review_477459982~“Family member in Neuro/Trauma Hospital - The Alfred”~Coming from interstate, I needed to quickly arrange accommodation that was close to The Alfred Hospital. I could walk, drive or use Uber Tpt approx $6.00. The 24 hr reception staff where very helpful and I chose the kitchenette/laundry apartment as I knew I would be staying for awhile and would have family and friends visit. It was very well set out and appreciated the separate bedroom to the living area. Kitchen is well equipped to cook most meals using the stove or microwave/oven, plus a dishwasher including powder when needed. Good brand of Tea/Coffee supplied with the necessary basic bathroom items. Complimentary newspapers in reception. The large sliding door out to the balcony was wonderful to sit out on or just for fresh air. Their dual roller blinds where great for privacy and giving the option of filtered light or block out for the evening. Heating and cooling unit worked extremely well. After a Hospital transfer to Caulfield Rehab Centre, I found it very easy to navigate too, from the Hotel being about 10-15 minutes by car, turning straight onto Queens Road/Dandenong Road. On return at nights I was always relieved to have a security gate and then to parking levels 2/3 using an internal car lift, room card required to access apartment level. Chapel street shopping and dining approx 5 minutes away and city 10 min. Transport via tram right out the front of Hotel. I am a light sleeper to noise and found the Hotel complex quite good considering I was on level 4. The bed was comfortable with ample space and bedroom had a double inbuilt wardrobe with safe. Minimal noise from adjoining apartments. I would definitely stay here again "preferably on holidays" and thoroughly recommend Hotel to Family, Friends and Colleagues. My partner was discharged from Hospital after 4 weeks, now home to rest and recover. Thank you to all the Staff for their considerate and professional personalities.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477298285~“Better Than Expected”~We stayed for 5nights here at the Seasons Heritage Melbourne. Our room was facing away from the main road and the lifts so there was no noise. Receptionist was very welcoming and friendly. Room was cleaned with room service daily. Only one down size was the car park lift and parking space. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would happily recommend to others.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475647456~“Avoid this hotel if you use Groupon voucher”~I brought Groupon vouchers of this hotel for my friends as it is in a convenient location and since I always have friends and relatives come to Melbourne, I thought I might choose this hotel as a fix place to host my guests. I went to twice before check in day and tried to inspect the room as I want to check what facilities there so I can prepare well to welcome my guests. But both refused by the reception guys. The reason for first time was the hotel were fully booked on that day, which was acceptable as I went there around 5pm (already after check in time). So second time I intentionally got there between check out and check in time around 1pm, still, I was refused to inspect the room. They gave the same reason that the hotel was fully booked which was obviously a lie as it was still before the check in time (2pm). The guy in the reception mentioned the cheaper price for Groupon intentionally, I understand what he tried to say: You got the Cheap price, so enjoy the LOW SERVICE, don't ask any more.  I did not insist to inspect the room as in the website, they are rated as a 4.5 star hotel. However, the room allocated to us is tiny and tired and most importantly, the outside floor is uneven. As my guests are two seniors, I tried to switch a room for them, they refused and mentioned Groupon again and said that's the room for Groupon user.  BTW: they got a 4 star rate in TripAdvisor in 2013, and still put that board in the reception desk even now already 2017. Shabby hotel! Low service! Never go again! ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473331883~“WORST HOTEL”~My Aunt and I stayed in this hotel hoping to have a special weekend in Melbourne for her birthday, April 2017, I have travelled all over the world and stayed in 2 star to 5 star hotels. THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN. The hotel was not only dilapidated and in need of a complete renovation, but was unkept and filthy. The carpets hadn't been vacuumed, the walls were covered in grime and marks, the linen on the beds smelled of stale people and the staff were rude. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, there are many More lovely hotels in Melboure~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472888869~“great price, good location”~The location is perfect, just a short walk from chapel street. Around chapel street, Prahran is a lot of nice stores just 5 minutes from the hotel. 15 dollars uber ride straight into flinders street. pretty small room but very nice.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472747445~“Home from home”~I mean it's not much like home to be honest, but we found this a relief after a week in other hotels round and about Melbourne. Not because they were bad, but because it was so good to have this massive space and the washing machine and fridge and all. I'm not hugely experienced in the ApartHotels thing, but this place was excellent huge room good facilities, parking on site, nice breakfast in the old dining room (the modern apartments are in a new bit on the back) and the reception staff were good humoured and helpful.  It wasn't cheap, but it was cheaper than some, and good value, I thought. The car lift was particularly entertaing. It's handy for the trams up to the centre, and we walked across to the delightful shops in South Melbourne, where we acquired a handbag and a set of mini pliars, to general satisfaction, along with a trendy Melbourne lunch, probably involving avocado and quinoa. We also walked over to Albert Park in the evening to see the bats, without luck but worth a detour I am told.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_472591003~“Very pleased”~Great location, very clean room, we were very surprised by this hotel room, it had 2 double beds which was very comfortable , dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, fridge-freezer, the view was of a office across the road but we wasn't too fussed about that, I didn't book the hotel for the views,I booked it as it was close to the cbd, taxis are easy to catch out the front , we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for one to pull up. We ordered dinner from the restaurant , the food was delicious, very large servings.The hotel has its own car park if you bring your own car , you can use the car lift.I had never been never been in a car lift before lol.The hotel staff were very helpful & friendly,Yes we would definitely stay here again .~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470179874~“Surprised! ”~From the outside this hotel looks small and very old, but once inside it is very modern and just keeps going and going.  We had a fantastic stay in two of the apartments. A must is one with a balcony.  Highly recommended for groups as very reasonably priced.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468989789~“The apartments are fine just a staff training issue”~I arrived after a long journey from Europe and a transit stop in Queensland. The booking made on my behalf was for an extra day and the staff present on arrival did not handle the matter very well. I was tired and just wanted to check-in and go to sleep. At one point I decided to leave and get another hotel but I was so shattered that I asked to see the manager. The desk staff member disappeared for 10 minutes then came back with a way forward. This involved a telephone call to a booking agent in the US who also spoke to me to confirm the change in booking. My booking was made for me through an Australian site called Wotif.com so I do not know why a call to the US was required. In the time I stayed there I learned that Seasons are hotel/apartment operators who do not own the premises. They use booking agents like Wotif, Expedia & Booking.com who are leaches sucking 15% from every booking. This experience has taught me to only book direct with hotels directly thereby avoiding these unscrupulous companies. Although the accommodation was OK I would not stay at any Seasons operated hotel again. This operator needs to provide staff training in how to deal with customers and how to manage their booking system for the customers benefit and not for the benefit of booking agents.~1~nan~4~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_468423310~“Lumpy beds”~Not the worst hotel I've been in and the star rating is fairly accurate. Mostly comfortable rooms, reasonably clean apart from scuff marks on walls. I found the bed lumpy, it had electric warming under the sheets and I could feel the cords under my back. Not the most comfortable night's rest. Close to public transport and convenience stores. Free WiFi was very helpful!~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_467682744~“Jetstar provided accomodation”~I was provided this accomodation by Jetstar for a flight cancellation, I was travelling with my Sister in Law. When we arrived the reception staff had no idea what was going on, the poor girl was a little flustered trying to deal with all the people that turned up. She did a great job. We then were notified about our room, they provided us with a room with a double bed. There was no way we were squeezing into a double bed, I asked if there was a room with a king or twin beds or even a roll out, I was told that would be an extra charge which Jetstar did not cover and I would have to call Jetstar. I called Jetstar and got no where, I think the reception staff heard how angry I was on the phone to Jetstar and did end up sorting something out for me. I wish the staff had done that in the first place. It turns out when I looked up the room types of a deluxe double room and an executive room, the price was identical so I don't know what the issue was. When we got to the room it was spacious with everything you need, the air con looked a little old, but it work perfectly! The room is very old with carpet bubbles and chunks out of the wall, this is fine considering the cost of the room is only $150. The room however was pretty dirty. Mouldy showers which could be cleaned and alot of dust all in the bathroom. The beds were also on the firmer side and my sister in law couldn't sleep. On the positive side the restaurant food was nice (pub quuality) and the girl serving in there was very polite!~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_467071123~“Overall average”~Larger 1 bedroom rooms are best on the balcony sides (front & back) of the hotel, avoid the middle rooms. The bar shuts at 9:30pm sharp with unfriendly staff not giving you a minutes grace( really annoying if arriving late & in need of a beer) Village pub is across the road, great bear garden~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465920380~“Great Hotel, can't go wrong!”~I have stayed here multiple times for business over the past 6 year and will continue when in Melbourne. It is located 5 mins out of the city and on the tram line so easy to get in and our of the city. I have a hire car and there is ample street parking or the hotel has a garage. I stay in a studio room, which is good for 1-2 nights, any longer then I suggest a 1 bedroom apartment. My only issue with the studio is the AC blows directly onto you in the bed, it is a floor unit so no way to escape it. Staff are always friendly and welcoming.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_464881479~“full of surpises”~Reception was good and very efficient. Inspected the room and found it to be basic, but what we needed for our stay. Car parking was unusual, but effective. Very disappointed in shower in bathroom, unable to keep water in recess and it flowed everywhere in bathroom, with swelling evident in doorjamb. Not enough pillows in bedroom and very thin. Our surprise was on the morning of our departure and my wife was reading the services directory for the hotel. On the last page my wife found a DVD inserted into the plastic pocket. Initially she thought that it was a information DVD, but noticed the heading "Sweetheart Anal" She was very embarrassed, just as well we did not have grandchildren with us as they may have been able to place it into the DVD player in the room. We took the directory and DVD to reception on our departure, the staff were very embarrassed as well, and apologized and said that the manager would make contact with us to pass on the apology of the hotel. To date I have had no contact with the hotel. Cleaners should check that the directories are current and factual and not have any hidden surprises. I just wonder what went on in the room. Pretty disappointed. Peterj~3~nan~nan~2~nan~4~4~nan
review_462873718~“Very Disappointed”~But We were booked in for a week and that week seemed like a month - I couldn't wait to get out. My heart sank as soon as I walked through the doors. The reception desk was so high, I had to stand on tiptoe to see over the top -it felt like the staff were looking down on us. One good thing was the room had a washing machine and dryer in the bathroom. Although the room was clean, I had to ask for four days running for face flannels and two days running before they repaired the shower which was leaking. The windows and balcony appeared not to have been cleaned for months. To add insult to injury, they want A$5 per hour or A$15 per day for WiFi. On principle, I refused to pay this especially as you can get free WiFi almost anywhere in Melbourne. I asked what star rating this hotel had and was told it was 4. I would suggest that whoever issues star ratings in Australia re-checks this hotel. I wouldn't give it more than a 2 and that is being generous. I believe this was once a very nice hotel but the current owners appear to be letting it go to rack and ruin. I definitely would never stay here again.~1~nan~nan~3~1~nan~1~nan
review_462109498~“Brief stay”~We stayed here and the room was fine for the one night. We had an area for coffee and tea. The room was clean and the air-conditioner worked well. There were a few things that could of been added to the room e.g. an extra blanket as my husband likes the air con on and l am one for rugging up, extra pillows as the ones on the bed were quite flat. Also a toilet brush. But other than that it was fine for the night but if you were there for a few nights you would want to upgrade to have a lounge room so you could have more space.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460216327~“Excellent reception staff”~We stayed at the Seasons Heritage for two short stays recently and found our room to be very comfortable, clean and with kitchen facilities that were adequate though limited. However, the staff were very helpful in providing a sharper kitchen knife when we asked, and I am sure they would have provided other items if asked. The staff were very helpful and responded quickly to any requests. The hotel was very convenient for accessing the city centre with a tram stop across the road and all trams going to the centre in about 15 minutes. (Myki cards for the tram can be bought and topped up at the 7-11 a couple of minutes walk away). Although the website advises a charge for wifi, we were given free internet during our stay. We were given a room overlooking Albert Park which I had requested after reading previous reviews, and this gave lovely views across the lake to the sea. We had corner rooms both times which seemed to give particularly good views. (1229 and any room on upper floors ending in 29 have the best views.) It was cheaper for us to park the car at the hotel car park at $60 for the week; some difficulties with the car lift access using the key cards were immediately resolved by the reception staff. We would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_458004333~“Just terrible”~Probably gets the vote of the worst hotel/apartment I have stayed in a long while. Checked in and they had no room service for 2 hours while they had a 'break' it was a 40 degree day in Melbourne no water in fridge or ice. Checked in at 4pm finally got room service at 6pm this was on a Saturday. Like a lot of Hotels in this rating they don't try very hard.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457286025~“Comfortable”~We spent two nights here towards the end of our week long trip to Melbourne in 2016. It was an apartment style hotel that was very comfortable. I was glad the bathroom had a washing machine and dryer as it saved me a trip to the laundromat. The hotel is close to everything and there are tram stops just outside easily taking us to the CBD and St Kilda. It was adequate for our needs and gave us two comfortable night's sleep after spending the last few nights at a different (and really bad) hotel. The hotel wasn't amazing but I would still stay here again in the future~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~5~nan
review_456310397~“Just adequate for our needs.”~We rented a three bedroom apartment for two nights. There were six adults and two children. It was adequate for our needs but there were several short falls. Only four of everything was supplied. That is four towels, cups, plates,bowls, etc.. We accidentally spilt some water on the kitchen floor but nothing to wipe it up, i.e. Mop. We used one of the bath mats which unfortunately showed that the floor had not been mopped for a while as there was a very dirty side to the bath mat afterwards. I must admit though when we contact the main reception to rectify the numbers of cups and towels they were very efficient in getting our requirements to us. Well done in that area. Also there are facilities to make breakfast but no dining area in which to eat it only the lounge room but it was ok. The cafe/restaurant was very good with the food very well presented and full of flavour.  If you are taking you car you will have an experience getting it in a car lift to the second or third floor. It was our first time using such a method to park your car.  I don't know if we would use this accommodation again but if we had to we would~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455748719~“Comfortable hotel...”~Comfortable hotel for a reasonable price in a handy location. The bed was comfortable although i find double beds too small. The bathroom is nice too. Only issue i think is the placement of the air con unit. It simply doesn't cool the bedroom as its nowhere near it. In summer, on a hot night, the air con made no difference at all.  Otherwise, its quite nice. Not sure i'd stay again but its ok.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_453863609~“Interesting and comfortable”~My "room" in this hotel was more an apartment than hotel room, with a washing machine and dryer in the bathroom and kitchen facilities in the hallway. They have a very good gym facility available to guests at no extra cost but no pool.  The only reasons I give this 4 rather than 5 stars is that WiFi comes at an expensive charge and the location is not that convenient, being neither in or near the city centre nor in what I would call a proper suburban area (St Kilda is the nearest) ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453433760~“GOOD MOTEL IN A GOOD SPOT”~My wife and I stayed one night in the Seasons Heritage and found it to be clean and comfortable. Reception staff were quite friendly and welcoming. The facade of the motel is quite plain but the interior is fine. Parking is good and the ride up in the "car lift" was....well....up lifting. The motel is well placed to public transport and walking distance to Chapel St. and Prahran market. A good solid motel complex.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453240244~“Friendly staff, nice room and a tram stop right outside the hotel.”~On arrival we found the staff to be helpful and assistance was offered, I was travelling with a disabled wife and suitcases. The room was clean and adequately sized and came well equipped even including a convection microwave. We mostly opted to eat in the restaurant which was open for breakfast and dinner. Not Lunch though. The location is well away from the city but using a tram or taxi (tram worked out much cheaper) it is only about 15 minutes away. St. Kilda is about the same in the other direction and the trams ran fairly late which was handy when we checked out the penquins after dark at St. Kilda pier. Be aware though that not all trams are wheelchair or pushchair friendly, some have steps to go up. What did we like the most? Definitely the location. The hotel is on a main road with a tram stop just outside with parks and other restaurants easily within walking distance. What did we like the least? The restaurant not being open for lunch and closing earlier than we would like in the evening. Minor stuff. .~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451783943~“Does the job”~Good location and affordable. Parking is tight (fine if in hatchback) but easy and safe. Good vegetarian breakfast. Pokey standard room but fine for a night or two. Nothing to write home about. Try kettle black up the road for food.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451698309~“Lovely Accommodation”~The apartment was clean, with the added bonus of washer/dryer (when you are staying for a while this added bonus helps with the limited baggage allowance).

review_450445294~“If you want to spend your time checking the bed is made and vacuuming is done, this is the place for you.”~Public Holidays aside, I had to wait three days for our bed to be made after many complaints. Dishwasher broke down after 3rd day, complained, dishes done by staff until they got tired of it. Dishwasher not fixed for the remainder of time. Sometimes they would come in and change the bins and not do the beds at all. We had to point out there was a big stripe of dust next to the door that needed to be vacuumed. Hotel cards were constantly being fixed. I stayed for 2.5 weeks, not a priority customer it seems. No complaints logged, so I was always chasing it up with staff. Not coming back.

Car parking is $15 per day, you actually have to go in a car lift for parking.

review_445554071~“A Unique blend of Old and New”~We really enjoyed our stay at Seasons Heritage Melbourne. We needed a cost friendly hotel to stay in the City after a Christmas Function and this was perfect. We booked ahead for a 1 bedroom apartment and were happy with the price and apartment.  The bathroom was newly renovated and we had a small kitchenette which we didn't need but would be handy for a longer stay. The bedroom was able to be closed off with glass sliding doors and there was a small sitting room with a couch and table and chairs.  We found it very good value.  The staff on the desk were very friendly and helpful.  You enter into the hotel through a beautiful old building. A beautiful stained glass window had prose of place on the stairway.  You access the newer multi storey building through an internal walkway.  Carparking is available. You need to access a car lift to get to the carpark. You would have a tight fit with bigger 4wds or suvs. There is free parking on the street of you are lucky to nab one.  Overall a great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_443513263~“Fantastic stay”~We stayed for 3 nights in October. We arrived just as the fire engine did but it didn't put us off. On arrival we were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment which for us on tour was fantastic as it had its own laundry so that got well used. Also had a small kitchen area which served us well for breakfast every day after shopping at the 7/11. Well placed hotel on St Kilda Road. Half hour walk to the beach and a short tram journey into town. What fun the car lift is especially when you get confused and enter the wrong way and have to reverse out - oh how I laughed at not being able to work it out first time. Did it right the second time. Staff on front desk really helpful for us tourists - thanks. Great stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

Ten times better hotel Heritage is old, smelly, dated and in serious need of attention Weird layout. Can hear conversation quite easily from next door. Windows look out into office buildings next door so be careful when you get up and open the blinds Bring your own pillows at the ones there have been steam rolled 50 times I think they should have been thrown out 5 years ago If you are driving and need to park you are in for treat. A very very tight car lift and car parking area which you get to pay for the experience I would strongly suggest.

review_442722050~“Excellent service with a 'can do' attitude ”~Upon arriving in Melbourne, I discovered I had lost my drivers licence and couldn't hire a car. I went straight to the hotel, before official check in time and attempted to check in to de-stress for a while.  They requested photo ID and I explained the problem I had - I had no other ID on me other than credit cards. The gents at the desk were exceedingly accommodating and checked me in, ahead of time and without the ID, giving me alternatives for not having my licence.  The room was small, but clean and comfortable.  The rest of the staff were friendly, striking up conversation in the lift and helping me out when my key card wouldn't work.  Nice view from 1326-looking straight towards the beach in the distance.  Would stay again simply for the fact that they made my life easy with their lovely service.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_440064534~“Nice room, but let down by IT team”~I enjoyed having my 12th floor apartment overlooking St Kilda Road and Wesley College. It was comfortable, spacious and clean. The desk staff were unfailingly polite. But the dark cloud over my six-day stay was the infuriating failure of the hotel's IT team to fix my email problem.  On the first night, I discovered that attempts to send emails were being blocked, although I was able to receive emails and browse. I complained and was told it would be fixed in the morning. Despite repeated complaints, it took until Wednesday for someone to phone me to discuss the problem. He said he would talk to his superiors about it and call me back. He didn't. On Thursday, I was visited by an IT person who confirmed what I already knew that the ISP was blocking my emails (possibly because it incorrectly judged them to be spam). He said it would be fixed that day or tomorrow (my final day with the hotel). It wasn't.  A very dispiriting experience and a poor reflection on the hotel management.~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan

review_439833740~“Worst Customer Service/Organisation DO NOT STAY HERE”~I booked one of the Heritage suites for my 30th Birthday about 5 months before the day and had spoken to someone over the phone to take my booking. Being that there was 3 of the larger rooms, i went into the hotel myself to pick which one i wanted as all were available at that stage. Out of the 3 there was 2 that i liked and requested for either of those 2 rooms (not the third)! The lady at reception said it was no problem for her to hold the room for me that night and left a note under my file so when the day came the room would be saved for me. I also advised them that it was my birthday and that i was having a group of friends over for pre drinks before we went out which they also said it was no problem as long as we were out by 10:00pm. Months later when my birthday came around, everything seemed fine, it was an easy check in UNTIL i realised i got the third room which i requested NOT to have! Once i asked the staff that there must be a mistake and for them to change my rooms they told me that the other rooms were booked out by people staying for 5 nights and that there was no request under my name for the rooms i wanted!! Now obviously they knew that the third room was much smaller and that the layout wasn't as good so they wanted to give it to people who were staying longer! They not only were unapologetic but also abrupt and made no effort to make things right with me due to their huge error!! They kept telling me there was "nothing" that they could do. To top it off, I also had a call at 8:30pm for them asking me to leave the premises due to "too many people inside the room" despite the fact that i already had confirmation that it was ok to have people over. I'm 100% dissatisfied with their poor customer skills and ignorance over the error of their staff. I searched for a hotel for weeks and decided on this hotel due to the larger room and the fact that they were fine with me having people over! If they were not, then they should given me false information. Not only am i disappointed and angry but they completely ruined my night and stressed me out! Honestly the worst customer service i have ever experienced with the most rudest & ignorant staff I have ever seen! I'm sure i wouldn't have gone as far to write a review if i had of got at least a sorry and they admitted that they were wrong and made an error but they DIDN'T! I would never stay here again - not even if someone paid me!!~1~nan~3~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_438590464~“Really small room”~We had a good experience with the staff who provided good information about how to get in the city, parking possibilities in the street, etc. The breakfast restaurant within its facilities offers a variety of tasty possibilities. The room was one of the smallest I've ever seen. This is very much unconvenient when travelling with big luggage.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_430203880~“Catfish3844”~What a great place to stay, staff very helpful and friendly.  Only 5-6 min walk to Alfred hospital as I was visiting someone.  I sent an email asking if I could get room with a view of Albert park lake, well the room I got was fantastic, not only could I see the lake I could see Port Philip bay and all the lights from the west gate bridge to I don't know a long way down the bay say to Mentone, I could even see the cargo ships making their way to port. The room had a small balcony, a washing machine and a dishwasher it was very well equipped and outstandingly clean. I will definitely go back if need to stay in Melbourne again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430171872~“Fantastic restaurant”~Staff were very friendly, but disappointed with the room. The room was tidy but not very clean, hair on bathroom floor and there was a stale odour in the apartment. There was detergent but no cloths,supplied in kitchen, The carpet was old and worn. Have stayed at other Seasons but this did not compare. The plus, however was the restaurant, food was delicious and very good service.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_428257615~“Bandaid ”~I walked into my executive suite and was welcomed by a used bandaid in the middle of the carpet. I didn't end there, the cleaners obviously aren't fans of cleaning. Dirty glasses, bathroom, carpet etc etc. Its one of those hotels that has 0 standards.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426249489~“Personal property stolen and invasion of privacy”~Do not stay here - my partner had his ring stolen by the house keeping staff and the front desk staff were very unapologetic and unhelpful.  Furthermore, while we were having an intimate moment in our room, house keeping staff opened our door without knocking to enter. Horrible all round experience. Don't stay here!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424866592~“A Hidden Gem”~Arrived on Friday afternoon for the Grand Final ......................requested a room with a view of the lake which booking staff could not confirm however it was noted as a request. As it was also my wife's birthday this was also noted by staff and a lovely bottle of Sparkling wine was left in the room. Our room 1330 had a nice view of the lake which we were delighted with. Check in / Check out staff were excellent and leave for dead a lot of the larger chain hotels. Location is good and an easy 10 minute cab ride to the CBD.MY only comment would be to have either queen or king bed options as the double bed albeit comfortable was a bit small.....Thanks Seasons Heritage a lovely weekend.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_424517899~“Petty Savings Spoil Stay”~Nice room, nice view but ... No tea towel, no chux, no coat hangers. Asked for coat hangers and was given only 3 horrible dry cleaner wire ones. Tv didn't work had to get it fixed. One of the towels was dirty. Kitchen bench was dirty. Had to pay security deposit, made me feel like a football hooligan.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
