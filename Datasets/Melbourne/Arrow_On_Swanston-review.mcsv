review_478762646~“Great location, nice staff”~Arrow on Swanston is conveniently next to a tram stop and minutes walk from the free tram zone. Melbourne Central is roughly 20 minutes walk from the hotel and the markets are nearby. The staff were very helpful not only with room requests but also with how to best get to the airport. They also held our bags before checking in, and after checking out. The room was relatively quiet for where the building is located (on a higher floor) and had all the facilities needed for a longer stay (such as a kitchenette). While the room was rather small, It was well suited to a pair, with separate rooms. My stay at Arrow on Swanston was very comfortable and convenient and I would definitely look at staying here again~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477876280~“Great hotel good location.”~We stayed here in March over the Grand prix week end so most of the accommodation was expensive but this was coming up quit cheap for a city centre, the hotel is on the city tram network with a stop just out side which takes you right into the centre within 5 mins or you can walk which only took 20 mins. The hotel room had every thing you needed with a small kitchenette ideal for making breakfast tea coffee etc, there was a small cafe at the base of the hotel but i never used it but from what i saw it looked ok. We arrived early so our room was not ready but the helpful staff locked our cases away so we were able to start looking around the city. The only down side to this hotel is that it is on the main drag some times it got a bit noisy out side with traffic we had a room at the front, but people we were travelling with had one at the back and had no issues with noise. But we would use again.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~5~nan
review_474900101~“Dont stay here!!!”~This place is ridiculously expensive especially for what it offers. It's dirty, smelly, small, loud, unmaintained, heck the list won't stop. There are much better alternatives dont ever stay here. One of the staff is extremely rude as well, I had a problem with her it truly is a nightmare~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474766999~“Staff need to communicate ”~This is a bit of a tale but needs to be said. I made an error on booking. Work stopped me coming for two days so I rebooked for one day, went to cancel my first booking but I'd missed my free cancellation window. Yep that's my fault. Oops.  Rang the hotel to explain this and was told by staff member no problems we will be able to refund the two nights as you're staying with us. Wonderful very happy. Sadly that wasn't told to any other staff member. So when my request was rejected I was a bit upset. After several phone calls and 3 days later the hotel offered one night refund. We accepted this and stayed two nights so we didn't lose out. I wanted to hate this place I did. But when I got there it was exactly as advertised. Wasn't huge but we knew that before coming. Beds were comfortable, good air conditioning and heating, staff friendly, room was quiet. Cafe downstairs made great coffee. After all this my only gripe is the lack of communication from staff I originally spoke too.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471481987~“Suitable for 1”~I stayed in the one bedroom apartment on level 5. I used this hotel for a course I was undertaking at the University of Melbourne.  The bed was very comfortable and despite my room being near the elevators it was so quiet.  The room was basic with a two burner stove , a fridge and a sink. The couch was uncomfortable and very close to the television but I didn't watch that much. The Wi-Fi is very affordable compared to other hotels at $9.99 a day or $19.99 for a week. The lifts were quick except one day where one broke down and it took quite a few minutes for front staff to come try and figure out where the alarm bells were coming from. As you can see the view was non existent but that's not what I was using the room for. The hotel being on the north side of the city was very close to RMIT and a short walk to University of Melbourne. Aldi and Woolworths are in short walking distance if you needed to use the kitchen. Otherwise Lygon street is two streets back plus there are some nice Asian restaurants close by.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470213900~“2017 Grand Prix ”~The room was very clean with all the amenities that you need for a 4 day stay in Melbourne during the Grand Prix.  It has a great location to the trams and is not fare from the shops which is great.  As it is a semi self contained unit I did find that we ran out of tea bags fast and one day hey we're not topped up and as for the rest it wear very well maintained with a pool and gym.  Definitely would stay there for a long stay as it was perfect.  Thanks~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468934543~“Don't be fooled by the photos!”~We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment. The photos on the website depict spacious living area, bedrooms etc - don't be fooled!! The lounge which seats 2 people (the apartment sleeps 3) is less than a metre from the TV. The queen bed takes up most of the bedroom with only one bedside table on one side of the bed - the other side of the bed is almost up against the wardrobe, which provides very limited access. Take your own clothes hangers as there are only 2 provided. Then kitchen is small but practical. The carpet throughout the hotel needs replacing, it is beyond cleaning. It is very worn & dirty. There is an unpleasant odour permeating throughout the reception.  The staff are professional but would not describe them as friendly.  There is a pool apparently- but access is "next door" with no other explanation. Okay for a very short stay where you do not intend to spend much time in your room.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467417615~“Location saved it.”~We weren’t expecting luxury based on the TripAdvisor reviews we’d read, but there definitely could be improvements when you’re paying $100/night. The cleaners only came to our room once over our 3 night stay, and when they arrived it was already 5pm so we were back in the room showering etc. and getting ready to go out so they couldn’t change the bins/vacuum etc. The bed was ok but I could feel the springs underneath me. The air-con worked but since it’s one of those box ones in the wall, a lot of outside noise (people talking, yelling from other rooms/apartments, construction) comes through the vents and it’s quite noisy. Also when it rained, the water from the air-con unit outside the room above us funnelled down onto ours and made a loud noise like rain on a tin roof. We had to put a tea towel out our window onto the top of our air-con unit to soften the noise. The bathroom was old and small, but clean, and the shower worked well. I think if I was paying $85 a night I’d have been happier. That said, the staff were very friendly, and the tram stop right outside was great. And it only took 5 min to walk to the free transport zone. We also walked up to Fitzroy which was really nice, about 25min walk away. I’d stay here again if it was the cheapest option I could find.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_467102054~“Unimpressed”~4 o us stayed for 4 days. Lots of noise in the street with rubbish trucks stopping constantly, emergency services sirens and loud revelers. There was faulty plumbing which was rattling through the day and night and located opposite a busy tram stop... which meant no sleep!!!!! The bathroom had a damp stale odor, mould and cupboards which were warped. No fresh linen and no room service. The bedding was ok, except the sofa bed which was a futon. Bedding for 4 but the size of the apartment was tiny and only enough seating at dine table for 2. Kitchen was a good size but dirty and greasy. The reception staff were apologetic and provided us with free internet for the day. Very budget accommodation, the whole place is in desperate need of an upgrade.~1~nan~3~1~nan~nan~2~nan
review_466647093~“Great location - just well used”~So close to everything - all I needed in the 1 Brm compact - good shower air conditioning worked fine - plenty of closet space . Access to pool and gym but you needed to go to the building next door . Not quite in the free Tran zone but not far. Bus from airport can take you there but needs to drop off around the corner as there is a tram stop right out front. A few bits of furniture in the room just looked well- used! You can get a days free wifi if you like them on facebook~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465457767~“not suitable for a person using a wheelchair!! Extremely poor customer service”~We had a dangerous experience - we were on the 9th floor, our friend uses a wheelchair. One night we tried to go down the elevator to go for dinner, no response after waiting 20 minutes. We rang reception and we're told the lift was working only to some floors, not coming up to the 9th, walk down the stairs. We explained that our friend cannot walk and we cannot leave her alone to go and get food. The guy told us there was nothing he could do, ring a food delivery place, being Sunday, he couldn't get a maintenance person.  We ordered food, at huge cost, and when it arrived at our door, we asked the person if he had to come up the stairs and he told us no, the reception guy had bought him up and was waiting there for him. We asked if the elevator was fixed and he said no, there was some way to bypass the problem and bring the elevator up!  What despicable service, they would find a way to bring a delivery person up but not help out a guest confined to a wheelchair! We were just lucky that our friend, or either of us, had not had a medical emergency... would not recommend this place to anyone, with such a low regard for customers. The website pictures are very misleading, the two bedroom apartment was tiny, one bedroom with only a single bed, we were three friends travelling together, expected a second room to have twin beds. The area where the tv is only had a two seater couch, with no sides, kitchen area not big enough for two people. Bathroom tiny, you can't get into the shower without closing the bathroom door, claustrophobic. Few positives, cheap wifi, only $19.99 for a week, we were there five days so cheaper to get weekly rate, good strength, didn't drop out. Great location, 10 minute walk into city centre. Quite noisy with construction all around but that would apply to most of the city area, lots of building going on. Room service good, not done on Sundays though, shows that lack of regard again, too cheap to pay housekeeping at Sunday rates?~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~1~nan
review_465148588~“Cosy and simple apartment ”~Staff were so helpful and the room was so lovely, shoutout to the reception dude absolute legend. Also loved the colour scheme of the room, very calming. The only downside was that there was construction happening nearby so my window got dusty easily but that didn't bother me at all. Comfy bed and comfy sofa. Will definitely visit again in the future!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464367753~“Clean, budget-style accommodation”~Our family stayed in the two bedroom apartment. While clean and tidy, the place felt too small for three adults and one kid. The sofa became the fourth bed and limited evening TV watching. Each room is fitted with its own air conditioner.  The kitchen is appointed with the usual suspects: Plates, bowls, cups, saucers, cutlery, fridge, microwave and stove top.  The bathroom is small and dated but served it's purpose. You can't have more than one person in there at a time. The hotel sits on busy Swanston St where trams ride up and down all day and most of the night. We were kept awake by their bells, by sirens and by yobs yelling their way home.  For shoppers: QV shopping complex is a 10 minute walk along Swanston heading into the CBD and houses a Woolworths, Big W, Dan Murphys and PLENTY of eateries.  For coffee lovers: Seven Seeds Specialty Coffee on Berkley St is a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction. A great place for breakfast as well. You will stumble across Market Lane on your way to Queen Victoria Markets. For beer drinkers: The Queensbury Hotel/beer garden is opposite the Arrow and offers Pub Grub with beers and ciders. Happy Hour is between 5pm and 7pm on a Friday evening served with complimentary finger food. For the fit: there is a gym and pool on site. Probably the biggest bug-bear was the lack of free wifi. The daily rate is $9.99 and I believe this is the price for each device although we didn't test it during our stay. Oh, and apparently you can organise a shuttle to the airport for $55 but you are better off hooking up with a Skybus shuttle. This will drop you off and pick you up from your hotel (or the nearest corner) and drive you the Southern Cross Station from where you catch the Skybus (with free wifi) back to the airport. If you book online this will cost you $35 for a round trip per adult (child and family discounts also apply). Hope this helps you if you are on a budget and are comparing this to other similarly rated hotels in the CBD.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464143579~“Ideal Location Melbourne”~Warning, we booked a Twin Studio Apartment, with twin beds, not realizing that it was two single beds in separate rooms, our mistake. The desk staff were most helpful & obliging and shifted us the next day into a standard double room, which was great, with all the essentials, toaster, hair dryer, cutlery etc Good central location, only two, easy to walk, stops to the "start of the free tram", with plenty of hotels & restaurants close by. The Lincoln Hotel in Cardigan Street, had great traditional pub meals & a big range of beers, in a friendly "county pub style" atmosphere. The famous Queen Victoria Markets are within easy walking distance, what a treasure cove of things to see there. We found the Arrow on Swanson, ideal for our needs and would definitely recommend it and stay there again ourselves.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_461324166~“Crappy hotel”~The location of the hotel is convenient but the service is overall horrible. When i ask about airport transportation information for help the receptionist promise to call your your room in 10 minutes but no call at all. They require internet payment and as i paid the internet was broken. Promise to fix and inform my room but from morning till noon there is no info at all until i have to come down and ask for the receptionist. The people working were not there anymore. I paid the the fee for nothing. Overall it is a hotel apartment but there is no washing machine and you have to go to laundry room where you need to pay a total of 8$ for washing+drying machine. You wash together with the housekeeping where they also wash rugs and bed sheet.  They also put my check in date the wrong month before hence my name was not there when i checked in. It was solved however they also put my check out date wrong so i paid for another extra day which i'm already to tired to complain to.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458594598~“Great value”~A 1-bedroom apartment during the Australian Open for only $135 per night - this is exceptional value for a comfortable, clean, quiet, no-frills stay. This is the second time I've stayed in a 1-brm apartment at Arrow - the first time our unit was better laid out. This one had an L-shaped living space that was impractical - but we were out so much of the time it didn't really matter. Staff were friendly, location is excellent with a tram stop at the front door, our room was serviced well every day at a convenient time, we felt we had privacy and security in our apartment, the bed was comfortable, and we had everything we needed during a four-night stay. We will definitely book again at this hotel - we haven't found anywhere else in Melbourne that is close to the CBD and which offers quite the same value for travellers on a smaller budget.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan

review_438893019~“Nice little no-frills hotel ”~Conveniently located close to Melbourne Central. With easy access to tourist attractions such as the Queen Victoria Market, Chinatown, Melbourne Museum, etc.  Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful. Not to mention the nice little cafeteria next to the lobby. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. The owner was a Malaysian Chinese migrated to Australia. He is chatty and provided us with a lot if good advises.  There is a tram stop right in front of the hotel and a convenient store just next door.  In summary, my family and I had enjoyed our stay in Melbourne and if course Arrow on Swanston. We will definitely stay here again if we are in Melbourne again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Unfortunately the rooms are very dated and really small, beds are not comfy and the bathroom had mould in the shower. It is noisy all night long whether it be street noise or the slamming of doors in the corridor. It feels like old university accommodation.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Has a korean foodie & convenience store just below. Can walk to lygon street which is behind the hotel. Pillow & bed comfortable.

review_431986455~“Arrow on Swanston visit.”~This accomm. is in quite a good location close to the city. I paid for cooking facilities in my room and they were clean and adequate. Bed was quite comfy but the position of my room was dreadful. It was at the corner of Swanston St and a laneway which meant I heard traffic noise, people noise AND about 10 or so large garbage bins being collected very early each morning (about 5 a.m.) One reception person was lovely, helpful and friendly but the others were not. Cleaning staff were lovely. Clare~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_431686634~“Amazed”~This hotel serves a purpose for an over night stay, but no longer. The room is very small, i new it would be but i didn't relies how small it could have been. It is very noisy at time, the garbage truck comes very early in the morning waking you up, one morning it come at 330 am. The room was ok, there was grout missing in some of the tiles in the shower, when you have a show the water pressure and temperature changes when ever anyone else puts there shower on. There was no switch to turn on the bathroom fan meaning the mirror would steam up or you have to leave the door open . when i left the first day i came back to what looked like my room had been ransacked, instead of cleaning the room, they put the rubbish bag in the bathroom sink and put new bag in the bin, didn't make bed, left towels on kitchen sink drainer, and the dishes where still there. As i say this hotel serves as a purpose for a very very short stay.~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan

But you can walk to the Burke Street Mall in about 10 minutes. If you want you can walk about 300 metres then you are in the free tram zone.

review_426870557~“Good location”~Stayed here for an early morning visit to St. Vincent's Hospital. Location was very good rooms were clean and tidy with a small kitchenette. Although a little on the small side it was quite adequate. Staff were friendly and polite. The main downside was the bed mattress it was not very comfortable at all. The TV screen was cracked which we reported to reception x2 times who were going to report it to maintenance. I suppose that the time of the report which was late in the afternoon may have prevented maintenance from attending. If this was the case I believe that we should have been informed or offered an alternative room.~3~nan~nan~1~3~nan~3~nan
review_426521973~“Cheap price with cheap services”~Cheap hotel and very rude receptionist staffs. Some staffs are rude and and snobby who are not helpful when the guest request for help. When they gave broken key card instead of giving new ones, they just ask "how come??" . I came to them twice before checking in and they still made a mistake by inserting my check in date on the other month. Luckily there is an empty room but it was not the room i requested.  I went from early morning till noon and requested for early house keeping if possible. My room is still not cleaned till 3 pm and i requested the receptionist again and her answer was, "sorry i cannot do anything. We don't want to rush anyone". The receptionists are mostly inexperienced and they treat guests lightly. My friend checked in into her room with wet floors~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425969189~“Budget accommodation”~I thought I'd got a good deal for a "2 bed apartment" so close to the city. As one reviewer has said "you get what you pay for". Indeed you do - this was the smallest "apartment" I have ever been in. It's obviously really intended as some sort of student accommodation. Yes there was a kitchen, surprisingly large in comparison to the rest of the place. First of all the room was extremely narrow. The seating area (can't call it a lounge room as nit much lounging could be done there) had a weird arrangement whereby the tv was just facing a blank wall and the tiny seat (can't call it a "sofa" as it was more like a small park bench with cushions) was at right angles to the tv. Made watching tv a bit of a problem, though we were able to turn the tv slightly.  Then the two "bedrooms". Put it this way - if you're claustrophobic (as I am) then you wouldn't be able to stay here. Very tiny areas with just a single bed, a small bedside table and a desk and wardrobe. But it was a very tight fit. My friend had the front "room" which was light and airy due to the window. I chose the back "room" because I was worried about street noise and also that it might be too light in the front room but hey - there's a window between the two sections (up high) so I got some unwanted light anyway.  Worst points for me: the bed .... aargh. So hard and uncomfortable. And proximity to the lifts. Was right alongside the lift lobby so no chance of trying to sleep in on the Sunday with people talking loudly, banging things and generally making excessive noise as people tend to do when congregated around lifts. The street noise was negligible compared to the noise from the lift lobby.  Good points : there is a tram stop right outside so it's very easy to hop on a tram to get to the city. It's a shame it's just one stop outside the free tram zone. Also it's not too far to walk to Lygon Street, which was the main reason I chose this place.  The staff on reception are pleasant and helpful enough and they did let us have a late checkout, which was very much appreciated. Like another reviewer mentioned I was also a bit offended at being asked to pay a security deposit but I guess a lot of hotels do nowadays. I chose to pay cash and it's a $100 deposit for cash but at least you get it back straight away on check out (well almost straight away - they do radio up to the room for the cleaner to check things out before you get your money back).  It's ok for a quick weekend break if you don't want to blow the budget and don't mind small spaces.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_424899836~“Great Place”~Thoroughly enjoyed our time at Arrow. Rooms were clean, even if a little small. There could have been more cutlery crockery and cooking utensils, and the hot plate could have been quicker, but the bed was comfortable. The shower was good. Even though we were in a room right on Swanson Street, it was quiet. Everything worked, the air conditioner was also quiet. The staff both at Reception and housekeeping were helpful and friendly. We have already booked again for next year. It is certainly value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418287813~“Perfect location and very clean”~I spent four nights at Arrow on Swanston over the last weekend and into this week. I hadn't stayed here previously but was pleasantly surprised by the courteous staff and cleanliness of the room. There were all the facilities required including a kitchenette and laundry facility. I needed and iron and ironing board which wasn't available in the room but staff at reception were happy to accommodate my request. The only down side was the $50.00 security deposit which takes a while to be refunded but for the price and location (with a tram stop right outside the door), I won't hesitate in staying there again.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_405482796~“It's alright but won't stay again”~We've stayed several times and found it rather good but not this time. Firstly, as mature aged guests we were pinged a $50 fee for possible room damage. Really? Partner reluctantly paid it, it took 7 seconds to take it but 7 days to return it. The room was nice, clean, a bit dated but adequate. It's self contained if you don't want to go out, the bed was comfy and there was roomy enough. The day before we left we asked reception staff to book the Skybus back to Spencer to get to the airport. It drops guests out the front on arrival so fair to assume that's where pick up is. Not so. After waiting for 15 minutes and nary a Skybus to be seen we asked at reception if the booking has been made. Yes, it was but pick up is at the corner (would've been nice to know that). Alright then, which corner? Queensberry and Swanston. Great, there are four corners, which corner? Couldn't get an answer so we went up to the corner. Not a Skybus sign to be seen. Contacted Skybus and.....oh, that's another frustrating story. Ended up Uber-ing it to the station. In short, we've found other alternatives in Melbourne to stay with better amenities for less money.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan

review_398678585~“Poor service, terrible hotel”~1. No wifi and TV service: upon check in we were told the wifi was down, and counter staff did not give us an est on when it will be fixed. Until the 2nd day, the wifi wasn't up & TV still not working  2. Requested for 3 pax in single room, the extra bed provided was a sofa with metal piece in the centre and it's impossible to sleep in. After notifying the staff, the included a mattress on the sofa bed. 3. Very very poor service, counter staff on 28 July after 6pm had an extremely bad attitude when we requested for a new bed. The one star was given to the room service for impeccable cleanliness.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395379672~“Not even worth 1 star”~Wow this place is bad. Never have I got to a hotel and wanted to leave so fast. Room SO small, smells like public toilet, not looking forward to two more nights here. I expect these type of rooms for under 100 dollars. Don't waste your money!!!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393369847~“Heather ”~My daughters and I stayed at the Arrow last night... Never again. Reasons being:- We found the beds uncomfortable, i.e. hard. There were only 3 sachets of coffee. Only 4 very small (single serve) milk in the fridge. Only shampoo & soap in the bathroom, which was the smallest one we'd ever seen! There were no lifts in the multistory car park that could be used without the room key/card. Meaning we had to haul all of our bags down to reception and back up to the car when we left. Staff were friendly though.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
