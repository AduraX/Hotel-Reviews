review_476988911~“Not as Good as Last Time- However Service and Cleanliness is Great”~Having stayed at this hotel in the past, I was looking forward to a return visit. This time however, the experience was not as great. It is still a good choice if on business or need to be located in lbert Park. The room that was allocated, was in the main "Pullman Tower." The room itself was very clean, however had a broken door under the TV (which made accessing the fridge challenging), several lights in the room were not working (1 light didn't even have a globe) and the bathroom is showing it's age. In saying that, the bed was comfortable, the service at the hotel is still amazing and as I have always found at this hotel, the room was well cleaned during each of our days at the hotel. Overall, this is a good business room, if you are not spending hours in the room each day. Would I stay here again- Yes if on business or if the Price is Right for the room.~3~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476268180~“Good site for a better hotel”~Stayed here for one night ... we were gifted it ... and I wish I could have re gifted it straight back ... it's an old joint that has seen better days . I think it's had a couple of different names / brands over the years and I thought when I saw Pullman it would be ok , but it was a struggle to be ok ... the room was tired and dark and no warmth or comfort ... just a bed an empty fridge and an uncomfortable couch ... the TV was a bit complicated although it was the newest and cleanest thing in the place . There are better options in Melbourne~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474828316~“Night Away”~A night away everything was fine apart from the breakfast could have been hotter. The hot food was more like luke warm if that, not sure if the bain marie were lit. Hotel concierge were friendly & great. check-in was prompt & courteous. Rooms were well fitted out and also modern. Bar staff were very friendly as were all staff. Location was ideal opposite the lake.~4~4~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_473739109~“ Clean but tired”~Stayed here for 5 nights during a visit to Melbourne. The carpet in our room was stained and room was quite tired. The T.V. was continuously not working and had to be reset - four out of five nights. It ended up that the gentleman showed my husband how to reset it himself. I was disappointed to find that the pool was closed for the whole time we were there with no prior notice given, just a note saying "apologies pool closed for maintenance will reopen Tuesday" which it did not. Despite my mentioning that I was unhappy with this twice, whilst calling down to reception for somebody to come and fix the tv yet again, this matter was never addressed by any staff. On check out we were not asked whether we had enjoyed our stay or indeed anything else. Our payment was taken and that was it!  The only positive comment I can make is that the first night we were there a very nice gentleman came to try and fix the tv which he was unable to do. The night manger called our room to apologise, say he would get the tv fixed the next day and if he couldn't would move us to another room He then sent us up a complimentary beverage. Although the tv problems still continued throughout our whole stay, this was very much appreciated.  Having stayed in the Novotel Sydney Darling Harbour Hotel which is part of this chain the week before, I was extremely disappointed to find this hotel nowhere near as efficient, friendly or interested in its guests or their opinions.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472737242~“Standard Room”~The room was clean. There was no mini bar, but there was a fridge with a tetra pack of milk. There was a kettle and tea and coffee. The bed was weird: only one side had a mattress topper, which made the bed uneven. Having said that, my untopped side was comfortable. The air conditioner made the room comfortable. The TV died, which meant it had to be reset every time I wanted it on. I had a hideous view of a garbage skip but the laneway was clean. Room service did not offer a club sandwich! Maybe the rooms at the adjoining Pullman Hotel (it's the same hotel) are better~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_472530834~“Love this place”~Hi, This is the place that we often stay in Melbourne and it never disappoints. The rooms are clean, the bar and restaurant nice, and the staff very friendly and helpful.  It's a little out of the city but handy to both St Kilda and the City by taxi or tram. It's also within walking distance of Chapel Street, the Prahran Markets etc. It's also across the road from Albert Lake which is a really nice morning or evening walk.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472505780~“Adele concert stay”~Celebrated Daughters 15th birthday stayed sat 18/3 to attend Adele concert . Offered upgrade for extra cost so given 2 very comfy beds, Room very clean, food for Coeliac very accomodating & promptly delivered to the room. Check in fast friendly & efficient as was checkout.

review_472115759~“One Night stay”~Stayed for one night for b'day celebration, check in was quick and got a room facing the 'lake', nice view i must say. Everything went well, until the next morning on the check out day. Hubby went to get something outside and I was in the room by myself. I was about to take a shower and took off my top, and heard someone knocked the door once, i was rushed put on my top and few seconds later someone has opened the door with master key, the same time when my hand touched the door handle. I asked him, and he said he came to check the mini bar, then i let him in. I do understand the hotel policy prior departure, but to enter the guest room without notice/very very short notice it's kind of weird. Imagine if a female guest undressed and got no time to put it on or only half dressed~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472039667~“Work stay for a few nights”~Short stay for work, arrived after a flight and was pleasantly surprised to be offered a room upgrade. Very spacious rooms and separate living area made the couple of days away from home very manageable. Ordered food through room service which was tasty and arrived within 15 minutes which was great. Visited the Windows restaurant for dinner on one night and recommend the steak. Great service all around.  Area of improvement would be the water pressure in the bathrooms, which could be higher.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472008667~“Average and not again ”~After spending one nights stay here safe to say I won't be in any hurry to come back again. My partner and I booked a king sized standard room and upon check in received a queen sized bed. After contacting the staff at reception they kindly provided us with the correct room however to our disappointment our "king sized bed" was simply 2 single beds joined together. My partner received back problems from the "king" bed as he slept in the middle not realising the problem until the early hours of the morning when it was noticeable and the beds began to move apart. Very deceiving from the images online as the rooms are in urgent need of renovations especially the bathroom!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470725702~“Awesome with caring people”~Good location to be accessible to downtown or airport and beautiful park right cross the road. Assistant manager Paul Smith is polite and caring person who is nice enough to upgrade to bigger room with two queen size beds for three of us. Since the night before I only slept on thin roller bed that I could not sleep all night and got back pain. His good work makes us feel welcome and comfortable experience. Also, the food is delicious with high quliaty. Highly recommended this hotel for all travelers or tourists if you come to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_469963586~“Spacious room ”~I love Accor hotels  They give you free upgrades  I purchased voucher for my two night stay at mercure Albert park. I was with my sister. We were upgraded to a loft (two storey) We didn't get to stay much of the day and returned only to the hotel to sleep but we felt comfy. The level one living area is big and second level is equally big I guess this could fit 4 people comfortably  For less than $100 a night this was really a good hotel. I note they share facilities with Pullman  And staff were really friendly. PS no water was provided but I guess for less $100 a night you would not get water. There is small fridge - empty nothing in it, tv in level 1/2 and separate bath and toilet There is a swimming pool and if you are a fan of Grand Prix this hotel is for you.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469776220~“Great hotel experience.”~Me and my sister stayed at the hotel for two nights in late January. I was abit unsure of the place in the beginning, because parking was $20 per day, provided that we didn't leave, otherwise it would have been $20 for each exit, but that gave us a chance to walk to the city which was good after excising in their gym. They had a fantastic gym and sauna. Me and my sister got the Sauna all to ourselves, which helped us to unwind after a long day of walking around the city. The staff were all so lovely and helpful. The hotel housekeepers are such a good thing about the hotel, when returning to my room for the day I would find my stuff re-arranged in such a tidy, lovely and pretty manner making it so much easier for me. (The housekeepers are amazing) I would just love to stay here again next time I visit Melbourne.  Thanks heaps!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_468714595~“Two nights stay!”~Great location just few mins walk to chapel street, Albert park across the road with a great lake also ocean view it might habe been port phillip bay not sure. We stayed in a family twin bed room, very clean equipped with the norm hotel goodies. The staff were great provided great customer services and we had a seafood buffet dinner which was deliously divine . Overall great experience and highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Melbourne Australia.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468437807~“Don't pay ectra”~We paid $309 for a Saturday night which is reasonable for an inner city hotel in Melbourne. But they wanted to charge us for everything else, for example, wifi and parking. The room was nothing special, pretty good if you are just staying the night. Bathroom was nothing special pretty basic for a 4 star hotel.  Would stay again only if it was the last hotel available.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467662563~“Not up to standard”~Our family recently spent 2 nights in Melbourne and whilst the visit was great, the accommodation was not. On arrival we were sent upstairs to our room. We were not informed that the room was accessed via a lift in another section of the hotel. We eventually located our rooms with the help of the cleaners via a service entry and fire stairs. The room itself had an unpleasant, stale odour, the bath had mould growing under waterproof silicon seals and the enamel was peeling. We brought this to the attention of the staff on checkout and were given an apology. We were part of a family group who were in Melbourne for a function. The rest of the group stayed in the Pullman section of the facility and were quite happy. The Mercure section was tired, and certainly needs a make over of sorts. It was not a satisfactory experience~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_467466008~“Adequate but ageing..”~Great check-in and friendly staff. Good size room and bathroom. Our shower tap was missing one of handles (it had 4 screw in handles - 1 missing and we had to screw in the other 3 as they were loose). Constant dripping tap in the bathroom sink. Shower curtain was dirty and should have been changed long before our stay. Room was a bit old and tired but room served its purpose and bed was comfy.  Overall for the price (we got a special deal on groupon) it was good. Parking was convenient.  Hubby wanted to buy a beer from the bar and take upstairs to our room but this was not allowed and the only option was to have it delivered by room service which he was told would be a 30minute wait plus a $5 surcharge. Wow! Needless to say no beer was purchased. On another trip past the bar later on people were buying and just walking off outside to smoke with their drinks and taking them up in the lifts to their rooms. Assuming these people didn't want to wait the 30min room service timeframe. We didn't break the rules and went without but 30mins to get a drink to your room is a little too lengthy.  Apart from that everything else was fine.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466872897~“Great Location and Staff”~Really enjoy staying at Albert Park and the surrounds. So close to St Kilda and Chapel St for restaurants. Staff are great. Was upgraded to a 2 level suite which was very comfortable and great value for money. Will be back.~4~5~5~4~5~4~5~nan
review_466672336~“Good value.”~Very handy to the trams, easy walk to hotel. Nice quick and friendly checkin. Room on 3rd floor, good size, no view but that didn't worry us. ( Was offered up grade to a room with a view for a extra $25.00 , but declined as didnt have the time to be sitting looking out the window). Don.t like the idea of two single beds being pushed together to make queen bed, VERY uncomfortable with ridge in middle. . Room is also too hot at night, air conditioning needs adjusting. Breakfast very good , plenty of choices. Water in pool also needs adjusting, too cold. (may be alright for kids , but too cold for others) Nice big pool,but just too cold in water. Plenty of areas to just sit around and relax and have drink on ground floor. Will be back in few weeks so will see how things are then.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_464426054~“Modern Hotel and great service”~I stayed in a premium 2 Queen size bed room with my teenage grandson. The room was reasonably large, well furnished with an adequate number of electrical outlets for our many electronic devices and charges. The room was very clean, neat and tidy with a view of the park. Check-in and check-out was completed efficiently and all staff we were in contact with throughout our stay were friendly, co-operative and helpful. The concierge was especially very helpful and obvious knew his way around Melbourne with fantastic advice and suggestions. All appliances in the room and Wifi were in good working order. The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows available. The room was very quiet. The bathroom was a reasonable size and adequate toiletries available. The buffet breakfast was well laid out, had ample supply and choices and were refilled when required. We ordered room service and the food arrived quickly, was well presented and hot. There was no mini bar in our room but that was attended very quickly when I requested same. I would certainly stay there again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

Great value for money and service with a smile.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_462820831~“What a bargain!”~I was lucky enough to get a room here on the weekend for the bargain price of $159. I expected it to be pretty average but I was wrong! From the moment I entered I knew it would be better than average. The revolving door and valet parking made that obvious. The foyer is modern without feeling cold. Check in was easyi (although my key had to be reactivated a number of times.)  This complex is the biggest hotel I've stayed in in Melbourne. My room was on the Pullman tower side - I'm not sure what the difference is.  The room was bigger than I expected. The bed was HUGE and very comfortable. The chaise lounge was positioned perfectly to enjoy some afternoon sun with a glass of wine. The bathroom was pretty clean. The only down side was the shower is the over tub style. I've never understood this in a room that is marketed to adults. The tub is just a standard tub, not a spa or soaking tub. Personally I'd rather just have a shower.  The buffet breakfast was a little pricey ($35) but the food was beautiful. The jam is in individual jars and the coffee was good too. The only thing I'd like to have seen is some avocado.  Most noticeably the service from all staff was impeccable. They were attentive, courteous and polite at all times. Well done to whom ever has crafted such a quality team. I would certainly stay here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462819228~“Not really happy with this place !!”~Ok - so here's what we unfortunately experienced in our stay : -Lack of customer service at the reception  -Average cleanliness of the room  -Poor service and cleanliness at the restaurant (breakfast buffet) - look at the pictures  And here's the details so hopefully the management reads it and fix the problem areas : The location is alright , only a few min walk from the tram station . We stayed there for two nights and I just happened to need to use their computers ,unfortunately ! The reception pointed me to where the computers were without knowing both computers weren't working - after trying for a few minutes I went back to them and the two guys at the reception, with the wrong attitude , tried to find out what was going on - finally someone from the concierge said "oh they've been out of order for two days and they won't be fixed until Mon ( that was a Friday afternoon ). So I just walked away ... couldn't stand the fact that they just wasted my time ... A simple sign would have been nice . At breakfast , the food and the selection were fine but it seemed like they were really struggling to manage the place ! Look at the pictures how dirty the counters were. It's the peak time and they should have known better to put someone in charge of maintaining the cleanliness of the counters as well as making sure all dishes are refilled properly which they slacked too . Its a long review but I hope they fix the problems we noticed if they want to have good business ! We surely won't stay there again ...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462798116~“Ok for short stay”~Stayed overnight for a business trip. I was in the Mercure Tower the room was a little bit tired and the bathroom old. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable and there were visible stains on the coloured pillow. Dining facilities were reasonable, good selection at breakfast, I ordered room service the night before and the chicken sandwich was ok. Staff were friendly and efficient Improvements could be made to the tower rooms and the car park was poorly lit. I didn't get chance to try the pool or gym. I would rate the hotel as average, although the Pullman which is an adjoining hotel looked nicer.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_462563011~“Disapointing stay”~I went to a conference in the Mercure-Pullman Albert Park where I stayed for 4 nights. I paid 220 AUD/night for a room with single breakfast (special rate for conferences attendees). At reception I was told that I am in one of their "best room" which was one bedroom kind of thing on top floor. As soon I entered the room it was a disappointment. All furniture was outdated and dirty. I could not find power point to charge my laptop and mobile at appropriate place. Most of the power points were hidden behind furniture. I needed power point in my bedroom, so I called reception, they seems very surprise that I do not have one. Anyway maintenance guy found one behind my bed (totally unreachable place) so he gave me extension which only extend to the side of the bed (see photos). Anyway this is a minor problem. One the first night I could not sleep because of road traffic noise (although I was on level 5). Next day I figure out that it is poor insulation in the bathroom (Not sealed window with very old style exhaust fan-see photo). Second night I tried to sleep with close bathroom door but that did not help. On third day Melbourne was bit hot (yep that can happen) and to my surprise AC in the room did not cool down, despite I kept it on whole day (they are old style room so AC does not turn off automatically). At night it was unbearable (hot) so I called the reception, 10 minute later they sent someone who simply said these units are old and we could not do anything. He offered me fan (see photo), I could not sleep whole night. I decided to go to reception and ask for room change, before I do that on the fourth day water in my washbasin started to appear dark yellow. I was so shocked I rush to reception who again was not apologetic at all and told it’s not our problem water in Victoria sometime comes yellow . I can’t believe what I was listening. Anyway they changed my room to “newer” side of the hotel, which was again disappointment (although 20-30% improvement).  I would say their lobby was good. Breakfast was good. But staff and rooms are terrible.~2~1~2~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_461889542~“Disappointed but ok”~I stayed for 1 night and too be honest was apprehensive as of some of the comments I'd read here.  I'm going to say that it was ok.  Some things definitely need work.  Stayed in a standard king and was surprised there was no mini bar. Why is that? There was milk, but nothing else.  The other things I noticed were: - no bath mat.  - Foxtel worked on and off - big rip in the curtain.  - noisy pipes at times The view was beautiful though!  Ordered room service for dinner and it was yum. The tiramisu was a bit dry.  For breakfast I once again ordered room service and I was very disappointed.  My gourmet porridge looked amazing but was lukewarm and they couldn't even find a lid for the coffee pot so a small plate was used. The lady did apologize but still, its something you wouldn't expect.  The staff at the front desk were amazing on arrival and check out. Friendly and helpful. Too be honest, out of all the Mecure's I've stayed in, this would be the most disappointing. Expected more being part of the Pullman. So much potential being overlooked.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461029663~“Great Staff and accommodation”~Have recently stayed there twice, and thought I would only review after the second stay. Both stays were excellent, I had been give, due to a recent knee and shoulder operation an upgrade to a disabled room, which was great for my extra needs. So good in fact, that I shall be staying there again on my next Melbourne visit.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459462007~“Stay elsewhere needs a good clean ”~Stayed here on a work conference for a few nights. Not one work colleague staying here had anything good to say.  We all had similar issues, the main issue we all had was the cleanliness of the rooms especially the bathrooms. Mould in showers was a common concern with general cleanliness lacking as well as loud water pipes and shower difficult to get a usable temperature being either scolding hot or freezing cold. I had issues with the toilet flushing and the towels were like sandpaper.  My bed and pillows where fine although did have a slight smell but no bottled water in the rooms even for purchase and a few colleagues didn't have milk to make a cup of tea. Very hard to get room temperature at a comfortable level as the aircon was old and couldn't be turned off.  Breakfast buffet had plenty of selection but really wasn't memorable for anything. Cafe downstairs was convenient but coffee was ordinary.  Only positive was hotel staff all seemed polite. I wouldn't stay here again and would advise to look elsewhere.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458417031~“Great Value ”~Stayed in a King room which was inexpensive however if you add breakfast for two people it gets quite pricey. Would be cheaper to grab a cab to Stkilda to eat.

review_457980604~“Disappointing stay”~This was an unsatisfactory experience (rare for Accor).  Plumbing in my room was faulty - I was woken once when someone in a nearby room went to the loo, then at about 1.00am I was re-awakened by a loud "jack hammer" type noise as someone in another room had a shower. I rang reception - who commented they could hear the noise in the background over the phone - and moved me to a room in the adjoining Pullman wing. Trouble is the move wasn't documented. First of all that meant (after already having had a disturbed night) I was disturbed again the following morning by housekeeping (who were not aware the room was occupied) then after breakfast I couldn't access the lifts or my room as my card wasn't valid.  I went to reception and was re-issued with a key - FOR THE ORIGINAL ROOM. The receptionist didn't seem capable of understanding my issue and kept insisting that the only key they would issue was for the old room not my new one (where my bag was). I got pretty frustrated and stressed and it was only when an assistant manager intervened that we started to get things sorted out. Again - had the issue been documented at the time this wouldn't have been an issue (although if the receptionist didn't stop listening after I said "my key doesn't work" we might have sorted t out a bit sooner).  As the manager pointed out - not documenting the move not only resulted in inconvenience to me but also raises issues for security and safety (eg if there is an evacuation). On top of that - not documenting the reason for the issue in the first place means the problem (which was significant) isn't documented and is unlikely to be fixed for the next unsuspecting guest. The manager did provide me with "compensation" of a small credit but bluntly this was a major fail and I didn't receive what I paid for (a good night's sleep) due to a failure of the hotel and it's procedures. Usually the Accor brand can be relied on for a good experience. Sadly on this occasion it fell way short. ~2~1~3~1~1~4~3~nan
review_457933939~“Lots of promise but disappointing”~Being part of the Pullman hotel the reception area and welcome is impressive and we always felt that the staff were helpful.  The mercury section is a bit disappointing, it's clean and tidy but tired and a bit shabby.  After the entrance you feel deflated. Then the keycard didn't work, the lift was out for one of the days and the Wifi particularly slow unless you paid more. Nothing shocking just together a little irritating.  The staff were, however, cheerful, informative and accommodating within their powers and the position is good for public transport.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456856285~“Pleasantly surprised!”~We were looking for accommodation close to the Alfred Hospital and came across a great deal for this hotel. We didn't really know what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised right from where we first walked through the main door! The staff were lovely, check in was smooth and efficient and we were offered a room upgrade. Our room was lovely - very spacious with a king size bed, sofa and coffee table, and a view over Albert Park. Our bathroom had a shower over the bath, and a fantastic long vanity bench with plenty of room to spread out your toiletries. Although located right on a busy road, the double glazed windows meant we didn't hear any of the traffic noises. The hotel foyer is a lovely spacious area with a bar, and dining is also available. We didn't get a chance to have dinner, only breakfast which was the usual hotel fare but with probably a few more options for international visitors. While we were very impressed and would be happy to stay there again, there were a couple of downsides. Not sure that the air conditioning was all that effective, and with a room at the front of the hotel the room did get a little warm. Not too much of an issue as we headed out and didn't get back until after dark. The bed was a little on the hard side, and was two singles pushed together. And in the morning it was very difficult to set the shower temperature. Took ages, but once it was set was quite a good shower. We just hopped in straight after each other so we didn't have to reset! We also felt that breakfast was a little on the expensive side at $70 for the two of us. The other thing to consider is the location. As I said earlier, we chose this hotel because of it's proximity to the Alfred Hospital. But this meant that we needed to travel by taxi to get in and out of the city. During our stay there was always a taxi available at the hotel, but it is an extra cost. You could probably walk a block or two and get a tram, but we didn't try this option. However overall we were very happy with this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456565903~“Business/Work trip...very disappointed.”~The hotel was cleaned and amenities were the basics as expected from a Mercure hotel. The room was spacious and even had a sofa, though not a very comfortable one. Housekeeping did a great job in cleaning the room.  The cons were no mini bar even though the brochure in the room said there is, no extra blanket in the room, the aircon was not adjustable so had to wear thick clothing to bed every night & there was a high cost for parking, $20 each time you take your car out or $35 for valet parking, TV volume works inconsistently, room service tray was still in the hall way where I left it 2 days later and staff were not as friendly as the other hotels I have stayed in Melbourne. One morning there was a homeless man in one of the lounge areas asleep which didn't bother me but when he came up to me demanding a cigarette is when it made me feel unsafe. I was about 2 rooms away from the lift but still heard every single chime when the lift was on our floor. Location was good with Albert Park across the road and trams nearby on St Kilda road. All in all, it was bearable since I was only in the room to sleep and get ready for work but would not stay there for leisure trip. Very disappointed as not really up to a Mercure hotel standards & security needs to be seriously looked into.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_455285627~“It was great!”~A very nice place to stay. The room we stayed in was great. Would've preferred a room overlooking the park but it was still fine. Very close to St Kilda and was just 10 mins into the CBD. There are cabs accessible to the hotel all the time and the service from everyone in the hotel was great. We got back to the hotel around 11:30pm & our TV was not working so I called the maintenance number & someone came up and fixed it straight away. I would stay here again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Only downside is parking cost. A quick cab ride away from St Kikda Beach and the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453735258~“Family stay in Melbourne”~We stayed in 2 family rooms for 3 nights. The rooms themselves are at the older end of the spectrum, well worn and my wife considered the bathroom cleanliness just adequate. The staff were all very pleasant to deal with and the location made for a great holiday.~4~5~5~4~3~3~5~nan

review_451629309~“Thank you Paul Smith”~Had extra robes after request, have to follow up and waited for free bubbly/cutlery for our anniversary. The free breakfast comes handy but cost us $149 per night instead of the first advertised price of $98.~4~3~3~4~3~4~3~nan
review_450591143~“A very enjoyable stay”~I like staying at Mercure Albert Park because it has a great pool-spa-sauna setup and a nice restaurant for evening meals. I always get a warm welcome from Stephen, Jay & Zoe and the Concierge is very friendly and helpful. The bar has a good selection of drinks with some of my favourite malts. Access and parking is very easy and very importantly - the beds are comfortable.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_449704013~“Good hotel but the parking price kills!”~The hotel itself is nice and clean. When we stayed there the air conditioner in our room did not work so we got moved to another room. However the TV in that room was so old and slow. Took what seemed like for ever to change channels. The Windows restaurant has amazing food, though a bit pricy.  The staff were very friendly.  It is conveniently located 5 min walk from the tram line and 10 min from the CBD. Would give it 4 stars but the parking prices are high (at least I think so).~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_449130899~“not worth, better spend little bit more to stay in other hotel”~mercure is old and the the management is not that good, when we get in to the room, our bathroom was locked, there were hairs on the towel, and there were some used dishes left in front of our door for long time. check in/ out time were quick, but I don't feel friendly from the staff . I would recommend you stay some other hotel even just business hotel such like ibis even better..~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~3~nan
review_449061367~“Style on the city fringe”~Mercure is the latest branding on this well established hotel. It offers a range of rooms in aspect and size. There is a good bar area, restaurant and well designed public areas. Valet car parking is on site, with a public car park around the corner. A big advantage is that access to the city by tram is but a few minutes away on St Kilda Rd. Our experience with the staff at check-in and on leaving was very good. Our room, upgraded at check-in, was a bit overwhelming. Would be good for extended stay with self catering (full kitchen, lounge and dining rooms). Apart from that, the big benefit is the location.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_449050095~“Not impressed”~Staff in Reception was full of self importance & arrogant, we did not feel welcome. Our bathroom was not very clean, specially the toilet had urine stains on it when we arrived. The hotel all round impression: Small details TV clock was wrong. Elevator clock and date was wrong, clock in the swimming pool area had the wrong time too. Tiles in sauna was missing and broken in bathroom. The showers in swimming pool area was very unclean and the drain looked like it have not been cleaned for days. We was wondering if we would have been treated better as Pullman guest after Mecure & Pullman are now one but after seeing the swimming pool area that both hotels used, maybe not. Not suitable for tourists, maybe ok for business trips.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448475850~“Excellent service and location”~Manager Stephen friendly, experienced, expert knowledge of area and restaurants, concierge helpful, pool, gym and spa/sauna amenities brilliant. Thankyou. Will come again especially due to being located so closely to St. Kilda, the lake and in between the sea and the CBD. Brilliant. The proximity to Heirloom Seed for breakfast.. and the recommendations/service/upgrade. Thankyou.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
