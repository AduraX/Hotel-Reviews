review_479032496~“Budget basics”~On the positive side, this hotel is well located, comfortable, clean and decently appointed. However the rooms are small and dated, as you would expect for the price. Breakfast is decent with plenty of options but not great coffee. It's a bit odd to have to go through to another building, but no big deal. The lack of ambient lighting/natural light in the room was a shame.  Can't comment on check in, but check out/goodbye was rude and disinterested. She was not having a great work day it seems. An easy thing to fix though.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_432270031~“Just Great”~We stayed here as a couple for 8 days. 5 of those booked by us and 3 days as part of a Sportsnet package for the MotoGP. Upon my initial booking, I requested that we be able to maintain the one room throughout the whole stay. Not only was this provided but we were also Upgraded to the next level of room. The room was very spacious, well appointed, very comfortable and very clean. I would like to make special mention of the standard of housekeeping. We have stayed in all manner of accommodation, throughout a large part of the world and the impeccable standard of housekeeping was among the best we have encountered. The staff are all friendly and helpful and despite it being a rather large hotel, we rarely saw other houseguests and there was no noise although we understand the capacity during our stay, was high. As to location, wow, from our perspective it couldn't have been better. Right in the heart of the city, close to trams and a short pleasant walk to Federation Square and Southbank.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_478094046~“Needs renovating”~I stayed 2 nights for work and while it was clean and quiet, my room was in bad need of renovating. The bed was soft but I had to sleep diagonally on it because I felt like I was falling out of bed. The pillows were great for me, not too hard and not too flat. In the shower you had put your toiletries on the floor because the rack was so small nothing really fit. The wardrobe was also tiny. The TV stations really left a lot to be desired as I know there are far more free to air channels than they had programmed and the only Foxtel channel that wasn't sport, was Fox 8 - Wow!~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_473688010~“Fantastic location”~My husband and I found a very good deal for $116 for a night at The Victoria Hotel. The rooms are basic but very clean with upgraded ensuites. It is located in a wonderful location for travelling by public transport to all parts of Melbourne. We paid $19 a head for a nice breakfast offering, cereals, toast, a few pastries and an assortment of hot breakfast dishes. Soy milk and gluten free cereals and bread were available. We will certainly use this hotel again if another discounted offer becomes available.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_473681577~“Reasonable price in a convenient location”~We booked this hotel because it was in a very convenient location and was a reasonable price. Room was extremely clean, beds were super comfortable, bathroom excellent. Reception staff were fantastic, very helpful and polite. Would definitely recommend and stay there again.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473500898~“Value for money in a great location”~We chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced accommodation in Melbourne's CBD. It was great value for a terrific location. The room was small but clean and comfortable. All necessary facilities including a very good bed. The bathroom was not brand new but it was modern, with everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_473342168~“Great Reasonably Priced Hotel in a great location”~This hotel has been refurbished and is very clean. I had booked on the wrong date and Zoe and Brett were fantastic, getting me a room and a good price. So close to the heart of the CBD, pool was lovely and clean and had a great spa. My kids loved it. Would definately go back. I try lots of hotels and most I never return to but this one I definately would. Couch could have used a dry clean but that is my only negative comment, everything else was great, carpet was new.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_473289170~“"Cheap Chic Inner City"”~I stayed for four nights to go to comedy gigs during Melbourne Comedy Festival. (2nd -6th April 2017) Victorian Hotel was a daily venue for comedy gigs.  My big room was very clean, with comfy beds, bar fridge, safe, coffee making facilities, phone, alarm clock, t.v and cable. I enjoyed a stylish new bathroom with a big shower that sprayed genuine hot water 24/7.  This three star hotel has no room service. There is one bar inside the hotel called Vic's that sells modest priced drinks and bar snacks nightly.  Airport shuttle picks you up outside to whisk you to airport for $18.00. Free Wi Fi in room and In house internet café. Luggage storage facility $5.00 if you arrive outside of check in times. Tour Desk with Maps. A Porter.  Staff were very chirpy and professional 24/7.  A 3-5 minute walk to join all tours that don't collect from hotel front door.  A 3-5 minute walk to catch all free inner city trams to DFO's Docklands.  Located Inner City Melbourne, close, cheap and chic!  So If you are on a shoe string budget or want to spend your hard earned dollar partying, touring, having a laugh at comedy gigs, or clothes shopping this is a safe, central location.  Photos of rooms posted by Hotel are identical to the room you stay in. well mine was! Travellers Tip: Take your own bottle opener as there are none in your room and reception don't sell any. OK!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473285191~“Don't ask for a bottle opener!!”~The location is great and the facilities are adequate. As a 3.5 star hotel we had no great expectations of service but we did expect at least basic levels. We rang reception and requested a bottle opener as there was not one on the room. We were told we had to go to the bar and request this. I went down to the bar only to have my request denied. They said I was welcome to bring my drinks downstairs and have them opened at the bar. This did not go down well!~3~3~4~3~3~3~1~nan
review_472803757~“Central Clean Safe & Quite”~Stayed for three nights. Very well located hotel right in the centre of Melbourne. Close to theatres Chinatown Bourke St mall etc. Breakfast on site ok and reasonable Buffett. We chose to go down the laneways two mornings.  Large rooms very clean. Onsite bar is a bit old fashioned but does the job. The best part is the price per night around half the rate I expected for Melbourne CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472508985~“Disappointed ”~After hearing many people talk favourably about this hotel I was looking forward to our recent stay. I stayed in a triple room with my mother and daughter. The front desk staff need a refresher in manners ! Each time I spoke with them I felt like an inconvenience, not a guest. My mother checked in a day earlier and was messed around by staff contradicting each other (my mother is in her 80's), when my daughter and I arrived Saturday the room pass key was basically thrown at us! When we left on Monday (as we are country travellers and train not leaving until after 6pm) we asked if we could cloak our luggage. We were told in a rude manner, not even looking at us, lockers are around the corner by the lift, you pay! We checked out the said lockers, only to find that there were very small, so unless their guests only have overnight bags, I doubt they would be useful! The cleaning staff were kind, polite and welcoming. The room was spacious and clean. The breakfast was well stocked, but the two staff on Monday struggled to clean plates due to it being busy, however, they were polite. Unfortunately I will not be returning to this motel. I do not think there is a place for rudeness in reception staff.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472335219~“Excellent hotel in central Melbourne”~This was our 4th stay at the Victoria Hotel and it continues to impress. It is excellent in terms of value for money, location, proximity to attractions and transport, amenities and room quality. Would stay again and recommend it to others.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472315954~“Convenient location.”~The welcome was off-handed and indifferent. The staff were generally unhelpful and passed any queries on to the manager. The wi-fi was allegedly free for only 1hr per day! This is appalling in this day and age. With the cost of the room, which was not cheap, it should be included. The pool is laughable - postage stamp size!  On the plus side, it was easy to get around from there and we really loved Melbourne.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_472214616~“A great place to stay in Melbourne”~This is our third stay at the Victoria Hotel, it is so central to the city and within walking distance of the Garden Show which was our reason for being in Melbourne. Staff are friendly & helpful, beautiful room, very clean, and a good breakfast. I think it is the only place to stay in Melbourne~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471825669~“Footloose”~Decent hotel in the very heart of Melbourne. Almost all sights and public transportation can be reached within minutes. Not so easy to find if you travel by car. We did not book breakfast, as cheaper options are available in the adjacent streets. We had a room for three people which was quite conveniently located on the 5th floor, but do not expect to get a view in this city hotel.  Great sushi in the near by Sushi Hub.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471495500~“Ideal budget hotel”~I stayed for 2 nights for a work trip. Got a good deal on Expedia. Hotel in excellent location for walking to shops, Chinatown, trams and trains.

I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan

review_470392458~“Just ok”~When we first arrived the customer service person was quite unfriendly and when we got to the lift our key didn't work so we had to go back and get another key. When we got to the room it was of great size but very very dated and old. Which was odd as the bathroom was very modern and nice just needed to be bigger. If the rooms were updated to be a bit more modern and better quality bedding it would be a nice stay. This place has potential.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469307771~“Convenient Location with Great Service”~The hotel is very convenient close to shopping within walking distance to theatres, and tram stops. I stayed 3 nights and we were able to get around Melbourne using trams and walking it was great. The rooms are not large we had 2 singles beds however we did not stay in the room much only for sleeping as we were busy sight seeing , shopping and dining. The staff were friendly and obliged to our requests. There was tea and coffee faciiities and a small fridge in our room which was handy. The price was reasonable for our stay. We went early to see if we could leave our luggage and they said our room was ready which was great to check in early. WE were able to book the STAR bus for airport pick up. The bathroom was updated neat and tidy.Wifi Facilities. Enjoyable stay.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_468842689~“Great location, but rubbish wifi”~This hotel could do with a revamp, it's looking a little tired. The location is brilliant, right in the middle of everything. While we were staying there we were woken at 6am by hammer drills, they were not in the hotel but in a building adjacent, really noisy and annoying. The staff were very good and we changed rooms no problem, this was beginning March so hopefully work is finished but check first. Big rooms but no storage space, wardrobe could only manage room for 5 coat hangers with no drawer space at all. Wifi is free .......... for 30 minutes!! Thereafter $20 a day, what a ripoff, in this day and age it should be free. Apart from wifi, good value~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_468776439~“Great service”~The hotel rooms are very basic but clean. There are lots of rooms but with only 3 front office staff. Apart from front office duties, they are also concierge.

review_468578631~“Great location, comfortable king sized bed, central”~The hotel is centrally situated just a few steps away from Meier shopping mall and a long car free shopping street. Has four elevators that work efficiently and fast, so even with a full hotel you never have to wait long to catch one. We had a corner deluxe room with a very comfortable king sized bed. A small fridge is available to store any drinks you might have brought along. There is a hair dryer (which is not advertised in the website) in case you need one - my spouse used it. We purchased the early check-in option, unfortunately, when we arrived at 10am, there were no rooms available. We were told that the room should be ready by noon, and that we wouldn't be charged the early arrival fee. However, when we were checked in at 11:30am, we did have to pay and were told that as check-in is normally at 2pm, we were still getting the hotel room a few hours earlier. Didn't want to argue about that but just made the experience less palatable. The bathroom shower is not enclosed. It only has a shower curtain, so you end up with a very wet bathroom floor after you are done showering. Check out was very fast and with no surprise additional charges. Price wise, it seems to be similar to all hotels near by. Oh... and the free WiFi worked without a glitch. All in all, good for a short holiday stay (perhaps not a business stay as it has no working space).~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_468410292~“Great location”~Overall hotel and service was great for a 3 star hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean in a great location with trams close by.

review_467923425~“Terrible front of house staff, outdated hotel”~Stayed here for a short three day business trip, as it was located literally across the road from my clients office. Will never be back. Check in staff were absolutely abhorrent. Clearly no interest in being at work and no attempt at customer engagement. Hotel itself is terribly outdated and has the most confusing layout of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Having to walk through different doors and into different wings? Not a pleasant thing while carrying luggage! Not to mention every time one of said doors is opened or closed you can hear it in your room and it wakes you up during the night!!! I asked to be moved to a room where the constant door banging wouldn't be an issue, and was met with "sorry that happens everywhere in the hotel"... absolute disgrace. The only reason i gave 2 stars and not one is because the room was very clean and well serviced (even though the shower head sprayed water out the top and all over the wall) and bed was very comfortable. Other than this an appalling experience.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467090103~“Strangely designed - no character”~We picked this hotel because of its location - and that's the only thing it scores on. The hotel is a refurbished place from what appears to be another era. The rooms were tiny, boxy and dark. The worst part of the hotel is the elevators - there is one elevator that takes you halfway, and another one to access your room. There were about a hundred "fire safety" doors between the elevator and the room, with long narrow suffocating corridors. Not a pleasant place to stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_466766289~“2 night stay”~Hotel is at a great location. walking distance from Federation square. lot of restaurants and shopping places near by. there is an Indian restaurant at a walking distance. wi-fi service is available on request. Hotel is with narrow pathways with doors in between. if you are with heavy luggage, its difficult to take it to your room as you might cross lot of doors in the pathways. I stayed in room 4119, it doesn't have any view. Rooms and hallways gives you creepy feeling.  If you are budgetary traveler and looking to be in hotel only for sleep then this can be your option.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_466661241~“Location,Location, Location”~This is not the first time we have stayed here & it certainely won't be the last, as always the room was clean, spacious & had all that was needed for a very good few days in the city. Easy walking distance to Federation Square, South Bank, Crown Casino, Botanical Gardens & many interesting bars, pubs, fabulous laneways, great shopping & restaurants. Free tram zone is a great way to get around all the sights. I stupidly left some items of clothing in the wardrobe, when I got home 2 days later & realized , I phoned the hotel & was put straight through to housekeeping who called me back within 10 mins to say that the items had been found & they would either hold on to them for me or post them. I was very impressed with the fantastic way they dealt with my stupid error. Credit all round. Thank you. On this visit we had some friends from the UK with us & they were very impressed by the facilities offered & at such a reasonable rate, they had been using 5 star hotels previously & couldn't believe The Vic was not rated higher.

review_466015252~“Smelly rooms”~Location is superb, taxis always out the front in the morning - perfect for business meetings. Front desk staff very friendly. Size of room good. BUT the room I got was smelly, it smelled like something was wrong with the sewage. I asked to see another room, that room smelled very strongly of curry. I was told no other rooms were available as the hotel was booked at full capacity, I decided to stay in the first room. They left another card in the room so that the vent in the bathroom could work all day while I was at work, that helped the situation somewhat, but I had to turn the fan off overnight. Also there is the tiniest window in the room only, not a very good layout. Overall I would not return and ask for work to book another hotel next time I am in town.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465699666~“Adequate hotel but with a great location!”~The check in is sufficient and that the deposit is very low. The hotel is quite old but the rooms are adequate. The real winner for me is the bathrooms, which had been recently renovated. The amenities are just shower gel and shampoo/conditioner and soap so bring your toothbrush and toothpaste. The safe is quite old and we did have a problem with it so just beware of your valuables. Tea/coffee and a biscuit is provided and water and milk. There is also a kettle and ironing board. Overall the service was adequate and the biggest winner is the location where you can access everything in the CBD with just a small walk or along the free tram zone. It is generally worth its price.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_465187848~“Pleasant front desk staff & great location & conveneint tram stops.”~First off, kudos to the front desk staff for their friendliness and helpfulness. My wife and I were greeted with a warm and cheery greetings by Zoe and her supervisor upon check in. This is our first visit to Melbourne and the staff (Zoe, Emily, Stella, the Thai gentlemen were all helpful to provide guidance to the nearby amenities and other helpful tips.  The location is great - close to trams, shopping malls, convenient shops and eateries.  Very central between Flinders in the south and Melbourne Central up north. Room - Bed and pillows were not too comfortable. Certain areas of the bed sags esp. the edges. Also would have preferred a lighter color to the deep red; made the place gloomy. Lighting in the room and bathroom was very good. I like the bathroom - spacious, clean and new. Well done. A little suggestion to make the experience better: 1) cleaners to be more meticulous; a piece of tin foil was found in the shower area floor and a used plaster was stuck to the inside of the waste bin in the room for days even though the room had been cleaned (we stayed 7 nights). 2) provide more shelf space in the shower. The tiny metal shelf is not compatible with the nice surrounding, and some hooks for towels would be convenient. It was cold and we had to open the door to get to the towels. 3) Another improvement to make - the door presently opens away from the towel rack and basin. Changing the direction would be helpful. Little details but would delight the users. 4) Provide more hangers - forget about those that need the plastic holders; a pain to use. Hopefully some of these improvement could be in place before our next visit towards the end of the year? Noise - it was noisy the first few days but after some of the inconsiderate groups moved out it was peaceful again. They created more disturbance than the White Night Festival which was surprisingly quiet from our room! The management should advise guests not to talk loudly outside other guests rooms. Quite uncivilized behavior. There was some machine noise as well - AC? Not too please that we had to get new passwords from the front desk for wifi access. Not guest friendly.  Overall we had a pleasant stay and would be back again.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan

review_463451165~“Had everything we need plus great location”~We always stay in the CBD when visiting Melbourne, but had not tried The Victoria before. Got a great price through Accor Plus, and upon arrival was greeted with an upgrade from twin to family room, which gave us a queen plus a single. The room was spacious, with a desk, two tub chairs and two small occasional tables. The bathroom was modern, the shower hot and with plenty of water, and the bed and pillows comfy. I was impressed with the generous tea and coffee supplies - so often these days hotels skimp on these. There were even a few biscuits! There was only one very small window in the corner of the room, but it could be opened for fresh air. Staff were friendly and helpful, and Vic's bar had a nice feel to it. Location is excellent and we were not aware of undue noise. I can't believe we have not discovered this hotel before, and I am sure we will be back.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_463379706~“A centrally based hotel handy to all public transport”~A very comfortable hotel with free internet to Accor Club members. Guest laundry provided adequate facilities to use. Friendly staff available to provide help when needed. Adjacent restaurant was a pleasant place to kick start the day with a good buffet breakfast and offered dinner if you didn't wish to go out. Only hiccup was the thought that the vanity in the bathroom was a little large for the size of the room and the small fridge was a little noisy sounding like someone snoring softly. Otherwise no complaints, would happily stay in this hotel again - more than adequate and good value for money.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
