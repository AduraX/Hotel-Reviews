review_477577576~“Excellent choice for those who like to explore the city”~This hotel room is lovely with a huge window view of the city and Yarra River. When we arrived we were to early to check in so bell hop took our bags and we started to look at the map to figure out the city. The bell hop was so helpful with helping us with the direction to head into the main city, telling us about the free city tram which everyone is able to ride. He gave us a good map and we headed on our way. After several hours of looking around and easily walking in town, we headed back ( walking ) to the hotel. Our room was ready and our bags had already been moved up there. We thought the buffet meals were more expensive and more food then we needed we found a food court within the hotel complex. You have not problem finding less expensive options. We only had two nights enjoying this lovely hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477493976~“great 3 night stay”~The hotel is ideally situated to visit Melbourne. It is a large hotel with walking access to lots of restauraunts, shops and a casino all within the complex. The room was beautiful and clean, very comfortable and well equipped. The mini bar was well stocked, however, a small (300ml) bottle of white wine was $28. The hop on/hop off tour bus of the City stops about 200 yards from the front of the hotel. The bar area is quite large and very comfortable and pleasant to relax in. Concierge and reception staff were very helpful and efficient. Would have no hesitation to stop at this hotel again.~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477341503~“Hard to fault!”~My girlfriend and I didn't know which Crown hotel to choose, obviously there's Towers, Metropol & Promenade. Promenade was just over $100 cheaper and for the price you pay, expectations were exceeded.  Yes, the promenade is situated across the road from the casino & towers but it is all connected. There are two walkways connected to the casino which creates easy access.  I cannot fault the service one bit, I would get asked 2-3 times if I had been looked after in the space of a minute which made us feel very welcome.  The room was fantastic, there was no fault whatsoever with anything provided to us, bed was comfy, views were spectacular and again I can't fault anything!  I would definitely recommend the Promenade to anyone heading to stay in the city.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477278788~“Very Nice”~This hotel lives up to expectations and having so many restaurants, a cinema, and the casino so close is always a bonus! Room was comfortable, clean and spacious with a lovely view of the city. Small notes for improvement: we had to remake the bed as the sheets were all bunched at our feet and the shower head doesn't provide enough volume of water, great pressure, but not enough jets in the head.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476957635~“"Outstanding"”~Five star service.. Five Star rooms..great views from every room..good for couples or groups... Casino adjoins to the hotel..and plenty of shops..restaurants everywhere.. Good and pleasant stay..will be going back to this one~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476840678~“Great place to stay”~Stayed 3 nights whilst on a tour of Australia. Very central right on the the river and very central. A huge hotel complex with three hotels together and a casino, shopping mall and loads of restaurants. Room a nice size, very clean and well maintained. Reception well organised. Breakfast was included in price served well and plenty of choice. Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan

review_476425046~“Disappointing service”~Stayed here for a conference. The initial contact with the reception was unwelcoming but quickly and efficiently resolved by a supervisor.  I could not travel due to a cat 4 tropical cyclone and flight cancellations. Arrived a day late, and placed a request to waive the 1-day penalty rate citing cancellation of all planes from my city due to cyclone. No response received and charged in full :-( So many other options were available to stay elsewhere and may not return any time soon!~2~3~4~3~3~3~1~nan

review_473721408~“Comfortable hotel ”~We had a standard twin room. It was quite spacious with a large window that overlooked the freeway. A good sized bathroom, in room safe, robes and slippers supplied & just a short walk through the hotel to access the casino & restaurants. They offer valet parking which cost us $37 a night, but they are happy to get your car for you as often as you like. There is public parking across the road costing $16 a night but then it costs you extra each time you leave the car park. Overall a good hotel if you want to go to the casino or into the CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Spacious bedrooms and very good bathroom with large walk in shower. Panoramic views. Great pool and spa area. Only one restaurant and bar in hotel but access to facilities in other parts of the complex, including food court area and several other restaurants. Good location - close to downtown and other south bank restaurants.~4~4~4~4~4~5~3~nan

review_472443367~“Excellent Hotel Close to Downtown”~Came to Melbourne for a business meeting and brought the family along as well. As expected of a high end hotel, service was excellent: courteous, prompt, highly professional and helpful to our satisfaction. Extra bonus for friendly staff in all positions! The location, as it's outside of downtown proper, is easy to get a start on travel: a major tour stop for buses, taxis, and transit. Many attractions are within walking distance and, for shopping and finding a quick bite, the indoor walkways take you to restaurants, food courts, shopping and casinos. Room was very comfortable and spacious -- modern and very clean. Indoor swimming pool was very basic and a little more stylish than functional, i.e., long, narrow and shallow. One issue: outlets could be much more accessible since everyone has something that needs charging nowadays. For us North Americans, we have outlet adapters but no power bars/strips.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_471749052~“Another Grand Prix weekend at Crown Promenade”~The location and Gym and Lap Pool of Crown Promenade make this our Hotel of choice for the GP Weekend. Also getting a big tick are the Pillows, duck down and Comfy !!. A couple of small negatives, the mini fridge was not cold, so lots of trips to the ice machine down the hall to load up with ice, and the plug for the hand basin was too small, so it didn't seal, which is annoying when shaving. Only small things however if they want to market themselves as a premium hotel, an attention to detail is required. Head Housekeeper, take note !!.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_471392167~“Difficult to revue”~This hotel reminded me of something you would see in a science fiction movie! Going out from the room it is a vast complex. It felt dark with people passing people passing people. Once we found our way out onto the street and were walking beside the river it all felt calmer. The room itself was very good. The breakfast was excellent. So all in all it is what the individual's taste is and being a city hotel complex it provided what was necessary..~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470771106~“Great Facilities, Great Stay, Very Poor Complaint Resolution”~Dear Mr Moore, Our stay, facilities and location was great. Our vehicle was valet parked, included in our stay. Brand new tyre on a large 4x4 damaged by your valet staff. Duty manager inspected the damage, photos taken, tyre inspected next day by Tyre Dealer, clearly damaged by hitting wheel stop at great speed. I offered the duty manager to have the tyre independently inspected, but refused. As far as management was concerned, the matter was closed. So who made Crown staff judge and jury. Very Disappointed.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_467846786~“Great room and fantastic complex”~We had a 4 night stay here during a 2 week visit in Oz. The hotel itself is part of a large complex of high end shops, restaurants, the river walk and casino. Our room was large, clean, the bed was quite comfortable and had extra pillows. Shower had good pressure, amenities in bath were ample as were towels. An easy walk over a bridge to Flinders Street for less expensive shops and visitor info and guides. We found there was no need to use the gym as we were walking everywhere throughout this large complex and surrounding area.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

I have never previously stayed at any Crown in Melbourne but have done in Perth. I was excited as my experience in Crown Metropol in Perth was excellent. From the welcome of the doormen to the fluffy room towels, gorgeous pool and excellent gym my stay couldn't be better. The in room dining experience was amazing the food delicious and the service outstanding. Conference facility was world class and absolutely professional.

However, although we waited 5 minutes for Valet parking (the gentlemen was helping a driver with directions) the greet was quite welcoming after. The reception although not as bright as used to, but still accommodating. We stayed on the 16th floor and was happy to be able to check in earlier.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.

review_464663979~“A Solid Option”~This was my first stay at the Promenade. For the most part it met or exceeded my expectations.  Check in was smooth and my room was modern and clean. There were plenty of towels in the bathroom and the amenities were of good quality.  In the flip side, my room on the fifth floor offered a view of the lobby roof, which was a shame. And the $5 charge for 200ml water bottle was excessive. The Wi-Fi is free, but was almost usable because it was so slow.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464463749~“Great choice on the Southbank”~We stayed for 3 nights at the Crown Promenade and were very pleased with our choice of hotel. The room was on the 15th floor and had a nice view over the Southbank and the river. The location is excellent as there are many restaurant choices both on the Southbank and the other side of the river. Check in was very efficient and we were pleased to receive a bottle of bubbly in the room, as the stay was part of our holiday for our 30th wedding anniversary celebrations. The room was of a nice size with very comfortable bed and we had probably our best night’s sleep of our 3 week trip to Australia in this hotel. In spite of being a large and busy hotel there was no noise from outside the room. The Wi-Fi also worked perfectly Bathroom was of a good size with large walk in shower. The hotel has a nice pool on the 3rd floor together with sauna and steam rooms in the changing room, although the sauna is very small. The hotel is a very good choice for a city break in Melbourne.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

Easy checkin and checkout, room clean and tidy and with amazing city views it once again lived up to what I expect from the Crown brand. Try out the pool if you can, we went for a swim at 1100am and practically had it to ourselves.

review_461834795~“Good location, great amenities, difficulty with car parking”~Stayed at the Crown Promenade for 8 nights and booked two rooms for a family holiday. The rooms are ok with good sized bathrooms. The wardrobe space was a problem as all the bags and stuff didn't fit, so most of it ended up on the floor. The rooms are very clean, with great views.  The proximity to the Crown Towers, casino, Southbank and other restaurants, can't beat it.  The pool and gym areas are great and the staff at the pool counter were really friendly and helpful compared with the staff at reception. If you are thinking of taking your car with you, this is probably not the place to stay.  Car parking was a problem. $38 for a 24 hour period. Long wait time to get the car up and mix up with keys etc. The forecourt is often completely blocked with people coming/going/checking in and out.  Good hotel to take kids to for the weekend. The pool is very nice, clean and good sized. Through the hotel you can get to a food court if you don't want to have breakfast at the hotel. You can also get through to the Game Arcade, which is a good activity if it's raining.  The price for this hotel was great compared to others in the area.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The rooms a large, with comfortable beds and the bathroom is huge, well worth the money and you can pick it up for special prices on all the hotel booking places  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461561745~“Crown Promenade”~Excellent service. If you want to feel like a King or Queen stay here! There's a lot to do and see as the location is of close proximity to the CBD. There's shopping inside the Crown and lots of food choices.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461359482~“Not a bad hotel but service poor”~First time staying at the Crown Promenade, after countless stays at other Crown Hotels in Melbourne. We thought we would give this one a go, as surely it would have the same level of class and service as Towers and the Metropol.  Boy were we wrong. Rooms are adequate and nicely presented, but have dated badly compared to its younger cousin the Metropol, and more looked-after Towers. However, cleanliness and location were just as good as other Crown hotels. The main disappointment in staying here is the level of service provided by front desk staff. From experience, Guest Services at the other hotels go above and beyond for guests. In contrast, check-in/out here was rushed, standoff-ish and generally unpleasant. A radioed 'mini bar check' was required before we were allowed to check out, which was an added inconvenience and a bit unnecessary considering other Crown hotels simply charge the credit card if anything is out of order. Basically, if you need a room at late notice and don't really mind about the quality of service or luxurious room finishes, this hotel will likely more than accomodate your needs. But if you would like to experience the luxury that usually comes with Crown's world class hotel, steer clear of this one and head to any of the other options. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461310097~“Friendly, attentive and humorous staff!! ”~Excellent hotel location.. located in the heart of the city. Tram is free, u can walk anywhere.. eat and shop and site see in walking distance. Thank you to the bell desk manager/supervisor and the bell staff! Thank u Alex for going out of ur way in making sure my husband and I did not miss our excursion. Qantas Airlines lost our luggage and bell desk was on it. Caution: Qantas airlines has a bad rep for missing luggage ... eventually it arrived but not necessarily along with ur flight. Bell desk made sure we got our bags. Even housekeeping and customer desk services would bring to our door whatever we needed promptly. Bell desk staff are truly knowledgeable of their city and are very informative.. this is a city that has its own pulse and rhythm. Restaurant services on point and servers full of excellent recommendations and friendly as well. This a place for food lovers such as myself ! Coffee here is prepared with passion and respect..always looked forward to my freshly prepared cappuccino !! Forget Starbucks..lol. ! I recommend u extend a few more days in Melbourne. We did the Great Ocean road trip and visited the 12apostles .. long trip but honestly breath taking. Words can not express. Kangaroo and koala sanctuary was definitely worth it. This was a bucket list trip.Thank u Aussies for making us feel welcomed!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461062725~“Love the Promenade”~whether you're staying overnight, a weekend or for a week or more, the Crown Promenade is absolutely perfect. nothing short of luxuriousness, the staff make you feel like you are a Hollywood Star. We highly recommend this hotel. Service outstanding, amenities outstanding, worth every cent every time.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461048387~“Fantastic hotel”~We stayed here for two nights to celebrate our anniversary and had a fantastic time. The hotel was very modern, we had a fantastic view of the city and it was very central. The bed was very comfortable as well. A great place to stay if you want to be part of all Crown has to offer. The price was very good too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460880731~“Comfortable and practical”~This was the perfect room for a business trip with reasonable wifi sufficient for email or web browsing and convenient power operated curtains and blinds as well as DND and MUMR lights, secure door locks, and good intensity lighting throughout. The water pressure in the shower is a little on the weak side and apart from the clock everything worked well. The clock had a loose power plug in the back which meant that merely touching the clock to reposition it was sufficient to dislodge or displace the connection thus causing the time and any alarms to re-set to 0:00. Instructions for its use would have saved time.~4~4~4~5~5~4~4~nan
review_460591474~“Fantastic Experience”~Wonderful 3 day stay with very obliging Guest Services who were wonderful in assisting our personal celebration. Great room with fantastic view, very clean and modern, and great bed. Cant recommend highly enough.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460551053~“Perfect Melbourne city hotel”~My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Crown Promenade whilst in Melbourne for the Australian Open. The hotel is perfectly situated for easy access to the city and the sport precinct, with several good restaurants in the vicinity. Check in was friendly and efficient and the room was modern, comfortable and immaculate with a great view over the river. The pool was a welcome relief after a hot day at the tennis and the gym appeared well equipped. This was our third trip to Melbourne and this is the hotel we will come back to in the future.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460488033~“Always a pleasure!”~Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Crown Promenade & would recommend it to everyone! We have been staying here for years & wouldn't go anywhere else. Crown always provides and exceptional experience for everyone, and that's why we choose Crown.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_460031206~“Helpful Staff”~Arriving early Sunday morning after a long flight from U.K. they still managed to book us in early despite being extremely busy with people departing after a weekend stay. Good location and all the staff very helpful.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_459794293~“Good location and good rooms ”~I always stay here for business when I am in Melbourne. Fortunately I get a corporate rate otherwise quite expensive. Nice clean rooms and on the higher floors a nice view on Melbourne. Lots of nice restaurants close buy. I like the location because you walk everywhere. Good breakfast, also expensive but understandable because of the wide choice of food.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459737577~“Huge hotel, clean and not too far from the sights and sounds”~On my trip to Melbourne, I stayed at teh Crown Promenade. The hotel is huge but on a downside it takes a bit of walking around the grounds to get to the front entrance. The hotel has its own infrastructure where they have their own parking building, mall and casino. The rooms itself is clean and we were fortunate enough to get the top floor with a view. If I visit Melbourne again, I would stay at this hotel again. The attractions are not too far and if you need a supermarket it is merely a block away. Service is impeccable and everyone is willing to help you get from point A to Point B~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_459555185~“Relaxing and shopping”~We spent three days shopping and sight seeing in Melbourne CBD post Christmas Sales and ended each day with a swim in the hotel pool and wonderful food at restaurants like Rosetta. Rockpool, Atlantis and The Hive~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459114823~“Excellent service”~We stayed 5 days in a city view room at this hotel on a trip to Melbourne. The staff were excellent, particularly the check in man and the bell desk team. Room was fine though the mattress was not great - or maybe it's an Australian thing to have a plastic top to it. Room good, though we would have expected complimentary water at this level. Didn't eat in the hotel as there are plenty of alternatives nearby. Good location for Melbourne's activities.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_458769793~“Hotel- excellent. Butbeat and drink elsewhere”~Hotel was great. Room (studio) was spacious and very comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. The Deck is better than it looks in photos. Would definitely stay again, but id eat elsewhere.  The bar, Tonic, and the restaurant Mesh, let the whole experience down. We had breakfast included with our room- we thought it was a full buffet but was just a continental, and the lady on front of house was a bit rude. I had a night cap at Tonic just to find that my $30 a shot whiskey had numerous pieces of dirt in the glass. The first glass he went to replace it with was put away after he looked in it- assumingit was also dirty. Then he cleaned another 1 for my replacement.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458761008~“Great hotel great location ”~Stayed here for a work function. Always great service and great location for everything you need. Staff and service is fantastic and I would recommend the valet parking as it is quick simple and easy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458638655~“Fantastic service”~Very helpful and friendly staff, the chaps on the concierge desk gave us lots of helpful advice about where to go and what to see/not see in our short time in Melbourne. The hotel was spotless. The pool was lovely, sadly the spa pool was out of order. We arrived very late and I wanted something to eat and drink, and we went by the walkway to the casino and there went to Margos for late food and drink. Great! Excellent hotel/staff/facilities.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457744952~“Perfect”~My husband booked a night last weekend to surprise me for my 50th birthday. He requested a room on a high floor & mentioned it was my 50th. Not only did they give us a lovely room on the top floor with a perfect view, they also sent up some gorgeous Lindt chocolates & a bottle of bubbly just after we arrived. Breakfast in the morning at the buffet was pretty good. Best bacon ever!!!  Didn't get time to enjoy the pool area, but it looked lovely!~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_457413127~“Great Location, Great Room”~Stayed here for 4 nights, the room was great on the 22nd floor with lovely views. It was spacious and comfortable.

We would use this hotel again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
