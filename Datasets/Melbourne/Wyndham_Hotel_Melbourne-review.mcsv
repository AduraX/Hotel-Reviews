review_475765639~“Perfect, almost.”~This is a great place to stay in Melbourne. Location is great, the facilities great and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We stayed a few days as Wyndham owners and were so impressed. Great room and a very comfortable bed. Equipped kitchen meant we could choose to eat at home or sample the many eateries around the area. Easy to get around by tram because of the central location. A delightful time in a great hotel. One minor criticism - very limited bench space in the kitchen. By the way, great gym, a relaxing quiet library and a heated rooftop pool, wonderful even in April.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

The hotel have roof top swimming pool on the floor 23.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474383892~“great stay in the CBD”~our first stay in the highly booked Wyndham Hotel in Melbourne CBD. finally got to use it as a little city stay after taking the kids to the Wiggles Concert in the city. whilst it's not in the touristy part of the CBD, the free Tram service in the CBD makes it a breeze to get a round. the Hotel is of high standards, even within the Wyndham group of places we have visited. nice friendly staff, and the room was spacious and modern. only thing we thought was missing is a bath tub, considering we were in a 2 bed room DX and there were 2 showers...~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474034604~“Friendly staff”~We stayed in a two bedroom apartment and found it to be ideal for a family. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. The kitchen was simple but suited our needs. The pool area was beautiful although it wasn't ideal for younger children. The only negative I can find is the couch in the lounge area, it was extremely uncomfortable. There are great restaurants around and it's not far to the shops in Bourke Street Mall or at the Spencer Street shops.  The highlight of our stay were the staff, they were all very friendly and helpful. We look forward to staying here again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan

review_473554807~“Outstanding Customer Service”~Awesome service during our stay at Wyndham Melbourne. From the time we arrived to the time we checked out, all the staff we meet were friendly, helpful and overall a breath of fresh air! Special mention to Casey who provided all the info required for us to get around the great city of Melbourne and Hallam who provided the best check-out service ever :)~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_473031094~“Lunchtime ”~The prestige restaurant lunch is informal both in the menu and the relaxed seating. Quiet and and spacious environment. Pleasing service. Able to host business associates and talk business. Ideal central location.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471794678~“Convenient location ”~This was a great place to stay. Very close to city shopping, restaurants, and sightseeing. Self contained rooms, very comfortable. My only complaint was the drawers in the bedrooms as they couldn't be opened.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471747094~“Nice hotel with central location”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom deluxe apartment. The accommodation was great and staff friendly. On the most part the apartment made the most of space and had a somewhat spacious feel... ...except for the second bedroom with twin beds. The second bedroom was small. It'd be fine for children to share, but you'd probably start feeling a little too cozy if there were two adults.  That would be the only con I found for the accommodation which was fantastic otherwise.  As a side note: On check in were given a 2 for 1 voucher to a nearby cafe with delicious food. This was a nice bonus that we weren't expecting.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471505912~“Nice Room for a Week-end Stay”~Planned a week-end stay in Melbourne and wanted to be close to the benefits of the CBD. This place certainly got the ticks for that. Even though this is a shared building with another accommodation group, once you walk thro the correct door its not an issue. If you have brought your own car however, its a different story. You need to do a drive by to unload (or pick up) your luggage, and then park in a building around the corner - at an additional expense. The staff are very very helpful with all aspects of your stay, including the help with luggage to and from the car.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_469278926~“Lovely Stay with nice views”~Lovely stay for my birthday weekend, apartment had everything you need, however no free wifi, even though it did stat on the website there was, but overall staff and facilities were great!.  only downside no decent supermarkets were near by~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_469277512~“Central, Clean”~Had a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment with balcony. Very nice, master room awesome, 2nd room quiet small, would be OK with small kids, teenagers maybe but not really for two adults, not really enough comfy seating when all wanting to sit and watch TV to chill. Room a bit stuffy if air conditioning not active but could open balcony door but very noisy with traffic~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469236849~“Could be much better”~Overall this hotel could be improved immensely. The rooms are fairly spacious with good facilities and are quite modern in decor. One of the issues is they are stuck between satisfying their vacation ownership owners and the other tenants of the building, apartments called 'The William'. These appear to get preference over paying hotel guests. The Wyndham is floors 1 to 4 of the building and floors 5 to 24 is the privately owned 'William Apartments'. The rooftop pool is small and cannot accomodate guests from all 24 floors. There is no room service. The paid guests get the worst rooms looking over trash cans and service areas at the rear of the hotel. Every morning at 6am a dumpster comes to empty the bins and wakes everyone up. Our balcony was very dirty and had not been cleaned in weeks. Staff on reception are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend that you stay at a property that is solely a hotel, with all the help and facilities you would expect. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467070393~“Amazing apartment in melbourne city”~My partner and i stayed here on a saturday night in july. Wish we could of stayed here longer! The room was modern, clean and very nice! Balcony was a nice size and was a nice view of the city. Staff were all very helpful and nice! Organised us a car to the airport and held our bags from saturday morning before check in and until sunday night after checkout. Very close to etihad stadium and docklands. Definately recommend for anyone wanting a nice apartment in melbourne city!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464152024~“Fabulous location”~My husband and I shared a 2 bedroom apartment with his brother and sister in law. The main bedroom was a good size and the second one was adequate with plenty of wardrobe space. The bathroom was a good size with plenty of towels, although some for the pool which we did not have time to use. There is a bbq area adjacent to the pool (which is on the rooftop). The living/kitchen area was good and there was a balcony overlooking Little Bourke Street, with numerous coffee shops all around. The kitchen is well equipped and we could have cooked a baked dinner, had we wanted to. Being in the heart of the city was great and we were able to walk to most of the tourist attractions. If not, there is a tram system that is free within the CBD, just hop on and off. There was a laundry on our floor with two commercial washing machines and 2 dryers. Detergent for both the washing and dish washing machine in the unit, were both supplied. The only downside was that neither bedroom had a window. We had not stayed in Timeshare accommodation previously, but were very impressed with our 4 nights at the Wyndham, Melbourne. We would not hesitate to stay there again. The reception staff could not have been more helpful.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_462647152~“Great hotel with everything you need!”~I can't say anything negative about this hotel - we had a really good experience! We had a 2 bedroom place and it was nice and clean and very spacious. There was a heated roof top lap pool which was great. There was also a shower room close by which you can use after your swim which was really handy. Near the pool there was a BBQ.  I loved that the hotel provided a free laundromat which had a dryer as well. Was really handy to wash our clothes especially when we were there for a few nights. Loved the free ice machine as well!!! I highly recommend this hotel, the only downside was that around the hotel a lot of places shut on the weekends, however it is only a short stroll away to other restaurants and the main hub of Melbourne plus the car park is not attached to the hotel but is only a short stroll away. I would stay at this hotel again!~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_460581634~“Another Wyndham Disappointment ”~Thank god we leave tomorrow & our membership is over finally. 4 different locations with 4 thumbs down. Never have we had so many dramas with a hotel chain. We were place above the gym 6am to 10pm with smashing of weights all day & night. We asked to be moved & were moved to the other end of the hotel along with restaurant voucher & some movies only to find out there was a gym right next door in the adjoining building with the same problem 6am to 8pm.The staff were great & the hotel was nice but very frustrating after spending thousands of dollars. Do not become a member or you may be very disappointed. Every stay they attempted to con us into spending more but didnt want our feed back. The exception was this property after we explained our previous problems.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460529577~“Only tram ride from everything”~Stayed here 3 times as couple and with friends, found it nice and quiet out of hustle an bustle of main Melb, but within 1 block walk to tram rides which are free in CBD to all locations you need. Terrific views from the rooftop pool area, very relaxing place, staff cant do enough for you. No in house restaurant however there is one outside door next to hotel, food was great and well priced. Only live within 45 mins of Melbourne, but if in city for extended time always stay at Wyndham hotel. Only stayed in 2 bedroom apartments so can't review what other rooms are like.~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_459968335~“Average hotel in Melbourne cbd ”~No in room dining service or water bottles or food available. No restaurant on site. Late check in (3pm) and early check out (10am).  No where to keep toiletries in shower so be prepared to hold them whilst showering or leave on floor floating around. Shower head falls on head. Wi fi in room was not working so man at reception came to room to fix and climbed over furniture with shoes on.  Need to pay $5 a day for wi fi.  Feels quite lonely and isolated.  There is a lot of space in the apartment so great for couples or families. Close to attractions. Staff (Cassie, Gemma and Jessie) are friendly and helpful. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459358071~“Great stay”~Perfectly located, the Wyndham is a wonderful hotel. We had a two bedroom apartment that was decorated in a clean modern theme. The front desk staff were very helpful and welcoming. On site laundry is available. There is a restaurant located on the first floor and it serves an incredible breakfast. A nice convenience store is located across the street and you can easily stock your full kitchen from here. Major sites are within walking distance and if it's not the convenient public transport is just steps away. And there is a very nice rootop pool.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457063420~“Pretty good”~To be perfectly honest, it was one of the best stays at a Wyndham however the room was very stuffy. I wish they offered to give you floor fans or something because the air con doesn't help the room near the kitchen. There's great facilities like the gym and pool. The balconies are quite nice in the morning when the city is still asleep, not too noisy, fresh cool air, great views.~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_455546965~“3 day getaway”~Hotel was clean , comfy beds rooms just a little too small if there were 2 people per room it would be cramped. Nice pool on roof. Good location with tram stops near. Quiet day and night and barely saw anyone on our floor. Overpriced~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~3~nan
review_451319028~“Great service”~Asked for an upper floor and was given top floor close to the roof top pool. Thankyou ! Customer service was friendly and extremely helpful.

review_450874184~“Worth the Airfare from the Gold Coast”~Stayed here for 5 days, could not fault the front office staff, every member we dealt with was super friendly & helpful with all our questions. Knowledge of the surrounding areas & public transport system was excellent. Two bedroom room was good quality, Nice & modern, good wifi, large tv, well equipped kitchen, large bathrooms, beds all good, air conditioning may need a service as we found it a little warm for our liking in the room. Hallways to the lift didn't have air con & were uncomfortable. Position of hotel suited us, Tram outside the front door, easy walking distance to everything we needed, Chinatown, Coles, Hire Cars, Skybus, Lygon St restaurants plus many more. There is no restaurant attached to the hotel but the staff recommend the one next door, we ate breakfast here & had afternoon drinks but would not recommend this place at all. Used the rooftop BBQ for dinner one night, no cooking utensils provided, but nice barbie, rooftop pool was well used. Would stay again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_449753855~“Modern apartment in CBD”~We stayed one night in a two bedroom unit in November 2016. The unit was spacious. I thought it was weird the second bedroom did not have a window. This is a mixed use space. People own apartments in the building and 80 plus units are with Wyndham. I find that arrangement as odd, not my idea of a resort-like atmosphere. The pool was warm and they had a nice gym. Laundry on a different floor. Due to the size of the unit and the location, it gets very good overall rating.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_446643772~“Wyndham Hotel Melbourne”~What a great location. Easy ten minute walk fro main bus depot from the airport($19 one way). 15 Minute walk to main CBD and all the wonderful shops, arcades, eateries and coffee shops.

review_445743640~“Friendly staff”~Staff were fantastic and very helpful. .The room was lovely (2 bedroom) .Silly sized coffee table in lounge area made it hard to access the balcony so had to move it..No noice cancelling windows but no big deal if u like the city sounds at night ..The heated pool wasnt really heated so was disappointing but the kids enjoyed it (as they dont feel the cold) haha ..Have rules at pool of no glass and no alcohol but half of the people that was there at the time we went went did have so needs more security and enforcement of these rules?? Maybe a suggestion to the staff to check the alarm clocks as our alarm went off at 5.30am in the morning obviously the previous people had set?! Lol ..otherwise a great place and handy to trams :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444540072~“Aprartment accom near etihad”~Apartments modern and clean, lots of residents in the building so doesn't feel hotel like.  Pool are nice, no glass or alcohol allowed so the idea of a wine by the pool doesn't work. Close to spencer street station and etihad, but not much goes on up this end of the city after dark. All dining/bars etc further away. Tram down bourke street to the mall, and beyond for dining etc is easy though. Good convenience store across the rd for supplies and IGA bottle shop next block towards station. Overall quite nice, apartments very compact even the 2 bed, so not sure I would stay there with the kids wanting space, but a good overnighter for football or concert visit.  Staff all very friendly and checkin/out was easy.~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_443355918~“Overnight treat”~Totally loved this place. Location isn't to bad. It's a little walk to the mall but with trams would be there in no time at all. It doesn't have a restaurant but there are plenty of places nearby to get a meal. Kitchen is well kitted out, so cooking for yourself is easy~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443008092~“Enjoyable Stay”~We enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Wyndham, checkin was easy and the room nice and clean. We had a 2 bedroom deluxe and the bedrooms are quite small but they were fine for us as it was a single person in each room. The bedrooms have no ventilation and can get warm during the night as the heat pump is in the lounge but again not really a problem for us. The gym was great and the pool fantastic. The location is also very good, there are numerous cafes and restuarants in close proximity and also a tram stop about 100m away. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would happily stay here again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_442520644~“Short getaway ”~Staff are very friendly, rooms spacious and really up to date.

Definitely my go to hotel when I get back to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441849517~“the bedroom is very small”~The location was great, the reception staff very friendly but the the bedroom was very small and the foldout couch very uncomfortable. The rooftop pool was great and clean but not enough seats to relax.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_439992075~“Nice - but missing hotel stuff”~Had an overnight family stay in a 2 bedroom. Hotel still feels new, and seems to be mostly residential apartments with some hotel rooms. Generally a comfortable stay with some annoyances hat could be easily fixed: - wifi was truly awful 3G. One device was all it could handle - and only within 5m of the wifi. - 4 people need more than 1 towel hook. Basic maths problem there - no shelf in the shower. Where would you like me to put stuff? - for a new hotel how is the largest bed size a double? That's just a bit dumb and seems cheap. For a short stay it's fine but the little things would get annoying over a few days.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438158316~“Handy position in CBD”~Have stayed here many times now whenever I'm in Melbourne using vacation credits. It's well-located at the high western end of the city so walking anywhere is mostly downhill. (Catch a taxi coming back uphill though - it's fairly exhausting). Very handy to nearby cafes too - even one on the ground floor which is very convenient when the weather is inclement as it so often is in Melbourne. It's in the heart of law courts country so expect to see lots of wigs and gowns on the streets nearby during business hours. It's right on the corner of Little Bourke Street so the nearby eating options are plentiful and varied. The apartments are reasonably well appointed but there are a few issues that prevent it being classed as "excellent". Firstly, the building is shared with other residents of The William Hotel so it's not exclusively Wyndham - just a few of the lowest floors. Lots of cooking smells from the other units in the hallways. No real view from the Wyndham rooms that are at the bottom of the 19 stories. Secondly, the rooms have a small split system air-conditioner located in the lounge-room area so the bedrooms get pretty stuffy (no windows) and you have to play with temperature settings and doors to get the air temperature right for sleeping. Thirdly, the TV remotes often have worn out batteries in them so you have to hold them right up close to the TV to get them to work. This is particularly annoying when you want to scroll through the movies on their entertainment system which always comes up first and is very slow to load. Fouthly, the usual Wyndham "hard sell" is particularly aggressive at this site. I've been to many Wyndham resorts over the last 10 or so years and am used to it, but this lot are particularly persistent: phoning you on your personal mobile phone if they can't get you in your room. WIth me that was 3 times in 3 successive days exactly at dinner-time when I was trying to enjoy myself at Melbourne's many good restaurants. So the tip is this: if they offer you "free" bottles of wine or a "free" breakfast don't respond - just run away as fast as you can. These are highly aggressive marketing ploys to sell you more extraordinarily over-priced vacation credits which you'll probably never need and end up paying exhorbitant "maintenance fees" to support. Put aside the cost of those units in an interest bearling deposit and save and earn interest on them and all the maintenance fees equivalents that you would have paid and you'll afford to stay at a much better appointed hotel of your choice - and afford to buy a much better bottle of wine than they cheap plonk they try to bribe you with.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_437949949~“Great Central City Hotel”~My wife and I stayed at the Wyndham Hotel in October for four nights. We had a studio apartment which was roomy and had all facilities that we required. The swimming pool on the rooftop (floor 23) was excellent and the views were great. The location is perfect and only a 10 minute walk to the central shopping area and the same to the Victoria Markets. Great for the shoppers! There are many very good bars, restaurants and coffee shops close to the hotel and the reception staff will happily make a recommendation for you. We enjoyed all that they made. We are returning in March 2017 for another stay.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_437015373~“Nice and Neat”~We travelled with our parents and friends, 2 bedroom apartment at Wyndham Hotel was just perfect for us. The apartment size was not so big, but it's good enough. Location is right at the central, many good cafes nearby.  Cons: bed was too soft.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_436708207~“Very central, new, modern and spacious rooms”~I was in room 323 - the room was very spacious and modern - with plenty of room in the robe for clothes and the bathroom was huge. Bed was comfortable and the TV easy to see while either sitting in the chairs or laying in bed. The hotel has essentially 4 levels of rooms and a shared pool, library and gym - all shared with residents of the building ie the hotel is just 4 levels while there are apartments from level 5 to 22 which are not a part of the hotel but in the same building. The system works very well and I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone. It is a short 10 min walk to the Bourke Street Mall and there are plenty of eating places around and a short work to Southern Cross Station - to catch trains or a bus to the airport.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_434818987~“Nice hotel in Melbourne!”~On a recent trip throughout Australia, my husband and I spent our final four nights in Melbourne. The city was quite expensive, so we wanted to find a hotel that would not break our budget but that was still convenient enough to walk most places. We elected to stay at the Wyndham and overall it was a very nice experience! This hotel definitely felt out of the tourist district and was in more of a business area (the court was practically across the street), but this actually didn't bother us as it ended up being a bit more quiet. We arrived in Melbourne via a flight from Cairns and took the SkyBus which was very quick and efficient and dropped us off at the central train station. From there, the Wyndham was a short 5 minute walk, making it very convenient. We quickly checked in and asked the front desk clerk for a map of Melbourne which was quickly provided and he even showed us some areas we might want to check out! The room itself was extremely clean, spacious, and modern. We had a small kitchen with a refrigerator, large bathroom and bedroom, and a separate sitting area with couch and TV. This really helped us relax during our final days in Australia before the long flight home! We found that we were able to easily walk to all the places we wanted to explore and restaurants (around 20 minutes was the farthest we walked, which was to the riverfront area). We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again!  Tip: Bring your water bottle to the gym and fill it up with cold, filtered water for free.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_427838224~“Fantastic apartment ”~The central location is a real winner, within walking distance of great shopping, restaurants and attractions.

We had a wonderful 3 day stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427068646~“Central Location”~We booked a two bedroom apartment on the third floor for five adults plus a baby during April, 2016. The apartment has a full kitchen and a limited view from the balcony. There was an air conditioner located in the lounge area but nothing at all, not even a fan in the bedrooms which made it difficult to sleep. We had to leave the doors open to get some air from the lounge area. The lounge converts to a murphy bed at night. The apartment is modern and spacious, so we were comfortable apart from the air-con as mentioned. It would be uncomfortable during the summer months. There's an excellent and well equiped gym and a library area for a bit of peace. The staff on the ground floor are all very helpful and friendly. The best feature of this place is the location. It's a short walk to the casino, chinatown and all the shops and restaurants close by. There was no onsite parking so we had to park at a station across the road. I own a timeshare in this hotel so the Wifi was free and worked well. This is a good place to stay for a break with family for a few days.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan

review_423661073~“Best Deal”~We stayed in a deluxe 1 bedroom apartment. Nice clean and comfortable. the laundry was free and on the same floor. Milk, tea, sugar, coffee was provided and was more than sufficient for our stay. Dish-washing liquid was also provided, I don't have to call reception for anything. I requested for porter and storage of our luggage as our flight was late in the evening. They arrange for a taxi that gave us the best deal as we had lots of luggage and there was only three passengers. Thank you Wyndham~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_422291110~“Okay 2-bedroom apartment deal”~We booked here for an overnight stay in Melbourne. We wanted to check in earlier but were not accommodated unless we pay AUD30 more. We didn't as we wouldn't be using the room until around 10PM. The room was big enough for the 3 of us but we enjoyed its space and comfort for an overnight stay. No free breakfast was included but we sure found a lot of splendid Melbourne breakfast places outside the hotel. One downside was the poor internet connection which initially charged us AUD5. Extra fee was waived after I complained at the reception desk. Wyndham is quite near Southern Cross Station, so it was pretty accessible. I would recommend this hotel if still priced for the same amount I got this for.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_422253166~“Family stay in Melbourne”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 teenage kids. Rooftop pool looks good but is quite shallow and narrow. Gym is good and well equipped. Lifts seemed a bit slow and busy with only 2 available. Rooms were a bit small for a family but still adequate. Kitchen was good but no laundry in the room, but a communal one on the floor. No bath in our apartment so for very young family may be an issue. Balcony was a decent size, we were enclosed by buildings nearby so quite dark in the apartment. Location good with access to city and markets very easy especially on the free trams.  For a relative new hotel/serviced apartment I was a bit disappointed with some of the design. Lighting in the bathroom very bad for makeup or shaving as it is comes from underneath. Build in robes have draws that you can't slide out. Couch was not comfortable at all.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_420338151~“Rooms have not been cleaned for some time!”~Good location and staff are friendly (almost too friendly- a bit pushy at times) but the cleanliness of the rooms was lacking badly. Stayed in 2 bedroom apartment (room 320) A thick layer of dust was covering most surfaces and given a cleaning charge is applied on top of what you already pay in membership- this would indicate they are simply ripping people off and not cleaning the room but collecting the money. Rooms are not serviced everyday- so your holiday is marred by having to do the daily chores of washing up and making beds- just as if you were at home- not really my idea of a holiday. Keys did not work - had to be recut. Milk / tea and coffee not replenished. Very disappointing and completely concerned about the lack of cleanliness. disgraceful in this day and age not to include internet. Almost every hotel does these days. Better off staying in a normal hotel than this club hotel- at least they clean your room everyday! Same cost- mostly less.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_420091025~“Giving two reviews, this one for the unnecessary wake up call”~So after a long day that started leaving home at 4:30am, and then taking in the sites all over Melbourne, what was needed was a nice early night to recuperate for the next days adventures. What I got was a phone call from reception at 9pm just after climbing into bed insisting that they come up and deliver some wine. No thank you, I'd just like some sleep right now can it wait for the morning perhaps.....no we come now.................NOT HAPPY. Hopefully I'll have a better review of this place once we've finished our stay.~1~nan~4~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_419275180~“Disappointing”~Stayed for one night with my adult child after booking a delux 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom apartment for what I thought was a very reasonable price. Turns out there was nothing delux about the apartment ( only one bathroom for a start), although it was beautifully clean.  When I queried whether they had in fact given me the right apartment (just as well I printed out the booking page as I had the impression I wasn't quite believed) and after being told I would be moved, and going back and gathering all my goods in preparation, I was rung by the duty manager and told it was a "systems glitch" and they were very sorry but they were fully booked and there was nothing else spare. Then he asked if that was ok!? No, of course it was not ok but what could I do? Too late to go elsewhere! At least they had the decency to take a few $$ off the bill but very disappointing. Although the location was ideal I am not sure I would stay there again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410291072~“Superb!”~A great central city location with shops, restaurant and transport close by.  Hotel has friendly, helpful staff. Room was fantastic! Clean, spacious, balcony! Everything you need in the kitchen, from wine glasses to a dishwasher! Price was fair. On the cheaper side for the city.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Wyndham Hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408074533~“Fantastic accommodation ”~This is one of the best places we have stayed in Melbourne. We have had one bedroom and two bedroom apartments and they have all been of an excellent standard. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The whole place is spacious and clean. The location is fantastic. It is within walking distance of the station, market and shops.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_406484618~“Nice new resort in good location”~This resort provides everything you need. The beds were comfortable, the staff were friendly and the location was good. The gym looked lovely and new and we are looking forward to returning in the summer months to swim in the rooftop pool!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401884732~“Weekend plans ruined”~Be very careful when using EXPEDIA for any travel bookings!! We had a two bedroom apartment booked for tonight in town at the Wyndham Hotel only to receive a call from the hotel this morning to advise they are over booked so they cannot accommodate us!!! The hotel advised us that this happens a lot with EXPEDIA!!! When we called EXPEDIA they found us a replacement apartment in Burwood!!!! This whole system is a total waste of time, if hotels allow this service to book/sell their accommodation they need to ensure rooms are available!! Weekend plans ruined!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_399884635~“Clean room in central location”~Stayed here for 3 nights in a 2 bed 1 bath room. Very clean, tidy and spacious room with balcony and kitchenette. Was given coffee, tea, sugar and milk as the basic starter which is always handy. We stayed on the second floor with no street noise but got the occasional banging/walking/door closing noise at night which was a little annoying but this place is a mixed lodging made up of tenants, renters and holiday makers. Very central location close to Cbd shops and Southern Cross Station. Also close to free trams within cbd too...Bourke St best! As a Wyndham owner would stay here again and staff were friendly at reception.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399333079~“Could do better”~I travel regularly to Melbourne and thought I would try this relatively new hotel as it looked flash on all the sites. I made 2 separate bookings months ago but for 2 consecutive nights (Thurs/Fri) due to a change in plans after the initial booking. I rang the hotel to request we could have the same room and was assured that yes that wouldn't be a problem and it was already organised. It wasn't. We had to move to a new room each day - a real 'first world' problem but you expect better. Beds and pillows could have been better but rooms are fresh and clean and location is good but you can do better in Melbourne.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_399052941~“Great Location, Rooms and Helpful Staff”~Perfectly situated in the CFB this hotel could not be better placed. It is surrounded by cafes, restaurants and within walking distance of Flagstaff train station and the free trams within the CBD. Staff are young and helpful and generally excellent. The hotel is only 18 months old and this is evident looking at the layout and standards and size of the rooms and public areas. Well equipped and clean rooms add to the appeal of this hotel.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_398728437~“Great location, no noticeable noise & best fold-out couch for extra guests”~Needed to stay in city for meetings, found this to be perfect location, loved the view over Supreme Court. Needed to stay extra night, was a pain to have to move, but they made it so easy transferring our bags while we were out at appointments. Enjoyed the extras like kitchen, lots of cupboards, foxtel & real nice shower. Would recommend & will use again.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_398664860~“Right in the CBD”~We stayed here for a long weekend. The hotel check-in was very quick and efficiently carried out. The staff were all very friendly. The hotel is fairly centrally located on the corner of Williams and Little Bourke Street. It was a short walk to most of the CBD and luckily Melbourne is fairly easy to get around as the roads nearby seem to be grid formation mostly. There are trams just down the road, shopping within walking distance, food lanes and varying restaurants in close proximity as well. Taxis are readily available and can be hailed from the lobby. What to choose to partake in is the only issue really. We had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 3rd floor and it was very well appointed, roomy and light with a big bathroom, great shower and usual amenties provided. Our internet was free and via the smart tv ... cheers :)~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_398238181~“Good location”~Stayed there for 3D2N. Check in was fast and staff were friendly. Location wise was good and very near one of the free tram station. Just 15mins ride away from harbourtown. Booked a two bedroom apartment which was just nice for us. Too bad didn't get to use their heated pool at the rooftop since we didn't had time. Overall a good stay! Would highly recommend!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396437684~“Good location just on the fringe”~Booked a 2b/rm 2 bath. Booked in, then told we had to go into the next building to get to the 7th floor, bit of a pain. Room was clean seemed ok, but poor ventilation to the master b/room. 2nd b/room very small could just fit 2 single beds in it. Overall the room was clean and had all the normal features so good choice~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_395676335~“Nice hotel in CBD”~While not on the interesting or touristy streets with food options, it's only a street or two away, making it still convenient.  It's situated near government buildings so you have to walk a few blocks to get to the more plentiful food options.  The room itself was spacious and like an apartment with a separate bedroom and kitchen space. It was clean and functional. Mine felt like a loft because it was on the edge of the building and had slanted ceilings and interesting Windows. But it wasn't a loft.  It was winter, so I did not make use of the pool.  Staff was friendly but I didn't use much of help or their accommodations, other than just staying in my room.  Overall a nice stay for a decent price in good location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_394927941~“Not excited.”~We stayed at the establishment first for one night then returning for a further four night stay after a three day tour to the King Valley . The one night stay apartment was in a great location facing William Street on the 21 st floor we requested a possible return to this apartment for the four night stay however that did not eventuate we finished up on the 7th floor overlooking little Bourke Street. Both apartments were two bedroom two bathroom as booked, the four night stay apartment had a washing machine and dryer.  In summary the apartments are overpriced for what is offered , there is no free wi fi , the bathroom only had one towel hook plus a cheap soap holder (suction to wall) . Staff were very helpful . Bedrooms are certainly not very big and the only ventilation (heating cooling ) is one AC which faces to the balcony.  Time share sales are very proactive whilst staying at this establishment . Location offers good access to Melbourne CBD / Fed Square and other locations.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_394654114~“Great rooms”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom and it was beautiful, it had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Great location - we were able to get everywhere by walking wether it was to the casino or the MCG.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_394176055~“Very impressed”~I cannot fault the Wyndham on William for service and cleanliness. All staff were excellent and our room was spotless. The location is good, with restaurants, supermarkets and takeaways all within a very short distance. I thought the decor in our room was excellent also. The pool top pool was very clean and had a great view over the city. We did a timeshare presentation while we were there and that was the only sore point of our experience. Very pushy unfortunately which we didn't appreciate.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_393777713~“Love the pool!”~Excellent customer service upon arrival and very professional staff. Booked a 2 bedroom apartment and we got the 23rd level just one under the roof top pool level! Great city views and large balcony. Very clean and modern. Small lounge area for a 2 bedroom apartment but then again we were busy during the days through to the night and straight into bed. The beds are very comfortable. Roof top pool is awesome with bbq area etc...The reception staff were very accommodating with our late check-in request with a very very discounted price given that we checked out at 2pm :). Crown casino within tram or walking distance or just Uber/Tax, 4 - 6min down the road. Highly recommend Wyndham and we'll definitely book again since we're coming back in October for a wedding!

review_392721758~“Excellent Hotel/Apartment, Great Service and Perfect Location”~Wyndham is located in the Center of Melbourne city and staying at Wyndham made easy for me to commute to so many places around including my office. Staffs at Wyndham are very kind and responsible. I stayed at Wyndham with my Baby and mother but on a business trip, I nearly felt like home. Rooms were very clean and they provided daily cleaning service. Best Hotel to stay with family.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_390629531~“Great apartment, great location”~We stayed here for four nights in a two bedroom apartment. Only one bathroom to share which wasn't ideal but we managed. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Had everything we needed. Parking was off site, around the corner, but worked well. Only two blocks to Bourke street mall and Melbourne Central. Would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_390201880~“Excellent hotel in good location”~We stayed for 2 nights in a one bedroom suite. The living room areas were spacious and furnished with good quality, comfortable sofa and chairs. The small kitchen was well appointed- including a dishwasher. the bathroom was a large enough,with quality tapware and shower. Bedroom was a bit n the small side, but the bed itself was very comfortable. The small balcony was locked - perhaps because of the season. All parts of the unit were very clean and well maintained. The A/C and cable TV worked well. While to hotel in right in the CBD area (and on a tram line), we were never bothered (or even noticed) any street noise.  Front desk service is exceptional. Check-in/out were fast and easy. When we rang to ask instruction for the dishwasher, a person came directly to our room to help. Very happy with our stay and will definitely use again,~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_390023546~“Great location ”~Comfy room, clean and tidy with friendly staff. Enjoy the roof top pool and view. Enjoyed the luxury studio and use of the lounge/library with late checkout .

review_388637338~“Stayed in Juen 2016... would highly recommend”~Had another Melbourne trip in June 2016. Great location - very close to Etihad Stadium for AFL, Southern Cross Station and excellent restaurants. Great room with a huge king bed and comfortable furnishings. Friendly staff but we got the Wyndam time share phone call within 5 minutes of booking in. A bit pushy when we constantly said that we weren't interested. Room was noisy with doors closing (slammed actually) down the hall from us. Management can't be held to account for inconsiderate patrons. Great heated pool on the top floor. 8 degrees outside and we still ventured in for a 30 degree swim- awesome. would highly recommend this hotel...~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_388083679~“Another great stay”~I had another great stay at this apartment. It is so much nicer to stay at an apartment than a hotel, bigger space. If you want to cook you can. The apartment has a full kitchen. I stayed at a 2 bedroom apartment this time and the rooms were clean and new. The staff were friendly and helpful. It is walking distance to Southern Cross station and two blocks from the free trams. Location is great. You can't go wrong at this place. Try the roof top pool - the view is amazing and it's heated.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386798803~“Another Great Wyndham Escape”~Had the pleasure of staying in the Wyndham Hotel Melbourne for the first time. We were off from Brisvegas for 2 celebrations (friends 50th and my nephew's stage show) and was hoping it was going to be a good stay. We are Wyndham members and found that the standards were up to the usual standards and was a very well appointed self contained unit. Only not was there were no laundry facilities and only 1 bathroom. Not a big issue but would have been handy. Located centrally in the Melbourne CBD it was very easy to either walk or tram it around the sites and access to a plethora of restaurants (a block and a half from Hardware Lane) to choose from. Try and avoid picking up the parking ($30 a day) if you can and try and get it each day which is much cheaper as weekends are only about $8 a day in many places.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_382351177~“Getaway”~Great Location. Great place to stay. Close to cafes, shops and Etihad stadium. The apartment was clean and bright. The staff were excellent.

review_382072563~“Long weekend away”~Just finished a long weekend stay as part of our Wyndham club membership. Have been trying to book this hotel since it opened with no luck. Room was comfortable with king size bed and kitchen with hot plates and microwave. Hotel has no restaurant despite the book in the room advising that it would open in late 2015??? Internet is available, however at a charge which in this day and age  you expect that this should be free. Especially since clib members pay ongoing service levies and cleaning fees.  Have stayed at many different hotel in Melbourne over the years and this one and would consider staying again next time.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382019248~“Great service and location ”~Great place and excellent location. Staff were ever so helpful with a special mention to Bernie. Have even booked with them again for later in the year and early next year as well. Thankyou for an excellent weekend ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381782377~“Puzzled....”~No onsite carpark, had to walk from carpark in Lonsdale St in the rain/cold. Staff informed us that Wyndham only has floors 1 -4 . Puzzled to read that other reviewers have stayed on higher floors. No onsite restaurant or roomservice. Not much of a view unless you enjoy looking at office building right next door....not even a street view. No USB ports ...you need to catch up with other hotels. No instructions for wifi. A 2 seater couch is not sufficient in a 2bedroom apartment.~2~nan~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_379523050~“Perfect for our stay”~My friend and our 14yo daughters stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. The staff were welcoming and friendly. Our room was ready earlier which was unexpected seeing we arrived at 10am. The room was spacious enough for the 4 of us, the bathroom was clean as was the kitchen and the whole apartment. The beds were very comfortable. Our apartment was so quiet for the centre of Melbourne and that is a real bonus. The pool looked very inviting and had nice views. There is no restaurant at The Wyndham but we did not find that negative as it was only a short stroll to the many eateries of Melbourne and 5 minute stroll to Hardware Lane. Importantly, we felt safe staying here and walking to and from the hotel. We will definitely stay at The Wyndham Melbourne on our next trip.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_376589241~“convenient”~convenient, - particularly if coming in on the skybus or a train, close to restaurants and shops, very new and clean, extremely quiet room , We booked a 1 bed apartment which was very inexpensive for Melbourne CBD and were given a 2 bed - Small comfortable apartment - but honestly it would have been crowded with any more than 2 people. Nicely decorated, and well lit bathroom with spacious shower - both bonuses in hotels ! Comfortable bed.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_375732839~“Great Location and Spacious”~Lovely hotel in central Melbourne across from the old Supreme Court buildings. We were the guests of friends who were staying in a two bedroom apartment which had a kitchenette, two bathrooms and small balcony. Very comfortable stay for four adults and two children. No restaurant on premises but very close to eateries & cafes. Cannot comment on parking as we did not bring our car. Staff are very helpful and friendly.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_375624611~“PUZZLING 2 BEDROOM APARTMENT”~Our family group of 5 stayed in a 2 bedroom six sleeper apartment and were very confused when we arrived to find a small lounge room and only a 2 seater dining table (see photos). This room was way too small to accommodate 6 people with only one lounge setting and a dining table for 2. We asked for a nice city view balcony but we got a view of a large office building and back ally. In all fairness though Wyndham may not have any rooms with good city views because they only have levels 1 - 4 whereas it is "The William Hotel" which occupies all the above floors. As a plus the staff were all lovely, friendly and very accomodating and the bathroom was lovely and clean. This hotel really does need a restaurant though and an improvement to the lounge/library area. Pool small but nice. If all 2 bedroom apartments are like ours we would not stay again.~3~2~3~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_375018707~“Breathtaking!”~While we didn't actually stay at the Wyndham Hotel we did get an opportunity to see the 3 bedroom fully contained apartment which was just awesome. I'm not sure what star rating the hotel has but this apartment was definitely 5 star - it was breathtaking. Stunning decor, very spacious, top of the range facilities including a laundry, ensuite and a huge main bathroom along with everything else you could possibly want if you didn't want to dine out or wanted to entertain in house including a full dining suite and cosy lounge area with pebble fireplace. It also had a balcony with comfortable outdoor furniture and a great view. The apartment sleeps 6 but unfortunately was not avaliable for the 3 nights in June that we were looking for. Next time!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374740865~“Great Hotel/Property and very large room”~We stayed here for a week while in Melbourne. Great location in the business district and walking distance (if you don't mind a walk) to site seeing areas.  The room was very large, great A/C, very new and updated. Be aware this hotel does not have room service / restaurant. The Wi-Fi is just ok as well. Would stay again as it was very large and comfortable.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_374424732~“Terrific location and central to everything”~We had a self contained apartment, very modern, extremely clean and so close to everything in the city.

review_374726329~“Bad experience”~Hotel decro is new but design a bit weird, two bed rooms apartment with one A/C (not central A/C) which located in the living room, bed rooms can't get any air if turn off the A/C unless you open the balcony(livingroom)/room window for the whole night, but bear in mind one room is no window at all. Believe this apartment not only for tourist but for resident as well therefore a lot of people in and out all the time. Beside there is a bar near by so the sat night which we stayed in 22/F (23/F max), still can hear the noise while we went to sleep (around 1am). Tried to pay more to get apartment with two toilets (which I didn't check during my booking nothing mention about toilets). Called to see whether they have it available, staff suggested we come to receptionist to double check. We went down apartment side staff refer us to the hotel reception (which located on the other side), another female staff attended to us, maybe she didn't want to help u just informed us that the whole apartment only with 1 toilet. Which we spoke to other staff (apartment side) later on, they do have 2 toilet apartment but just fully book at this moment. So overall, I won't choose this hotel again, not even with the name Wyndham.~2~2~4~2~3~3~3~nan
review_373963646~“Great location and comfortable”~We (two couples) flew to Melbourne from Perth for a gourmet escape long weekend. We had booked what we thought was a two bedroom two bathroom hotel apartment for three nights from Friday to Sunday. The room we were given was on the thirteenth floor which was ok. We had come over on the midnight flight and naturally our room was not ready even though we had emailed asking for an early check in if possible. Luggage was stored and mobile number given in order to be notified as soon as the room was ready. We got to the room a little after 1pm and the room may have been ready earlier but one of the queen beds was still in the twin bed config. We were prepared to accept this, but the door to the room did not close and even when the beds were pushed together the room was too small for the beds and the apartment had only one bathroom. We approached the reception and said that this room was not like the picture we received of our room when we booked and said we would accept it if the price was reduced. This was apparently not possible and we were upgraded to a room on the 23rd floor of two bedroom and two bathroom which did look like the picture! The roof top pool was terrific, and the gym was of an excellent standard. Despite our initial disappointment the overall outcome and experience was very good.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_373880019~“Perfect in every way”~Stayed here with my daughter & granddaughter on a "girl's week away" From check in to check out we could not fault the service. The staff were friendly,cheerful & helpful & went out of their way to go the extra mile Service like this sets the hotel apart from other establishments. Our apartment was spacious modern & well equipped with very comfortable beds. The location was perfect for us being very close to the CBD, great restaurants (check out Max's in Hardware Lane) & Slate just around the corner for great breakfasts at a reasonable price. Trams were just an easy walk away & we made good use of them. Will definitely be returning here again hopefully in the near future~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
