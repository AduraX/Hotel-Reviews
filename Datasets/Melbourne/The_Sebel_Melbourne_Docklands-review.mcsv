review_478778641~“Excellent place to stay”~It was a great place to stay. Close to were we needed to go. The rooms were very roomy and clean. Staff were very helpful at time of check in. It was very quiet. Breakfast was included with our room price and it was delicious. We also got upgraded when we arrived.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477900475~“Nice hotel n Docklands”~Hotel located in Docklands with easy access to trams and other Dockland attractions. Stayed in a water view 2 bedroom apartment. This was a large and spacious room with a view to the dock. Well fitted. Advertised as 2 king beds but second rooms had 2 singles. Kitchen supplies seemed inconsistent- obviously items missing and have not been replaced. Restaurant downstairs was convenient but while the food was ok, better options close by. Room relatively soundproof internally but lots of noise outside the hotel(obviously not their fault). This includes council garbage trucks and cleaning coming daily after midnight. Staff always very helpful.  The room we were allocated on arrival had a filthy rug in the lounge. Housekeeping was below our expectations. I raised these with reception and they addressed this immediately. Ozkan was great in arranging to move us to a new room and confirmed that the housekeeping should have been better than that received. It was a schlep to pack our bags and bring them down for storage, but the new room was better. Housekeeping over the next few days was better too. Still not as expected. Parking at the hotel is cheaper than other hotels in the area. Open car park lots available close by much cheaper though. As other reviews have said, the parking is messy. One has to lean outside the passenger window to tap card reader for access. Car park to rooms has stairs which is difficult with bags.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_476041642~“Perfect for visiting Etihad”~Stayed the weekend with my family - we attended two games at Etihad Stadium and it was very close, easy walking distance with kids.

review_475644480~“Perfect Hotel for a business Trip”~We stay at the Sebel Docklands on all of our Melbourne Business trips, easy to get too, nice selection of restaurants around, apartments are a great size and the beds always comfortable. Stayed in the hotel for three nights at the beginning of the week and again all was excellent. Want to make special mention to Ja / Jay, very accommodating and professional, offered excellent restaurant suggestions and offered map based directions, also needed to borrow a computer cable as I had left one at work, he found one I could borrow for a short time to get the work done I needed, I was very appreciative.  Will be back again!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_475479254~“Great location”~We stayed at the Sebel on a Saturday evening. The first thing we noticed was the outside noise level - music and diners. Obviously the glass is not double glazed. The apartment was bright and the kitchen was well appointed. We did find it hard to connect to Foxtel as there was no written directions. In the end someone from reception had to come and do it. The products that were provided in the bathroom were Appelles and were much appreciated. The bathroom was fitted out for wheelchair use, which is not a problem except that the shower curtain did not reach all the way around. Hence which ever way you went the bathroom got very wet which did become hazardous. We paid for breakfast and expected a good variety however breakfast was served from the cafe and the buffet was quite limited. An order for a cooked breakfast came from a limited menu. If I was to stay again I would not pay for breakfast. Parking was expensive and not easy. There are designated spots for parking but they are located randomly, not in a block, so they are difficult to locate. The staff at check-in were fantastic and were good enough to give us a later checkout, which was much appreciated. Overall this hotel is located in a great place, easily accessible by public transport and close to shopping and Ethihad Stadium. However there are a number of issues that to me don't make it a great hotel and one that I would love to revisit.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_475131898~“Overnighter”~This hotel is in a great location at the Docklands. The hotel though seems to be all over the place, and directions of where to go and how to get there very poor, easy to get lost within the hotel itself.~3~2~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_474845903~“Comfortable Apartments”~The apartment we stayed in was a comfortable two bedrooms with self contained facilities and a large balcony with water views overlooking Docklands harbour.

review_473549226~“Nice...but some improvements needed”~Having recently stayed elsewhere in the city for the Adele concert, we had another concert to attend - this time at Festival Hall, so I set about looking for accomodation. As a Platinum Accor member, with some points to burn, The Sebel Docklands was available and a mere $15 plus points for a studio apartment for the night we needed. Upon checkin we were upgraded from a studio queen, to a 1 bedroom king - which was greatly appreciated. All Platinum benefits were recognised and the room and staff were great, free water in the room plus free wifi and late checkout offered, complimentary drink vouchers etc. Room service from the on site restaurant was very nice and well priced. Why this review gets a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 ?? The car park. I have read previous reviews on this, so I can safely say I am not alone with my opinion. The lack of signage for the car park is a definite negative for me. Arrival wasn't too bad...but we did find ourselves carrying our bags down the fire stairs as we could not find any signs directing us to the lifts once we had parked our car.  Exiting the car park was the real frustration. When we checked out, the lady at reception gave us good instructions about needing the key to access the car park then using the "drop box" as we were leaving etc. We wandered out, and had no clue as to how to actually get into the car park from where we were. I ended up going back into reception and having to ask directions. To her credit, the lady came out and showed us how to access the car park - she took us through a door to an elevator that then took us to the car park - the thing is, this door had signage of "pool and gym", nothing about car park. Once in the car park, and you are driving from level to level, there are no signs to direct you left or right to the exit, you basically are playing a "guessing game". This bothers me on many levels especially in the event of a fire or emergency. Anyway, we navigated our way to the ground floor and had followed the instructions to pull up to the sensors to open the garage door so we could exit. Dropped our key card in the "drop box" and waited...and waited...and waited. Nothing was happening. We sat there for a good few minutes trying to figure out what to do next to try and get the garage door to open so we could exit. It was only luck that a resident was pulled up behind us and jumped out and used their key to open the door for us.  There were also some challenges in the actual apartment with trying to find light switches and using the air conditioner. My husband and I are seasoned world travellers and I also travel a lot for my job and it just seemed a theme of the hotel to be trying to be too "hip" and provide as little information and signage as possible. The compendium in the room wasn't really much help.  Would I stay here again ? Not sure. The staff were great, don't get me wrong....but the frustrations of the car park and some of the room issues were a real problem for us, maybe not for others - everyone is different, I guess :)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472226792~“Comfortable accommodation & great location”~We stayed 4 nights in a two bedroom apartment. Well appointed & very comfortable. Kids had their own bedroom & bathroom. Stunning views from the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the marina & Ethiad Stadium - amazing to see the hot air balloons flying over the city at 7.30am. Pool was a good size for a swim & jacuzzi was enjoyed but these facilities are shared with other residents in the complex so can get busy in the evenings. The hotel is located within the free city centre tram zone and is well served by a number of trams including the city circle tram - a must for travellers new to Melbourne - so it's really easy to get about. The freeway from the airport and out to Melbourne suburbs/Great Ocean Road is 5 mins from the hotel and there is reasonably priced on-street parking 10mins away (rather than $25 per night at the hotel). There are a couple of small grocery stores close by for drinks & emergency supplies. Would definitely stay again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472054048~“Excellent Apartment & walking distance to harbour town”~We stayed one night in a one bedroom our apartment.

review_471503599~“Spacious and Walking Distance to Everything ”~Docklands is not an area I would normally stay in Melbourne, but I was pleased to explore the area a bit more when on a business trip.  The Sebel provided a very comfortable stay. I enjoyed a two bedroom apartment with modern finishes. A large shower, European appliances in the kitchen, balcony, and comfortable living area.  The building provides a lounge with vast array of books, an abundance of areas to work, and private rooms. There is a well equipped gym, and a large lap pool.  The restaurant provides superb meals (and coffee!) and is reasonably priced. The staff were very polite and pleased to serve you.  Located within walking distance to Bourke St Mall, the DFO outlet at Southern Cross Station, and Harbourside Shopping, you won't be short of places to shop.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby and public transport at the corner of the street.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471322915~“Great facilities, good accommodation and not far from the city”~This was our first visit to the Sebel Hotel and first-timers in Docklands. We booked this accommodation well in advance as we were travelling during the AO event. We stayed at this “studio apartment” for 2 nights (Thu 19 to Sat 21 Jan 2017) during the first weekend of the Australian Open (AO). We normally stay in the CBD but this time we wanted to try somewhere else, and not far from the city. We checked-in at 3pm. I was disappointed that I was not given a room at the top floor with water views as I requested in my booking. However, as soon as I walked into the apartment, I was happy with the cleanliness and standard of the apartment. In comparison to US or European hotels, this accommodation feels like a one bedroom apartment as it is very specious and well presented. I also learnt that studio apartments are located in a different building just behind the actual Sebel hotel, just across the road and therefore the water views are very limited from this building. I am guessing that the water views are for one or two bedrooms apartments as per the hotel pictures.  The studio apartment with a balcony has all the amenities needed for a short or long stay. Even though, we didn’t cook nor use the washing machine/dryer and other appliances available, it was handy to have them if needed. What we did use was the gym and the indoor pool. The gym is very well equiped to a hotel standards, it looks like a proper gym. It also offers a tennis court and relaxation area. You need a separate key to use these facilities, which can be collected at reception. Commuting into the city is very easy. Unless you do not want to walk or catch a taxi, the tram stop is a few minutes away from the Sebel Hotel, and it does take you all the way to Flinders Station. Central Station is around 15’ walk from the hotel, where you can catch the SkyBus into the airport, otherwise there are plenty of taxis. The sightseeing around Docklands is stunning and the suburb is very walkable. There is a bottle shop next to the hotel and an Express IGA one block from it if you need some provisions for the apartment. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes around the area to choose from. The normal check-out is at 10am, but if you ask nicely, the staff can allow you to check out later, as we did at 11am. All and all, it was a good experience and we would stay at the Sebel Docklands Hotel once again.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan

review_471232015~“Location is a positive”~We stayed here recently for the F1 race. The location is ideal, close to tram stops, restaurants, shopping and Etihad Stadium.  The room itself is a strange layout, the living area felt cramped with a large curved sofa, round coffee table and dining suite for two and with this area the only space to leave our baggage. The floor to ceiling windows follow the curves of the building with large curtains. The foot of the bed was really close to the window, it was not easy to walk around, I had tripped on the curtains several times. The curtains did not block out the light from the street fully from the bedroom, falling across the pillows where we slept. Housekeeping replaced towels often. This is was the only positive for housekeeping. When the bed was made, it was simply making the top blankets neat, with the sheet under left crumpled in the middle of the bed.  We have stayed in other serviced apartments before with better housekeeping and we were disappointed with the lack of attention to detail.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471002232~“Dissapointing - especially for such a brand apartment hotel!”~We booked a three bedroom apartment via the Accor website so that we could have three couples in the same apartment and have a good catch up prior to heading out. The apartment was quite small, the balcony could only accommodate two at a time, the bedrooms, other than the well appointed master, were small and stuffy and only one air-conditioner serviced the apartment. There were only 4 towels in the entire apartment.~2~1~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_470405232~“Disappointing place for our long weekend”~We had not stayed in Docklands before, and the hotel looked good from the photos. We arrived late, and had to move rooms 3 times, to find one with working air conditioning. We complained the next day and were assured that the manager would contact us on checkout. Never saw or heard from him. The room was in poor condition for a new hotel, with grubby rugs, badly fitting sheets, and cleaning very average. we had paid for breakfast, and this was of poor quality. Mismatched plates and cutlery, very few options and the menu grubby - just like the sticky and smeared tables. The swimming pool had been drained.~2~nan~nan~2~nan~1~2~nan

review_469780469~“Adele concert melbourne”~Stayed at Sebel when going to Adele concert. Room was great. Not a huge room but designed really well and had everything we needed. Rooms were also really sound proof and we had no noise from the street. Was the perfect location as we were going to Etihad stadium. Just had to cross the road after the concert and we were home. Staff were all lovely. They let us into our room early which is the first place in Melbourne we have stayed at that have let us do that. They also let us leave our car there after we checked out so we could do some shopping before we left the city. Would definitely stay there again if going to docklands area~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469749860~“Farily quiet central apartment hotel”~Easy tram trip to the centre of the city. Relatively quiet for a city hotel. Apartment was comfortable and clean (although the very tiny outdoor deck had a lot of spider webs!). Comfortable beds, excellent air conditioning. Café downstairs was extremely busy (due to Adele concert) and the wait staff mixed up our orders; other diners left before being served. Pool, gym, spa and sauna a bonus.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469703637~“Good first impression”~This was my first time at Sebel Docklands and it created a good impression. The welcome and helpful parking advice at check- in was great and my 1BR apartment was modern and comfortable. If you are staying for a few days the kitchen looked very functional and it is nice to have a small lounge room to relax in. There is a convenience store right across the road. The tram to the cbd is just a few meters away and the docklands cafes are right on the doorstep. Breakfast is in a café next to the hotel and my eggs, bacon and mushrooms were excellent. My only issue was that it is quite complicated to park both in and out. First you need to park on the street (not always easy) so you can find reception and check in. After getting your room key then you can park in designated Sebel parking spots in a nearby commercial car park building. It is quite a process to get into the parking area and then back to the hotel rooms involving swiping cards and finding the right lift. As I mentioned reception staff are obviously used to providing advice so I eventually worked it all out. I would stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_469532479~“Amazing Stay-Nice Hotel”~I loved this hotel, The room had everything and the space, it was amazing, Location location location. So close to train station and a min walk from the water. The swimming pool looked nice.  I contacted staff before arriving about disability friendly 2 bedroom apartment and they did, the staff could not be any more helpful, Only downside was the water pressure. I found it really low and our washing machine had an issue with draining all the water.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_467087701~“Modern and functional”~Had a lovely stay at Sebel. The staff at check in were lovely and helpful. The room was large, spacious and with all the mod cons. Kitchen and laundry well appointed. King size bed was very comfortable. There is alao a well appointed gym and swimming pool for guest use. There is also a handy little grocery store across the road with a liquer license. There is no minibar in the room. Not sure about room se vice either. Breakfast is available in the ground floor cafe. It was passable, considering nothing else was open. Such a beautiful location and no cafes were open for breakfast.! ?? The only problem I had was getting back into the Hotel complex with their key card. There was an obvious box for the keycard to activate the door lock, but there was also on the door what looked like a Sebel sticker. Well apparently you are suppose to tap the keycard onto the sticker. Maybe they can make this a bit more obvious. The hotel in the Docklands was wonderful but the docklands area was dead. Best to catch a tram imto the city. The free 'city circle' tram stops close by.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan

I told them about it to the night duty staff but from not happy look on his face I told him not to worry about it, thinking they may have forgotten and will refill or refresh the next day.

review_465190215~“Apartment was clean and comfortable though located in a residential apartment block.”~Stayed for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment on the 15th floor of the Nolan building which is a residential apartment building approximately 100 metres up the road from the Sebel reception area. I hadn't realised when we booked that the apartment wouldn't be in the same building as the reception area nor that the Sebel managed privately owned apartments in a number of the residential towers in New Quay. Accordingly, readers need to keep this fact in mind as reviews may cover a number of different types of apartments in different buildings with different facilities, including wifi efficiency and TV coverage. In fact the only thing in common appears to be the reception area and the privately owned cafe where guests have breakfast. Our apartment was in the Nolan building which had secure key access to both the front door and the elevator. On entering the apartment there was a small corridor with the main bathroom on the right and straight ahead at the end of the corridor was the open plan combined dining/lounge and kitchen area, there being a long bench that separated the kitchen from the dining/lounge. Another small corridor lead off from the lounge/dining area to the 2 bedrooms and at the end of this corridor there was a small second (ensuite) bathroom. On the left of this corridor were the wardrobes and drawer space as well as a cupboard that contained the washing machine and dryer. The 2 bedrooms were both of a similar size i.e. small, and both had a double bed with bedside tables and lamps. Only cupboard space was in the corridor, in fact we ended up leaving our bag and clothes in the lounge room to make more room. The "main" bedroom had a large TV mounted on the wall (extended free to air channels only with no Foxtel). The bed was comfortable. Both of the bedrooms and the lounge/dining had excellent views down onto the docklands area and the waterfront. There was an open balcony with a table and chairs that could be accessed via either of the bedrooms or from the lounge area.  The kitchen was reasonably equipped with sufficient crockery, glasses, cutlery, pots and pans and there was also a stove, oven, microwave, kettle, toaster, fridge etc.  In the lounge/dining area there were 2 large comfortable couches, a large round coffee tables, dining table with 6 chairs and a large TV which sat on a long low sideboard. Wifi was excellent, although the piece of paper we were given upon checking in contained both the wrong wifi network and password. Easily fixed with a call to reception. There was no safe but not really required given key access to building and lifts. Ensuite bathroom contained a small cabinet with hand basin, though no plug, toilet and large shower - pressure was excellent. Main bathroom was quite large and had both a separate bath and a separate shower. Apartment was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was taken in the cafe near the reception area. We learnt that there are two options for breakfast. The first is the buffet which gives you access to the small buffet selection displayed on the table which has a choice of 3 cereals, couple of juices, yoghurt, milk, fruit salad, bread (toaster available), some condiments, mixed array of muffins, hard boiled eggs and 2 hot Asian dishes PLUS a choice of a hot dish from a special buffet menu that included eggs with bacon and sausage, porridge, bacon and egg roll, a toastie plus a couple of others. The second choice was just a single dish from the Cafe's a la carte breakfast menu. You can not mix and match. Unfortunately communication from the staff regarding the choices available was exceptionally poor on the first morning, and we were not the only guests initially totally confused. Indeed on each of the 3 mornings we attended, we were given only the a la carte menu, not the buffet menu. On the positive side the hot dishes of eggs and bacon and the porridge were very good. Some appropriate signage regarding the available breakfast options could greatly assist. We had not stayed in the New Quay/Docklands area before and found it to be reasonable convenient - about a 15 minute journey on the tram (all within the free tram zone) to Flinders Street Station or Bourke Street Mall/Swanston Street. There was an IGA, a chemist and numerous cafes and restaurants within a 100/200 metre walking distance of our apartment. The tram stop where you could catch an 86 (up Bourke Street), a 30 up Flinders Street or the City Circle tourist train was only about 150 metres walk away. The new Harbourside City shopping area was about a 300/400 metre walk away. Staff at reception, particularly Misha who took us to our apartment, were very good. We were also able to store our luggage after checking out. Overall good accommodation and, whilst not in the city, only about 15 minutes away. Would stay here again but would probably seek more details regarding in which building the apartment was located.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465170681~“Great location”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment on the 5th floor. From our balcony we had a partial view of the water in one direction and the Observation wheel in the other.

review_463059527~“Convenient location and fine for just one person”~I stayed here because it was located near where I needed to be for the weekend and because I wanted to swim laps in the pool each day. I got a good deal from lastminute on a 'deluxe studio apartment'. The bedroom was tiny, but fine for just me (I kept my luggage in the lounge). It would have been uncomfortable for 2 people. No view, but I was really only there to sleep. Although the Sebel's pool was closed for repairs, they provided me with access to a superb 20m lap pool at a nearby apartment block, which worked fine. If there are 2 of you and you I intend to spend some time in the apartment, I recommend staying in a bigger one. Good value for the price I paid.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_462581731~“Bad service,badley managed”~Reservations were made with Sebel Apartments Docklands in May 2016 from 17/1/2017 to 24/1/2017 and paid in full by credit card. A request was made that the three apartments be close to each other for gatherings of the group. One x one bedroom apartment- Mr & Mrs One x Two bedroom apartment - Mr & Mrs + 3 kids under 10 One x three bedroom apartment. - Mr & Mrs, Mr & Mrs + 2 kids under 9  Occupants of the one bedroom apartment phoned Sebel Docklands two day before arrival to check reservations, they were assured all was well. On arrival 17/1/17 they were told there was a double booking and were to be moved to Pullman on The Park and a cab arranged. On arrival there was not a booking, and was told this is Pullman on “Albert” Park you should go to Pullman on “The” Park. Not happy with this they returned to Sebel Docklands and firmly stated they should be there with our group, arrangements were then made to move back the following day. This occurred but in a building two blocks away.  Occupants for the two and three bedroom apartments arrived on the 18/1/17 at 10 am and was told check in was 2 P.M. at 2 P.M. we were told guests had a late check out and room was not ready. 3 pm still not ready and could not check because Sebel computer did not talk to cleaners computer. The lady was not very helpful and quite nonchalant at the fact that we had to wait, we were told the room was in the building next door. Was then given two drink vouchers for our party of 6, to use at their restaurant for cans of coke.  Returning at 4.30 PM we were given a key to room P1405, on arrival at the room we opened the door and the children ran into the room were they were confronted by several Japanese already in the room.  BACK TO RECEPTION Again not that concerned. Around 6.PM we were given keys to apartment 1802 and found it a 0.25 star in cleanliness, damaged fridge with door not closing properly, vinyl peeling off the cushions on the $100 lounge that seats 5 in an apartment made for 6 and a rocking tabled that spilled cups of tea while buttering toast. There was only one towel rack in the main bathroom supposing to accommodate 4 guests!! On two occasions we requested to speak to the manager, both times we were told the manager is too busy to come out of the office.  With all that we settled in, had dinner and off the tennis tomorrow.  Saturday PM at the tennis my daughter received a call from Sebel Docklands stating. “We have to get out of the apartment because the “OWNERS” want the apartment for the weekend. Not only we were told that we had to vacate the apartment and move, it was to another building again.  On arrival we informed the desk we were not moving unless it’s the penthouse upstairs, if not, ‘'THEN RING THE POLICE” Sunday, my daughter checks her account online and finds Sebel has charged her another $2,000.00 for the apartment. this is has since been reversed. The lack of professionalism and concern was absolutely appalling and never ever experienced before, I would be looking into the way your reservations are handled and the staff representing your brand! Never to step foot inside one of your hotels ever again JW~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_462379286~“Location Location!”~We grabbed a deal through Wotif and what a lovely surprise! Fantastic location in the heart of docklands, close to Etihad Stadium, Harbourtown Shopping Centre and the Star Wheel.  Our room was fully equipped with two bedrooms and the best bathroom! I made plans to renovate mine after our stay :) Quirky furnishings, very modern and comfortable, we will certainly be checking this hotel out again when next needing a room in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462157288~“Room”~The room for the price wasn't up to he standard the bed was horrible why should it be that long when I have not a good thing to say about the place and when my wife was ask about our night and what she said was shrugged of like bad luck~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461905633~“Business ”~Docklands keeps growing, plenty of restaurant and bar options. The Sebel itself is great, or would be if the rooms didn't stink of cigarettes (no doubt smoking on the balcony) and if the pool was in operation. Check in seemed a bit disorganised too, would expect at 2pm checkin not to wait another 5mins for final room inspection to be complete. Location and space in rooms has potential to be very popular.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461288042~“Great stay nice and quiet”~The room was near absolutely faultless, no complaints regarding the room whatsoever. The reception and facilities were in a different building and the pool was closed, these items were not ideal, but were not devastating.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460877279~“Very Spacious”~We Checked in for 2nights at the Sebel Docklands and the staff were very friendly. We stayed in a 2bedroom and found it spacious and had a balcony with a nice view. We were also able to use the Private dining room/Cinema room for a Cocktail party to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday which was very accommodating for all our guests. It was a very enjoyable weekend and would definitely stay there again.~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_460754674~“The 1 bed apartment was very comfotable and spacious”~The 1 bed apartment facing the harbour was spacious and very comfortable and good kitchen facility. Also, the location was good in regards to the proximity to the city and the reception staff were friendly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460749233~“great choice”~I really enjoyed this property. my room was very nice. I didn't use the gym or pool as i wasn't there long enough. I am not sure about the reviews that say only a few restaurants. I counted no less than 10 on my walk to the supermarket so heaps of choice.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_460334142~“Much better performance”~I stayed here October 2016 for leisure and it was a poor experience. This time I stayed for business and am much more satisfied with my stay. Overall, Docklands is an excellent location to stay in. Right on the waterfront, close proximity to the city.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with waterviews. The rooms were clean and tidy. We had a minor problem with the air conditioning but that was quickly rectified by the maintenance guy. The only minor gripe I had with the bedrooms was that the single beds are a little small and very wobbly. If you turn in your sleep, this gets a bit annoying. Pillows were great and each living area had its own air conditioning unit so you could have different temperatures. Each bedroom had its own bathroom which was great also. Minor issues: Entering the car park is a pain especially if you are by yourself. The swipe beacon is on the passenger side which means you need to drive up until the green light comes on, then get out of the car to walk around and swipe yourself in. Same problem when you exit.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
