review_478364601~“Brilliant, Clean, Quality, Location”~This hotel is great, so clean and fresh, everything looks great quality. Customer service was exceptional and the rooms were fantastic. The kitchen facilities were excellent = microwave, hot plate, dishwasher - everything you could ask for. Even though I asked for a quiet room, with the building going on around, I don't think it would have been possible, however, the noise did not distract too much and I loved this hotel and would definitely recommend to anyone.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478355306~“Great value; great location”~Easy location if travelling by train & leaving from Flinders Street- tram up Swanson Street. Staff were helpful, polite and willing to offer additional assistance. Good location for Melbourne Central and /or Vic Market. Everything close by travelling by tram or strolling  My room was small but so was the price paid . Quite adequate for solo traveller. Clean modern fittings . Good quality toiletries.  Everything traveller could want. Great food options in the area Construction work in the area but on the 12th floor certainly no impact I will certainly be keeping an eye out for special bargains here~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478346187~“Great Value Hotel in Good Location”~What makes a great hotel, no matter how many stars they have is the staff and at Brady Hotels they are genuinely friendly! Warm greeting at the front desk with quick efficient check in, nice smile and hello from a staff member in the lift and more smiles and greetings when leaving and returning from dinner!! Try and get that in many of the 5 star hotels and you will struggle, and I should know as I travel a lot. Great value rooms for the price and a comfortable bed.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476627326~“Good location! Great for solo or couple.”~Stayed there over the Easter weekend, price is not as pricey as other same star hotel, take a skybus from airport to southern cross station where you have to either take tram (free) or uber ($8) to the hotel, i arrived late at night at 130am, the automated front door is controlled by the staff after 12am? Took them sometime to notice me but not a big deal, check in was fairly quick. The room itself was quite small but everything was clean and tidy, but somehow there's a slight foul smell in the room which can't really bother anyone (I am just sensitive to smell) shower room and toilet is really clean and modern! all necessity accommodate for except toothbrush and paste (luckily I bring my own, but if you didn't 7-11 is just 1 min walk downstairs)  One bad thing would probably be the weird noise and water dripping sound you can hear from outside the window and the wall and also when ppl are opening or closing the door.  The location is near to almost anywhere in cbd area. All is just walking distance of you can do a lot of walking. RMIT just opposite the hotel, turn left when you come out of front door and turn right is where the state library will be at, turn right when you come out of front door and turn left is where some of the famous brunch will be at hardware st. And pretty near to Chinatown and QV.  Overall it was a pleasant stay and would definitely go back again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475817947~“Great little Hotel”~We stayed there for 6 nights and found it to be a great place. The rooms are small but adequate. Overall, it's clean and tidy, service at front counter was fantastic, friendly and very professional. Housekeeping is a little hit and miss though. Toilet not cleaned once, wash basin not wiped down once and when we first checked in, found previous guests cotton bud under the mirror. These things didn't bother us too much. It's very well located at a stone' throw from Melbourne Central. Easy access to the city and all public transport. A lot of construction happening around the hotel but there wasn't much noise at all. We would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475652549~“Nice hotel but small”~Nice hotel and cheap , yo get what you pay. The bedroom was clean and tidy with a small kitchen where you con reheat food o cook something quick . I only found 2 disadvantages: 1. The windows were locked with key as well as the balcony . Because the hotel didnt provide us the key , we couldn't open them  2. The zone is not nice , the entrance of the hotel is located in a backstreet small and dark . But if you have in mind that the price of the accommodation is cheap , is not that bad~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475503033~“Nice hotel with small rooms”~Late night arrival after long flight from the UK. The hotel is well located close to Melbourne Central station, but getting there from Southern Cross (where the SkyBus drops off) is a little difficult. The hotel entrance is also down a very narrow side street which was somewhat intimidating to walk down in the dark. Once inside the room was modern, clean and comfortable. WiFi was free and fast, but limited downloads are permitted per room per day. The room had a small balcony but it overlooked a car park so there really was not much to see. Good value given Adele was in town on that night and most places were fully booked.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_475122114~“A great little hotel”~The Brady Hotel isn't super fancy but it is comfortable with a good hot shower and a central location which provides great access to Melbourne city, trams and shopping. The staff are possibly this hotel's greatest asset and were thoroughly helpful, kind and friendly at all times.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474830762~“Hotel good, street location a disappointment”~On entering one encounters the smallest reception area possible. The staff were friendly and helpful, even working in such a confined space.  The room seemed small at first because of the odd shape, but everything needed was there. The bathroom clean and modern with plenty of shelf space, something often missing in larger hotels. The bed and pillows comfortable. No problem with noise even though our room was near the lift. The main problem (which may change with time) was the street in front. Full of building skips and the narrow footpath broken up, making it necessary to walk on the road and dodge the builders vehicles. The surrounding footpaths were constantly crowded with RMIT students, many of them smoking. If you have a breathing problem perhaps not the place to stay.~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_474284100~“Great location/ Nice rooms”~We recently stayed at Brady for a trip of a lifetime to Melbourne! Rooms and hotel are in great shape and staff was wonderful!  I'd say it's a great hotel for low maintenance people like us. We don't use bellmen or valet and usually explore the city rather than dine in. I note this because I don't think the hotel had bellmen or valet? So if you're looking for full service this may not be right for you. We loved the decor and space in our room. I'd say the only thing missed was drawers. Because we stayed 8 days unpacking was difficult. But I wouldn't have changed hotels if I could do it again. Location was beyond perfect. Because of the hotels amazing location near it all don't expect views unless you've upgraded.  I'd stay again and maybe ask for an upgrade so we have fees and drawers. LoL~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473382360~“Right in the centre”~This is a great hotel for exploring Melbourne, its right in the centre and close to all shops and bars, pleanty of places to get breakfast in the morning. Rooms are clean and bright, showers are great.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_473038279~“Close to all the city has to offer”~Husband and I stayed in a Studio King Apartment as we were going to dinner and a comedy act nearby. Room was small (not too small) but had everything you needed - bed was very comfortable and balcony was a bonus. Arranged breakfast in our room which was very nice and generous servings (only thing was the home made hash browns which were was too small for the price (2 for $3) and not very tasty. Check in was smooth and needed the windows and balcony unlocked which was handled very quickly. All employees we interacted with were very helpful and efficient. Will definitely be back :)~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_472544244~“I was Impressed :)”~Purchased a 2 night stay in a king studio room, the room was stylish, clean and comfortable. Good tv options and air conditioning worked a treat. No real issues with the construction nearby. Front office staff excellent, didn't meet the cleaners etc but they did a good job. In my opinion good value  Well done and thank you!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_472002077~“Great value”~Really good value for money, really friendly staff. The rooms are clean, stylish and simple. Loved the copper tap wear, really nice little touch. The only downside was water pressure and noise (bass) from nearby nightclub/bar .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471944177~“Very nice boutique type hotel”~Close to downtown and shopping. Boutique type entrance on side street but very clean roomy accommodation.

review_471301915~“Stylish rooms”~Is in a good location for accessing the city, although the side street it is on had building works ongoing. Very clean and stylish room.

review_471232759~“Surprisingly stylish”~I must admit I wasn't expecting much given the cheaper price of this hotel but was pleasantly surprised. The room felt bigger because of clever design and the rose gold detailing of bathroom fittings was a nice touch. The bed is uber comfortable (rare for a hotel bed) and the aircon works really well and quietly.  Everything felt new and fresh and even the bath towels were much bigger than usual hotel mini-towels! (Why can't all hotels have nice big fluffy towels like the Brady??!!). It was easy to find off the Skybus from the airport which had a free shuttle to and from the hotel to the skybus terminal. If you're not travelling with little kids or lots of luggage, this is a cheap and easy way to go.  The only thing missing for me was a bottle of water on the minibar fridge but given there's a Woolworths metro about 50m away, it's no big deal. Excellent location for state library and just about everything else.  Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469739170~“Clean, central and compact hotel”~My Mum and I booked a Studio King Suite for our 4 night shopping trip to Melbourne. The hotel is well located in the northern end of the city, not far from the Queen Vic Markets and a two minute walk to several tram stops. Although there was a lot of construction on the street, we couldn't really hear it from our room on the 12th floor. The room was perfect - we had twin beds which were incredibly comfortable, and although the room was compact there was plenty of space for the two of us. The kitchen area was small but it was great to have a kettle and a sink, and if we had stayed longer we would've used the stove to cook ourselves dinner. The bathroom was clean, and the water pressure was fabulous. We had a great stay and we'll definitely stay again!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469527988~“Comfortable, quiet and a very good location.”~Stayed for three nights on the 8th floor. Room very quiet. There was a lot of building going on across the street but we did not hear a thing. Bed comfortable. Hot water was plentiful. Room a reasonable size with a safe which came in handy when not travelling with iPads etc. Very good location. A few minutes walk to Melbourne Central Railway Station which has a Coles and Coles Liquor Express next door. Lots of reasonably priced restaurants in abundance. Gloria Jean Coffee house on the corner. Would definitely return to this hotel upon our next visit to Melbourne.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_469473621~“2 bedroom apartments fantastic ”~Great location. Comfy beds. Spacious apartments with a bathroom for each room. Views of the city spectacular from all the balconies. Great to be the only ones on our top floor as we had booked both 2 bedroom apartments. Reception had passed onto housekeeping our room configuration requirements and this was done perfectly. Had a delicious breakfast delivered to our room and we enjoyed that on the balcony in the sun. Only wish that we could have stayed more than one night. Would certainly recommend to friends and family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468977132~“Lovely!”~Perfect little room with everything we needed. Beautiful decor and sparkling clean bathroom. Loved the shower and the little balcony off the main area. Walking distance from some great spots and Taxis everywhere. Had a bit of trouble with the recommended parking because of the construction work happening in the area. Ended up parking in a Mon-Fri car park and didn't realise until Saturday when my car was locked inside. My own fault. No fault of the hotel. Made for a funny story. Hotel was perfect. Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468688889~“Great accommodation, location”~Stayed in this hotel last week. Friendly reception staff. Location was great. Only a few minutes walk to the tram station, Queen Victoria Market and other attraction. The room was great with cooking facilities. However, only one minus point here.....The housekeeping was not done thoroughly. Bed sheets not changed and the floor and basin was not clean on daily basis as well. We did feedback to the reception after several days later. The reception staff was nice enough to assist and change the bedsheets for us although it was not their duties...... Definitely will stay in this place in my next coming visit.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467938237~“Superb Hotel”~What an amazing find in the Melbourne CBD. Stayed here for 5 nights in a studio which was sensational. Lovely clean rooms, staff were great to deal with, from the reception to the cleaning staff nothing seemed to be any trouble. A fair bit of building going on around the Hotel but noise wasn't an issue at all. Next time I am in Melbourne I will make this my first choice as the place to stay.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467254095~“Overall good experience.”~Great location and very affordable. Rooms are very small and simple but has all you need. There were a few hiccups with housekeeping, as in it can be cleaner. Staff was nice but just don't expect them to go the extra mile: as in, if they don't know the answer they will not help you call to inquire.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_467115560~“Great Location, friendly staff, comfortable beds and good deals to be had”~Purchased a good deal through Booking.com and could not resist due to price and location and was not disappointed. Checking in earlier was not an issue, checking out easy. Bedroom was cosy for 2 people in single beds but for price perfect. Bathroom modern and serviceable.  Little kitchenette has all you need. A small balcony gives to a great view also. Was able to watch the Moomba fireworks from bed. Air conditioner a little noisy and water running from an apartment above noisy as was corridor with inconsiderate guests but all in all quiet and comfortable. Restaurant makes good coffee and not a bad menu but staff very loud in restaurant and clean up while you are eating, I am sure there was another time that floors could be swept.  Great Japanese restaurant next door, Woolworths just down the road as well as a BWS and alternate restaurants close by, trams not far either.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_467049249~“Brady Hotel”~Loved the Brady. There was so much construction in Melbourne but since the Brady is in an ideal location it was perfect. The Brady is only two years old but really nice. The Brady's staff was very thoughtful and extremely helpful. They were the best:)~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_466934224~“First impressions misleading”~Upon arriving at this hotel we were concerned as the building opposite it is covered with graffiti as are some other buildings in the street. The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance to the free trams and many attractions. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fine. Our room was small but equipped with everything we needed and it was clean. One thing to note is that there is major construction across the street and the workers start at 7 am shap so not possible to sleep later than that. Also, our room faced the street and garbage collection is at 4 am and very noisy and will definitely wake you up.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_466483829~“A superb hotel in a perfect location.”~The hotel is in the most perfect location for exploring all of Melbourne. A few minutes walk to the trams, Melbourne Central Station, the State Library, the shops, restaurants and bars. The room was small but perfectly fine. The bed was comfortable and despite nearby building works it was extremely quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. We wouldn't hesitate in recommending it and will certainly be coming back to stay there.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465924959~“Not an apartment”~The room was clean but extremely small, I booked what was called an apartment but was really just a small studio room with a king size bed. It was not cheap either at $225. Disappointed!!! Would not stay here again.~3~2~2~4~1~4~3~nan
review_463877502~“Good Value property”~After a last minute booking we found Brady . The property was in our price range , under $150 and close to the centre of Melbourne . The property is in a very small street/alley . The reception is tiny . Our room was very clean and modern , but very small . We had a corner room that was L-shaped . All around development work was taking place so the noise started at 7am . Overall I would say great , clean , modern room that was quite small but this was reflected in the price .~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_463463133~“One Night Stand”~I had a concert to go to in Melbourne so I decided to treat myself to a night away...I had a standard double room which was rather small, but for solo or couples it's fine for one or a few nights. The balcony was a bonus and make sure you request a floor above level 4... the view is a bonus. The bathroom modern and a great shower! The bed was super comfy also.  I would definitely stay here again if I'm coming into the city for a night out!~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_461006260~“Very clean, modern hotel in good location.”~Hotel is in a good location and easy walking to city centre, theatres, Vic Market and even Carlton, if you want. We had a King room on the 13th floor which was adequately comfortable for the two of us for our 3 night stay. Room had a very comfortable bed, well equiped kitchenette, good wardrobe space, ironing board and a good sized bathroom with large shower (good water pressure) and a great portable hairdryer and toiletries. All fittings were modern and room very clean and comfortable. The room was very quiet with great block-out curtains, good airconditioning and a small balcony where you could get some fresh air. We didn't have any meals there, as we don't like eating in our room and there didn't seem to be any sit-down facilities in what looked like a small kiosk downstairs, so we went elsewhere - Chinatown is only a 5 minute walk away with lots of other eateries in Swanston Street. Car parking, which is in a Wilson Car Park, is an easy 5 minute walk to A'Beckett Street. The only issue with this particular car park is, the entrance onto each floor is VERY narrow so care must be taken not to hit the walls as you negotiate the entrances. The hotel is not responsible for this, and they do make you aware of this "problem" before you park your car. Would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_459839320~“Great Location, Clean small rooms”~My partner and I popped down for a weekend in Melbourne recently. Normally we like to stay in St Kilda but since it was a flying visit we decided to stay in the City. Brady Hotels is located very conveniently on Little La Trobe Street... very handy for Melbourne Central and Emporium being just a short block over for shopping! Check-in and check-out process were efficient and reception were friendly. The standard rooms are small, but functional and should come as no surprise as their sizes are well advertised. We were on the 11th floor which was quiet enough and the view out from our room was quite open and not too obstructed although there is still ongoing construction around but it didn't bother us. The bed in a standard room is up against the wall with only one bedside table but was comfortable enough and perfectly adequate for a short stay. The bathroom was clean and tidy, also small but perfectly functional. Room service was good. The balcony was super tiny, but I think it could still use a little stool out there so you can sit down.  Overall our stay was pleasant. I do normally prefer to book directly with a hotel, however the rate was cheaper to book on Expedia so it seems that you may need to hunt for lower prices rather than relying on booking directly for the best rate.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

review_459013095~“Quiet, Clean Hotel in Melbourne CBD”~Located down a little side street in the heart of Melbourne's CBD, Brady Hotels presents itself with a clean image and a welcoming reception. Room sizes are adequate with comfy beds, modern bathroom and adjustable climate controls. The receptionists were friendly and offered suggestions of where to go/ what to see during our visit. Location is amazing as it's within walking distance of everything in the CBD and for a decent price as well. My only disappointment was the promised Free Wifi was only a free 256mb (any excess would incur a charge), enough to check emails but not much else. Besides that I can't fault the hotel, would definitely recommend to friends. Stayed 11/2/17-12/2/17 in a two single room~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
