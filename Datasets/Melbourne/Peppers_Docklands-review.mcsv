review_478409999~“good”~The shower area at the toilet without sliding doors, the water always drop to the outer area over there. This is dangerous when we take the bath and may be injury, especially for the kid and elder people, I suggestion to re-add the sliding door in the coming future.~5~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_478385616~“Feedback”~1. Room is clean and good size. 2. Writing desk has a table lamp located on the walkway which should install a ceiling light. As it is located next to the Coffee making table, it is too dark as there is no lighting on the coffee-making table.  3. Suggest installing a bed side switch and remote control for air conditioning. Need to walk from the bed to the entrance to turn off the room ceiling light and adjust air-conditioning. 4. Pricing of breakfast is a little on the high side compared to other Dockland's hotel around the vicinity.~4~3~3~3~3~4~4~nan
review_478374218~“Great staff, great food - interesting pool situation”~The staff were amazing - couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, without exception. As a very frequent business and personal traveller, I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and the staff were among the most helpful I've come across.  We had dinner in the room both nights as it worked out, and the food from Monami was outstanding also.  A minor downside is that getting to the pool is a bit of a mission, but the pool itself was heated, sparkling clean and had a great view. The kids (4 and 6) absolutely loved it.  Something to note also is that there are small local/convenience shops around, but they're not always obvious - ask the staff if you need something in particular.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478363275~“Not a 5 star hotel!”~If you're looking for a true five star hotel, this is not it.  Reception is situated at the end of a bar which flows onto the restaurant. All of which you need to walk through to get to the elevators for your room.  The rooms themselves are okay except for the fact that the "king size" bed you've booked is actually two single mattress pushed together which is covered with a mattress topper.~2~3~3~2~2~4~3~nan
review_478325555~“Happy”~Friendly staff and the accommodation was of a high standard. The room was large and bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel is within walking distance to everything and tram was at the door. Would recommend  ~4~4~4~5~5~4~4~nan
review_477609283~“Won't be staying there again”~Very disappointing bed sheets stained, staff rude and no overnight dining service even though it is advertised as 24hr service, defiantly not a five star hotel as advertised and not worth the $500 a night I had to pay , never again~1~1~3~2~2~1~1~nan
review_477581765~“Etihad Stadium”~Could be noisy at times due to the close proximity to the Etihad Stadium.  Sports lovers chanting and drunk after the game walking about whenever there is a game. Otherwise it is in a nice and quiet location with Tram Stop just in front.~4~3~5~2~4~4~3~nan
review_477564282~“Great Hotel, Great location”~I enjoyed my short stay, everything was great. My only criticism is the shower pressure, I like a good hard hot shower and the rain shower heads do not do it for me, sorry. The front desk staff were open, friendly and approachable, but seemed under pressure during busy periods. I look forward to staying at Peppers Docklands again soon and more often.  ~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477302370~“Excellent”~Would stay again and recommend to family, friends and business associates. Location is central with easy access to the city centre and all tourist highlights. Staff were easy going and extremely helpful.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476964913~“It doesn't get much better than this...”~From the staff, to the cleanliness, the willingness to exceed expectations, this is a property that we will return to again and again when we stay in Melbourne. If you want ease of access to trams, the CBD, great restaurants and shopping, then you simply have to give this hotel a crack. I just hope that it doesn't get too popular as it might mean we won't be able to book in next time :)~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476620480~“Would stay here again!”~Nice place to stay. Modern rooms, comfy bed (I stayed in a King room with balcony) Short walk to restaurants & tram, right next door to Etihad Stadium. Has a restaurant (however i really wasn't that impressed with the menu) The staff were OK - not rude or unhelpful but could have been more pleased to be at work i guess. Overall, I would recommend this hotel & would stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_476617097~“Fantastic”~The location and staff were great and we would highly recommend. The hotel was easy to access and staff were very friendly. For anyone that is going to watch the footy at Etihad and wants some where to stay, than this is the place as it is right next door.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476612239~“Very comfortable and well located Hotel”~Our recent short stay at Peppers Docklands was very enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The bedding was extremely comfortable and the room was quite spacious. The location is excellent with access to the free tram right outside and Southern Cross Station within easy walking distance ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476598449~“Easter Break”~We returned to Peppers after a year to find that the staff are still so very friendly and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. The room was a king room with balcony with great views over Docklands, it was very spacious and comfortable indeed. The restaurant had plenty to choose from and we enjoyed room service with a view. The Trams, (some of which are in the free tram zone) stop across the road from the Hotel and get you around Melbourne, especially the number 35 which did the City loop, you could hop on and off as desired.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476444924~“Overall Disappointed”~GOOD: nice room, friendly staff BAD: Why is there a sit down checkin desk. Completely ridiculous and awkward. I don't want a chat - just my key. The restaurant only offers a menu breakfast. Why no buffet? Impossible to get bowl of cereal and toast. The gym is in another residential building right up the back with faulty equipment. The treadmill I used kept on slipping.~2~3~3~4~4~4~4~nan
review_476333777~“Great place to stay”~My experience at the motel was positive in every way. The rooms the staff the bar and restaurant were all first class. The location next to Edihad Stadium as we were there to see Adele was brilliant, we heard her sound check both days which was a bonus.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476259965~“Easter weekend stay”~The apartment and facilities were such a surprise as it was luxury at it's best. Staff were so helpful and friendly, beautiful menu option, which delighted us and our children. Gorgeous views and central to everything, we will definitely be coming back. ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476258585~“Very good location and nice services”~We can catch the SkyBus from the Airport and get off at the Southern Cross Station and just take a 10 mins walk to the hotel. We really like the room. It's big and nice view. We got the discount coupon for the breakfast and it was very good, too.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475696076~“Great Accommodation close to Etihad”~We stayed here for the night to attend the football at Etihad Stadium. The staff were very welcoming and the room was spacious. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of storage. The only negative would be the lighting - it is practically impossible to put makeup on, even in the bathroom. I had to wait until we got to the airport because you can't see anything!~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_474333006~“Great location”~Perfect location, close to City,Tram stop and Docklands. Also close to Casino & Victoria Markets. Excellent staff - helpful, cheerful and polite. Willing to help if needed anything. Definitely recommend to friends and family.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_473504525~“Awesome stay”~So this was our first visit down under from the US. We booked this through a timeshare and was lucky enough to stay at Peppers Docklands. We normally don't spend this much for a room, but it was a package deal and we were not let down. Our room was clean, well kept and fully loaded and totally awesome. The wait staff for breakfast was awesome. The wifi was 50mbs witch was great. The cook or cooks, could learn to cook eggs but every breakfast was still delish. Denise was our highlight of our visit. She works the front as a concierge. She was top notch and beyond. She not only made you fell like you were as comfortable as being at home, she goes the extra mile. She also made a quick fix in our room as normal maintenance was not available on Sunday. We were lucky enough to enjoy 2 free Adele concerts. No tickets, but sitting on the patio next to ethid stadium. What a great place to stay, local bus and train service within walking distance. US make sure you bring enough cigarettes as local place sells them, for $36 per pack.  This location is 5 star all the way.  Thanks Denise for the wonderful stay~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473504068~“Great place to stay.”~Excellent service and a great location with trams at your doorstep. Attention to detail was commendable. All enquiries were handled exceptionally well. Well appointed rooms with great views over the Yarra.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473290889~“Weekend Away”~Staff friendly with a free buggy ride to Train Station.  Breakfast in restaurant downstairs expensive but nice.  Room needs more lighting to do hair and makeup.  Had a very good nights sleep with views of the Boltic Bridge.~3~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_473251493~“Weekend stay”~The location of the hotel was excellent with a short walk to the Ethiad stadium and Southern Cross Station. Spencer Street has trams connecting a short tram ride to the Bourke Street shops or casino.  The rooms were very comfortable, airy and quiet. The coffee pod machine was a pleasant touch.  The reception staff were very friendly and professional. My only concern and disappointment was that the restaurant meal I ordered and the breakfast delivered to my room, were not of a standard expected for this hotel. The breakfast was burnt and I was charged $$$ extra for the tiniest portions of food. My meal in the restaurant was a Asian crispy pork roll with fries. The pork was soggy and the whole thing bland.  Whilst accessing the pool was from a different adjacent building, the view of the city at night time was spectacular.~4~3~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_473112463~“Good service and design”~We are live in Peppers Docklands in 31 Mar to 2 Apr 2017. I very happy my choice is best. Your have good service. Property design is New type. But I only displeasure my room view have are big billboards. I can't enjoy my good view.~4~4~4~3~3~4~5~nan
review_473099569~“Great Stay in Melbourne”~We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Peppers Docklands. We really could not find any negatives with our stay. All staff we encountered were friendly and professional right down to a knock on our door on the first night of our stay from a staff member to enquire that everything was okay with our room. The king room we were in was of a high standard and very spacious. We also had breakfast and a dinner in the restaurant and the food on both occasions was lovely. We did not find the location a deterrent at all. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to Southern Cross station and Coles. Docklands Wharf is less than 5 minutes and has a variety or restaurants. If you are looking to get to the centre of the Melbourne CBD and Federation Square it is a short tram ride that only takes a few minutes. We actually found it nice to be a short distance away from the middle of the city. We were pleasantly surprised with Peppers Dockland and are already looking at staying there again when we return in December.~4~4~4~4~5~4~4~nan
review_473024799~“Hotel was great - poor service in the restaurant ”~I stayed here for a week on a conference. The hotel itself was great, the rooms were clean and inviting, with modern decoration. The bathrooms were lovely as well. The only real issue I had is we are at the hotel restaurant frequently and the service there was often very poor. The food was excellent, however the front of house staff were often rude and difficult to communicate with with.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473011756~“Weekend away”~Great if you have an event at Etihad. Staff really friendly. Tram out the front great to get up to the city. Rooms very modern with good amenities. Found our room quite loud as straight above the bar & the walkway into Eithad.~4~3~3~4~5~5~5~nan

review_472774556~“Great Location and highly recommended”~Great clean hotel in Docklands. Tram only across the road to get you in the CBD for exceptional food that Melbourne offers. No 35 free tram that does the city circle even goes up to Carlton Gardens. Fantastic if you are attending a game or concert at Eithad Stadium - right next door!!~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan

review_471225081~“No beer”~Lovely motel loved the room & a shower to die for. We stayed 3 nights. Coming back to our room after room service I noticed no water bottles replaced. Having gone down for a beer on the Thursday & no Carlton mid's while there I asked the girls at service desk if they could put more water in room & also asked how coffee machine worked as I pressed the button 5 times to fill a cup. I even left a note in the room about this witch was read as I noticed they replaced pens that stopped working. I also ask the service desk if they had any instant coffee as I didn't like how strong the pods were. Anyway after 3 nights no one bottle of water was replaced. Also we ordered room service for 8am on our last day & at 8:40 I rang to see we're it was..... cold when we got it :-( & then to top it all off as we were about to leave room at 10am I stopped the missus from turning tv off so I could watch a major news report on a footy story only for the tv to be turned off on us from reception lol... Oh & back to the no Carlton mid still none on Friday when I asked & same girl so I made a smart comment ( wow ran out again) same on Saturday & u wouldn't believe it Sunday also... But I did like the place enough that I mite be tempted back oneday  MAYBE~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470417205~“Average stay”~The main issue was the door made noise every time the next room door was opened and closed. In room dining food quality was poor. Staff were very helpful. Hotel location was perfect next to the Harbour and close access to transport.~3~3~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_470408846~“Friendly Staff and great location”~Even staff I was not directly dealing with were very friendly. Check-in and Check-out was a pleasure as it took a few minutes each time. The hotel is located a short walk from good restaurants and entertainment areas.~4~5~4~4~3~4~5~nan

review_470017991~“Smelly room ”~I stayed at peppers docklands in march 2017. Firstly did not not get the room I booked and then the room smelled like it hasn't been cleaned for a while. The staff were not helpful at all in trying to resolve issues. I was then charged an extra $45.00 a day for parking. I will be spending my hard earned money elsewhere next time I'm in Melbourne and advise you to do the same.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469564495~“Professional staff. Good location. rooms are average”~The staff were fantastic and very professional. The glass doors as you enter actually shut on me as we were entering Peppers. On third level where every other door shutting would shake our bedroom door and make it sound like someone was coming in. Beds were very comfortable as were the dressing gowns! Room was a bit disappointing as the pictures make it look bigger. Felt very cramped as you walked into where the bed was. Shower door didn't shut properly unfortunately. Stylish rooms and bathrooms to die for in your own home.~3~3~4~5~2~5~5~nan
review_469548631~“Perfect stay for Adele concert!”~Lovely place with just a walking distance to tram facility across the street. Staff is very warm and friendly. I didn't get to get the name of the staff who was so helpful. I will be sure to catch his name next time.  Overall - really nice bed to sleep in. The balcony was a nice to just chill out and people watch especially after the concert. Good job on the hotel for keeping only hotel guests for the hotel after the concert. It was such a brilliant system.  Would recommend this place for those who are attending a show or a sports event at Etihad Stadium. Super convieniece! Thank you Peppers Docklands. Will be back again for sure!~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan

review_468702759~“A-Dele cious stay!”~"Hello!" I do have to preempt this review as we stayed at the Hotel when Adele was in town. Therefore it Etihad was a very busy precinct for our stay and the crowds were a little out of the usual. Ryan greeted us at valet parking and saw us and our bags inside and made sure we were settled in the room (even loaning us a charger cord for our stay). The room was beautifully appointed and set out and very quiet. Bed was lovely and comfortable too. Our hotel experience was very good. I shall review Momami the restaurant separately to this review.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_468172889~“Business traveler”~New hotel but not really designed for business customer. No desk or table area to set up computer to work.

review_467948525~“Peppers Docklands”~Well presented, great location with easy walk access to the stadium and Melbourne city.

review_467927612~“Just ok”~Certainly not as luxury as what you would expect from a Peppers. Rooms are just ok but new. Location is ok but but out from main city attractions. Don't ask the staff for any sensible directions as they all appear to not be locals or have much city knowledge. Overall it is average, but above average price!~3~2~2~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467675901~“Bieber Fever!”~Our Room was very clean and comfortable all be it smallish for three, but it worked for two nights. Shame we did not have the view, but I did not ask if there was a view, will do in the future. The restruant was lovely and all the staff particularly helpful and attentive. Definitely would stay here again.~4~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_467668872~“A great place to stay in Melbourne!”~This was a quiet retreat with lots of attractions in easy walking distance: comfortable rooms, great food and friendly staff. This is an ideal location for events at Etihad Stadium, but you can also access shops and other attractions. A short walk from the Station and Airport Bus. It was very welcoming to the whole family.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467413005~“Awesome place, great location!”~What a lovely modern hotel! Our balcony room was quiet, clean & well maintained, nicely appointed & very spacious! Loved the super comfy king sized bed, beautiful big bathroom & lovely little pod coffee machine! The only down side to this otherwise beautiful accomodation was the lighting in the tea/coffee making area & the bathroom....both areas were quite dull. As for the staff & the location, both were excellent! We found the staff to be warm & friendly, always smiling & happy to help wherever they could. The location of this hotel sees you with Etihad Stadium & a tram stop virtually at the front door! You are also within comfortable walking distance of Harbour Town Shopping Outlet, Melbourne Star, Southern Cross Station & Spencer St Outlet Centre. Thankyou Peppers Docklands, we now have a new favourite place to stay when holidaying in Melbourne! We will most certainly be back!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467399585~“A little dissapointing for a Peppers Hotel”~- Great location for events at the stadium, reasonably close to main CBD. - Staff didn't advised of check-out time, or if any breakfasts were included. - When we asked the check-in staff about booking dinner we were abruptly directed to ask the restaurant, when we did ask the restaurant we were advised that a $50 per persona deposit was required to secure our booking, something I have never heard of, especially when you are a guest at the hotel.  - We ended up just walking in ( didn't need the booking deposit this way ) and the staff were uninterested and forgetful. - Food was good, quite expensive though. - Room was clean and tidy - Would only stay here again if I was going to an event at the stadium~3~3~4~5~5~5~3~nan
review_467384103~“Good room”~Arrived at location at 10:30 as per booking but was only allowed in our room until 2pm which wasn't ideal but a quick shop after a tram ride and we were back and allowed in our room.  Decent room for what we needed comfortable.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_467136029~“Simply amazing!”~We stayed at Peppers Docklands for a recent night away and we were thrilled by the whole experience. From our warm welcome upon arrival, the assistance provided at check-in, arranging taxis for us, breakfast deal but we he room topped it off for us! Simply divine! The decor was so fresh and inviting, the balcony an added bonus. The bathroom design was stunning, modern and so clean! No worries for germaphobes at this place! The huge bed was the comfiest bed I've stayed in away from home and the huge king size pillows were comfy beyond words (so comfy that I ordered 10 of those very pillows for my own bed at home!)  We love Peppers Docklands and every time we need accommodation in Melbourne it's our very first call!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
