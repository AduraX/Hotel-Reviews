review_472767002~“Would not stay here again”~We had a large room with an old spa bath that needed to be better cleaned and a cracked vanity basin. We stayed 2 nights and both of us had inflamed sinuses as the room was very dusty and musty. The room looked clean but the heavy curtains needed to be cleaned as they were smelly and there must have been a lot of dust and dirt in the carpet. The motel is an old complex that has been cheaply renovated. You get quite a lot of noise from the corridor as people leave at 5.30am. We chose this place as it was meant to be 600m from the garden show, but the walk was more like 1.5km. Web said free onsite parking but the carpark was very small and parking was only available if there was a free spot when you needed to park your car. If there was no carpark available you paid $12/day for parking up the road. There was a lift in the complex but no trolley so you had to carry everything a fair distance.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_471305295~“Great Location and Great Value for Money”~We were tired of the Pullman on the Park, but love the East Melbourne area, so we decided to save some money and try the Adara. We were very pleased that we did. The room was a good size, very clean and comfortable. Great location, walking distance to many restaurants and cafes and an IGA supermarket, and a very short walk to the Tram.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_471282853~“Outside Melbourne CBD”~this is an apartment type hotel so there is no gym, no restaurant. It's in an area with few services and restaurants within walking distance although if you're keen, you can walk into Melbourne Chinatown within 20 - 30 mins.  The room I was assigned had a king size bed and a lounge with a desk for working on. The wardrobe was huge and the room had a kitchennette with microware, kettle and toaster. The bathroom needs some work. The shower was awkward with a 30cm step up and the door doesn't open all the way as it hits the basin cupboard. The toilet is positioned awkwardly against a pillar.  The room was serviced well and regularly.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_466955190~“Not for Business Travellers”~The major failing was that there was no work space/desk in the room. As a business traveller this just does not work. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and motels over many years and did not expect this. The Bathroom also needs serious help to make it more useable - a hand basin that I really struggled to use when shaving as it was so tightly crammed into a tiny alcove in the bathroom and having a crappy (watersaving) showerhead over a corner spa bath that you had to climb up narrow steps to be able to get in and out of. Not safe and not user friendly. There is not much on-site parking available and on-street parking is not an option due to parking restrictions. They do have an arrangement with a near-by parking station ($12 per night) which was okay.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_466373677~“Comfortable and well located”~For an apartment type hotel this is quite a good choice.  Had a comfortable and large room with queen bed, couch, desk and kitchenette. Basically a studio apartment.  Well maintained and simple but modern furnishings. Friendly checkin staff.  No onsite catering but close to so many options and can get delivery.  Lovely location opposite the park and easy walk to city or Smith street for lots of entertainment options.  Offstreet parking limited but there are other options on street and near by.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464958048~“Good location”~Good sized clean modern room with microwave, kettle and toaster. Bathroom needed a bit of a refit, but everything work well. Good location for central Melbourne. Several good restaurants nearby. Lift, free wifi, guest laundry and some car parking spaces~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462759394~“Overnight stay”~Second time staying at this accommodation. Walking distance to MCG, Melbourne city, major hospitals. Renovated rooms that are spacious, tastefully decorated and extremely clean. Well designed and hosting microwave, kitchen appliances and crockery and glassware. So happy with this apartment style hotel and the plus is, it is economically priced, even hosts free car parking. Highly recommend, Jenny E~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460821250~“Bizarre bathroom”~Room 9, ground floor. Room was fine, 1 king and 1 single bed. The one stand-out: the terrible bizarre bathroom! There is a vanity cabinet bang up against the toilet (less than a hand-width distance away) To use the toilet "sit down" you need to straddle the vanity cabinet. Unusually uncomfortable and inconvenient and made the bathroom feel tiny, awkward and shoddy. The shower-over-bath was narrow and required an awkward step-up-and-sideways to enter the shower. The step-over the edge of the bath is taller than the top of the toilet seat! Who thinks that they can offer rooms with the bathroom in this condition?! For Gods sake take out the bathtub, create a square and roomy shower cubicle, re-orient the toilet and put the vanity somewhere else. Just terrible. Air con & TV worked well, bedding comfortable and felt clean & fresh.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459597446~“Lovely spacious room in walking distance of the CBD with free parking”~We really enjoyed our stay at Adara East Melbourne as it is very close to Victoria Street in Richmond and the CBD. The room was lovely as spacious and beds comfortable. The bathroom is a little dated and climbing in and out of the spa under the shower was Ok for us now but may challenge older people. The kitchenette was great too and to have free parking was also an added bonus. We will be staying here again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_457991732~“HANDY LOCATION”~Stayed here the night of the Bruce Springsteen concert and found it very good. Huge room with cooking and laundry facilities if needed. Walking distance to Epworth hospital and the Melbourne sporting precinct. Wouldn't be a hard to walk to the city but there is a tram in Bridge Rd, a two minute walk away. The only down side is car parking which is either 2 hour or permit only and the hotel charges $30. per night which I thought was a bit steep considering what you pay for the room. It was a very hot day when we stayed here and the staff had the aircon running in our room when we arrived which was much appreciated. Would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_456809907~“Great location, comfy and practical”~This is a great value hotel-motel near Bridge Road within easy public transport reach to the CBD. I like this motel for the kitchenette that is available in every room - makes life of a business traveler much better. The washing machine is also a great addition. Some rooms are better than others - but that is normal with every hotel. I like that there is no restaurant on premises - means the hotel is quiet!- but they do chargeback delivery from local restaurants or one can just take a stroll on Bridge road and bring something back. Great hotel, will continue to use it when in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_455340040~“Great stay ,great location ,will return!”~Spacious and modern living, clean with a touch of luxury. Helpful and polite staff.  We are a family of four and had one of the apartments, spent 6 days in there quite confortably. Location is great as it is near many points of interest if you you want to visit different attractions, shops and food venues.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_454343366~“Great”~So impressed, large, clean, price the best. Will be back. Also had parking out back if you are lucky other wise $12 parking not far. Room had all the little bits that makes you feel special. There is also a lift in the middle of building~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_453185492~“Great value, great spot - would stay again”~Location is great for MCG, Richmond, East Melbourne, Collingwood and possibly Fitzroy. It's a 15 minute walk to the city centre, or probably a ten minute tram ride/walk via the nearby tram line on Vic Parade. There's a growing field of motel-style hotels in East Melbourne that run at $50 to $100 (or up to $200 on peak) discount from city equivalents.  Adara is a cut above it's East Melbourne peers. Checkin took seconds and looked totally organised. The room is very modern, well furnished with good light black-out, dark colours and accessible wifi that works fine. There's no challenge keeping the room at the right temperature unlike some local competitors. The room is clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable despite being a pretty simple bed. Haven't slept like that in ages.  Barely saw the staff during my stay but the room was completely clean every day with some nice welcome notes.  There isn't Foxtel but there are all the normal terrestrial digital channels. The kitchen is a bit limited if you're looking for self-contained. The bathroom is a bit weirdly designed (although clean - there is a tricky step into the shower and a tight door so a bit difficult for low-mobility travellers) and it was a bit short of cutlery (although i didn't ask for more). But these are very minor issues and I would definitely stay here again - both for business and if I was coming down to Melbourne for leisure.  If I could summarise it, I'd say it's a very good SME Business Hotel that is also a hidden bargain for leisure travellers.  Planning to come back.~5~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445935282~“Nice place to stay”~My sister and I had one night here on a recent trip to Melbourne. Comfortable, good sized, modern room. Friendly service. About a $15 uber/taxi to the Crowne Casino. Little bit out of the cbd, but not too much that it's a huge bother.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445913799~“Good location if attending events at MCG or Rod Laver”~We stayed in an executive room which was quite spacious. Bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent. Its a shame the cafe is closed on the ground floor. The parking area for guest needs an upgrade but other than that its a good place to stay.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_442725022~“Most Helpful Customer Service.”~There was a mix up with my booking so when I arrived I did not have a room. The staff at Adara were so helpful and kind. They chased up the problem with the booking - speaking to the travel agent, before finding me another hotel (in a mostly booked out surrounding area) for me to stay at and arranged a taxi. Cecilia at the front desk was curteous and beyond helpful and made me a lovely cup of tea while I waited.  I would definetely stay here again just for the wonderful customer service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440780643~“The bed cleanliness was bad.”~We stayed on a weekend. We were not told that the room would not be made up at all on the weekend. Quite surprising. The bed had no mattress protector and the sheet did not cover the bed so our feet were on bare mattress. Huge YUK factor.  Size of room was great. Our initial reaction was really good but by the 3rd night we couldn't wait to get out. I doubt we will be back again.  We are looking for a place to stay frequently as we have just moved out of Melbourne to the Mornington Peninsula. We will have to keep looking.~2~nan~nan~nan~4~2~1~nan
review_439399059~“Would have been 5 stars”~The only reason I'm not rating this hotel 5 stars is check in was an hour late. We arrive around half 12 so understood our room wasn't ready, however check in begins at 2pm but our room wasn't ready until 3pm. I've never experienced this before and as we had anniversary plans it was annoying to lose an hour of our afternoon.  Other than that the girl on reception was super friendly and chatty. The room was beautiful, a lot bigger than we expected, the bed was really comfy and the jacuzzi bath was a welcome surprise.  Really lovely hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439328156~“Great Service. Great Location.”~We were travelling with our son and the room was perfect. Clean with a bathtub, fridge and access to laundry facilities. We were travelling without access to the internet and the staff, especially Jessica, was very helpful and generous with answering our questions about Melbourne. A beautiful park was directly across the road, which was perfect for kicking around a ball, lying in the sun or playing in the playground. Great place.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_438195112~“Convenient location, nice rooms and courteous staff”~Location: The apartment hotel is located close to CBD. Trams and Buses are available just around the corner. The Powlett Reserve park right across the road is great for families with kids and if you can walk two blocks, Fitzroy Gardens is accessible. Rooms: Had a ground/1st floor room and was apprehensive of whether outsiders can see inside but they can't. Preferably, get a 2nd or 3rd floor room. The only reason the rating is 4/5 because out bathroom shower made loud noises when we tried to mix water. It took almost a day and half to get resolved. Otherwise the facilities like in-room Microwave, crockery, large LED and on-site Laundry were great. Service: The staff was very helpful and courteous. The check-in process was very simple. However, the check-in counter closes at 9 PM and when we reached the door at 1230 AM in the morning, it was a panic attack. They have a staff member to open the main door for late arrivals but do ask the contact number and an emergency contact just in case.  TIP: Since we couldn't locate any mobile SIMs seller on airport, I was horrified when the door was locked and there was just a number to call. Have some coins for pay-phone available. There is a pay-phone booth nearby so in case you need to make a call, you will need coins. TIP: The shuttle service is on payment and goes till Southern Cross from where you board SkyBus to Airport. You may consider asking them for a Taxi in case you have luggage.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_433443559~“Pleasant Stay”~Booked a stay because we were attending a wedding locally. King size bed was comfortable and the Cafe within the complex was excellent. The downside was the en-suite. The choice of vanity was too large for the room which encroached on the seating position of the toilet. Couldn't sit square on due to our knees hitting the vanity. Other than that a pleasant stay and a beautiful 20min walk from the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430431190~“Two night Melbourne stay”~For $125 a night this was a great motel. The room was large, fresh and bright. Nothing to see out the windows but you can keep the curtains closed. The ensuite was large but a bit chipped and cracked. Had microwave, toaster etc and a lounge. King size bed was comfortable with a range of pillows. Located 15 minutes walk from the city's edge where trams are free. Parking provided too. We did notice quite a few mosquitos in the room and discovered they were coming in via the bathroom window. No fly screen and a large gap in the windows glass, something the motel should look at. Staff very friendly and professional.  We booked this motel because of the parking and not much was available closer to the city centre with parking included. Pleasantly surprised and the walk in and out of town was beneficial too.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_429584250~“I Will Return...”~Comfortable bed, brand new appliances. Staff went over and above with customer service. Parking may be small but we fitted a 4x4 VW Amarok. Location is really good. Close to MCG, AAMI park etc and close to some really amazing restaurants.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan

The room was very roomy, quiet and comfortable with a spacious bathroom.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_417031820~“Nice basic hotel”~Conveniently situated on border of Melbourne CBD. Room was nice but bathroom was cramped with an old-ish shower. Bed was comfortable and room was spacious, was all looking very good value for money until we saw the bathroom. Everything worked fine though and service was good, though because of the busy traffic, I think a bit slow. Would come back again, but don't expect a flashy, modern hotel.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_403005474~“Great place”~Nice place. Clean. But really tight parking. All in all very good. Very close to all locations.  Would definitely stay here again. Only bad experience was when other person parked their car right at the exit and made it difficult for others to exit. Nothing against the hotel. But thought i would mention. It was inconsiderate of the person. But the staff were quick in sorting that out.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395594055~“Average”~The room had a strange musky smell which was easily refreshed with opening our balcony door to get some fresh air. Good amenities eg. Washer, dryer, dishwasher, fridge and microwave plus all of your basics. Bathroom shower over very high bath potentially dangerous but good grip flooring in bathroom. The blanket on the end of the bed was filthy dirty with a sticky substance on it. The parking you have to prebook as there are not enough spaces. I was very disappointed as the parking was booked up for the entire duration of our stay. I almost walked out because of this to find somewhere else to stay however we were so tired from a long day and it was 10pm by the time we checked in.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382002720~“Nice and clean and all you need.”~Adara is a good example of how a renovation can make a big difference to a guests experience. Nice bed spreads, a small modern kitchenette, desk and mirrored waredrobe bring a modern feel to the room. A fresh coat of white paint, nice dark carpet make the room feel bright. The bathroom is the give away that this is an older building and my only comment would be that the Windows could be replace to prevent the cold air from coming in. The receptionist did a good job of managing our needs as well as the other guest upon arrival. She had a friendly and helpful attitude.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_378195842~“Pretty good.”~Agree with most posters here, good value, clean and efficient apart-hotel. Bathroom needs a refresh , and yes the shower is quite treacherous.

review_377550635~“excellent service”~We found the room to very nice, well priced and the service from the staff to be excellent.

review_375316423~“Great room, but I fell in a dangerous bathroom.”~The Adara offers well priced accommodation, close to the city and the MCG where we were headed for the football. Lovely spacious room, well lit, quiet, good amenities and quiet. We parked at nearby parking station because the back carpark was full. All good until I had a shower the following day. There was a significant step-up into the shower and the door opened only part way because the vanity in the way. When I stepped down out of the shower (about 40cm so I knew to be careful) I slipped on the bathmat floor and fell onto my knee severely bruising my shin. I'm average height, 5ft 5in but it was a big step. poor design when there is plenty of space in the bathroom to avoid this problem. Would be dangerous for kids, older people.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_373961201~“Reasonably priced excellent accomodation”~We stayed for only one night but will definitely return. The apartments are very well located close to the city.

Bad car park, you could smash your car against the walls easily, so tight. beautiful coffee shop sorta inside it. so close to the city, we walked a couple of days and ubered the other couple, barely touched $5. so cosy and right in front of the gardens, well worth it! free wifi, had a microwave, fridge, separate area for chilling, just loved it.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_371283128~“Footy Trip”~My husband and I took our two kids to Melbourne to experience their first AFL match at the MCG. We found this place online. Great value for money. 10 minute walk to the MCG. Onsite parking, however there are limited spaces. There is a secured parking lot 100 metres up the road which the hotel offers a discount for. Our room was a little on the small side but that didn't concern us at all as we were out for most of the time we were there. Comfy beds, modern fitout and impeccably clean. Unbelievable quiet. No street noise whatsoever. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. 5 minute drive to Lygon street for dinner. Would recommend this place and we will definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_362683066~“East Melbourne is pretty”~Stayed a week here. The suburb is nice and pretty. Short walk to MCG and very short walk to 2 tram stops. Adara was ok. Wouldn't recommend the room we had to anyone though but I'm sure other rooms are better. Bed, facilities etc are great. The bathrooms was dated though and the shower door only opened a short way as it hit the sink vanity. Ok to climb into shower but difficult to get out. Really poor. We were in room 45 next to the lift. The lift is VERY loud at all hours.  Staff were very helpful and professional. There is a cute Cafe onsite and other amenities very close by ( small supermaket, takeaway places) There was also some work going on Monday - Saturday in the rooms/ on the roof above us? Very noisy but I imagine this is not long term. I would recommend this place but ask to not be in a room by the lifts.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_359632946~“A great new find”~Great location for access to office when travelling for work. Also close proximity to Melbourne CBD either on foot or tram. Fantasic location in summer when there are plenty of daylight hours, I'm not sure how i'd feel about staying here in winter though, it's not on a main road, so I wouldn't feel comfortable walking back to the hotel in the dark on my own. Excellent kitchenette facilities.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

Within easy walking distance of central Melbourne and just one block away from the nearest tram, yet the location feels peaceful and a world away from the hustle of the city. Stayed in a premier room which was very clean, well appointed and had the most comfortable beds and efficient aircon, I slept excellently.

The cafe downstairs offers breakfast where you can choose from a bacon and egg burger, raisin bread or croissants with tea, coffee, orange juice or water. There are also tennis courts opposite and Hisense Arena is nearby too. For the price it is reasonable accommodation which offers value for money~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_347084796~“Perfect hiding spot just out of the city”~Stayed here for 10 days when I first moved to Melbourne the staff were very helpful, house keeping was prompt and they even offer free parking not that I had a car at the time. Very close to Melbourne Cbd with good amenities and public transport options all within walking distance. Fast food and supermarket options all within 5 minutes walk. Would recommend this to short term and long term travellers very large comfy bed with basic cooking amenities.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_344854480~“Clean but aging”~I stayed overnight with my 6'5" son so we required separate beds. This the Adara could accommodate -- unlike most of the Quest apartments.  The free off street parking is minimal and East Melbourne offers very little free parking so best avoid it if you have a car.  We were in a level 1 room -- could only just open the aging windows for fresh air. Certainly wouldn't have wanted to be on the ground floor.  The apartments have undergone significant renovation and the rooms are light, tastefully decorated and well appointed, but the old bones of the building are inescapable. The bathroom -- whilst adequate had the shower over the bath which was very small and almost impossible for my son.  As we always travel to Melbourne with a car -- we won't stay here again. Otherwise it is really very central to all that the city has to offer.  Jasmin at reception was a delight!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342278663~“Leave the car at home!”~Looking for value for money accommodation in this part of the city you could do worse than the Adara. It is a handy location to several hospitals, the MCG, and the Bridge Road outlet shopping precinct. Having stayed here now twice in the past year, the highlights are the easy walking distance to the city, the convenience of a late night supermarket nearby and amazingly friendly and keen to please staff. For anyone with young children, there is a park with a playground across the road. The bed was comfortable. The room was large. The bathroom was clean. Wifi was free and reliable. However, there are many small things that could be improved. General maintenance seems to be an issue. For my last stay I left a long list of items that needed attention– blown lightbulb, loose toilet roll holder, powerpoint which did not work, chair with broken spring making it impossible to sit at the desk to do work etc. Perhaps these items had accumulated over time, and the blame should instead lie with previous guests who had not reported any problems?  The bathroom had louvre windows that could not be closed, and this would potentially be very cold and drafty in winter. It also meant that street noise carried into the room loudly. My wish list therefore includes redesigning the bathroom windows.  Finally, I had initially chosen the Adara because of its free car parking. However, my recommendation would be to leave the car at home or park elsewhere. Parking is limited, and on a first in basis. Depending on the size of the cars already present, it may be impossible to access the remaining car parks. During my stay one car had its rear vision mirror side-swiped to the point where it had dislodged completely.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336794314~“Reception staff great, but place in general rubbish.”~Stayed at the Adara East Melbourne complex last night as we were attending the Big Bash. Photos and all look great but to see in general is very disappointing. To get up to the bedroom to find an ant size bathroom and toilet area, your shoulders are literally wall to wall, and then to goto sleep and find we were sleeping on to King singles (meant to be Full King Size as paid for!) joined together so we were sleeping in a crack all night. I believe we would have had 2 hours sleep for the whole night if it wasn't for people slamming doors, banging walls, and talking loudly. Very convenient in other cases as a quick stroll to tram stops, MCG or the bottle-o. In terms of their refurbishments looking at the insides. There is some great features to the rooms, but is also some very rushed revamped areas which do stand out. Recommendations to everyone else. Spend the extra money, stay elsewhere so you have a comfortable sleep and stay. I won't be back ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_334304004~“Wonderful stay”~we visited to Adara in Dec 2014 first week and found this accommodation real cozy and comfy.  Adara is well. Connected by sky bus service from Melbourne airport and bus drops you like 200 meter from the hotel and pick up. From there as well.  Staff was very helpful and prompt if any thing needed or asked.  The very best highlight is its just opposite two big gardens and that give you a feel that you are away from city even when you are in city.  Most of attractions are either walking distance or very well connected by transport.  Most of the tour operators are familiar with the place and pick you from hotel.  All in all a great stay and highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_332366076~“Great Rooms - Even Better Service”~1) Superior King Room - Rm# 16. 2) Premier Room - Rm# 39. This was a short weekend stay. I have to say, the customer service from the first phone call to checking out was fantastic! The best service I've experienced in all of my travels. A third party website was offering the accommodation at a slightly cheaper rate than Adara themselves, so the total rate for three nights was reduced by $15 below the third party rate. The hotel is small, with only about 50 rooms. The hallway is narrow and the car parking facility is extremely small. If you wish to use the first in first serve carpark, hire a small car. Even if you feel you're the best driver/parker in the world, use a small car. Your life will be easier. Rm# 16 - The first room was a great size with ample lighting - natural also. The rooms had been recently refurbished so the decor was modern, clean, and inviting. The beds were very comfy, with wonderfully cold AC split system. Plenty of wardrobe space, as well as room to live out of your suitcase if preferred. The kitchenette had no sink, you had to use the bathroom sink - A slight negative.  The bathroom hadn't been refurbished. The tiles were fine, but the grout needed cleaning. The bathroom was fairly spacious with good ventilation. The window could also be opened if needed. The water pressure was very strong, almost too much. It was hard to get a happy medium with the water temperature and the pipes not squealing. Shower was also extremely slippery - request a bath mat. This room is on the ground floor and looks out on the very small, cramped carpark. Make sure you close your blinds at night and only slightly open the bathroom window, so none can see in. The laundry flooded the last day of our stay - across the hall from our room. We were out and received a phone call to notify us of this and that they needed access to our room to assess the flooding. They advised they'd upgrade us to a premier room at no charge. Luckily, our suitcase was on the ottoman, so there was no damage to our items. We were also offered free breakfast, but couldn't accept as our flight left too early. Rm# 39 - This room was on the top (2nd) floor overlooking the carpark. The king bed wasn't as comfy as the original room; you could tell one of the king singles pushed together was slightly higher then the other. This was the only negative. The kitchenette had a sink this time, much better when cleaning dishes. The rest of the room is reflected in Rm 16's review. NB: - This is a hotel with a small cafe at the front. There are no other facilities like a gym or pool. - If you can't find parking at the hotel, they have a deal with TriBeCa a short walk up the road, at $12p/n. It's an open carpark but is policed like street parking. You need to obtain a ticket from the hotel front desk first. - Parking on the road (park side) is free from 10pm - 9am each day. We did this mostly. Parking on the road (hotel side) is only 1hr parking I believe. - There is a lift in the hotel. It takes forever! Just use the stairs for the time you have no luggage. Location of the hotel is slightly out of the CBD. It's a short walk to a tram stop which would take you directly to the CBD, so no issues for those without a car. There is no front desk after 10pm. You're provided with a security PIN for entering the property after this time.  There's Hungry Jacks, Fish & Chips, a small grocery store etc just around the corner. I couldn't find many late night dining options within walking distance though. Most cafe's closed around 8/9pm. I'd definitely stay here again, but would hire a small car for easy manoeuvring. 5 big whopping gold stars for customer service - thoroughly impressed!~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_331972093~“Great find”~From the city, pleasant walks through Fitzroy Gardens and Treasury Gardens has you at this clean, spacious apartments in a quiet, lovely neighbourhood of Melbourne. I was lucky enough to get a room overlooking the gardens. A small shopping centre is close by with wellstocked small supermarket. Also on site is a small cafe with terrace for enjoying breakfast - I can recommend the bacon and egg brioche. The accommodation was at a good price for being close to the city.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
