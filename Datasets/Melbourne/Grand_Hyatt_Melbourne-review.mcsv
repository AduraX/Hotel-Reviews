review_478395526~“A 2 night stay with Luxury Escapes deal”~Partner and I stayed two nights last week, after buying a deal featured by Luxury Escapes. It just fitted nicely with times we wanted to be in Melbourne. The deal was 2 nights in a King Club room, with access to the club facilities on 31st floor. This included a breakfast for two, tea and coffee and biscuits during the day and after 6pm wine, beer and plenty of food until 10pm. We couldn't really take much advantage of this club as we were dining with friends and then doing concert things. But it all looked good. Breakfast was all that one could need, but only one type of eggs per day, we scored poached on one day and scrambled the other, no complaints. The room was comfortable, nice bed but the doona was a bit thick which made for a hot sleep. Nice black and white marble tiled bathroom, with a seperate shower and bath. The view from the 31st floor room was ok, but not expansive, as it was on the back side of the curved building, but we did see over the river, up near the sports stadiums. All up a pleasant stay. The deal included a free welcome cocktail and a $50 voucher for hotel spending. Also free valet parking which a friend used while we went to a concert at the Hamer Hall.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_451628831~“A Great Week in Melbourne.”~We were on holidays and planned to do many day excursions to the Great Ocean Road, Dandenong Ranges, and Puffing Billy. Plus see some shows, and enjoy some delight Melbourne Restaurants. The hotel is excellent. Great location for our morning walk along the Yarra River. Our Concierge Violet was outstanding . She was relentless to find us a great Melbourne Restaurant on short notice.  Also, the hotel hairdresser is excellent. Only disappointment were the staff in the hotel dining room. Not interested in going that extra mile for customers. Management need to take responsibility for this and train them to understand the value of warm and friendly service as would be expected from any international 5 Star Hotel We will be back.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_478258104~“Top notch but.....”~Stayed for a total of 9 nights spilt 6/3 in different but similar rooms (King with View). Not sure if the AUD$20/night upgrade is worth it since I never saw the view from a regular room.  The Hotel lives up to its name. It's definitely Grand and everything you would expect from a world class 5 star.  Pros: -Roomy Bathrooms -Discrete in room lighting -Window partial and full black out shades  -Large Gym (largest Hotel Gym is southern hemisphere but it is open to the public)  -For a price, good views of Southbank and the Yarra -Nice bedding -Clean Cons: -Noisy (some floors double up as maternity nurseries so avoid them if you're after a quite stay) -Elevators only work with room keys which gets tiresome after a while -Lightweight beds that easily move around. Note to management: it's all about the beds! -Some toilets remain flushing longer than usual  -Answering machine leaves a lot to be desired.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_478155431~“Staycation”~We really do like the Grand Hyatt Melbourne. The hotel is quite central in the city so just about everything is either a short walk or tram ride away. Our room this time was on the 20th floor which overlooked the city (nice view), the king sized bed can be so spacious. Another favourite is Ruco the bar at the Grand Hyatt, we like to go there for pre drinks. The breakfast at Grand Hyatt is also something to try, there is so much to choose from and has the quality that you would expect from 5 star hotel .  The only issue I found was that our clock radio had frayed and exposed wires, which will be brought to Grand Hyatt's attention.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478139826~“Almost 5 star .... but not quite ”~Just returned from a 2 night luxury escapes package. As promised smooth check in and all vouchers presented in an envelope making it a genuine deal. Valet parking a highlight as a cheery jimmy welcomes us. The rooms are pleasant. Not really city views when you are looking into a building but great windows and city lights nonetheless. Great amenities and excellent bathroom. Attempts to support the environment emerging.  Club lounge great fun from 6-8 , variety of canapés, ample seating, wine/ beer spirits flowing and friendly attentive staff Breakfast also great variety, staff still friendly and smiling if slightly struggling to keep the food and crockery up to the hungry patrons. All day drinks and a few biscuits available  A few glitches. Neighbours smoking and ordered or cooked smelly food . We were immediately shifted when informed staff. A massage was exceptional ( thanks masseuse) but to be expected to enjoy a RELAXATION massage with children and parents enjoying the pool right outside therapy room totally ridiculous. Was offered after providing some constructive criticism a50% reduction but needed to remind them at checkout. Please ensure these communications occur it matters to the customers and leaves us feeling awkward to have to retell the story of less than acceptable service. Also receiving a reminder to checkout at 11 when we had a 2pm checkout both disturbing and awkward.  Staff were pleasant and friendly throughout the hotel and such a great end of town to enjoy the Melbourne nightlife  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478131285~“Luxury hotel”~Hard to fault this one. Rooms are small but luxurious, as is bathroom. Restaurants are great, bars are good. Walking distance to everything. Staff are very respectful, and efficient. Doormen are friendly. Bit expensive, but worth the extra for a bit of luxury. Great beds, and good view through large windows!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478124899~“Noisy, busy - with so much choice try elsewhere”~Third Grand Hyatt I have stayed at in the last 12 months and none have been a great experience.  Booked club suite which was large and had excellent rooms, but very badly designed in terms of use of space. Bathroom was really quite small and really only suitable for one person. Single wash hand basin and tiny, weak shower that was difficult to regulate temperature. Two sitting areas (?why), one in bedroom and one in lounge. Walk in robe really small with three lose, small drawers the only storage for clothes. Main problem was the noise, with apparently no sound insulation between floors. Woken first night at 02:30 by loud footsteps directly overhead. This continued though-out night, with flushing toilet, running bath, etc clearly audible. Different guest next three nights but woken each morning at 05:30 or so with bathroom noise. Lifts were another major problem: constantly lost your floor number and even when full would still stop at every floor and then mysteriously not go at all or then move in opposite direction. Gym was good but small, very warm pool not suitable for lengths and only opened late on Saturday am due to late arrival of staff.  Club lounge nice but very busy most of the time and standing room only on Saturday evening: had to just walk away as no where to sit or even rest against a table. No ive available in morning or during day. On check out was, perhaps wisely, not asked about my stay.~2~nan~nan~1~3~nan~2~nan
review_477859685~“Great location”~The hotel is conveniently located in the center of the town. It's a nice area. And a lot of cafes & restaurants around. The bedroom & bathroom is large, clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477822638~“Beautiful Luxury Hotel On Point Location”~We stayed here for the first time recently and were so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rooms and staff. At check-in they asked what was the occasion for our stay and told it was my birthday they awarded us lat check-out wand gave us a beautiful city view room to watch the sunset. After entering our room a staff member rang the doorbell and gave us apples (did have a giggle at this but a lovely gesture). The bathroom was nice and styled very well. We had a lovely nights sleep in the comfy bed. The day after we realized we'd left something in the room and the housekeeping staff were fantastic at arranging to put it in lost property. Upon collection of the item even the valet staff were lovely. The best part of this hotel is it is located near some of Melbourne's best bars and restaurants! Just around the corner in Flinders/ACDC lane. Would stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_477818954~“Great family stay with good location”~The Grand Hyatt had a great location (next to Louis Vuitton store, close walk to Bourke street, China town and other locations including the free tram lin) The venue was also beautiful, dimly lit and clean. The free wi-fi was fast and easy to access  The service was excellent with friendly staff, accommodating as well to our family with providing a cot, arranging a pram and providing us with recommendations.  The great service goes for all staff, including those positioned outside who helped us with calling taxis as well as helped with our bags at all times.  The room amenities meant we barely had to bring a lot of items from home.. The room we stayed in (King room facing city) was large enough for me, my husband and toddler with good space that fit a small 2.5 seater lounge with a round table so it was easy to sit together when eat breakfast. Even though it faced work buildings, the view (level 11) was great and we could even see hot air balloons out the large window. Also, the marbled bathroom looked amazing. The hotel rate here was a lot cheaper than what we see for comparative hotels in Sydney (we paid $225 per night during Easter holiday at the Grand Hyatt) so for us, given its star rating, service and location, this hotel was value for money. We definitely recommend this hotel no matter what purpose the stay.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_477681531~“Great Hotel ... possibly the pick of the CBD offerings”~Having stayed in the 5 top hotels in the Melbourne CBD over the last 7 months .. the Hyatt is the best of the bunch with the only negative being the size of the pool  Good food, great service ... top hotel  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477390304~“Brilliant hotel; close to shopping, tours and tourist information.”~We used Luxury Escapes to stay three days in a king club room and enjoyed it so much we stayed an extra day. Excellent hotel, staff, room, food and location. The location enabled us to access trams for travel around the city and walks along the Yarra River. Day trip to the Phillip Island penguins was recommended by the concierge which proved to be well worth it especially as we went to the Phillip Island Circuit as a bonus.  Your photo of the hotel gives you a good idea of what it looks like.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477270412~“Great Location”~The Grand Hyatt Melbourne sits graciously next to the Louis Vuitton retail store on the corner of Collins street. It is therefore beautifully positioned in one of the more desirable blocks of the Melbourne CBD. For this visit we had interconnecting rooms for our family which worked well for our family of four however, the noise during the night from other rooms meant that their was an interupted sleep. The hotel is noisy and occupants of the rooms can be heard easily between the walls. On the upside though, Collins Kitchen serves an incredible array of delicious food and wine and we hosted a dinner that was a great success due to the standard of the both the cuisine and service delivery. The other lovely aspect to the Grand Hyatt is the abundance of casual and intimate seating spaces dotted around the hotel which promotes meeting up with friends a breeze. Overall, a good choice for a city stay.~4~3~5~2~4~5~4~nan
review_476986491~“Overall, excellent.”~Stayed during the Easter long weekend for the Melbourne Comedy festival. The efficiency of the staff to make check in and check out swift and welcoming.

review_476937541~“Great Easter Long weekend stay”~Nice and clean hotel, staff were friendly the entire time and accommodating towards us with all requests (cot and pram for the duration of our stay) The hotel is centrally located so you only need to walk for food, shopping outlets, 7Eleven, free tram line. We were also able to walk to a beautiful burch nearby- St Patrick's Cathedral for Easter Sunday mass and it only took 5mins. We took up the recommendation from hotel guest book and went to Gazi for a birthday dinner (George Colamabris street Greek food restaurant which was just 5 minute walk; the recommendation was good as the place, atmosphere and food were excellent (and even cheap-$115 for 3 adults and a toddler including wines/beers).  Overall a very pleasant stay and kI would return again~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan

review_476679493~“Excellent stay”~The hotel is extremely well located in CBD, within walking distance of almost everywhere, rooms are not very big, but specious enough to add. a rollaway bed without any problem, breakfast excellent with plenty of choices (I recommend the EGGS BENEDICT made to order), the only remark, is a very poor choice on A LA CARTE MENU for lunch. Otherwise faultless performance, a secure choice for a stay in Melbourne.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476312565~“A Great Weekend”~Our daughter booked a Luxury Escape package to celebrate our granddaughter's birthday and invited us to join them. I was very impressed with the whole weekend. We were there over Easter and stayed in a club room. These are reasonably spacious with a large very comfortable bed, a well positioned comfortable couch by the window with a good size round table, a large marble bathroom with a bath and separate shower, and fabulous views over Melbourne. The club lounge was large, comfortable and provided a small but excellent quality selection of food for breakfast and canapés in the evening. These are all important but the thing that put this hotel over the edge was the quality of the staff. From the smiling happy face of Jimmy and the other men on the front doors to the reception staff and finally Jessica and the staff working in the club lounge. They were all friendly and personable and did not make you feel like a guest but a welcome friend. Every staff member we met wished my granddaughter a happy birthday and even sang to her that night. The bar staff gave her a plate with small cakes and a candle when we went there for a drink. This made the whole occasion very special for an 8 year old and her family. I think the hotel can be very proud of how the staff conducted themselves and no matter how good the facilities this is what makes people return.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476242357~“Very disappointing”~Our 2nd visit back here and unfortunately nothing has changed, service etc is below average and cleanliness of the rooms, they obviously have cut back on staff in the bar and at breakfast and for an expensive hotel this hotel does not live up to standard~2~nan~4~nan~nan~1~1~nan

review_475178967~“Lost me as a guest. ”~Grand Hyatt has lost me as a guest due to the terrible customer service and the hotel with no idea of what is happening, with a long email trail and not willing to help me. I am shocked the way i was treated as a loyal return guest and a hotel member. You would expect being a return guest and a hyatt member they would go out of there way for you, but no its not about service its all about money. The staff came across rude on emails and was told different things from different staff as per them not knowing what was going on. I stay in a lot of hotels and have never come across this, the little boutique hotels would do anything for there return guests but not the hyatt they just care about money. Also Indya the assistant manager is very rude also with no customer service skills, ive read from previous reviews she hasn't treated people very nice. Time to go to another chain.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We booked Attica for one night and the rest of the time, let her guide us.  The hotel's location is perfect and let's you access all sorts of neighborhoods. The club lounge is well-appointed and the staff is there to please. Overall, we haven't had this nice of a stay in a Hyatt since the Hyatt Regency and Park Hyatt in Tokyo.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

Most CBD offices are a short walk away and the free city circle tram runs just past the front door. Rooms are spacious, updated and comfortable. Staff is professional, courteous and efficient. I found the hotel concierge to be especially helpful. I was here on a weekend layover during the middle of a two week business trip and she was able, with short notice, to book me on a winery tour to Yarra Valley with a small group. I had failed on my own. It was a very enjoyable way to spend a cold, rainy day. The bar turns out excellent cocktails and, unlike most hotel bars, does not gouge guests on prices.

review_472014780~“Its the thought that counts”~Grand Hyatt is centrally located at the corner of Collins and Russell Streets and is just a decent one wood drive from Federation Square. The hotel's reception is minimal but efficient and if one is fortunate to have access to the Gold Club room on the 31st floor then your stay at the Grand Hyatt really begins. The staff are pleasant and efficient and the facilities are fantastic. From the well presented breakfasts to the evening canapés there is nothing to be desired. The chef does something different each day and from a personal experience where we needed gluten free foods, the chefs went over and beyond to prepare attractive and different foods each evening not to mention the wonderful staff who waited on us hand and foot. The bedrooms were comfortable and the bathrooms were large and well stocked with all amenities. However all of this comes at a price but to us was well worth it. When they heard that we were celebrating joint 71st birthdays, cocktails appeared from nowhere and a bottle of Champers was delivered to the room.

I would highly recommend this hotel. I used my World of Hyatt points for the stay so it was great value.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_471510064~“Comfortable hotel”~Stayed for 2 nights on business trip. Room is clean and bed is comfortable. Location is good for reaching many sites. Few streets away from Chinatown and walking to central shopping is about 10-15 minutes. If you coming from Flinders Street station, you might need to walk up a slight sleep slope to hotel.  I took the Skybus from airport and transfer for a free hotel shuttle at Southern Cross station and that takes about 1 hour. Buy a return Skybus transfer at $36.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471502201~“Excellent place to stay”~We stayed there 6 days for F1. Location is good and room is clean and tidy. Staff is helpful in suggesting where to eat esp Craig. He is very familar with F1 transportation arrangement that helped us a lot.~5~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_473305871~“Grand Hyatt escape”~We thoroughly enjoyed our two day escape and were treated extremely well by all of the staff. The Club Lounge was brilliant and allowed us to recharge our batteries. The views over Melbourne were wonderful and the relaxed atmosphere and availability of snacks and drinks throughout the day was exactly what we were seeking for a bit of chill time. We left behind something valuable to us and the staff had in safe and sound, then were amazing in their response to package and return it....a very big thank you. Stuart~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471394774~“Right in the center of all Dining, and Entertainment”~I've now been three times to Melbourne and this is as good as my other stays. You are walking distance from all the top chic restaurants in the area. High-end shopping is just footsteps away from the hotel entrance. One block away you have the theater. I have to say, it's all nearby. Great service from the minute you arrive. The Guest priority lane surprisingly moves very quick. We only encountered two issues (one of them was out of their control). Constant construction in the area nearby can be troublesome if you are a late sleeper. The only other issue was the proximity of the bathroom of the next door room. The plumbing buts up to our bed, so you heard everything in the bathroom next door. We had a corner suite so maybe it was only an issue to our room. But it's annoying if you are sleeping and the guest next door flushes the toilet at 3AM or showers at 5AM. Breakfast at the Lounge is acceptable, a bit more warm options would have been nice.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_471324048~“Average for the price”~To start with the positives: the public areas of this hotel are very stylish. I also loved the Collins Kitchen, which is amongst the best I've experienced for breakfast - and it does a nice lunch too.  But I was disappointed by the room: relatively small, and with a duff choice of furniture that didn't feel like a luxury hotel - especially considering the inflated F1 season price. Service was distinctly average too. Very long waits for coffee at breakfast; an odd incident at lunch with a guest in which the waiting staff insisted a pink fish was snapper and a white fish was salmon; a concierge service in which they booked a restaurant for the wrong number of people at the wrong time; and a number of other small lapses, including failing to send the final bill by email. Wifi became very slow during F1 weekend too, presumably because everyone was online. Overall, it was ok as a place to stay - but I'd hope to do better if I went back to Melbourne.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471222039~“Sure...i'll be back❤”~I stayed for 4 nights for F1 Grand Prix Melbourne with other 15 colleagues, and i had my room on the 29th level facing the yarra river...view was awesome. I love the hotel location which is just few steps from many famous cullinary, shopping and historical building spots. Good service from the staffs and even they gave us (16 rooms) early checked-in 2 hour before the checkin time.  Quick check in and out procedures. Nice stay and will be back on the next visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471298384~“fab hotel”~we stayed here for the grand prix and afl game so good position to go to both. loved the comfort of the hotel, huge gym, a couple of bars to choose from, good social areas. the room was good with super comfy beds and pillows, good blackout curtains for a fab nights sleep! only let down was, I had asked for a quiet room away from lifts, our room was 3 doors from the lift which didn't impact our stay but our room was opposite the doors to the housekeeping room which was noisy with them banging the double doors open with the cleaning trolleys and food trays etc. if I had known this upon check in I would have requested a room change but didn't know till after I had unpacked.

review_471001185~“Comfortable”~I came for business and stayed 2 nights. The concierge is friendly and efficient, recommendations from the Collins Kitchen are fantastic and welcomed. Rooms are clean with acceptable amenities (few pictures as reference). I do support the energy saving policy by not overuse the towers one of the brilliant move with minimum impact of leisure. Recommendation: Hopefully the kitchen could run a bit later 22:00 is way too early~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_470801090~“What's so Grand?”~As a Melburnian, I like to use my FlyBuys points to experience hotels in our home town. We have stayed at The Langham (my favourite) and the Sofitel (next favourite) several times depending on availability. This time I thought we'd try the Grand Hyatt for a change - and am so sorry I did.  The hotel has a masculine, 'cold' feel about it - unlike the Sofitel and Langham which are both very welcoming. I booked the 23rd Grand View room - yes, an impressive view of Melbourne - which (at $450 equivalent) was very disappointing. The room looks worn, tired, and I was not impressed when I saw a hair on the table, which really looked unclean. So much so, I wiped it myself with tissues and my hand disinfectant. I requested another room but was told they had a full house. This is the tail end of the Grand Prix and the beginning of the Comedy festival - so it's a very busy period in Melbourne. Incidentals, like providing only one robe in the cupboard (but two slippers) and one English Breakfast tea bag. And the windows were filthy; look like they have not been cleaned for a year - or more ! The dark furniture in the room also looks tired and I think a refresh is due! On the positive side, the block out blind and curtains help the sleep patterns - although it is surprisingly noisy with people walking around in the next level and the corridor. Strongly suggest you do your homework before you book.  And Grand Hyatt: please conduct an audit on your rooms. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470760290~“Terrible Cocktails”~I came into the bar just behind the Bistro Bar last Saturday to have a couple of cocktails with a girlfriend of mine. The first two cocktails we had (Espresso Martini & Toblerone cocktail) were OK, a bit watered down but OK. Then we thought we’d try strawberry daiquiris, however before we ordered we asked if they used fresh strawberries and we were assured yes fresh strawberries were used. When they arrived, it was red syrup, (the only strawberry was the one hanging of the glass as a decoration). These were taken away and they apologised. The replacements were not any better, perhaps they used one strawberry, just terrible especially when you ask. Terrible service, nobody even came to ask about the replacement cocktails. I paid the $80 bill for 4 cocktails, and the waitress we paid was very apologetic, but that was the extent of their customer service!~1~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_470742356~“Great breakfast. Noisy room”~Stayed recently on a Saturday night.  Welcoming service and front counter certainly created a good impression.  Rooms very well appointed  Had a pre dinner drink in bar off lobby, loved the decor and ambience but service was unusually a little off.  The breakfast I rate as the best of the hotel buffets in Melbourne and didn't disappoint this time.  A downer was the noise overnight within the room, it appears that the location of the bed is in very close locale to adjoining room bathroom~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470632657~“Nice hotel, perfect location”~Big thanks to Janelle from the front desk and Elwin from the bell desk - both made our arrival at this hotel great. Lovely hotel. Great location for exploring Melbourne. Good, friendly staff. Nice executive lounge and good breakfast there - better than most I have experienced. Nice bathroom, shower no bath. Ask for a room at the end of the hotel - kind of a corner room (although there are no corners because of the shape of the hotel) as the views are great (but will be more expensive). All in all, this was a great hotel for three nights. We were there on holiday but I would have been very happy with the services offered had I been there for business. Thank you to the team there - we had a great stay and they were very attentive.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470524113~“Very clean hotel in good location”~Overall very good hotel. Rooms a bit noisy, can hear everything from corridor as people walk past. Staff very helpful and friendly. Beds and pillows very soft, but that's fine if that's what you prefer. Walking distance to shopping so great location.  I became unwell on the day of checkout and they were very accomodating in arranging for me to have a later checkout and making sure I had enough water in my room.~4~3~5~3~4~5~4~nan

review_470080894~“Perfect location...”~The Grand was a very nice hotel, in a great location in the city, though I was a little surprised at the size of the rooms. We may have been unlucky with what we were given, and don't get me wrong, still a wonderful room, though not up to Grand Hyatt standards. As long as you get a decent price, go! Keep in mind there is a Park Hyatt not far away, so that might be a better fit for your trip - and it was less expensive on many of the nights that we looked at.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469860733~“Great hotel in a good location.”~This was our first visit to Melbourne and having stayed in a Park Hyatt hotel numerous times in the past in Dubai our expectations were high. I am pleased to say that we were not disappointed. Having paid the extra for exclusive use of the club floor and all the facilities (speedy check in, breakfast in the club lounge and afternoon tea and evening canapé) were all part of the package. Good quality food and free access to both alcohol and non alcoholic drinks made the whole experience first class. On top of this the hotel was in a great location for the majority of Melbourne attractions. Well done to all the staff.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_469505623~“Not worth the Price”~Stayed in a Standard King Room on level 24. The bed was amazing but the room was disappointing for the price. Just felt like another standard hotel room. I was expecting more for the price and 5 star rating. Staff were great, foyer/reception area is lovely. Blackout blinds were great and our room was super quiet. I asked for an upgrade when the price of our room dropped the day after I pre paid, I was told a request had been lodged but when I arrived it was declined due to high demand yet rooms were still available online. Had an issue with the shower that they fixed straight away.  I would gladly stay again BUT the standard rooms are not worth $250+ per night. ~4~3~5~5~3~4~4~nan
