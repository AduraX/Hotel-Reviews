review_478786257~“Great location”~Our family stayed here for 2 nights and it was a great location to explore the city and easily walk to Maragret Court Arena. The room was very spacious and clean with Southbank facilities only minutes away.~4~4~5~3~5~5~4~nan
review_478735749~“Good location”~We were upgraded to a double room which was ok. Heater wasn't working properly in our room. Kitchenette was great.  On site parking was very tight in and out.  Staff were helpful.  Location was great close to Southbank promenade. Nice and quiet location~4~3~4~3~3~3~4~nan
review_478522274~“Awesome and fuss free stay”~This stay was perfect for us as we needed minimal interaction and maximum convenience and we got both. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and filled with everything we needed and the staff were more than happy to give us what wasn't there. It's a no fuss and easy place to stay with awesome coffee on the doorstep and a supermarket around the corner. Loved it!~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478386859~“Excellent”~I highly recommend this facility. The staff listen and act on requests for all kinds. The location is convenient to Southbank and M1 and car hire. I could live in their apartments! I experienced the 1 and 2 becroom and both were excellent.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478092443~“easter break”~Great location right in the heart of Melbourne. Helpful staff only to happy to supply us with extra coffee pods, tea and sugar. Washing machine was out of order but reception organised housekeeping to wash and dry our laundry, excellent service. Could do with more cooking equipment.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_477864672~“From a pair of oldies”~We found the location very convenient for walking to Southbank and accessing the city. Convenience and grocery stores are in close proximity. Bed and furniture could be more comfortable but overall we had a good stay.~4~3~4~3~4~3~3~nan
review_477581178~“Quest Southbank”~Beautiful rooms, exceptionally clean, courteous staff. The wi fi was fast but a little expensive once you have passed the 500MB limit. Very comfy bed, great sleep. Nice lounge area, always stay with Quest if there is one where I am travelling.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477301418~“Great location for Southbank and CBD”~Excellent front desk service and clean and comfortable room. Parking onsite. Only downsides were the vacuuming and cleaning, which could have been contributed to by the Easter period, and the expensive Wi-Fi, with poor support service. Plenty of cafes and restaurants in close proximity.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476968705~“Quest Southbank Melbourne”~Fantastic location, and our 3 bedroom apartment was certainly spacious, but apartment was tired and in need of a good freshen up. Price for our stay over Easter was certainly reasonable too, but the place just needs some love.~3~4~5~3~3~3~4~nan
review_476959652~“Good-value stay in Quest Southbank Apartment”~The apartment that we stayed had adequate/good facilities for cooking for a small family. We felt at home. Quest Southbank's location is within walking distance to Melbourne's CBD and yet, we do not experience noise from the city, again we felt much at home.~4~5~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_476778423~“Service staff very helpful and friendly. I responded positively to their easygoing, relaxed efficiency.”~My room was clean and very comfortable.  Staff quick to respond to all inquiries.  The bathroom could've done with a refit. Dishwasher was a problem but service staff were great in taking care of dish washing.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_476619343~“great staffs. Aircon in guest room only not bed room. Limited free wifi data.”~Live in apartment (2bedrooms) at 10th floor for 2 months (2017 March ~ May) +: Rooms: Nice décor, large. Staffs: Very nice and helpful -: Aircon little loud (outside fan), only one in Guest room, no aircon in Bedroom and little bit cold at night though I had to open bedroom door for warm air come in. weak wifi signal in bedroom and only little bit available near bedroom door.  --: very limited free wifi data 250Mb/day (for 2 people). Freaking expensive extra wifi-data : 500Mb/14$ (12Gb - $280.00, 31 days )  To someone who new in Melbource: - 5 mins walk to Flinder Str Station to enter free tram zone (2 ways one climb up ladder to grass field longer and one shorter by go out hotel turn left then left cross the street (at trafic light) go to subway near car park).  (usually tram outside free zone cost 4$ per trip 1 touch on + 1 touch off with Myki card) Tram from outside to inside CBD usually cost half price of same opposite route. 5 mins walk to near by artist center building and 20 mins walk to Royal Botanic Garden (very nice and large garden my favourite walking place) Have to go inside CBD for super market. 4mins to 7Eleven but not many things there.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476278721~“Comedy festival night out”~A group of four couples booked into Quest Southbank to take on the Melbourne Comedy Festival. Not only was the location fantastic being only 300m to the venue but the rooms themselves were fantastic and the beds superb. We had a very pleasant time at Quedt and the staff were fabulous at ensuring our requests were met. Congrats to the Quest. We'll be back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475755212~“Booked a king size bed and we're given a double when we complained it took staff a very long time to reallocate another”~Overall we were disappointed as we've stayed here for the last four years and have never had an issue before  This time the reception staff were not at all able to address the problem  I left feeling that the staff need training in complaint management~2~1~4~3~2~3~1~nan
review_475415868~“Great position ”~We enjoyed our stay here in a two bedroom unit, which was spacious and comfortable. Furnishings were modern and comfortable with a king bed with ensuite in the main bedroom and a queen bed in the other. A second bathroom was convenient with our family staying together.  We did find the lack of a dining room and breakfast a bit disappointing. There was a coffee shop close by though who book meals back to the hotel. The other thing we would have expected for a hotel of that price, would be a swimming pool. Kitchen facilities were great in the apartment and we appreciated the convenience. 10 minutes walk from the Rod Laver and Margaret Court was a bonus as it would have been impossible to find a cab. We would stay here again for the convenience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475387986~“Comfortable apartments”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom executive apartment, it was spacious and had all we required for our stay. Friends stayed in 2 bedroom apartments one was small, dark and not spacious, where as the other 2 bedroom apartment was just as big and spacious as the executive we booked and paid extra for. Guess it comes down to luck on the day?  The apartments were clean and serviced daily. Beds were comfortable. Our shower in the ensuite was a bad design, shower head faced the wall (only getting half the water) and it flooded the bathroom floor every time it was used. A very limited amount of wifi is provided and then you can pay for additional amounts, in this day and age why can't we get fast, reliable internet for free? Parking is provided in the apartments for an extra cost, it is convenient and easy to get to. The location is great, an easy walk to many restaurants and attractions. There is great cafe next door that does a great breakfast and coffee (Saporito?) I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_475155334~“Fantastic location”~A couple of friends and myself were going to see Rickie Lee Jones at The Recital Centre so we booked Quest for it's proximity to Recital Centre. We were pleasantly surprised with the service, condition of apartment and ease of parking in the car park. All in all I would definitely recommend Quest.~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_474887666~“Some good, but lots of little things missing”~First the good stuff: Good sized rooms, great beds, kitchen and bathroom facilities adequate. The reception staff we had on our first couple of days were great. They even have very good office facilities which came in handy. Not so good: We booked four apts for a stay of almost a week. All were on separate floors and there were only 2 keys per apt even though there were 4 people staying in each. Every time someone wanted to go to an apt they had to go to the foyer and have someone from that apt come get them. We understand the security aspect of this but it was a nightmare to manage this over a long period of time. How hard would it have been to give us fob keys for all the floors? Other hotels have done this for us. The cleaning was less than adequate - floors were never vacuumed. Dishes put in the dishwasher but not turned on, toilet paper not replaced. Overall, we found the hotel's lack of flexibility with any of our requests (such as additional internet) was inconsistent with the fact that we booked several rooms over a long period.  We do this trip every year but we will be looking for a different hotel next time. Too many little things went wrong. The service is in the details...~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~2~nan

review_472537469~“Good Location”~I stayed for 3 nights and found Quest good value in a very good location. Noticed some minor traffic noise, and occasional noise from the room next door, but otherwise everything was very good. Close to resturants and a supermarket all within easy walking distance.~4~4~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_472065419~“Great location. Room was clean and facilities were quite good. Dryer was a bit noisy”~Overall a great location and good facilities. The dryer was a bit noisy. The staff were overall friendly. Except for the breach of security or our room by room staff we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the quest as a good choice of accommodation~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_472013775~“holiday”~A very pleasant stay. Quiet, and everything is there that we needed Our requests were acted upon when needed. Because it is situated so close to the city, Southbank and the trams, we would certainly recommend it to our friends, ans would stay there again..~4~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_472003878~“Great location/poor service”~Was there for the F1 Weekend. 3 Rooms booked several months in advance only to be told upon arrival one of three rooms booked was unavailable for one night. Options offered to accommodate the muck up were poor. We came up with a solution that worked for the complex with one couple making arrangements to stay elsewhere. We had in fact requested 2 months in advance to cancel one room but were refused. To then turn up and find out that a room wasn't available anyway with the solution offered being unacceptable was unbelievably poor form. Wont be staying again.~3~3~5~3~4~3~1~nan
review_470453322~“Great location and friendly staff”~The location is great and the staff are always friendly and helpful, restaurants and cafes are close by, the only problem we had was there was no plug in the bathroom or the kitchen, the rooms are always clean and comfortable~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_470142359~“Central, clean & spacious”~Great location, clean and spaciousness for three couples. Staff on reception could possibly learn to smile and not give the impression you're request is a problem - they are in the hospitality business!~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_469954720~“Awesome spot staff considerate”~Car park was tight but we fit our Prado in. Staff helpful. Considerate of disability access. Great value. Only down side was the room smelt of cigarettes. Awesome breakfast downstairs. 2 bed exec had plenty of space~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_469742379~“A great place to stay!”~It was very clean and we had a lovely spacious apartment, going as 4 friends it was really reasonably priced but just as one family it would be expensive. Great location right near the restaurants of South Bank and not far to the CBD.~5~3~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_469727782~“Complimentary return”~We stayed as a family in July 2016. The weather was cold and the heating in our apartment was not working . At the time the staff were extremely helpful but were not able to fix the problem so we slept poorly.  Immediately we were offered a complimentary night which we accepted and so ended up staying for my daughter's birthday treat in March and stayed to see Adele in concert. An easy walk to and from the Etihad stadium.This time we had a fantastic stay. Again staff wonderful and helpful. No complaints. Apartment huge and comfortable.  Thank you so much.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469543625~“Quest Southbank”~The property is well located, close to the city but also close to the arts precinct. The staff are very helpful and know the area well. They were able to assist with a place close by to eat, buy groceries etc. I was in a one bedroom apartment, it was very clean and roomy. My only complaint would be that the glass doors for the shower did not meet exactly which allowed water to leak onto the floor. The bath mat captured it, so not really a problem.~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_469507731~“Decent price, great facility, no view, great quiet location”~Decent price, great facility, no view, excellent location because quiet and easy to walk to all the popular sites. Loved the Hockney show at the Victoria Museum using back entrance through parking structure. Not too many food options but sufficient.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469300592~“Overnight stay”~The Quest was ideal for our stay. We had a 2 bedroom apartment which suited our needs for the stay. The location and price were great. Just a short walk to the Casino, restaurants and bars. Check in was available early which was a bonus.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469262467~“Great accommodation for 6 family members”~Very clean & spacious. Not to noisy for an inner city location. I'd stay there again - not a problem. In fact this is the first time I've used Quest & now I will always look for Quest as my first choice. My only beef was that the accommodation was not within walking distance from a certain entertainment venue & that is not Quest's fault. They were very helpful with booking a maxi taxi for us & gave us instructions as to the public transport system when returning home if unable to hail another taxi.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469258286~“Great Location & Quality Apartments”~Affordable Quality apartments. Located close to the city and restaurants. Perfect for an overnight stay on business. Highly Recommend it to anyone travelling interstate for Business. Also good location for a quick cab to the airport.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
