review_478724127~“Good value for money ”~Great location, walking distance to city, metro, supermarkets etc. Can walk to st kilda but takes an hour, it's nice if you get the weather. Friendly staff. Room is nothing special, very small bed for a couple but you get what you pay for. Would recommend for a stopover or short city break.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477570396~“It was good for short term”~Overall was good. Not luxury but the room was clean. Staff extremely helpful and welcoming. The bed was comfy. A little bit noise from the street but understandable. I will come back again if I saw some special deals next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476721059~“Low budget, neat and tidy stay”~I stayed in the month of April 2017 for a short business trip. Single bed @ affordable prices with ensuite bathroom. It was neat and tidy with TV, Iron, Kettle. Good for single person stay and near to southern cross station (just 6-7 min walk)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476028753~“Refurbished Ibis Kingsgate”~Returned to this Ibis, newly refurbished and refreshed. Good service from front desk staff.  Convenient location comfortable and quiet. Rooms often are at a good price.  Close to Southern Cross station very handy. Nice new shower and bathrooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475674574~“Hidden Gem”~Don't let the aged façade fool you. This hotel located close to the famous Collins St and Southern Cross Station, is a great property for those who need accommodation for short stay/business traveller. The hotel is currently going through a refurb and what a pleasant and refreshing upgrade the rooms are becoming. The staff are super friendly and very receptive to your individual needs. Breakfast options range from a continental to a full breakfast and priced very reasonably I might add. Truly a hidden gem in the bustling Melbourne CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475409387~“Ibis hotel king street”~This hotel is in the city area close to train stations & bus to Tullamarine airport. Restaurants & casino is close by. Entertaining for travellers to explore road trips in victoria. The rooms are new & upgraded. The ibis hotel is going through renovations.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475287845~“Comfortable and convenient.”~The Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. My room was quiet and comfortable. Convenient for regional trains. Handy to varied food venues for a cheap night out (Italian was good). I felt it was a reasonable walking distance to South Wharf and City Centre but of course trams are handy for the purpose also.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473094816~“Great price great location”~Room very small but everything you need plus new television and foxtell. Great location in the heart of the city and near south bank and casino. Friendly staff and clean bathroom. Good security and doors locked at night with 24/7 front desk staff available~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473088498~“Great place”~I was here alone and felt safe the whole time. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Great location near Southern Cross Station. Rooms very basic but clean, tidy and quiet. Will definitely be back. Convenience store and cafes nearby.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_472568923~“good value”~Good value , close to train station and bus .Walking distance to most city requirements and restaurants . I think the area is safe and being slightly out of the city CBD area is less traffic as well. The hotel has all you require if you are looking at a good room , breakfast and a good price and value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472004733~“Great location....but”~I totally appreciate that rooms are being renovated, but I couldn't help be disappointed by my recent stay. The room was clean but the whole place is just old, with creaking wooded floors and old paint jobs and noisy air conditioners... bathrooms are fine, if you don't mind banging your head when you stand up from toilet, bed was actually really really hard and uncomfortable and pillows were just as bad...I have stayed in other IBIS Styles and I guess I was expecting a lot more. Pity the cafe is only open for breakfast. It is in a great location with lots of cafes etc all around and a supermarket just across the road. Very nice staff, friendly and professional.~2~nan~4~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470786358~“Hmmmm....”~I think the best you can say for this place is that it is reasonably clean. My shoebox of a room was very basic. Very little space around the bed, no room to spare. The aircon is very old fashioned, not very efficient, and very loud. Not great when trying to sleep 1 meter away from the aircon unit. The sofa is very basic, and pretty uncomfortable. The TV has had to be replaced, as the first one was just not working properly.  The bathroom is fresh and recently redecorated, and the housekeeping was effective. But don't expect any mod cons here. And it was not that cheap either.  Not recommended. Find another place to stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470720732~“Not Great Experience”~This trip the room was re-furbished but had lot of hassels with opening the door with that new lock. Key always used to get deactivated. Had to go down all the way and again get someone. This happened 4 time in 3 days... Also, rooms next door and front were getting renovated so was really different atmosphere with new paints and wood dust.~2~3~5~2~4~3~2~nan
review_468661801~“Good basic hotel in the right position”~The hotel is a good basic hotel right near the southern Cross train station. This makes journey's t the suburbs and to the country areas simple, using this hotel as a base. Staff we very efficient and good. Pleanty of places to eat nearby also.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_465683612~“Great Value”~We stayed here overnight just before our overseas trip. Great value for money and handy to all of Melbournes attractions especially the docklands precinct. Not our usual type of hotel but can recommend for a value stay.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463593822~“Great value, terrific convenience and excellent servie”~I have stayed in this hotel about 6 times since 2013: this is, in fact, every time I've been to Melbourne since then. It's extremely welcoming, with wonderfully helpful staff and, on top of that is very reasonably priced and comfortable. It is so easy to use the trams (the hotel is in the free tram zone) as well as being only 3 minutes walk from Southern Cross station, where the Airport Shuttle bus stops and from where trains to almost anywhere in Melbourne can be caught. I have 3 sisters and many relatives to visit in Melbourne and at 63 really value having somewhere private to stay that is not beyond my budget and also has a very pleasant lounge, breakfast room and public balconies.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463547585~“Very basic hotel but good location”~The location of the hotel was great and the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, however the hotel itself was incredibly basic. I have no idea what our stay cost as it was paid for through a travel agent as part of a bigger trip, however I would guess it was not cheap. We stayed for 4 nights and changed rooms twice on the first day. The first room was so noisy as there was a constant loud dripping from the air con unit above, dripping onto our unit. The window would not close properly and there was a sponge on our unit outside to catch the drips, so obviously not a recent problem! The second room had an extremely dodgy lock, which meant the door was very difficult to open from the outside, but mainly from the inside where it was extremely stiff and we thought we were going to get trapped inside. The third room, which we stayed in, was an improvement, however the windows again did not open/close properly. They were also frosted so we had no idea of whether it was day or night, or what the weather was like. We had to have the lights on whilst getting ready in the morning. The air con unit was so loud it was impossible to sleep with it on, and it was so close to the bed it was a terrible design. However with no air able to come in from outside, we had no option but to leave it on all day and then top up some cold air in the night. We could still hear the dripping outside and the sound quality of the rooms in general was quite poor as we could hear our neighbours quite easily. The layout of the room meant it was very tight to walk down the side of the bed, and the air con unit was far too close to the bed when trying to sleep. The whole layout should have been different. The wifi connection was terrible and considering we couldn't see out of the window, it would have been helpful to have been able to check the weather! Overall it was a good location and we used the room as a base for exploring the city. However it was pretty poor and I'm sure I would be horrified to find out what we actually paid for the stay.~2~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_459493243~“Black box in perfect location”~I am really confused for this hotel review since everything except the room was perfect. The location of hotel is good for tourists and must be for business purpose as is in middle of the City. There is a Supermarket Cole at about a five minutes walk, Some three Indian restaurants in vicinity which are having good options even for vegetarians including both north and south Indian food. Other places for tour operators are also near by although most of the tour operators pickup and drop at Hotel itself. Reception is supporting and can reserve any tours you wish to have directly from reception. The only issue is with Hotel design itself. Seems very old and like a hospital. The room although was of good size to accommodate two adults and two kids but was having only one bathroom window facing inside to similar bathroom ventilation windows of other rooms. Bathrooms are of old type with pipes apparent on walls, even in room for old oil heaters which seems not working as separate electric heaters were also kept in the room. At entrance of hotel there are a good 10-12 stairs where you need to lift your luggage. The room was reserved by my tour operator so I have no idea of prices and other kind of rooms to compare but must be cheaper.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458545866~“Very good ”~With a 15-month old and overseas guest we really had a comfortable last night stay here. I wish we booked this place earlier before arriving at Melbourne.  Staff is helpful and kind. Basic but nice and clean Highly recommended~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456823628~“Great Location”~We stayed in IBIS Kings Gate for 4 days. The Hotel is centrally located with easy access to the local tram stations. There are 4-5 Indian Restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is in CBD area and the trams are free within the CBD area. The hotel had free wifi in the rooms and lobby area. Some of the rooms are quite small. Initially we were given a small room, but we got it upgraded to a larger room by paying a nominal amount of AD10/day. The breakfast was good but had limited options.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_456521855~“Good location - adequate room for a short stay”~I had a newly renovated room which was small but did the job for my one night trip. The room was clean with a good bathroom and aircon. Location is excellent. My only negative was the breakfast- it was ok, basic but no attention to detail and no worcheshire , Tabasco or chilli sauce... A small negative- with so many good cafes in the area avoid breakfast at the hotel if breakfast is your thing. The staff at reception were very friendly and accomodating. Free wifi and quiet rooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455513365~“Great location and friendly staff at Ibis Kingsgate”~We stayed 6 nights during first week of Aust Open Tennis and were very impressed with Reception Staff, daily free newspaper and daily free brochure of games and times played at Tennis. Rooms comfortable and clean, great location, 6 min walk to Flinders St Trams to Tennis, will come again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455084744~“Very Ordinary”~I checked in late at night and was meet at reception by two very lovely attendants. That's where the good bit finishes. The room was clean but very ordinary. The air conditioning was dated and noisy...it was hard to sleep with the noise. They had forgotten to put a kettle in the room so I had to got to reception to get one. It's a budget hotel- if you book in don't forget it! The price was too high, $250 a night because the tennis was on, apparently!~3~1~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_454823551~“Excellent value in downtown Melbourne”~A good basic hotel in downtown Melbourne. Clean and friendly staff. Bergerac French restaurant next door is highly recommended. Older style hotel but freshly painted. Near most of Melbourne's major sights.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454823275~“Over priced ”~Stayed at the Ibis Styles Kingsgate hotel on the 20th and 21st of January on arriving our car was towed while trying to find out where we could park and unload car, this was on top of inflated room rates due to the tennis, room was Ok but Certainly not worth $330 or so a night. Staff friendly but should warn guests of the risk of parking at the front even if just for 1-2 min....~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453895434~“Addi you legend. Great staff!”~Travelled with two of my friends, we were mostly new to Melbourne, 17 and travelling alone for the second time. The staff were incredibly helpful, Addi, thanks for everything. Early checkin wasn't available when we arrived, but he looked anyway, when it wasn't available, the first thing he did was offer to look after the bags. When I had to call home and sort some credit card stuff out, he was patient and helped just the right amount of other customers to not waste time.  From directions, to help with little things in room, all staff members were helpful, happy and informative, even at the late hours we arrived back at the room.  The free WiFi was rather helpful, really useful and didn't seem to be cripplingly slow as some tends to be, and that little saving really helped ease our tight budget. The structure of the room itself was a little dated, the washbasin had those separate hot and cold taps, took some getting used to for a morning face wash, but though it looked a little old, everything else worked fine. Some other comments here mention the direction of the air conditioner, yep, it was hot when we were there and if we hadn't left it on during the day, it would have cooled the wrong part of the room first, but as for the rest of the room, the beds were comfortable, room was a good size and the price was amazing. Thanks for making our stay so so comfortable.~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_453893123~“Don't do it!! Under renovation ”~We booked our accommodation on line for 2 nights. When we arrived at the hotel we discovered that it was under renovation. Our room was very very small and very old and tired looking. For $538 for 2 nights it was a total ripoff !!!!!!!. (We expected a little luxury for this price). Noise from construction on Friday was so so loud , I went back to the room mid afternoon to get some rest and it sounded like a freight train coming into the room!! Thought we would get a break from the noise on the weekend but to no avail, they started up again on SUNDAY morning. We made our complaints to reception on our departure but basically fell on deaf ears , we were offered complimentary breakfast!! Whoop whoop!! Too little too late. Won't be back again. So beware before booking online (any hotel) and check on important information, apparently this is where they put updates on hotel, at the bottom of the website page not at the top where they tell you to " relax and lay back" . Total joke~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453183624~“It is what it is”~Super friendly and helpful staff. Small room with no view. Had everything I needed though. Somewhere to leave my gear, a bed and a hot shower. Would stay again for the budget price I paid. Central location and couldn't hear the streets. Could probably do with some better doors to stop internal noise but that was minimal. Free Wi-Fi was fine for facebook but wouldn't recommend for work.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452865213~“Ibis Styles Kingsgate Melbourne - Weekend Getaway”~The Ibis Styles is conveniently located within walking distance from Southern Cross Transit Center which is were the SkyBus drops you. They have 24hour check in. Their rooms are freshly renovated (new paint smell was a little overbearing but I'm sure this will not be an issue much longer). The rooms have all amenities required for a short stay and in my opinion suit the price tag. The Hotel is a short walk to a number of Tram stops, which are conveniently located within the free tram zone. Monday to Friday the area is bustling. However on the weekends there are not many eateries open for breakfast, but you are right in the CBD, so a small tram ride to have more options. Same with the night life~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449030086~“Great, but needs work. ”~Our stay in Kingsgate was good, we enjoyed our new year there. However we didn't get fresh towels til our last day when we called reception. Although the aircon started to play up we were offered a different room. Everyone was friendly. Lift feels a bit dodgy but I'm sure it's just older. Paint needs work throughout hallways and the balcony closes at 11 and reopens at 7 but there is lights with no light switch on it. Beds were great, and it's good for anyone looking for a reasonably priced place to stay for a few days.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448761327~“Very helpful staff”~Needed to check in early for a variety of reasons. Contacted hotel in advance and they accommodated easily. I will be back there this Saturday for BBL match. I use this hotel frequently due to its proximity to Etihad Stadium.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448175087~“Decent stay for NYE”~We stayed for NYE at Ibis styles Kingsgate Hotel location wise was good for what we had planned for NYE. It would also be great location for an event at Etihad Stadium.  On check in staff were quite friendly and provided us with information for parking which was close by at $25 for the night. The room it self was extremely dated as where corridors, Air conditioning didn't work to well very small unit pointing in the wrong direction to cool room. Glad it wasn't any hotter outside.  We spent $325 for the night cheap compared to most other hotels on NYE we weren't expecting crown towers. Hotel did the job was clean, had a bathroom, a bed and free WIFI was good as well. Glad the hotel is undergoing renovations as it really does need it~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan~4~nan
review_447706646~“Small room, convenient location! ”~The hotel is located in CBD, the contracted parking of the hotel is located on the next block 5 minutes away with 25AUD charge for 24 hours. The hotel condition is not very good as it is quite an old building however this should be improved after the renovation. The room is small but well equipped as per ibis standard. The staffs are helpful and polite, overall it is another budget place to stay in Melbourne (CBD).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446854135~“Simple stay”~Don't expect too much on the hotel room. The room is quite clean but a bit old. As the roomis a bit too near to balcony, we often smell the smoke from balcony. The cleaner did a good job in house keeping.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_446657015~“Very good hotel”~Very good hotel. Arrived earlier than I stated but they tried to find me a room, was a busy period with competition going on.

review_446618313~“Christmas Shopping Weekend”~Extremely satisfied, sure it's not plush but it is excellent value for a clean room and a good night's sleep.

review_446001182~“Recommended”~I spent a week in the hotel.  The hotel is a block away from Southern Cross station for those arriving by rail or the airport bus.  Check in was quick and done in a pleasant and welcoming manner. The room is a bit dated and in need of some paint but kept very clean and attractive by cleaning staff. The size was good and everything was kept in good repair. The bed was comfortable. I found the hotel quiet and clean. Wifi was OK and reliable. Location is good being a short walk from trams and other transport options. On checkout I was able to leave my bags in a secure location with staff until I left for the airport. Again the staff member was pleasant and helpful. The rate I paid was quite good and I'd quite happily recommend the hotel and return there myself.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445924180~“Australia holiday”~We found the hotel very comfortable and clean, with friendly experienced staff. the one fault of the hotel was access. Entrance to reception was up a steep staircase, which was very difficult to negotiate with heavy suitcases. We did struggle with this and wondered how disabled people and wheelchair users managed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444318497~“Average hotel in the cbd”~Quite honestly I should have asked to move rooms as our room was on the inside of the building with two small windows overlooking the fire escape and several noisy air conditioning units. My husband had already unpacked and as the shower room was huge, we decided to stay put for the four nights. As we were only going to sleep here it sufficed. The room needs a lick of paint and more furniture, eg an additional bedside cabinet and a shelf in the bathroom for cosmetics. It must be a man who designed the rooms. The plus point was the great shower wet room. Word of advice, if you are unhappy ask to be moved, it makes life much easier.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443221276~“Not quiet a serial killer room. ”~We stayed here on a budget so it was a cheaper choice. Room was small and had a weird vibe about it but wasn't quiet a serial killer room compared to IBIS BUDGET. Beds were so comfy though!!! Pay for what you get in melbourne unfortunately~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442064514~“Convenient location - rooms a bit dated”~Location wise, good. near eateries, southern cross station just a street away, right in between Burke and Collins. Rooms, ok clean and functional but a bit dated. However, at night can be a little noisy as there is a pub next door. 7/Eleven across the hotel provide easy access to coffee (cheap and good), bottle water, snacks, etc. Service wise, ok, quite pleasant.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_440238435~“budget convenient”~A simple mistake on my part with the booking was sorted instantly by very friendly reception desk staff. Location is perfect, close to Skybus at Southern Cross station and within a few minutes of citynd maybe the bulbs could be warm white ? trams. Accomodation is basic but comfortable, excellent bed, really great shower. Lighting is a little dim, and maybe warm white bulbs would be more cosy. A standard lamp would also add to that vibe. Tea, coffee making, iron, hairdryer - all the things needed. Excellent free Wifi - a must these days - and pretty good TV channel selection. If the city you are in is what you came to see and a simple place to sleep is all you need, then this place is just fine. I would stay here again.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_440047452~“Great Location”~Stayed for three nights in this hotel and I would definitely come back. I was staying in one of the new rooms and booked for a single, happy to find that I'd been upgraded and staying in a room with a queen size bed. The bathroom was great and the shower pressure excellent.  Location wise it's great, your a short 10 minute walk to Burke St Mall, surrounded by eateries, near a tram stop, and around the corner from Southern Cross station which has the Sky Bus to take you back to the airport.  Reception was extremely friendly and check in/out was quick and efficient.  There were renovations happening at the time of my stay (and right next door to me as well) but that just got me out of bed, so it wasn't a problem for me. For those who are looking to laze through the late morning, maybe ask for something away from the reno's while booking.  That being said, I really enjoyed my stay, good value for money, and I'd love to come back if I'm ever in Melbourne again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan

The rooms are small but clean and adequate for a good night's sleep with en-suite clean bathroom and showers. The hotel has parking arrangements with a nearby carpark at an affordable rate.

review_438378598~“Average, small dark rooms, overpriced, central location”~The rooms in this hotel are small, old, and need a new lick of paint and the couches replaced. The price you pay is what you get. Very basic and straight forward. Beds were uncomfortable and not ideal. The WiFi kept cutting out every so often which was a pain. Front desk staff were friendly and the ease of checkin and checkout was fine. Not somewhere i would stay again, not my type of place.~3~nan~nan~1~nan~3~4~nan

review_437730582~“Ibis Kingsgate Hotel in Melbourne”~This hotel is situated in a good location in the middle of the CBD area close to Southern Cross Station. It is a very old hotel. Check in staff was friendly. The room I had felt like I was in jail and was dark. It does not have window or view. The only window was a frosted window in the toilet. Air cond is old style where you had to plug in a power point and turn it on. It was too noisy to leave it on the whole night during sleep so I had to turn it off. The TV needed a passcode when you turn it on. Not sure why but you need to ring reception to get a code. Toilet and shower is clean. They provide basic amenities like shampoo, soap, towels, kettle, coffee, tea, sugar, milk and iron.  Not recommended for leisure travel stay. Good for anyone who is on a tight budget who just want a hot shower and a place to sleep.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
