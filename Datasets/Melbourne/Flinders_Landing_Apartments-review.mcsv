review_477848768~“What A Great Location”~We had an absolutely fantastic 3 night stay at the Flinders Landing Apartments. Believe it or not but first time visitors to Melbourne (what took us so long) We stayed here after a recommendation from a friend. The location was absolutely superb we walked absolutely everywhere. Have read quite a few reviews and would agree with past comments it could be spot on but just a few things bring it down. We were travelling with two teenage girls so we did a bit of food prep in the kitchen which wasn't very well equipped and quite unclean. We booked a "penthouse" which I thought would be on the top floor but wasn't. Have stayed in a lot of penthouses in the past I wouldn't put it in that category. Would stay again though as the location so perfect.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_470520929~“Spacious but a few tiny finishing touches needed ”~Stay here often for business. It's almost great, but just needs a few finishing touches. For example, it might be a good idea not to vacuum around someone's legs whilst they're checking in. Just wait 5 mins. And the room I stayed in last time had no blind in the main room so I walked out in my pjs to a full view of the construction site across the road --- and them to me!  In saying this, the rooms are very spacious, high ceilings, lovely cosy feel to them, nice bathrooms, always clean, really comfortable bed and the people at the reception desk are always friendly and helpful.  I'd recommend this place to people looking to stay in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469261225~“Value & Comfort”~This is our home away from home - perfectly appointed for short trips away. Having the kitchen and laundry facilities is brilliant. The rooms and bathrooms are a great size, and the furniture is comfortable. It has always been very clean and quiet when we have stayed, and the staff are very helpful. Free nespresso and newspapers in reception is a very nice touch.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469093738~“Perfect location - pros and cons below...”~I had read all the previous reviews about this place being noisy and thought to my self - I'm sure it's not that bad as I work in the area and hardly hear any noise during the day in my office or the surrounding cafes.... however it's true my friends... you can hear everything from cars and trams to people talking or maybe yelling outside at all hours. That being said, please keep reading as I still thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Flinders Landing Apartments. Here's why: It's in a really central location to get around the city, close to so many great restaurants on flinders lane, public transport and a short walk to south bank or the shopping precinct. It's cheap compared to any other apartment style accommodation. We had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen and lounge with lovely views of the city for only $250 for the night. The staff were lovely to deal with, very helpful and gave us a free upgrade from an executive room to a penthouse without us even asking. (This may have been because we stayed on a Sunday - not sure this is something to be expected - we were surprised and impressed)  You can get cheap city parking near by - $25 for 24 hours is a bargain!  I asked my family if they would stay here again even though it was noisy and they said absolutely, next time we'll bring ear plugs. We were really happy with our experience and my advice is if you struggle to sleep with noise and can't do ear plugs this might not be the place for you, if this isn't a problem for you then you will get your money's worth.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468190822~“Excellent Position, Spacious Unit and Friendly and Helpful Staff.”~My girlfriend and I spent four nights in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. It was very clean and was very spacious. We had an easy walk to excellent shopping and theatres and if needed the free tram was close by. Free WiFi was available. The check in staff made sure our luggage was taken up to our room when it was available as we had flown in early so we could go off and explore. Once again on check out they organized transport to the airport and rang us when the taxi was near as we were once again nearby fitting in last minute shopping as girls do. Would certainly stay here again. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_463945828~“Convenient, quality”~Comfortable and spacious rooms located in the heart of the cbd. Good facilities and fitout. Friendly service. But no free wifi, which is annoying.  This time had a room facing away from the street, which was much better for noise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463933937~“Very spacious one bedroom apartment”~Very good position quite near Federation Square .....everything needed for a long stay including a washing machine! Just keep in mind though if you have heavy luggage as there are steps out front leading to reception and in our case the apartment was next door so a tip if there are two of you is to stay outside with the bags until you know where apartment is located. Comfy sofa and tub chair for tv viewing and an excellent price point for Melbourne in this location... what more would you want.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461102309~“RUDE STAFF!!!”~Great location right in the centre of Melbourne, Nice rooms, very affordable for what you get, was very impressed up until check out and was recommending a return, but will never be returning due to how staff handled a certain situation at check out, very disappointing~2~nan~5~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_458592884~“Excellent”~We were in Melbourne for one night for a concert. This hotel had everything we needed. The 2-bedroom 2-bathroom apartment was spacious, very clean and comfortable. Big enough for privacy and quiet enough for a good sleep (and the beds were incredibly comfortable). We were on the top floor - it's worth noting that to get from our apartment door to the apartment itself involved climbing a flight of stairs - ask about this when you book if it's an issue for you. We loved the apartment, found the staff friendly and the location perfect for everything we needed to do - our concert at Rod Laver Arena was within walking distance, and it was only a short walk to Chinatown, trams and everything else we wanted. The apartment came with free wifi and complimentary bottled water and soft drinks, which was great - and our only suggestion for improvement would be some nicer toiletries in the bathrooms.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_440242282~“Very good apartment in great location”~Located near Federation Square and Flinders station. We booked a 2-BR apartment. The apartment was spacious and equipped with washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, microwave. They provided us with basic supplies like soap, shampoo, and washing tablet for dishwasher. Note that equipment may vary for each apartment, as an apartment booked by my cousin has rice cooker while my apartment don't.  I expected the apartment would be cleaned every day just like if we stay in hotel or other service apartments, but usually they only ask if we need any additional supplies and if we have garbage to throw. Maybe we have to ask them specifically if we want them to clean certain area. My cousin also experienced no hot water in her apartment when her kid wanted to take shower. As it's located near hang out place, expect some noise especially on Friday and Saturday night. Tip: the staff said it would be cheaper to book via its website rather than other booking website.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_438923771~“Great family apartment”~Great location, everything we needed was in the apartment for our young family. Cheap parking across road. Was noisy at times during the night in the street facing bedroom but not enough to wake kids.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436929361~“Great location”~Great location, right next to a Melbourne graffiti lane and very close to Federation Square. Large well equipped apartment which was a little tired but clean. Car parking is $25 per day and is down the road about200 metres walk.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_436873063~“Marvellous Melbourne”~The apartment we had was huge with everything you could wish for. It was immaculately clean, and essential supplies like washing up liquid, tea towels , milk tea and coffee given.  The apartments are in a fantastic location close to restaurants , bars and transport links. The only minor issue was the noise from early morning traffic.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428070602~“Great location, great apartment, clean & quiet - loved every minute”~Not very familiar with Melbourne somehow we booked this amazing apartment for two nights mid-week for a very reasonable price.  We had a two-bedroom two-bathroom apartment on the 4th floor for four women on a mid-week GWA, with three singles + one king, spacious kitchen/with a washer/dryer, an extra separate toilet, and roomy lounge/dining area.  The apartment was very clean, the lobby really classy, and Denis in reception very helpful. It is right on Russell Street and only steps from Hosier Lane, aka street art central. We were in Melbourne for an exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria and could see the NGV from the window - one block away - next to Flinders Street Station: right on all public transport options. There is a multitude of restaurants only streets away (see my other reviews!) There was some street noise - those mid-life-crisis Harleys mostly - but it didn't bother me; and while I can sleep anywhere, my more-sensitive friends also slept soundly. The windows are double-glazed. My only criticism is the taps in the bathrooms (and I'm sure each apartment is different), but they were quite difficult to turn on and off with no handle just a round knob - all the girls struggled and I cannot believe anyone with a disability or even mild arthritis would be able to manage alone. This was the only thing I would change! I loved this apartment, this location, this city - can't wait to came back.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_423992436~“Good value and location”~My apartment had ample space and facilities. Clean and well appointed. It was excellent value.  The location is terrific for city work and convenient to transport and any convenience.  The only downside was some street noise. Light sleepers might want earplugs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413358974~“Fantastic apartments in a great location”~These apartments are in a great location. Close to federation square and the river precinct.

review_412223586~“Laneway Living in Mellbourne”~The Flinders Landing Apartments are incredibly well located, a very short walk from excellent shopping, eating and transport options. The lack of hotel amenities is more than compensated for by the price of the accommodation, with various fully equipped options available.  Although the décor is nothing special the furnishings are pleasant enough and in good repair The apartments are clean and secure, and staff at reception are friendly and helpful.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_410294174~“Good location, all the amenities”~Flinders Landing Apartments are perfectly located in the CBD near Flinders Station and within easy walking distance of great cafes, restaurants, shops and theatres. It is also close to tram stops and Melbourne's iconic laneways. Our apartment was well appointed with large, comfortable beds and full kitchen and laundry facilities. Our apartment had two bathrooms - one was an en suite with a shower and the other was beside the second bedroom and with a shower and bath. Staff were helpful and friendly - we did have to ask for replacement bathroom and kitchen supplies but these were provided immediately on request. The only downside was the view from our room was of a six foot brick wall. This made the apartment feel quite enclosed and dark - and was a surprise given the photos on the website were all of spectacular views over Melbourne. We had booked a 'premium double' apartment so were anticipating at least some sun and views. However, we were out and about all the time so it was not a significant issue. We will stay here again because of the location and value for money - but maybe specifically request an apartment with a view next time...~3~nan~nan~5~3~nan~4~nan
review_407295933~“Great city pad”~I've stayed here a few times. It really suits me as a single business traveller. On Flinders Lane It is right in the middle of the restaurant action for after work beers and food or before work coffee and it is walking distance to the both sides of the CBD, so there's usually no need to get a taxi or tram anywhere (although the tram is only a block or two away). It is quiet, although you can hear footsteps above you and other guests coming back at night.  Rooms are set up with a kitchen so that you can do your own thing completely. You might be surprised however to find that there is no mini bar although there is coffee and tea laid on. I've always found the beds comfortable and got a good night's sleep. My only peeve is that I would have to pay for in-room wifi which is a bit of a rip off. Reception are always friendly though and will bend over to assist. The best thing ? The crazy wooden five storey fire escape. You could make a movie in this space - just a tall skinny brick shaft with a wooden staircase hung in it. Even when I am on the fifth floor I take the stairs because I like it so much. I almost hate the lift with an equivalent aversion I have to say - it is slowwww and a bit unreliable (you might be taking the stairs even if you didn't want to).  My only other comment is that, if you are in a wheelchair I don't think you'll get to the front door up the steep narrow steps. Enjoy !~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_405604127~“Great location”~On girls weekend. We had 2 rooms, Our room was really spacious, comfy beds and had the river view. The other room was much smaller so all vary in sizes. Close to shops and restaurants.  The only downside is the street noise, double glazed windows would help. Price for rooms were also very reasonable compared to other accommodation. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405589602~“Great location!”~Shared the penthouse apartment with another couple for a 3 night weekend. Wonderful view, great amenities, centrally located to restaurants, shows and the footy. Unfortunately the apartments have no control on what happens outside - and there were roadworks until 5:30am in the morning - very noisy and so a sleepless night. But will definitely be back.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_404354462~“Just what we needed”~Been here before and returned as it suits our requirements nicely. Well located in the CBD great for accessing restaurants, shows and trams. Service was excellent and while the floors creak it was only somewhere to sleep. Kitchen had enough to cater for a dinner with guests. Very good value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401078631~“Spacious Apartments good for family trip”~These apartments are in a great location and very spacious for our family of 4. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment which had a full size kitchen and spacious lounge room. The apartment wasn't overly "flash" but was definitely comfortable and great value, the 2 bedroom apartment was less than we would normally pay for a hotel room for the wife and I. Another big bonus was it was an easy stroll to two of our fave restaurants in Melbourne, Lucy Liu's and Chin Chin.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_397028410~“Just OK”~Didn't really like this apartment (#11) - 'balcony' was a grey 6 foot brick wall with 2 fold-up chairs on the Flinders Lane side of the building. The glass door and windows were difficult to close so it didn't feel very secure. Furnishings were comfortable and kitchen well stocked although not sure how you're supposed to reach the microwave above the fridge (I'm 5 foot tall and couldn't open the door.) Floorboards were so creaky I was woken up in the middle of the night when our neighbours arrived home or walked to the lift. Overall - probably a good choice if you're not in the room much and just want somewhere to crash. Not suited to our family weekend where we spent the evenings in the room.~2~nan~5~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_396387187~“Spacious Apartment”~What a pleasant surprise. So close to the city and affordable and spacious to boot.The size of the master bedroom and its ensuite was staggering.With a more than adequate sitting room for the kids.Loads of cupboards in the kitchen for a longer stay.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_390835912~“Flinders Landing Apartments”~These 2 bedroom apartments are clean, tidy and spacious. Location is great, close to the CBD, the MCG and Flinders Street Station. Transport is close and easy to use. The staff are very friendly and welcoming.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_388923682~“Good place for self service holidays”~We booked a one bdrm and a three bdrm apartment for a family trip. No children. The staff who helped me arrange a large family gathering were very helpful. The apartments were all very well appointed and comfortable. Heaters worked well in the cold weather. The kitchens were good, although we didn't cook, just bought ready to eat stuff. We landed at 7am but unfortunately we weren't allowed to checkin until 2pm - and I am pretty sure that there was no one else in the room, so that may have just been the guy behind the desk that day. No restaurant or room service but we didn't need it. Great location for walking everywhere.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_387514411~“City stay”~After booking this hotel online while on a road trip to Melbourne via the great ocean road I was not expecting too much for the price. It had a separate bathroom as well as an en suite two lovely bedrooms a large living room full kitchen and a balcony.it was in a great part of the city.It made for a very comfortable stay and will definitely return if I go to Melbourne again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_386068230~“Excellent value for your money”~Only stayed one night for an early morning business meeting, in a one bedroom apartment. Service was excellent, even though checking in really late. Apartment was very spacious and quite like home away from home. Super clean and comfortable, with everything you need. The building is a little old, but the rooms are refurbished. The location is great for exploring Melbourne city, with all transport facilities at easy access. I didn't have any issues with noise, but would imagine depending on what night, it is an active area, so there may be some issues - but for the excellent price for a stay in the heart of Melbourne, I'd say it is highly worth it.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_383368370~“Old Building Apartment”~The Apartment building itself is very old, the lift is old but the inside of the apartment has been refurbished.  The location is within the city and within walking distance to the shopping area of Swanston Street and Bourke Street. It is also walking distance to the Flinders Station and Federal Square. The artistic alley, Hosey Lane, is just a few steps away. Overall the stay is fine.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382982774~“Possibly Melbourne's noisiest apartment hotel?”~I picked this one-bedroom apartment (via booking.com) as it was well priced and close to my business meetings, and the rooms looked modern and generously sized. The reception was closed on arrival (public holiday) but entry was just a quick phone call away. The apartment was clean and tidy and at $145/night seemed like very good value. All my boxes were ticked…..until it was time to sleep. I was in apartment #1, one floor above street level and facing Flinders Lane. Directly opposite the apartment building is a waste recycling facility (via a loading dock), which services large garbage trucks. The trucks are constant and VERY noisy (eg imagine the sound of 1000s of bottles being dumped into a metal skip bin). There was a short window between 12:30am and 4:30 when the truck noise diminished but that was when the guy with the high powered water blasting equipment turned up to clean the street (he worked tirelessly and noisily for an hour between 12:30am and 1:30am). It was literally unbearable, even with quality ear plugs. By comparison the passing traffic was almost acceptable. I complained at reception immediately the next day (I’d been awake from 4:30am to 7am fuming) and it was clear that I wasn’t the first person to complain about noise. The manager appeared empathetic and moved me to level six for my second night. The apartment still fronted the street and I was aware of the truck noise but it was MUCH quieter and I did sleep well (I was exhausted!). There’s a lot to like about these apartments but the noise totally killed it for me. There are apartments situated at the back of the building which might be quieter but I simply could not recommend this accommodation. If you book online it’s a duck-shoot. If you are thinking of staying in this apartment block, you should at least phone the operator directly and request a room at the back of the building.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_373875848~“Gorgeous apartments not so gorgeous neighbours :(”~The apartment itself was absolutely stunning very clean and tidy. Very modern and warm. Close to the all the city attractions and train station just around the corner. The reception staff were polite and helpful and our apartment was serviced daily. Unfortunately we had a permanent resident on the floor where we stayed and they complained every single day about our noise, we never had any parties of any sort but we did convene at the end of our day and talk about where we had all been and have a drink before dinner so laughter was present! The complaints were made at around 6.30-7.30pm each night and the morning we left we had a complaint at 8.15am in the morning - we were only having breakfast! I would suggest if anyone stays here ask for a floor where there are no permanent residents as this is a gorgeous place to stay but the residents made our stay miserable.~3~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan
review_370825128~“Short stay in Melbourne ”~My daughter and I decided to spend a few days in Melbourne, we wanted CBD accomodation. The booking was made the evening before we arrived. It was so much better than we expected, 2 large en suite bedrooms, enormous kitchen, well appointed living and dining area. We didn't cook, but everything was there, dishwasher, washing machine, stove etc. crockery, cutlery for 4. Great for 2 couples. We were impressed with everything. Would highly recommend these apartments. The position was also fantastic, we walked or took the free trams.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_370476355~“Beautiful apartment with big glass windows”~WE had a nice big 2 bedrooms apartment with large windows in every room. A bathroom with toilet and a separate toilet, fully equip kitchen with washing machine and dryer. Parking per entry is about AUST$25. Staff are friendly and helpful. Really walking distance to middle of the city, shops and tram stops.  The only negative thing is, if you are a light sleeper, the sound of traffic in the morning will wake you up.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_368290726~“Excellent location but some negatives”~We had a 4 night stay at Flinders Landing Apartments on our first visit to Melbourne. There were many positives, firstly, as most reviews have highlighted, the location is excellent, ideal for exploring the city. Comfortable walking distance to transport options, shops & restaurants. We had a rental car with us & the parking charges in the nearby car park are very reasonable (especially when you've parked in a city hotel in the USA). We had booked a 2 bedroom Executive apartment & found it very spacious, clean & well-equipped. We had specially requested a room on a high floor with a view if possible & were really pleased to be on the 7th floor in the Cavendish building with an excellent view from one of the bedrooms. We didn't experience any problems with a high level of noise as highlighted in other reviews. We also found the staff very friendly & helpful. On the downside we did feel that the decoration of the apartment was not as good as the photos on the website suggested & the furniture was a little tired in places. It was also quite sparsely furnished and perhaps an extra picture or two on the walls would have helped. Also there seemed to be too much emphasis in the paperwork we were given & in the room guide on not making too much noise for the sake of people living permanently in the building. The statement that you could be asked to leave immediately seemed a bit over the top to paying customers! The other drawback was the connection to the Internet. We kept having to re-enter the password while using a device.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_367075724~“Spacious apartment, great location. ”~Great spacious apartment, ideal location for going to the footy at the MCG and also ANZAC day dawn service at the Shrine of Remembrance, we walked to both of these. Our apartment was fully self contained even including a washing machine, making it ideal for a longer stay, the price was what I would expect to pay for say 3 - 3 1/2 star type accommodation. Easy access to Trams, which are now free in the city zone, we caught a Tram to the museum. This means you can park the car and not use it while your there. Parking is off site, but it is just a couple of buildings down flinders lane and at $25 per day is one of the cheapest options, we could also leave the car there after we checked out so we could see more of the ANZAC day events. There is an IGA express supermarket and separate bottle shop within 5 mins walk of the apartments and plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars close by. Only downside was the street noise, while trying to sleep at night. Coming from Regional Victoria we are use to it being a lot quieter at night. We stayed in apartment 4b which has Windows out onto Russell St and Flinders lane, in the main bedroom. If a quiet nights sleep is what you are use to you might want to check where your apartment is situated in the building. We will stay again if we can pick a quieter room.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_364784946~“Wonderful location”~What an amazing place, two bedroom, two bathroom apartment with plenty of living space. Clean, fresh and sheets and towels lovely.  It was noisy but that was to be expected right in the centre of the city and it didn't stop us from sleeping in! The busy-ness of the street was interesting and part of the city experience.  The staff were really helpful and informative too.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_358845128~“Very central to everything”~Location is ideal for visiting Melbourne. Walking distance to the central shopping area and handy to all public transport options. Our 1 bedroom apartment was spacious and reasonably equipped for self catering (although lacking any cooking dishes for the oven or microwave). Also curious was the CD/cassette player that had no power cord and speakers not connected. Central location does mean noise from traffic, people at nearby restaurants and the joy of bins being emptied in the early morning. We were on the second floor so noise penetrated quite loudly, but we have found this is an issue with most apartments in the CBD. Expect it and bring earplugs. We also had to contend with a herd of elephants residing in the room above, leaping about noisily. A call to reception seemed to bring some improvement but again this is the risk of apartment living. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. We would probably stay here again but try to get a room higher up and away from the street noise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356153551~“In the heart of the city”~Wow talk about value for money. We had a two bedroom apartment, extremely spacious, two bathrooms, large lounge and dining area.
