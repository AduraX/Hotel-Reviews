review_477836320~“Hidden gem”~I like new hotels with friendly and efficient (but not overwhelming) service. This hotel fits the bill exactly. The room was not huge but it was comfortable with enough space for our 3 suitcases. Very clean and modern. Good fitness centre. Also very close to the tram and safe to walk back to at night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476303124~“Lovely hotel, great location”~Spent a special night over Easter weekend here. Checkin was smooth and staff very welcoming and we were upgraded, which was terrific. Our room was on the 11th floor facing west and very spacious and comfortable. Huge bed (if only the springs were tighter so when one person moved the other didn't) and a nicer touch would be towels are sheet size. Otherwise the 1 hr massage in the SPA was luxurious, breakfast buffet had huge choices and so nice to be in a spacious, welcoming and spotless hotel with very welcoming staff. Great location in Melbourne's CBD without being in the hurly burly. Highly recommend~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_475941061~“Great hotel with great service”~I stayed at this property for two nights for business in March 2017. This is a relatively small hotel without the club lounge. However, it's located in the center of the city with many cafes and restaurants nearby. The property is clean, modern, and comfortable. And above all, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I had an issue with the bathroom sink and they sent a maintenance person and fixed the problem right away. The way the staff treated me gave clear message that they wanted the customer to have great experience at the hotel. Kudos to the manager of the hotel, as it's evident to me that it all started from him/her, as the way staff acted was consistent, not just one or two persons.  Highly recommend and will go back for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475756588~“Centre of Melbourne close to restaurants”~Booking this hotel means you can expect quality. The rooms are nice and well equiped. Breakfast is nice, plenty of things to chose from.

review_474345331~“modern hotel fabulous beds, room depends on floor and aspect”~New modern hotel with lovely roof top outdoor bar. Service good from the front desk. Some rooms on the side overlook a large office block close by making rooms very dark with no view. Higher rooms in different positions, have lovely city views. Overall would stay again.

review_473505991~“Another superb weekend stay! ”~The Sheraton Melbourne is our home from home. We travel from Brisbane throughout the footy season and wouldn't stay anywhere else. The staff are always very attentive, and always welcome us back.  The pool, spa and sauna are always a great and generally very quiet and peaceful. The ladies at the spa are fantastic and we always try and book a treatment.  Perfectly located with plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars around.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473027765~“BEST HOTEL IN MELBOURNE! LOCATION, ROOMS, STAFF ARE SUPERLATIVE”~The Sheraton Melbourne is truly the best hotel in Melbourne and an outstanding global Starwood Group property. Its location at the Paris end of Melbourne's CBD is perfect for both leisure and business. The rooms are spacious, clean and with every amenity. And the staff! There was a friendly greeting in the lobby, the check-in at reception was seamless, the house keeping and room service staff was responsive and informed... This superb level of detail and service is obviously driven by management who also went out of their way to ensure that my stay was perfect. This is the type of hotel that makes up for the stress of constant business travel. Very highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472812613~“Amazing, help staff, beautiful room and impeccable view!”~I would like to personally thank Benjamin at the concierge desk for helping me with all my requests, my 100 emails and all my questions! I wanted to celebrate my partner and I's recent engagement and wanted to decorate the room, have everything you could think of there to celebrate and leave a gift for them to organize on the day also. I had donuts delivered, balloons organized, a banner, chocolates, beer and various other chocolates and presents organised for the room. Our room was also upgraded for free! As they were so lovely to give that to us also. We adored the room, with a clean and beautiful set up, lovely bathroom, 2 televisions and an impeccable view. All my requests were met, everything was organized for how i wanted it and i couldn't have been happier! All the staff were lovely and i can't wait to stay at this beautiful hotel again! Thank you once again Benjamin and the Sheraton for everything.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472797915~“Location A. Rooms A. Service C.”~Lovely hotel with nice rooms and big bathrooms. I loved the comfort of the beds and the wonderful linen. The bathrooms were so spacious. Reception and concierge staff were great - friendly and efficient - however the staff at the breakfast restaurant were so laid back it was almost ridiculous. Waiting forever for milk for my colleagues tea....my coffee took ages - I'd just about finished breakfast when it arrived. Then tying to get any sort of service for anything else you needed at breakfast - we didn't bother waiting - we just got up and had to hunt around ourselves. We were at a function at the rooftop bar and the girl behind the counter nearly bit our head off almost yelling at us the 'package' had finished. Not great when you have your clients standing right beside you. (I can understand the 'package' is finished but there's a way to explain to somebody and it wasn't that way). The food was great, the amenities were really good as well but the staff needs to be better trained in customer service.~3~4~nan~5~nan~nan~2~nan
review_472663322~“10/10”~Stayed the night at the Sheraton hotel. Like can it not be so fancy? Beds felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. They must have had reinforced slats like they do back in Malaysia. The staff were so friendly to, would stay here again.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470197746~“An experience leaving some mixed impression”~Stayed 5 nights. This hotel is all about location, location, location. In the CBD but equally close to all restaurants and bars. Everything is within walking distance and if you happen to be tired of walking, jump on the free tram. We used SPG suite night awards and got a lovely spacious room on the 7th floor with a tiny balcony. We are glad to have used the awards as I can only imagine the regular rooms being very small (as the Suite size would compare to a deluxe double room elsewhere). Though, very tastefully appointed room with all the amenities you need and expect. F&B: we only had breakfast and that was, for all the 5 mornings, not a too joyful experience. Whilst they use great ingredients, it just appears impossible to prepare dishes properly. There is salad without dressing, great coffee beans that turn into the most sour beverage, lovely fruit very poorly prepared, great fresh eggs cooked in a way that the omelette just does not taste good. I don't know what it is but it is simply wrong. I am not a cook nor a hotel owner but when I cook breakfast at home it tastes better in all aspects. Reception and concierge: extremely friendly and caring; they are perfectly doing their job and whatever you have, they will deal with it promptly and professionally. Housekeeping: inconsistent in the detail. There is that little something every day that you have to take care of which makes the experience a bit of a hassle. Customer care: we have addressed all that with their staff and they took the feedback very professionally and showed commitment to follow-up. Even though in view of the rate paid, I would have expected a bit more, we might consider returning since the location is simply great and would outweigh the other items I mentioned.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan

review_469172067~“Location and luxury”~2 nights for business in Melbourne w my husband . Gorgeous bath and wonderful location in a Parisian neighborhood in south city..walk to circle line, china town, arcades and lanes, exposition hall, churches, dining, and Parliament House . Nice 3 Rd story bar terrace near spa and pool and gym..all nice. We had Crux and co daily downstairs and enjoyed the tub and modern bath. View from 14th floor should've been amazing but it was facing another too close building which we didn't like.. but lighting, bedding, desk area, early check in, late Check out and power changer in room provided all so helpful. Do not like rooms w room key to power room. I know it's green-but it is such a pain and they should just include an extra power key at check in. Hall ways seem to lack AC , elevator slow and there are a lot of stairs and petite meeting space here so if you are mobility challenged it may not be a good choice . Lobby concierge and restrooms on different floors which was kind of a pain.. but compact high end nature of everything was really nice and very beautiful /modern. Would defiantly stay again . Thank you~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468172775~“Boutique with a Great Vibe”~Have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions and will continue to do so. It's not you're usual grand Sheraton style, but instead small and boutique. The rooms are all very comfortable but basic rooms have basic views. So spend a little more for a view. The staff make this place very special from cleaners, wait staff, front desk, concierge and even the chefs. Everyone is warm and friendly, which you don't get at bigger hotels. Great out door bar and cosy pool area. Food is of a high standard and the buffet does not disappoint. Almost didn't want to write this review as my wife and I wanted to keep it our little secret!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467451913~“Small and good location”~Small hotel, no club lounge. Stay at Suite, with a small living room. Near to 7-11, trains and trams. Not much choices for breakfast buffet. Plenty coffee and breakfast places downstairs next to the hotel. Can improve comparing to other Sheraton in Asia.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466730217~“Great Stay”~Visited Melbourne for the first time, did some research about the city but checked with the trustworthy concierge, Nick. He led us to many places we wanted to see and set up our tours for us. Gave us great insight, thanks Nick! Rooms were nice, had everything we needed, albeit small. Hotel was within walking distance to many of the cities restaurants and attractions. Overall, a wonderful stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466409837~“Beware: Nice Hotel but Terrible service.”~The inside of the room was lovely but the windows looked directly onto the side of a building. The location is good. The pool is small and does not look like the photos but the steam room was nice. This also appears to be a hotel for family's so maybe not the romantic escape you might expect.  Unfortunately we had a terrible experience. The package we had included breakfast; as with most places we expected this to be the standard buffet breakfast.  Upon checking out we were not told there would be additional charges and the receipt would be emailed to me. Unfortunately when I got the receipt there was an additional $50 charge for breakfast. I queried this and was told that my package only included in-room breakfast. This was never explained to me during any part of the booking process or when we checked into the hotel. The reply from the "Guest Services" said this was my error. The hotel said they would refund the $50 but due to receiving such terrible customer service, I certainly cannot recommend staying here.~3~2~nan~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_464386277~“Nice hotel with cosy bed”~Stayed for two nights at this nice hotel.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is within walking distance to the CBD area which is helpful if you want to explore this area.  Pros: Nice ambience for breakfast  The bed is heavenly... Very inviting Reasonable overnight parking rates. There's this 'safe city parking' service   just directly opposite the hotel. It's manned by polite staff who will ensure your car is safe. I drove in at 7pm and was quoted 30 bucks for overnight parking. The car park will close at around midnight and you may drive the car out again and make sure you inform the staff at the car park that you will be back before midnight cos they will lock up the Carpark and you can only retrieve your car in the morning at around 630 onwards FYI - Westin Melbourne provides overnight valet parking at 60 bucks.  Cons: Not much I can think of. They provide an excellent Sheraton experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462094500~“Comfy stay”~Room is of right size for 4, great value as there a 2 comfortable double beds. And I'm really picky about beds! Location is not right smack in town but not too far away from actions. Amenities given are plenty. Heated indoor pool which did not have a chance to try. Gym facilities are good but gym size will be better if bigger. Great cafe below if need to grab brekky before going for tours. Best part: within free tram zone!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461022302~“Very Professional”~I was impressed with this hotel, everything, about exhibited quality service and high standards. The rooms were a good size along with a spacious bathroom. The breakfast had a good selection from western and Chinese dishes. The fruit offerings where a stand out, such excellent produce , they are clearing sourcing their produce from an excellent supplier. The omlets were fine but not upto the high standards as the fruit selections. I would recommend this place if your after a quality experience in Melbourne. It's a pity their weren't more restaurants operating from the hotel but there is a good selection close by.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460951172~“Ideal location for Australian Open”~We stayed at the Sheraton for 2 reasons: 1- Ideal location for walking to the Australian Open 2- As a gold Starwood member, I was hoping our room would be ready earlier. I had requested an 11:00 am check-in time and the Sheraton had our room ready. After a long flight from the US, this was huge for us. We could walk 10-15 minutes to the Open. Also, the cricket stadium and the Botanical Gardens are very walkable. The rooms are large and very comfortable. Wifi was free for me and very reliable.  In addition, the hotel is near the trams and the main town sites. Staff were very kind and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_458369039~“4.5 Stars!”~We spent a thoroughly enjoyable week in Melbourne in late January. This was our first trip to Australia and we especially appreciated the excellent CBD location of the Sheraton Melbourne. The Flinders Street Station and Federation Square were a 15-20 minute walk and Flinders Lane, home to many fine and funky restaurants and bars is even a shorter walk.  The property itself is very attractive and thoroughly up to date. Our sleeping room was smaller than we had hoped and overall a bit ordinary but offset by a large bathroom.  A key attraction of this property is the outdoor third floor lounge. On sunny afternoons this is a superb place to sit and enjoy a cocktail with a view of urban Melbourne.  My husband was a bit underwhelmed with the fitness facility but overall it was adequate enough.  The reception staff was kind and welcoming and helped us through a slightly stressful experience with the SPG group. All in all, this is a very good property and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to our friends.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_458188504~“Second stay and even more impressed”~Have stayed at all the best five star Melbourne hotels and this suits me as the best .

review_457608416~“Rude staff, horrible view”~My room was not ready for my arrival, so the attendant told me I had to wait an hour and they would get me into another room. The new room was not the type that I reserved, they said they could not get me into another one. It was called a city view room, but the entire view was looking directly into an office building despite having wall to wall windows. You could not see anywhere else. Very disappointed with the entire experience, the concierge was not even a little bit concerned and I will avoid booking with Sheraton ever again.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_457288905~“Disappointing”~Within 2 mins of check in my partner washed his hands to find the sink was blocked. We called customer service and someone was sent to our room who tried to fix it with a coat hanger. He could not fix it. Another person was called and could also not fix it. We needed to get ready to go out. Despite having just checked in tjey did not offer to move us to another room. My partner could not shave before dinner, we had to use the shower to brush out teeth.  We then noticed the bath was not draining. We told reception on our way out. When we got back after dinner the bath had not been dealt with and was unusable and the sink had a gaping hole because they just removed the metal part.  We arrived for a relaxing weekend and were stressed from the get go with the delay in getting ready and the discomfort of how we could get ready.  Really disappointing. Upon telling reception in the morning about the bath issue not being resolved all we were offered was to contact them next time we stay there and they will give us a discounted rate. They did not even tell us what the discount would be. Will not be using it anyway because we wont be staying there again.  Also wasnt a fan of the decor. It felt sterile and cold.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455798050~“Misleading business practices”~1) The hotel webpage uses a main photograph that shows a 31-storey tower block with the word "Sheraton" emblazoned across the top of the building. However, anyone thinking, like me, that the photo shows many rooms with balconies and great views, think again. Apart from one penthouse suite on floor 31 (which is not even bookable on the hotel website), all hotel rooms are on floor 14 or lower. Few of these have balconies and most have no significant view. 2) One room category that has a limited view is the Grand Deluxe room. However, the photograph on the hotel website for this room category (which appears to come from room 1414, where I stayed) has been photo-shopped. The view through the windows is not possible. The view shown has been shifted right to remove tower blocks. 3) The hotel imposes a credit-card surcharge, one that exceeds the amounts considered reasonable by the Reserve Bank of Australia. 4) The credit-card surcharges are not disclosed on the hotel website or at any point during the booking process on the hotel website. There is a reference on the subsequent email confirmation that seems to imply that the surcharge applies to Australian credit cards only. The only disclosure is buried away in several paragraphs of text on the check-in card in print that was too tiny for my eyes to read and which I was told contained "nothing significant, just some legal disclaimers".~2~nan~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_455523956~“Excellent service. Really good Location. ”~We stayed over the Australia Day weekend. The staff could not have been friendlier nor better.

The Sheraton is definitely worthy of an excellent rating.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454183756~“Great hotel and great location, great staff”~When you arrive at the hotel you are on the ground level. The reception desk to check in is on the 1st floor. The bell staff will take your luggage to the room. There are a couple of things that you should be aware of. The first is if you opt out of the green choice program make sure you let the staff at the check in to avoid any confusion. The next thing is to be a bit careful when you take a shower the marble floor can be a bit slippery when you are exiting the shower.  As a platinum member I chose the breakfast amenity. Breakfast is served from 6:30am to 10:30am. The breakfast staff was very helpful and friendly. If you have a special request such as oatmeal the chef will make it for you. The chef did this for me a few times(I was there for a long stay 14 nights) I gave the chef some Canadian maple syrup as a gift and he was very happy. He had a smile on his face. The hotel is a small boutique hotel which is in a great location. The hotel is 1 block from major streets such as Collins Street and Bourke Street. Also within walking distance to Flinders station(the train station).  I would like to extend a very special THANK YOU to the concierge staff(Troy, Alex, Marika,Nick,Felipe, Ben, Hedi, Mane) I am sorry if I missed someone from concierge. Each day one of the staff would ask what I was doing and then I would give them my comments when I came back. I would tell them what was good and what was not good. They always greeted me with a smile.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_451803793~“Lost the name value.”~Stayed one night at Sheraton. Room was okay with balcony and nice view. The room service breakfast was the worst for the value. Don't understand why they called certain dish an "Asian breakfast" if it's far away from Asian menu. Don't want to mention about the price as it is five star hotel so you can imagine. They charged $8 for the delivery fee for room service which I couldn't understand as it should be included in all service taxes. Anyway the Asian breakfast came with cold pot of rice congee, small bowl of beef - were meant to come with in the pot -, one bowl of yogurt, one bowl of tasteless fruit salad,few different variety of pickles and small dish of soy sauce without grilled fish which was described in the menu. Baked eggs were not hot enough, as well as cold coffees. They also sent complimentary jams and all the different sauces which we didn't know what to do with. At the end chef cooked again but already far to make things better. Have more things to say about our unpleasant experience at Sheraton but all overall, I'd like to ask to everyone at Sheraton to work harder to keep the promise of your name value to the customers. We choose your venue for the name without questions, returning this trust you guys should work better than what you do now.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_450098662~“Not up to scratch”~Stayed at the Sheraton Melbourne and was quite disappointed by the tired state of the Hotel and its rooms. The soft furnishings were heavily stained and this was repeated throughout the Hotel ( See the Restaurant seating for further proof ) We stayed as SPG guests for 2 nights in a suite and a further night ( we added for logistical reasons) in what can only be described as a poor double room. I say poor as the curtains came off the rails and the view was a dirty vacant building next door!! The price definitely didn't reflect the state of the hotel and I wouldn't choose to stay here again!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

There's a lap pool, sauna, gym and day spa too.  A great balcony and bar (though you had to pay $25 on NYE) A great buffet, variety of foods, proper coffee and good service. It did cost $25 (or more as a non SPG member). When a room costs over $600, they could probably throw in breakfast~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448762013~“Fantastic stay for our annual girls trip!”~The perfect hotel for our girls trip. From the minute we arrived at the hotel we were greeted and made welcome. They didn't have any rooms available at 9am when we checked in, but they took our luggage from us and sent us off to partake in the Boxing Day sales, letting us know around 11.30am that they had a room ready for us. Room 1414 is a corner room with spectacular views of the MCG and surroundings. The room, although on the small side, had two double beds, a desk and a large TV. A little taken aback by the large glass window that look directly into the bathroom, the electric blind proved to be 100% opaque. The small gripe that I had with the room was the lack of bedside tables. There is one bedside table in the middle of the two double beds, but those sleeping on the side closest to the bedside tables need to get creative and use the windowsill or other pieces of furniture to put their glass of water or wine on. The buffet breakfast is $25 for SPG members and was well worth it. Thank you for a fantastic stay and we can't wait to stay again next year!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

The staff were fantastic and our room certainly exceeded our expectations! We were surprised with a platter of sweets for our anniversary, which was a lovely gesture. The buffet dinner and breakfast was beautiful and catered for allergies which was great. This hotel is highly recommended for an awesome city stay.~5~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_448703403~“Awesome Location with Fantastic Cafes”~The hotel is conveniently located just a stone's throw away from Parliament Station and with great little cafes and restaurants around the area, this hotel is right on the sweet spot for convenient traveling within the CBD. In addition to the great beds and pillows, the service staff were very friendly and approachable with great attitudes. ~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_448401078~“Great stay and easy access”~Check in was a breeze and everyone was very helpful. You just feel that the conceige is all out to make your stay a very pleasant one. It's also an easy walk everywhere in the city . If you prefer to take the tram , it's just a 3 min walk away.    It's also easy access to go eat . From Chinatown to Southbank restaurants . You will not regret staying in this hotel. Just excellent !!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_447951758~“Excellent location, comfortable hotel with super friendly staff”~We were in Melbourne for a week, and chose this hotel to stay in based on other Tripadvisor reviews. The hotel location is perfect, close enough to the central shopping district and just far enough away for you to be out of the noise and fuss. The closest FREE tram stop is a block away and three stops takes you to the center of the shopping district. If you choose to walk, it's a mere 10 to 15 minutes away.  The hotel itself has a small lobby on the 1st floor along with the buffet restaurant. The ground floor where the entrance is is small, and has the concierge desk along with 2 chairs and lifts / stairs to the lobby. The rooms are nice, with well appointed bathrooms and comfortable full length beds. The room size is bigger than average, but not as big as places like the Shangri La in Sydney. The view from the room is adequate, but nothing exciting and whilst the curtains do a great job of keeping the morning sun out, they do let in enough light for it to be bothersome for people who want no sunlight intruding their sleep. The rooms have the standard instant coffee / tea options along with a kettle. A more professional coffee machine would have been better considering the grading of this establishment. The wifi is fantastic. SPG members get it for free, everyone else pays. While it's fast, AUD 20 a day is too much for high speed wifi in a hotel. You can easily get a local 3G/4G sim card with a wifi device included less than AUD 40 and enjoy the wifi anywhere you go.  The breakfasts are really good and very good value for money. SPG members get a discounted breakfast rate. The staff is what makes this hotel stand out - extremely friendly, very happy to help, without being overbearing. For what you're paying, and what you're getting, this hotel is excellent value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_447703219~“This is what we came for: Family Christmas Lunch”~Best Christmas lunch ever! For 2nd year in a row, the family chose Sheraton Melbourne to host our annual Christmas family lunch. For a group of 8, the service was fantastic. We got fed with delicious food, enjoyed the drinks and were looked after by the hotel very well. Staff: Drinks requests were spot on and came fast, used plates were cleared before and upon request, no request was too hard to accommodate. They were very polite, friendly and professional at the same time. They smiled and were happy to engage in small conversations. They didn't feel like Santa's over worked elves.  Food and Drinks: Food selection was still extensive. Seafood, Asian, Italian and Western cuisines were served plus a very wide range of dessert options. Seafood in particular was fresh, tasty and replenished on a regular basis. The alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks on offer were nice as well.  Entertainment: The venue had the Christmas vibe. Live (quartet) and canned Christmas music were both available. Everyone looked happy and were having a good time. Highlight was Santa: entertained each table, posed for selfies, paid special attention to kids and handed them with presents. The hotel will certainly see us again next year. You get more value than what you pay for. We will continue to recommend Sheraton Melbourne's Christmas lunch to our friends.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447057241~“Its a Sheraton SPG POINTS YEAH”~We had a room show the night prior to check in and it was a lovely hotel indeed, but then its SPG, upon check in we got an upgrade as I'm Gold SPG to Grand Deluxe, East Melb view. The room is spacious the bathroom has a great soaking tub, love a bath. The only downside I did notice it was a twin zip king bed, meaning 2 single zipped together, but actually very comfortable at night as you can feel the bump. The breakfast included was great and sooooo much choice and REAL coffee made fresh to order, bright cafe and staff were so attentive Sheraton you've done it again, SPG love you~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_447037739~“Sheraton”~Excellent value and location. Reasonable rates. The only problem was early closure of balcony bar area. The staff were friendly and professional. We would stay again for a getaway and we would recommend to others.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_446874655~“Enjoyable stay”~Stayed in a suite. Cleanliness - excellent Noise level – quiet, except when function on garden terrace – noise penetrates rooms Bed - superlative: Sheraton has the best beds (and pillows) we have ever slept on in hotel accommodation Food - excellent; delicious meals, brilliant room service, great wait staff who added to the pleasurable experience Amenities – excellent, although cream cloth furniture is becoming stained; brilliant rain-shower in a very nice bathroom Comfort – very comfortable; room well appointed Staff – super excellent; professional, courteous and friendly – couldn’t do enough for us, but not obsequious; just perfect Would definitely stay here again~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_446121693~“Nice big rooms, great service, no complaints”~Everything and everyone was top notch at this hotel. The rooms were quite large with big bathrooms. I didn't have a view due to a retainer wall on the third floor. It made the room quite dark. I used the ballroom and patio for events. Very nice and great service. One small hiccup when we arrived when a bag went missing. A very important bag. The hotel looked at the video monitor and found the thief and tracked his movements around the corner. The bag was not recovered but the important items were dumped in an alley which were recovered in about 2 hours time. The hotel graciously offered to pay for all lost items. A true class act of a hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_445967819~“Nice Hotel, Shame about no free Wifi”~This is a fantastic Hotel and I like the Sheraton Brand. My only Bug Bear is that they charge for internet! Really? I think in this modern age perhaps they could offer free wifi when you are paying almost $300 per night. The bed was very comfortable and the service by staff was excellent, with a fast check-in and smooth checkout. The hotel is well maintained with all of the Sheraton Luxury appointments.~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_445716380~“One night at the Sheraton in Melbourne”~We received a very warm welcome from the concierge and reception staff. Our room had a spacious and luxurious bathroom, with big walk-in shower. The bedroom was likewise spacious and luxurious, with a good size couch and desk. A little delay before the bag was delivered to the room, but overall a fabulous stay.~5~4~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_445714821~“Fantastic place to stay in Melbourne :)”~Sheratan @ little Collins Street in Melbourne has been my got to property for personal stay.

review_444566595~“Offers a lot of privacy in a good location.”~The hotel is in a good location in the city and within walking distance to everything. It is also very quiet so if you value privacy, this is a good hotel to stay at. Clean rooms, decent bed. Tiny gym.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_443730488~“A fantastic spa!”~This is my favourite hotel in Melbourne and I have always given it 5 stars. Had my first visit to the spa today. A wonderful lady called Koi worked her magic and two hours later my face looked 10 years younger! Professional, extremely welcoming and great value as you certainly get the service. Can't wait to go back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443052110~“Boutique Luxe”~The Sheraton Melbourne is at the Paris end of the city on Little Collins St. A great location and the staff members are generally fantastic. The systems haven't quite sorted themselves and the tray charge of $8 per order is odd for a 5 star hotel making an otherwise good impression. The rooms are wonderful with lots of natural light. Though the glass-walled bathroom in my room might take the gloss off the romance for a couple. The dumplings at East restaurant are superb and also available via room service. My room had a nice outlook over trees but a couple I met with a suite were viewing brick wall for their stay. Overall, an excellent hotel for leisure or business with Sheraton hanging out it's boutique shingle with flair. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441287316~“Not up to standard”~I've had some unhappy experiences with Sheraton hotels and this was another. On checking in I was assigned a room configured for wheelchairs. At check in I indicated this would not be entirely suitable, as previous experience has revealed that things like the desk aren't suitable to work at for people who are not in wheelchairs. I was told there were no other rooms available. As anticipated, I could not work at the desk, but there were other issues - nowhere to put luggage, a sink unit in the bathroom with nowhere to put toiletries. The walls are also incredibly thin and so it is possible to hear conversations from the adjoining rooms all too clearly. These were all frustrations, but the major issue was that my room was not serviced during my stay. There was a 30 minute period in which I was in the room during the day and had the 'do not disturb' sign out and I was told - by letter - that because of this it was not possible to service the room. At other hotels, the service staff typically come back at a later time. I would say that the young man on the desk to whom I complained did his very best to respond and I acknowledge that the hotel provided a small food gift as compensation. All the same, in my experience there are better hotels nearby at equivalent or better prices.~2~nan~nan~3~3~nan~1~nan
review_441262185~“OMG! BEST NIGHT EVER!”~After 2 weeks of motels, B&Bs, cabins and driving trips in Tas and GOR, when we checked into Sheraton Melbourne was like a little piece of heaven. Staff was great! Attentive bellboy and helpful people all around made the stay even better! Great rooms with great access to town, Chinatown and food and so close to the tram as well. Clean and pristine toilets that shine.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_440761141~“Quality ”~I stay around 200 nights a year in hotels, but have never stayed here until just last night. The hotel is very central, and on one of the many Melbourne 'little' streets. Reception is on level 2, off the street, which is very 'US/Japan' style, and great. Rooms well appointed, and linen very high quality. Enough Powerpoints near the bed AND desk, which was very welcome. They have put good effort into the gym, even having myofacial release 'muscle toothpicks' available (runners will know and love these things called 'the stick' - look for them near the fit balls). Only thing missing was kettle bells (and room to swing them). Breakfast buffet was thankfully well priced at $25, which is extremely good for a hotel of this level. Lastly, a roof bar that won Best Roof Bar of 2016. Taking guests there tonight. This is a solid corporate traveller hotel, and also i imagine great for couples going to one of Melbourne's events in the city, or at the many sporting venues. I'll be back I think. I am only Gold with SPG, and much higher with IHG and Hyatt, however still worth always considering this hotel. Cheers Mike~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439612312~“Well positioned, new and modern,staff very friendly”~The rooms are spacious, dark and very quiet. The hotel is spotlessly clean. The gym has equipment that is is perfect working order. The location is great for the theatre and restaurants up Spring St end.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_438893702~“Fabulous boutique hotel in the heart of Melbourne”~From the moment you enter this hotel you feel welcomed and well looked after. The rooms are spacious and well serviced. The restaurant (for both breakfast and dinner) are well stocked. A french bistro atmosphere for breakfast and a relaxed dining experience in the evening. I noticed one receptionist staff member dealing with an elderly lady who wanted some help - her manner was exceptional. This is replicated for all visitors and guests at this establishment! Would recommend it for anyone.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_438876509~“Will stay here again”~We loved our brief stay at the Sheraton Melbourne. Our room was modern and comfortable, with a lovely bed. Excellent linen quality. The bathroom was well laid out, with bath separate to the shower. The breakfast buffet had a great selection. The coffee is very good, although takes a while to arrive. The location is great if you are attending a show, a short walk to Her Majesty's Theatre.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_437587890~“Home away from Home”~Last weekend I had the pleasure of staying at the Sheraton Melbourne and while SPG is my group of choice the standard of service is exceptional. This was my second trip to Melbourne in two weeks last time Westin this trip Sheraton and while I have been critical of the staff in past now I think they are exceptional from the welcome at reception to service attendants everybody seems to be on the same page. "Pretty good for a corporate" My only concern is getting a pot of tea for breakfast. Please guys as a family that needs their tea in the morning please can we hurry up on the service time:). Definitely will be back. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437242612~“Beautiful Room”~The modern style room is really beautiful. The hotel is located on a very narrow lane, but I don't think this is a problem since the doorman will call taxi for guests. When I was visiting Melbourne, it seemed that there was a special event such that the room is over-priced (nearly 700 AUD). I don't think it worth such a high price.~4~2~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437203636~“Great location & room”~I stayed here for two nights while in town for an event.  The location is great - it about a 5 min walk down to Bourke Street Mall and all the great shops around the CBD,  The staff were great and very helpful.  The room was a decent size, loved the bathroom and the blinds to block the view from bedroom to bathroom were a nice touch.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_436762077~“A special and spacious room!”~The service was great all throughout my stay and I loved the Executive Room I was assigned.

Housekeeping and Concierge staff both went the extra mile to ensure that my stay was a happy one.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_436533497~“Good business stay”~I was here for work and chose the hotel for its location. My room was very large, and had a great view. The bed was perfect. Room service was prompt. There was a coffee plunger but didn't seem to be coffee, which was odd. The parking was across the road at Wilson but you could get a cheaper rate by paying at the hotel. I'd stay here again for work, it was all pretty seamless. The staff were pleasant and friendly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434651454~“Solid business hotel--nothing special”~Good, comfortable, solid business hotel in a relatively convenient (albeit decidedly not beautiful) location.  Concierge was very helpful, as were door staff. Front desk not as much. My one big concern was when I tried to call 'Guest Services' on Sunday morning between 10 and 11 am and the phone didn't get picked up, despite me calling 3 separate times and letting it ring at least 10 rings per call. THings like that make me wonder what would happen in the event of an emergency, truly. (I eventually walked down to the front desk with my question about late checkout and was rebuffed.)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433825300~“Need a bad review ”~Read reviews on trip advisor, I'm a platinum member for life with SPG so booked for my business stay. Little Collins is a narrow one way side street. Honestly best part of this stay way door staff, very friendly, lots of over the top service, valet parking ( but car park is across street) called me by name every evening on my return. The rest was, let's just say well below what I thought a Sheraton would be in such a large fun city. Desk clerk check in had zero eye contact, robotic answers to my questions in broken English. Room was on a lower floor with a fantastic view of the back alley. No use was incredible all night, trucks, homeless street people fighting, more delivery trucks, police & rubbish disposal. Great walk in shower with relaxing tub, but truly the room size of a postage stamp & defiantly not an upgrade. When I asked front desk told I got what I booked! Evening meals were either room service or patio bar because restaurant was always busy even week days past 7pm & staff were horrendous when asking for a table for one person. Given the option on next visit, sticking with SPG but headed elsewhere. Can't wait for new hotel to open in port Melbourne next year, this place will have to pick it up when it comes to loyal Starwood members.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433431902~“Pleasant stay”~The staff were very lovely and accommodating. The rooms felt a little dark and difficult to know what the weather was doing due to having views of a brick wall. Rooms were lovely and presented well. Nice big bathroom. Breaky buffet was average and basic. Pool and gym was convenient and presented well. Room service super expensive. In a good spot, maybe 10 minute stroll to main shopping centre, trams at the top of the street maybe 5 minute walk.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433419922~“Just a little snazzy!!”~Great place to stay. I would most definitely return. We stayed in a lovely suite and there was nothing further we could have asked for except our stay wasn't long enough. The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get up in the morning. We will have to come back and stay for the weekend to really enjoy this place.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431973112~“Good Hotel, better service”~This is a good hotel, rooms are lovely and clean. the best though is the bar and dining area and the service that comes with it. We had a lovely drink in the bar/eating area with friends and the service was exceptional. A fellow by the name of Danny was great, he was so thorough and quick on the service it made for a very pleasurable evening. This waiter/barman even chose all our snacks based on what we told him we felt like and git every single dish right. Very impressive and good experience.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431380260~“Good service, located strategically in the CBD, close to parking facilities”~I attended a meeting there - the staff service was great and the hotel room was clean and spacious. It looks relatively new, so all the amenities were in good condition. I like the location, it is near a multi-storey car-park and within walking distance to good eateries, coffee shops and also Chinatown. Looking forward to return again when I have business travel to Melbourne!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_430750302~“Expect so much more from Sheraton, overall a very disappointing experience n so many way”~When you stay at a Sheraton you have a certain expectation not just with regard to cleanliness, or service or the facilities and rooms themselves but you have an overall expectation of a certain standard especially when you are paying over $400.00 a night and $53:00 for a room service Hamburger ($35:00 for a burger + $5;00 for cheese + $5.00 for bacon + $8.00 tray charge so when you order and get charged $4:50 for a bread roll with your sons pasta you expect it to be delivered not forgotten, when you call to let room service know you expect them to offer to make good not just to say sorry... when you flush the toilet you expect it to stop running not keep running endlessly until you get up out of bed and spend 5 minutes trying to get it to stop and when you turn the TV on you don't expect it to turn itself off whenever it feels like it so you need to go through all the rigmarole again of finding your channel and when you are in your room doing whatever you expect the staff to knock before letting themselves in to "check the room" not actually saying "room service" as the door opens .and when you check out and they ask "how was your stay?" and you tell them ... you expect them to say more than "Oh I'm so sorry...!" Seriously Sheraton .. first world problems I know but for a weekly traveler used to staying in 4 / 5 star hotels not just your once a year tourist who may be impressed with a window in the bathroom it's bloody terrible!~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_430488219~“Exceeded expectations!!”~A really lovely surprise; was expecting another standard city hotel but found it to be much better. Had a traditional room on the 3rd floor. Very nicely appointed and practical. Comfy bed, great bathroom, room service food tasty and on time. The pool, spa and gym looked excellent. The rooftop bar also looked great but didn't use due to awful weather! The thing I liked the best was the delightful staff. From check in to check out everyone was so helpful! The concierge team were particularly friendly!  Will definitely stay again, it was excellent value for money. One thing only to improve..the bath towels!!! Tiny and thin! If you do this Sheraton, you will be perfect!! thanks ! Zoe room 311~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

This was my fourth visit and each time I have had really good experiences.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_429593745~“Good for business travel”~Enjoyed this hotel. Lobby and checkin are not uplifting but the room, service and food experience really works.

review_429508179~“Not bad but needs to review privacy issues”~Frequent visitor to this hotel and usually quite happy. This stay saw 2 separate incidents where staff burst into our room having rung bell then entered immediately - once with "Do Not Disturb" sign lit & latch on door. Neither apologised, cleaners saying they did not know I had a late check out (even though this was before normal 11am check out!). Rooms are clean and nice. Front desk staff pleasant & friendly.

review_425509504~“Relaxing few days”~We recently spent 5 nights at this hotel. Room was comfortable and we had a view of the gardens. In house breakfast at Little Collins st Kitchen was ok, nice surroundings, but perhaps some changes /additions to the menu would be good. The Spa was excellent, highly recommend their 1hour massage, we went back for a second one! Pool was good for lap swimming. Visited Terrace bar once, seemed nice. Staff in general were friendly and helpful. Terrific location, close to everything. Free city tram was just down the laneway. Lots of cafes etc nearby.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_424212953~“Exceptional service and standards”~From the moment I arrived at the reception desk I knew that this would be a good stay. The service was exceptional with the staff member doing everything possible to get me into a room early well before the check in time. This was followed by an unexpected but appreciated upgrade to a deluxe room. None of this was necessary but greatly appreciated. The rooms were large and well appointed and the breakfast is as good as you get from a major hotel chain. Thanks and see you next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_423697583~“Avoid at all costs”~We arrived in Melbourne late in the evening and due to a mix up with our apartment booking needed to find hotel rooms. All the hotels we tried were fully booked with the exception of the Sheraton and now I know why! It was a mission to make the reservations , and the room rates confusing. The staff were subsequently apologetic but totally unable to resolve this.  The rooms were very ordinary, our towel in the bathroom stained.  Having travelled all day , we finally got our rooms, one was without a room service menu so we had to ring down for one. Menu very limited and very expensive. My 82 year old mother was travelling with me and requested a sandwich. The only one on offer was a club sandwich containing meat. I explained that my mother did not eat meat and requested perhaps a cheese sandwich. I was told this was impossible. It seems that the Sheraton were totally unable / unwilling to produce a cheese sandwich off room service.  We moved to our apartment the next day and the rest of our trip was amazing. Melbourne is a wonderful city but avoid the Sheraton at all costs!~1~nan~4~nan~nan~2~1~nan
