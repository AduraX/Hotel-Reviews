review_477569860~“We loved the Lindrum”~We booked the Lindrum based on a guidebook recommendation and we were very pleased, thus this recommendation. It was just the right location for us, with easy access to public transportation and easy walking distance to restaurants and bars, shopping and the CBD. We had a large, wonderful room on the second floor with two bay windows and comfortable chairs. The bed was fine, the Wi-Fi was fast and reliable. The staff was professional and courteous, helpful when giving directions (that were not necessarily correct!) and we enjoyed a drink in the bar. We did not eat in the restaurant as we found the food selection limited and prices higher than we wished to pay for the offerings. All-in-all, we recommend the Lindrum and, should we get to enjoy another visit to Melbourne, it will be our hotel choice.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_476229310~“Great location! ”~My husband and I stayed at Hotel Lindrum over the Easter long weekend. Such a cute hotel in such a prime location! (Tram stop right out your front door and just a couple of blocks of walking to Fed square, Swanston St etc) Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean and a good size only had a view of a wall but that didn't bother my husband and I as we spent all our time wandering the city only returning to the hotel to sleep. If your after a room with a view I would request on checkin or maybe this wouldn't be the hotel for you as a lot of the rooms don't face the road. Shower water did overflow onto the floor which wasn't a concern for me more for the hotels wooden floors in the bathroom! All in all had a great experience and would return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475957926~“Great boutique hotel in quiet location ”~The room was big and spacious. The mattress was comfortable and I slept well. The staff was professional and was kind to let me check in early. The hotel was located at a quiet street. Location was not so convenient as the tours will not pick you up at the front of the hotel and there are no restaurants or supermarket outside the hotel though there are restaurants within walking distance. I love the toiletries provided by the hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474399220~“Boutique hotel with all the trimmings!”~Boutique hotel, in the fantastic city of Melbourne, with people who care and everything on site or go out to the laneways for meals. We stayed 2 nights..not long enough!, Restaurant on site, the famous Lindrum Billiard table to while away the time or the very comfy bar. Invited friends for drinks prior to going out to dinner and and nightcaps after.... very impressed.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472242004~“Boutique hotel in the heart of the city”~The Lindrum has a great vibe. Excellent and helpful reception. Comfortable seating around the bar. Had breakfast and it was superb. The rooms are spacious and the beds super comfortable. Around the corner is great shopping.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470791929~“Neat Boutique Hotel in what was Lindrum's Billards Parlour”~Neat Hotel, Rooms and Bathrooms not overly large but certainly do they job. Bed comfort was very good, bathroom small but serves its purpose. Was on the first floor above the bar and some noise flowed through. Room had no view sandwiched against a building next door. Wi-Fi was very good. Mini Bar was good. The hotel has a neat lounge on the ground floor including one of Walter's old tables. Walter Lindrum's statistical domination of billiards was amazing where he set 57 world records and played against ''blind'' handicaps of up to 7000. At least twice, the rules were changed in an effort to blunt him. He adapted. Anyway also on the ground floor is the restaurant 'Felt'. Had breakfast there which was very good and included Avocado and Feta Smash plus Zucchini Fritters. The breakfast was very good, where you can buffet or a la carte or if feeling hungry both. Staff were helpful. Would stay again.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469274919~“Boutique hotel ”~We were recommended Hotel Lindrum for pre dinner drinks as we were having dinner at the Press Club which doesn't have a bar.  The lobby & bar area are lovely as the hotel is housed in a beautiful historic building. The decor offers warmth & ambience. We loved the idea of the Billiard Room which evidently oozes with historical significance.  The hotel is located in a fabulous location on the edge of the CBD yet a handy walk to restaurants, shops , & transport.  We will definitely be returning for a stay next time as Hotel Lindrum really reminded of us of our recent stay in Brisbane at another boutique M Gallery hotel the New Inchcolm Hotel which was fabulous.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469023231~“First visit to Melbourne and I was very impressed!”~This hotel is situated in a fantastic part of the city. So many places are able to be walked to but if you don't feel like walking, there's a tram stop right outside. The hotel has such character with its high ceilings and floor boards and is beautifully decorated and furnished. The staff were amazing. On my birthday they delivered a complimentary beautiful bottle of wine to our room. The housekeeping was immaculate and our room was very luxurious and quiet. We will definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467755728~“Boutique luxury in the heart of Melbourne”~Really lovely small boutique hotel. Very conveniently located - 5-10 minutes from Flinders St Station, could catch the free circular tram from stop just outside. Felt very luxurious without being too posh/stuffy. Lots of really nice touches - lovely toiletries, plentiful T2 teas, freshly ground coffee on demand, turn down service, pillow menu (!) We paid a bit extra for a deluxe room which had huge windows facing the street and was very light and roomy. There is a nice bar area just beyond the lobby and we enjoyed a few games on the full sized snooker table. We didn't eat in the restaurant but ordered room service for breakfast one day which was nice.  All in all a wonderful stay and I would recommend without hesitation. We were on a month long trip around Australia and this was our favourite hotel.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467695491~“Fabulous decor and ambience downstairs”~Loved my business stay here, very attentive staff, great areas for sitting and relaxing downstairs, perfect location, delicious in room breakfast, great bathroom and facilities, in fact would never stay anywhere else in Melbourne if only for one thing. I left my brand new watch behind and even called on the same day as check out and it could never be found, that was really disappointing but I suppose it happens..... Went back to ask a month later and still nothing so it must have been a great find for someone. Not the hotel's fault but the cleaner should probably have found it and reported it to lost property.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467352025~“Worth visiting ”~After a difficult start the team has been very helpful. So congrats to all of them and especially to Sahil who made this stay a good one. For all first time travelers to this property, please have in mind this is an old Building - beautifully restored in and out but is stuck in between two low rise parkings so the majority of the room do not enjoy day light or close to none. Only the one facing facing Flinders Street are enjoying this. I personally enjoyed the old wooden parquet flooring, the nice decor and this includes the bed side lamp, the wooden parquet also in the bathroom. The mattress are of very good quality for a good restful sleep. All in all a great stay. Last but not least as stated earlier this is an old building and even though it has been well restored there is no gym or pool. All these facilities are in nearby Accor hotels, but still within walking distance.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466586847~“Very nice boutique hotel”~This is my second stay at Lindrum. Great staff, friendly and helpful. Rooms are well appointed and good size. Clean and safe Great location.

review_465448027~“Great boutique Hotel in Melbourne CBD”~Huge room. Big bathroom. Views not good given its location boxed between buildings but front rooms must have good views over towards sports area. Great vibe. Excellent location. Named after pool player Walter Lindrum, so yes there is a large pool table in the lobby to have a game. We will stay there again next time we need a hotel in Melbs.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465220804~“Very good hotel”~We arrived late from England. The lady in reception was very pleasant and welcoming. She said we had been upgraded and, as a result, we had a large comfortable room with a settee. The hotel is situated on the City Circle tram line with a stop very near which takes one within striking distance of most points in the CBD. To make things even better the tram is free. The hotel is within walking distance of some of the wall art, the arcades and the lanes and the station.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_464874893~“Fantastic”~I travel a lot for business and stay in many different hotels and locations, looking for value for money. I had the pleasure if staying at this hotel due it now being part of Accor. What a great find, a small classy hotel with friendly staff, nice atmosphere, good room service menu and selection for breakfast. Must say the food I had 1) Fish & 1) steak where top quality. I have already booked my return stay it is in a great location and the free tram operates to my office in Docklands.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_463649822~“Hidden Gem”~In the heart of Melbourne but without the inner city grind. Close to transport as well as the river and a lovely park so plenty of opportunities to get out and enjoy this lovely city. Loved this place! Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Breakfast is an absolute stand out. Delicious! Would have liked to have tried dinner but the hotel is walking distance to so many amazing restaurants! Service is a delight. Breakfast managed almost single handedly by a bubbly and efficient waitress. I wish I remembered her name! Front desk staff and management equally lovely without any Melbourne pretentiousness that sometimes sneaks in. Will absolutely be back when I travel to Melbourne for business and pleasure. Such a lovely change from the usual chain hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463559373~“Boutique Hotel”~Hotell Lindrum is very well located close to restaurants and shopping in the center of Melbourne. A garage is next door which is very convenient. The rooms are nice and clean and you sleep well. Breakfast is adequate and dinner can also be had, On our last day there were many guests so the staff at the breakfast was a bit undermanned but that is easy to live with. The only drawback was that on the first evening when we got back to the room there was another unwanted guest in the bathtub, and quite a large one at that. He/she was quickly disposed of in the toilet. Apart from that our stay was nice and relaxing.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_462864449~“Such potential and such a disappointment ”~All was fine when we arrived. Staff seemed unfamiliar with the history of the hotel, I informed them of my playing pool here some 40 years ago. Room was ok but overpriced, have stayed at many boutique hotels and this definitely didn't have the feel. Trying to organise room service we were basically told that we should have hung our menu on the door overnight and they can do room service but prefer we come downstairs otherwise it could take quite a long time. So basically we were disuaeded from putting in an order they wouldn't try to provide in any type of timely manner. Some type of drain pipe ran every couple of hours waking my wife and I both up. The view of the car park which was our only view didn't really seem to justify the steep price. One hotel we won't be returning too~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462793592~“Complimentary Egg Shells”~Been here a few times for dinner. Excellent food.  First time here for breakfast buffet, unsure if it's worth coming back for anything but dinner.  Huevos Rancheros Baked Eggs took an hour to serve, and was unspectacular. That's slightly acceptable as there was a selection of buffet sides. Less acceptable would be the waiter getting an item wrong for the group (albeit dish was apologised for and made free), and the side of egg shell on both my and another's dish. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462580960~“Nice but not a lot of natural light”~It's a lovely friendly hotel, boutique, but it is owned by Accor who I think could put a bit more boutique in it. The rooms are dark with lots of carpark views and not a lot of natural light which I find annoying if I were there for other than business, but for business it is fine as I'm out during the day. The breakfast offering is weak although if you a la carte and it is freshly cooked it is slightly better. Wine selection at the bar good and it has a lovely boutique feel to it and is centrally located with great local restaurants around it.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_461388692~“Best Bed Ever!”~We arrived after about 33hrs of travelling to be welcomed into a very plush and comfortable hotel. I then proceeded to sleep for 12 hrs in what I can only describe as one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The room was very nice indeed and the staff extremely helpful and flexible. Great location - very close to Flinders Street Station and the city centre. Loved the place and would definitely return to the Lindrum. Nice to play snooker again after about 20 yrs as well!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460896659~“Outstanding stay - great location, great room, great staff”~Arguably one of the best hotel stays over the past 20+ I've done over the last year, simply being one of those places where everything simply "worked". Location of the hotel is superb on the edge of the CBD, with excellent selection of restaurants in walking distance and easy tram connections more broadly. Layout of the room was outstanding for both working and relaxing in-room, and hotel design overall was stylish but still exquisitely functional. Staff was incredibly helpful and professional, from front desk providing pointers to Melbourne's transit system to restaurant & bar service being on point. Simply put, everything worked nicely from start to finish --- ideal experience.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_459727747~“Great Location and Gracious Service”~I stayed for a week on business in a junior suite. The room is laid out nicely with room to relax or work and not feel like you are sitting on your bed. This was a repeat visit and both times the rooms while having plenty of windows faced an alley limiting the amount of natural light coming into the room. I will have to check to see if they have the junior suites with a street facing view to get more light but having said that the room was quiet and the room was primarily for sleeping and not working. The location is convenient to the CBD or many attractions but not in the middle of everything providing a more secluded feel. The breakfast was good and all the menu items were well done. The continental buffet is a little pricey for what you get but probably in line with the market. I had dinner at the hotel on one night and found it to be very nice. Service is good and the staff are friendly and helpful. If you have any problems they are very accommodating. The internet was efficient and had no problems. Housekeeping was done promptly. The hotel is showing some age and would recommend they consider an upgrade of carpet and room furnishings within the next few years to keep the hotel competitive. As indicated this was a repeat stay and still highly recommend it.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458991116~“I'm a regular at the lindrum ”~I'm a regular at the lindrum hotel. I stay there whenever in town, I make my staff stay there, I had my first night of my honeymoon there, and I'm a general promoter of the hotel to friends and family. What happened - was it a management change? I don't know.  I checked in this month with a staff member and was asked to fill out some paperwork. I politely asked if I need to fill out the paperwork (address and contact details etc), asked if I could provide my M Accor membership details and I could be found in the computer because I stay here a bit. I was told: "No, you booked through Expedia." ...How about a welcome back? He's an assistant manager too. Surely there's some training to be friendly.  Later that night I returned to the hotel from being out to dinner and as I walked in there was staring assessment to see if we are guests, and then front desk got back to what they were doing. Again, no warmth.  The reason I stay at boutique hotels is because of the people. A smile. A warm hello. A welcome back. The old manager Matt would remember me by face and ask how my wife is. Big difference to getting less than a smile and a welcome back.  Sadly if I don't feel like I'm returning to my home away from home when arriving, you've lost your point of difference to other hotels in Melbourne so I'm moving on.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457502545~“Fabulous boutique hotel”~I stayed here a week ago for 3 nights as my second visit in the last 4 months. I could not fault anything at the hotel again on this visit either. The rooms are beautifully appointed, large and comfortable beds, clean bathroom with good shower and toiletries and the restaurant does very good food too. The staff are just amazing people who are professional and helpful but kind and friendly with it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good place to stay in Melbourne and would go back again if I had to visit Melbourne.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455537304~“Really lovely boutique hotel. Would not hesitate to recommend.”~The title says it all. The longer review follows: 1. Location - Excellent. On Flinders street, easy walk to theatres, restaurants, or (in our case) the Rod Laver arena to watch the Australian Open tennis. 2. Room & facilities - Very good. No pool, but gym access nearby. Reception area is compact but doesn't need to be huge. Bar as well as restaurant downstairs, and a full size pool table free to use. Room we had (110) was a good size with no view but very little noise even though on first floor (accessed via lift or a short flight of stairs from the reception area). Curtains kept out light well, and interior was very well lit. Large walk in shower with separate hose and 'rain shower' heads. Quiet fridge, quality toiletries, comfortable bed, good selection of pillows plus a pillow menu. T2 tea bags, and plunger coffee available on request. Power points near bed to plug chargers in for mobiles. Our *only* suggestion for improvement with the room would be to review the bathroom - water pressure was too low for the shower, and the glass shower door didn't quite close completely which allowed water to get on floor in bathroom. Exhaust fan also didn't always seem to work. 3. Food - Excellent. 24 hour room service menu of selected meals available, larger range of choices in the evening, plus the ability to also order food from the 'Felt' restaurant downstairs to be delivered to the room. Prices seemed reasonable for a hotel. We had the breakfast included, which meant we could choose one dish from the breakfast menu as well as anything from the small buffet. Also included T2 tea or plunger coffee (espresso available for small additional cost). Food was well presented and of high quality - so much so we would consider coming back just to eat there. 4. Service - Excellent. Check in and out was fast and professional. Everyone we spoke with seemed friendly and helpful. So overall I'd like to thank the team at the Lindrum for such a warm welcome, and making our stay so pleasant. It really felt less hotel like, and more like staying at a stately home or club. It actually reminded me a little of some Relais & Châteaux properties I've stayed at in the past in Europe. I don't know when, but we will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_454382862~“Mum and daughters night away”~Excellent room and lovely bar to have drinks. Staff also friendly. The location was very central for great restaurants and cafes. The parking was just next door and only $16 per night. We would definitely come again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_453508109~“Nice Hotel Good Location”~We arrived here with luggage to find there are no porters which meant lugging our cases up several steps to the front door. Check in was smooth and efficient and we were soon on our way to our room. The room was a Junior suite which isn't a suite at all but a big room with some lounge furniture. Having said that it was very nice with a big comfy bed. The bathroom however was not so good - a shower over the bath isn't good enough for this class of hotel. Breakfast was fairly basic but nice enough with hot and cold choices and service was good. Location of the hotel is good, being a few minutes walk from Fed Square. Were we to return to Melbourne we would be quite happy to stay at the Hotel Lindrum again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_448851312~“Hotel Lindrum Melbourne offers a great location with very reasonable room rates.”~The Hotel Lindrum M Gallery has the best location in Melbourne with spacious rooms and very friendly service.

review_448421977~“A Keeper”~Nice boutique hotel. First impressions positive. Reception was notably friendly, helpful, and thoughtful both before and on arrival. The main entrance to the hotel is on Flinders Street and up some steps, which wasn’t ideal with heavy bags but manageable. Having somebody at the main entrance to help would have been a nice touch. There is a restaurant area just inside the entrance and by reception which I didn’t use. They appeared to be busy but not overly so. The room was a generous size with everything required provided. Nicely set out but starting to show some wear. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was also a generous size with a good shower and nice amenities. Towels and robes new and fresh. The bath was compact. Room 404 faced a brick wall but this wasn’t an issue for me. The location is a good one for the CBD, with Parliament Station five minutes walk and Flinders Street ten minutes walk (there were a number of homeless people outside Flinders Station which I hadn’t noticed on previous trips, some of which were a little aggressive, so you might want to factor that into your plans). There is a park a minute’s walk from the hotel and a number of tram stops. Good cafes etc on Flinders Lane. Reasonable value for money, I’d happily stay again.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_446527076~“Hotel Lindrum feels like HOME.”~From the time I walked in to this boutique hotel, I was extremely excited and happy. Vintage decoration with a high standard quality, lobby is a bit small but welcoming.  Check-in staff is very friendly and professional. The Christmas Tree in the waiting room is gorgeous and fit in the area so well! I booked a studio room on level 4. The room is much bigger than what I expected. The queen bed is very supportive and comfortable, pillows are also soft and great! Beautiful view to see the Flinder Street from my room. Love the decoration, furniture, amenities as well!  When I got back to hotel after dinner, I believe hotel staff been to my room shut the blinds, turn off the TV, remade the bed for sleep, and turn down the light; which was absolutely excellent! I just felt like I walked into my own bedroom back home ready for a good sleep. Thank you! :) Check out is easy and fast if you have paid the room on arrivals.  I certainly enjoyed the room, the service, and even the little pack of welcome biscuits! Will definitely come back to stay again and will recommend to friends and family in the future. :) PS: just a little thing to state, when used the towels, there were heaps of little fluff came off and stick on the skin; which was a bit annoying.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_445127277~“Cheeky weekend wedding fun n games in Melbourne”~+: large, spacious room, super comfy bed, refined interior design to hotel and room, very helpful and friendly staff (almost Japanese in terms of attentiveness and courtesy), personalised feel to service given small number of guests (only 59 rooms). -: patchy internet connection, slightly wimpy waterfall shower pressure, lack of onsite gym (they have preferential deal with Sofitel about 7 mins walk away) Conclusion: I recommend this hotel for couples/family leisure trips and not for business trips. At peak times (check in/out) the ratio of staff to guests might feasibly annoy the time poor corporate traveller who might not value the Lindrum's personalised service approach. Mon - Fri I would probably prefer to stay at a larger, international chain style hotel with an onsite gym, robust internet and more staff. On my own time though, I am so happy to have stayed at the Lindrum because it is precisely all the things that I want to get away from when I'm not wearing the suit! I was glad there was no gym because I didn't feel guilty about all the unbalanced eating and drinking I did :-) I didn't mind the patchy internet because I wasn't glued to the laptop :-) I loved the oasis like calm of the place, the fact that it's a block away from the main action, I loved that the staff are all capable of holding an interesting conversation :-) I love that it's not the *insert name of nice hotel where your employer sends you M-F* :-)~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_440253701~“Weekend in the city”~Wow..the big brown door opens to an unique area. The smell hits you and makes you feel relaxed as you step inside. The area is small but utilised well. The staff on the desk were friendly and welcoming. Once checked in we went to our room. Felt roomy and homely. A shame about the view of a concrete wall. The bed was extremely comfortable with pillows that just moulded to my head it felt amazing. The bathroom floor was wooden boards and I instantly fell in love. The shower was over the bath which I'm not a fan of but I admit it's probably the best shower over the bath I've ever had. The step into the shower was not to high, I never felt like I was going to slip over and the shower pressure was delightful. We never ate at the restaurant so we can not offer advise for that, however the menu did look interesting. All in all would definitely recommend this lovely hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440026493~“A Pleasant Oasis”~We have stayed at several MGallery hotels around the world. This property measures up very well. Not big by comfortable and very well presented. Staff are very friendly, helpful and efficient. Given the location there are really no views to be had from the guest rooms. This minor inconvenience is more than offset by well appointed and comfortable guest rooms. The restaurant is small but pleasant. The breakfast was a disappointment. Over cooked breakfast was unappealing but there was a good selection of other offerings. Overall a very good boutique hotel experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_437702819~“Surprisingly Good!”~A two-week business trip to Sydney and Melbourne can leave you a bit frayed at the edges. Melbourne was my last stop on my trip, and must admit that I was not really expecting very much when my secretary booked this hotel. I suppose when you don’t expect greatness, the pleasant shock of staying in a hotel that contained nothing-but welcoming staff with a rather ‘homely feel’ can make anyone who is tired and jaded feel better. The Lindrum, from what I could understand, used to be a pool or snooker hall. It was renovated into a hotel under the Accor brand, and to their credit, the hotel retains a degree of small intimate escape, mainly as there are only four floors, but not many bedrooms.  The lobby has a very very small bar, with a lovely gas fire for those cold wet days when I was there. There is a restaurant, which almost feels as if it was added an afterthought or a separate business, despite it being part of the hotel. It’s a rather grey room that lacks any kind of warmth, although the staff make up for that to a degree. The food, while good, seems to depend on a modern rustic approach to food preparation, so much so that the bread (no matter which kind you take) will breaks fillings out of your mouth because it is so darn hard. Eggs Benedict on a concrete slice of bread does not appeal, nor does their in room dining menu which lacks what the busy business traveller needs – a burger, soup or a sandwich! The rooms a spacious, although it seems most rooms face the wall of the next building based on the age of the hotel and its previous occupants. A very pleasant room, with the quirk that all the floors are original floorboards from the old pool hall. This is lovely, yet when people walk along the corridor at night, the creek of the floors seems to end up deep in the middle of your bedroom! The Location is perfect for sightseeing or business travel as its right in the middle of the CBD.  I think the only fault I would give this hotel is the lack of a business centre; although the staff were more than willing to help print documents. Also, the bar area is too small, and the removal of a very large pool table that seemingly never got used would actually make the place much more relaxing and give the hotel extrea revenue. A small oasis of joy and somewhere I will go back again in due course.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_437552014~“Loved it!”~Excellent customer service - very warm welcome when we arrived, feeling rather travel weary, in the early morning. Lovely room. Excellent breakfast. Quiet location. Free tram service just across the road. Easy walk to city centre.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_434542754~“Superb hotel”~I stayed for 5 nights at this hotel recently and loved it. The staff are very helpful and polite. The restaurant and rooms are all really good. Breakfast was very good and the coffee just fab. The room and bathroom were clean and spacious. I could not find a single thing to fault in this place. Book a room facing the wall so you get no street noise.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

Didn't eat here but menu looked good  Overall nice stay and very friendly and helpful staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433831189~“Prime Position ”~This boutique hotel is a stone's throw from many of Melbourne's iconic sporting venues and walking distance to the shopping precinct, Chinatown and great restaurants. Our checkin was efficient, our room although at the rear of the building which meant it was a little dark, had excellent facilities, great bedding, superior toiletries and for once an extremely well lit bathroom with an exceptionally good hairdryer. Breakfast was not included in our deal but I would highly recommend it for its variety and reasonable cost. The Hotel Lindrum is a great little hotel with excellent staff and although there is no onsite car parking there is a large car park next door with which the hotel has an arrangement. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_432520862~“Excellent location, great hotel”~We spent 4 nights at the Hotel Lindrum in October and found it to be really well located. It is walking distance to Flinders St Station, Federation Square and to the laneways and arcades. There are a lots of nice restaurants nearby as well. There is also a tram stop directly outside the hotel.  The hotel itself is beautifully presented - the front door is amazing and the common areas and rooms are all decorated in an elegant, understated style. We had a superior room and this was very spacious with plenty of storage and seating in addition to a large comfortable bed.  There was a plague of mosquitos in Victoria whilst we were staying and reception were very helpful when I got bitten, offering to spray the room for us and suggesting a bite cream to stop the itching!  Breakfast was lovely - great choice of hot options as well as a buffet of cold items to choose from.  Overall, excellent hotel in an excellent location and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we are lucky enough to come back to Melbourne.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_428857757~“Room overlooking multi storey car park with daily early morning bin refuse noise”~I can't believe this is 5 star hotel. Do not stay in room 213. There is a small window with curtains permanently drawn as it has the Wilson public car park behind! Daily bin refuse collections start at 7am with reversing of vehicle noises and horns. The carpet runner in reception is filthy. The toilet roll holder kept falling off, the air con didn't work. The coffee and milk weren't topped up. The only good thing was the comfortable bed.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427819275~“Worth considering instead of one of the big hotels”~A change of room to one at the front of the hotel with no fuss set the scene for a very enjoyable overnight stay. We appreciated the proximity to all of the things we were interested in seeing during our weekend in the city. The view from our room over to the Botanic Gardens and the MCG was delightful and we were impressed with the rooms decor and amenities The staff were friendly and helpful, including the waiting staff at breakfast, which was excellent.  We were glad we made the decision to pay for a late check out at 4pm as we enjoyed spending extra time in this very comfortable hotel. We would suggest that the large open fire in the bar area be lit as we returned for a night cap after our dinner and we would have appreciated the ambience, can't see the point of it being there if it wasn't used! Small quibble because we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lindrum~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_427149389~“Good botique hotel for business travellers, even for cricket lovers.”~M-Gallery hotels are well managed by Sofitel. Lindrum is one of them. We stayed for the first time and booked this one as our previous stay at The Grand Hotel was not very pleasant although the staff was good and responsive. This hotel is a bit away from CBD and MCEC, but is quiet, cosy and have attentive staff. Right from reception, breakfast, room service and bar were excellent. Recommend for business travellers.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_425599216~“A disappointing 3 nights' stay - definitely not a 5 star hotel”~We had driven from Sydney round the coast to The Great Ocean Road and then drove up to Melbourne for 3 nights. Our room definitely did not meet our expectations.  We had decided on the hotel from having seen the hotel website photos, all of which had been very professionally lit. Our 'Superior' room was not as on the website, with daylight streaming through the window. It was like a prison cell, with a wall approx 10 foot from the window which was fitted with bars and with absolutely no chance of any sunlight at all. Because there were public steps outside the room, we also had to keep the curtain drawn to prevent anyone looking into the room. (If we had wanted to open/close the curtains, we had to climb on to the bed as the window was behind the headboard!) The bathroom had both a rain shower head and a modern shower fitting. While the website advertises the rain shower head, it was only the modern wall fitting shower head that worked. On our first evening we chose to dine in. The restaurant was not not even 1/3 full, yet we had to wait a lengthy time to be served our order. We were thankful that the chef was not having to cook for a full restaurant. This is definitely not a 'stylish boutique' 5 star hotel as advertised. With 59 rooms, there must be fewer than 10 rooms with a view - the remainder have a wall as a view. For those rooms that do have a view, the hotel overlooks a busy road which also has trams running on it. The interior lighting was not as per the website, much more gloomy than the website pictures.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~4~3~nan
review_424635134~“Great stay, wonderful staff”~We stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Lindrum last week. It was smaller than I expected but this added to the warmth and friendliness of the Hotel. Our room was very large with high ceilings, a very comfortable bed, plenty of seating in the room and a good size bathroom with nice amenities. The hotel was nice and quiet and all areas were keep immaculately clean. We felt so relaxed and comfortable staying at the hotel. We ate in the restaurant one night the meal was delicious and the service very friendly. We also enjoyed a drink at the bar and a few games of billiards on the special table.  What sets this hotel apart is the outstanding staff. They are so friendly and always wiling to help out with plans and bookings. They treat you as a personal guest and willing to chat about your day or plans. We were allowed to check in early to our room and permitted to stay for late checkout before leaving. We will definitely be back to stay at Hotel Lindrum.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_421906488~“Wonderful base to explore Melbourne from”~We stayed four nights here recently on a girlfriend's shopping trip. My Junior Suite was fantastic! Luxurious and comfortable. The amenities (toiletries, bathrobes, quality of tea and coffee) were spot on. I loved the turn down service-sleepy time tea and shortbread biscuits. Staff were very pleasant and helpful-turning down the air-con and providing a different pillow. The room was quiet and immaculate. We didn't dine at the restaurant-too many other choices, but from what I saw, the breakfast buffet looked inviting, fresh and plentiful. A really lovely stay and I will come back!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_419955475~“Outstanding service and quality- One of the best hotels in Melbourne”~Our spontaneous stay at the Hotel Lindrum was one of the most joyous experiences I've had staying in Melbourne. The service was incredible, warm and welcoming.  The design and hotel interiors were divine, a very sophisticated and unpretentious hotel. The pace to stay if you appreciate the finer details in life, tea and biscuits on pillows, plunger coffee and a morning paper.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_419685137~“Great meals and great service”~So impressed we ate here twice and can't recommend it enough. Other then the distinctive door which, no I'll leave it to you to find out for yourselves. Should also mention it's worth hearing the history of the place and why it has a billiards table out back. Didn't make sense until I heard the story. We were served and looked after the sweet, capable and very competent Evie for both our visits. She ensured our wedding anniversary meal was memorable for all the right reasons right down to a surprise at the end of our meal. Impressive when they didn't know until we arrived. They also made our second visit just as worthwhile. The meals were great. Love my meat and had the ribeye the first night and lamb the second. My wife enjoyed the lavish flavours of their signature dish both nights. Something the Melbourne Accor hotels seem to be doing, or at least the ones we visited. It's worth hearing the story behind the signature dish too. Must mention all the desserts were great, especially the bread and butter pudding. It had me so bad we needed a taxi to get me home I was so full. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417368699~“Nice hotel but lacking a little”~My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Lindrum for 3 nights and though it was a lovely hotel, lovely staff and generally fine it did lack a little. Location wise it is on Flinders St, but right at the far end, but still walking distance to restaurants and bars. We were upgraded to a Superior room. The room itself was very large and the bed extremely comfortable. Our view was directly into a multi-storey carpark, so the curtains remained closed! The bathroom was also a let down. Being a 5 star hotel i expected more. It was an old style bathroom with a shower/bath that fitted 1 person, the lights were dodgy with the over mirror lights only turning on when they felt like it. Simply for the price and the perception as a boutique / unique hotel they could do better.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_416996732~“Comfortable and a but different”~Have stayed at the Lindrum a few times, both work and pleasure. I like the hotel but it's not for everyone. The rooms are very comfortable and large, quite comfortable and luxurious. The bathrooms let them down a little as they are not great, a bit dated and most rooms have the shower in the bath ... And it doesn't work that well ... But having said that, it is still better than many I've stayed in. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Downstairs bar area is really nice for a nite cap after going out. Restaurant is good, food quality has been generally good, service may be a little slow but it's probably not the place you go for a nite out. I've eaten there on a few occasions by myself so really wanted to get in/out quickly and it tend to drag out a bit. i like the hotel as its not huge and busy .. There were not groups of blokes or bus loads of people, so I really enjoyed that sort of boutique style of hotel. I suggest it's a winner for a romantic get away or people who appreciate a nice hotel ... it's not your modern funky place but has class and warmth.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_416686294~“Well-serviced hotel near the park and train station”~Providing full hotel services, excellent service, and large, quiet rooms, Hotel Lindrum is a great option in the CBD. Opened some time ago as Melbourne's landmark boutique hotel, the decor is a little tired but this is more than made up for by the quality of the services. It's location, too, is excellent -- right near Federation Square (with ACMI and the Ian Potter galleries), Melbourne's central train station (Flinders Street), the graffiti of hardware lane, and the excellent restaurants and shopping on Little Collins Street. All in all -- worth the stay.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_416288211~“So Disappointing ”~I have never been more disappointed in a hotel, I love to stay at unique boutique hotels & the other reviews are good so I was really looking forward to it, it's clear that not everyone has the same experience.  On arrival the service was reasonably welcoming but the reception area that would have once been charming now looks well, just a bit tired & grubby. We chose a Junior Suite on the third floor which looks onto the alleyway which is not good at all & quite oppressive, in hindsight we should have checked about the outlook. The room itself smells like the rugs & upholstery need a good clean & need replacing, the layout of the room is also very dated & again oppressive, the air conditioning is effective but noisy, the bathroom is old & not in a charming way again in need of an upgrade.  I did enquire about a change of room, ideally with a view, the receptionist just looked a bit embarrassed was sorry that we felt this way but other rooms were fully booked, to be honest after a long journey I was too tired to question it further & will make the most of it. On the upside the bed is very comfortable with great sheets & pillows. So..... if you choose this hotel it's not quite what it seems, clearly most people have good experiences but I can't recommend it & definitely wouldn't book again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414407420~“Iconic Boutique Hotel”~This was our second stay, my wife and I and our 10 yr old son. A beautiful hotel in a historic building, previously the famous Lindrums Snooker Hall. Rooms are large and comfortable, with a day couch for smaller children if required. We got a rollaway this time which was great. Bar area and full size snooker table are great and all the staff were excellent and very friendly. We had breakfast in the restaurant, expensive and nothing special but other than that an awesome place to stay. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_408073202~“Lovely service and appealing decor.”~I frequently visit Melbourne usually staying with family, but this time had to spend one night in a hotel and picked Hotel Lindrum because of its location and positive reviews. Hotel Lindrum did not disappoint. My flight was late so I was late meeting a friend at the hotel. When I rang, she said she was having a lovely time in front of the fire sipping coffee, chatting and reading. All good. I thought the level of service was very good in all areas. I liked the décor, particularly the corridors which in hotels are often anonymously grim. The room and bathroom were everything I would expect and very comfortable. I ate in the dining room,with again, very pleasant service and an appealing room. The location of course is marvelous and I would certainly stay there again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_406851621~“Almost perfect in the imperfect world!”~Friendly and helpful bar and reception staff are the absolute standout for this lovely hotel. Add beautifully renovated old building, funky and spacious rooms, great bed and good location, then we have an almost perfect hotel.  We asked about restaurants near by for dinner when we arrived. Clear recommendations were offered and a booking was made for us straight away - very efficient and helpful. When we asked for a late checkout, the response was instantaneous - "Yes, certainly! There was no dragging feet of "I must ask the Manager, or I will have to check and get back to you". They could have made it absolutely perfect by adding thicker and softer towels and the hot water system that does not oscillate between too hot to too cold every three minutes or so. BUT, I can easily put up with these things for everything else this hotel had to offer.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

The bed was very comfortable and the hotel supplied hypoallergenic bedding ready for my arrival, which was great.  The staff really were excellent and this is the main reason I'm giving a positive review. They were all very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure I had what I needed and my stay was comfortable. They even arranged for me to use a room to freshen up before I travelled to the airport in the evening after I had checked out! I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a quality hotel in the centre of Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397758561~“Classy Boutique Hotel at the top end of Town”~As you open the huge timber door you know you are in for a unique experience of luxury Intimate reception and personalised service are number one A hotel with character and history - let you find out for yourself. Natural old timber floors and centre carpet with distinctive charm and exclusive décor. Enjoy a drink at the bar or play on the big table ( What ? - find out for yourself ) Some tips: If coming by car, Park at the Crown Metropol Multilevel Carpark for $16 for 24 hours overnight. Walk the fascinating Promenade to Flinders street. Get the free tram up Flinders Street to outside the Hotel. Do the Brown tram ride at night for the whole circle and see glorious Melbourne with commentary.  Walk around the corner into Spring St and Collins Street for the Theatres Great Walk past Parliament House and the Fitzroy Gardens Summer or Winter Breakfast with choices at a reasonable rate at the Hotel Adequate rooms and well appointed.

review_395185439~“Well-situated and comfortable”~From reading previous reviews, I knew that some rooms looked out on a car park or a wall, and some looked out across the river. I made sure to book the latter, and it was a really beautiful and well-designed room.  The staff are young and some are more attentive than others. The public spaces are terrific. Breakfast was very good, and we were greeted with a plate of sweets in our room as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary with this trip. The hotel is very well situated for exploring the city. You can catch several trams, including the free circular line that tours the central part of town, right in front of the hotel. You can walk to much of the compact downtown, including other tram lines. There is no place to leave a car when checking in - we parked on the street around the corner, but it was a Sunday. This could be tricky during the week.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_394219783~“loverly hotel with very friendly staff.”~Stayed 2 nights ,15th and 16th July. I would like to start with the staff were all friendly and looked after us very well. Dinner and service was fantastic. Breakfast very slow and things that were asked for were never received but the cooked breakfast was very good. The young ladies who looked after us were lovely and did there best as breakfast was very busy at that time. Our room 302, bathroom tiles / grout need a good clean as mould or dirt showing. In saying all this the room was big not to noisy as we did face Flinders street. Over all we had a very nice stay with some very nice staff from the time we booked in to when we left. We would return again.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_394108394~“Disappointing ... but redeemed in the end.”~Our initial experiences at the hotel were far from what you'd expect at a five star rated hotel. Our taxi dropped us off right out the front, but there was no bellman to meet us to welcome us to the hotel or take our bags ... rather we had to lug them up the stairs to the foyer of the hotel.  After checking in, again no one offered to help us with our bags to the room. Of course, I'm totally fine to take my own bag, but at a five star hotel, you would expect the courtesy to be offered a hand.  The foyer is lovely, with double height ceilings, and is nicely decorated. Our room was decent, with nice furnishings, however the window looked directly into a wall so having the blind open wasn't overly pleasant, and having it down provided little light into the room. Upon returning to our room after dinner, there was a distinct smell as though someone had used our bathroom. A call downstairs advised us that there were no other rooms available, however they would send someone up to freshen up the room. A bit of air spray later, and that was all they could do. They advised us they may be able to move us the following night. The following afternoon the stench was back, so we were advised they could move us to another room and to pack our bags. We did so, and a new room key was delivered to us, yet again there was NO help offered to move our bags to the other room. When the cleaning gentleman came to refresh the room, he kindly offered to help us (which was so kind of him to go out of his way). The new room they put us in, was smaller than the first! And it looked directly into a carpark, so there was no chance of having an open blind! Again, we rang to ask to move rooms as we felt like we had been downgraded (!) and were told we could only have this one or our previous one (which still smelt!). The following day we were kindly upgraded to a large airy room, and the manager on duty left us a bottle of wine to enjoy for our next two evenings. The new room was great, and it did redeem the awful experience we had had for our first two nights. So a bad start .. but a good ending. It may have just been an "off" couple of days for the hotel ... I'm not too sure. Would I stay here again? Probably not.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_392346349~“Comfortable boutique hotel”~The Lindrum would have rated 5 stars if it were not for very slow service with cooked breakfast (half hour wait) and difficult to adjust shower temperature and pressure. My room was large, very comfortable and quiet. It was well equipped with seating and lighting is excellent. There's a turn-down service (not on Sunday) with 'sleeptight' tea and biscuits. Complementary newspaper to the room. Continental breakfast has a good range and food from the restaurant is delicious. Location almost opposite galleries in Federation Square, 10 minutes to Bourke Street Mall and the NGV, tram stop opposite the entrance. Intimate bar and attractive foyer. Warm, friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
