review_479098127~“Quite value for money”~Reasonable price for two bedroom suite. Location tricky for taxi, only convenient if can commute by foot. Receptionist friendly. Room clean sufficient facility for cooking. Very poorly insulated however, extreme noisy. Blind cannot shield morning light at all. Swimming pool quite cold.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_479027688~“ANZAC DAY & Collingwood Essendon match.”~Great accomodation very stylish and clean good service. Close to venues just 5-10 minute walk and then on a free city tram. Short 5 minute walk to Yarra and fantastic restaurants, there is a top market eatery foodcourt at the Casino 10 min max walk.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478835348~“Great 2 bedrooms apartment”~We booked a 2 bedroom executive apartment over Easter. It was a great apartment, spacious bedrooms, well decorated and maintained. Good location, 1 block behind south bank. Helpful reception.  Downside is its noisy from traffic below. Only has a small IGA near by. Also its main rear entrance is off main road so it was harder for taxi to locate. We booked through their website hence wifi is free for the entire stay.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_478706330~“We had a great Easter Break”~I stayed with my family during Easter break and had a great time. The room was very clean, nice and tidy with modern decor. The location was just right for our family to travel to south bank,crown and eureka. Our room had a nice view. My kids enjoyed. The bed was very comfortable. The washing machine and dishwasher came very handy. All staff were helpful. Especially Marika, who checked us in was very helpful. Only downside is parking is from the back road which might be confusing for 1st timer but we will stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_478692129~“Great for a night or two out in Melbourne CBD, close to Crown Casino”~Beautifully appointed modern decor, spacious & very comfortable. Situated in Southbank within walking distance to Crown Casino complex, very handy. Only negatives, was where to park when checking in, as out the front is a Clearway, also signage for Oak's Wrap is not great, if you do not know the area well, you can get lost very easily. Reception OK, a little frosty & no pass given to get to Car Park level, this is very annoying! One other small thing, no champagne glasses available, considering it is a self contained apartment & they have a bar near the lobby, #Please explain!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_477835593~“One night in Melbourne - perfect spot”~One quick night in Melbourne before the Yarra Valley trip. We have stayed here a few times before and really can't beat it's location. Parking is also really good too.  We can walk everywhere from here and haven't felt the need for cabs or Uber.  Great room, facilities and service with a stunning view. My only note was that there is no pod coffee machine that I could find. Would really help. I really recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477605540~“ESTER BREAK IN MELBOURNE”~We arrived early at the Oaks and were told that the room was ready so it was so pleasant to be able to off load bags before a walk on Southbank. We were also offered un upgrade as we had been before and it was suggested that direct booking would have saved some money.The room we were offered on level 29 was much larger than level 5.The shower was well thought out and the glass soap dish did not impact on my hips when turning around in the shower. The space could have fit 2-3 people comfortablly and the shower was easy to turn on and off without getting water on my hand- taps were positioned very thoughtfully.A person size 14- 28 would be quite comfortable using this bathroom amenities.The power points in the shower room were positioned behind the mirror .  The bed was a king and the bedroom separated from the living / kitchen area -very spacious feeling about the whole studio apartment. the whole room was neat and clean. the booking in and out was efficient and pleasant . After book out we were offered extra parking time for no extra money so that we could enjoy a breakfast on Southbank. .the whole experience was great - only down side is the entry to parking is behind the hotel and very steep access but once parked -very clean and easy to get around. I didnt see a wheel chair access to the lifts from the car park but if needing to stay ring ahead and ask for the best way to enter if in a wheelchair . Love the position of this hotel and the staff helpfulness.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_476976706~“Fantasic”~My partner and I stayed here on a short trip to Melbourne and it was just perfect. The staff were great to deal with always attending to you promptly. The room was huge and equipped with a full kitchen and the king bed was so comfy. Walking distance to the city and Southbank to beautiful restaurants. We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Melbourne, very happy ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476289317~“Absolutely fantastic!! ”~My partner and I stayed at Oaks WRAP for 2 nights and couldn't be happier. Room was amazing (1 bedroom apartment) with best views over looking yarra river and on other side the bay!! Views from balcony and bedroom were something that we will definitely go back for. The room was immaculate and extremely clean and modern.  The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Especially Tim and Marika, their service went beyond a smile and our weekend away was perfect, thank you both for your help and kindness.. It really made our stay unforgettable :) we will definitely be seeing you again in near future. Cheers Sarah and Dave~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475922150~“Well located”~We stayed here for 2 nights while in Melbourne and had a 2 bedroom apartment which was fantastic great layout and to our surprise came with 2 bathrooms which was fantastic also has dishwasher, washing machine fully equipped kitchen as with most apartments. We had a small balcony with which you could see the MCG we were located on the 35th floor, everything was clean and tidy staff were friendly the only thing was we got there early and we knew check in was not till 2pm which is fine and the guy behind the desk told us no rooms are ready but if your willing to pay 80.00 extra he could get us an apartment immediately what the.... we waited till 2pm. Also Wi fi is only free for half an hour per 24hrs so after half an hour you will be charged resets after 24hrs.~5~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_475670774~“Wish we could have stayed longer”~Have to say it was the cost that attracted us to this hotel. We made a late booking for Good Friday so at $140 a night we were happy. We were even happier when our room was a one bedroom apartment, very tastefully decorated and only 5-10 minute walk to Southbank. The lobby area is very cosy, so much so that we decided to have breakfast instead of wandering to Southbank. Definitely recommend this place at that price. And breakfast was delicious.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474419049~“Comfortable apartment close to Melbourne CBD and Crown Casino”~We stayed overnight after going to a show in the city and found the apartment to be very comfortable and well located. Would suit one or two people staying for extended stays as it had a separate bedroom, dishwasher, washing machine/dryer, microwave, stove top, toaster and full size fridge.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_474376837~“Three night stay”~We travel to Melbourne for the football and stayed at Wrap. Booked a studio but think we got a 1 bedroom it was great. Room was on 32 floor was nice and had everything we needed. Was a bit of road noise (yes even on 32 floor) but by second night didn't notice it so much. Walked everywhere even to MCG so location was great very close to casino. Room was lovely and serviced daily. Restaurant down stairs was very nice only had breakfast on last day wish we had done dinner there.. would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473984456~“Great location, good value.”~Top spot for an overnight, or extended, visit to Melbourne CBD. Situated within easy walking distance of the casino and Southbank Wrap really is a little gem. The studio apartments whilst compact are clean and well presented with full sized fridges, large wall mounted TV, washer/dryer and kitchen facilities. Sleep quality was excellent on the 15th floor and although close to the lift did not hear any extraneous noise whatsoever. Wi-Fi is free for a limited period. Check in was easy and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. If I had to fault anything it would just be the lack of towel racks / hooks in the bathroom. Would definitely stay there again.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473931096~“Will be back”~We stayed here in the 2 bedroom apartment on the 41st floor - fantastic room with and amazing balcony to soak up views of Melbourne. Wish we could have stayed longer. Cafe downstairs provided a nice vibe and breakfast to finish of our quick stay. Only very critical complaint - maybe an ensuit may have made our morning a little less chaotic. Close to the action of Melbourne - walking distance to casino and awesome restaurants & bars along the Yarra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468183600~“Great stay, close to Southbank ”~Great stay, clean tidy room, well appointed, nice balcony, efficient checkin easy walk to Southbank and all it has to offer, didn't eat at the little bar and restaurant but looked nice, value for money stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468041763~“Very good ”~I too must agree with the previous reviewer. Some people will complain about anything . These serviced apartments are great value for money offering a cost effective form of accommodation in a great position . The apartment was spacious , clean, providing good bedding and bathroom facilities . The views from the 30th floor were amazing.  If I were to have one little gripe it would be about the internet connection ,the free service only allows you 30 minutes in any one 24 hour period ,in this day and age the internet should be free for the total amount of your stay. .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467968097~“Great service and good location”~Good location being a short walk to Crown and various Southbank restaurants. Décor nice, simple and modern. On arrival we had an initial issue with our room, however upon advising reception it was immediately attended to and we were moved to another room higher up. The views were stunning! Overall we enjoyed our stay and will likely return.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_466597091~“Great Location”~I have to have a chuckle at the reviews where people are complaining about everything. I had the pleasure of staying here in a two bedroom apartment and found everything to be of a very high standard. The overall presentation was bright and tastefully done, the reception team were very polite and enthusiastic, the apartment was great, bright and had a huge balcony. Driving a large family car I had no trouble in using the parking facilities. Sorry but I have to throw one in for all the negative reviewers, I had trouble seeing the numbers inside the elevators without my glasses on. Overall would be more than happy to stay here again or recommend it to other travellers.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_465983598~“A great place to stay for a conference at the Melbourne Convention Centre or other activities in central Melbourne.”~I stayed at the Oaks Wrap for 6 days and found it to be great value for money. The staff were very helpful and informative. the apartment was fantastic value for money with amazing views. I was on the 28 floor with a balcony. The apartment has what you would expect a small gym and pool area which was clean and tidy. On the ground floor there is an external restaurant which is not part of the apartment so no room charging. There are also many other restaurants and cafes within walking distance, as well as a number of supermarkets close by. Some road noise heard late afternoon when trying to have an afternoon nap( catch up after time zone change) very quiet otherwise I will come back here for a week with my grandson due to it weekly rates and proximity to many activities.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_465433731~“Fantastic Location”~This little apartment had everything we needed for our business trip. Self contained and very clean and tidy. Our conference was at the casino and this was just a short 5 min walk over. Breakfast down stair was so yummy, but you could make your own in your room in the mini kitchen. All in all awesome stay~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464899719~“A lot of disappointments”~NOT ON SOUTHBANK. Which we were under the impression it was from it's title, but it's not. It is a couple blocks back behind Southbank on a main road.  We had 2 rooms over 5 nights each, a one bed and a two bed apartment. In BOTH of these apartments the phones didn't work at all. We really needed to communicate between apartments and outside the hotel as we had guests from the US staying. The hotel were unable to fix it and worse, we are certain they know it's like this continually but they pretend not to (or have been told to feign surprise). The complimentary wifi is complimentary only for 30 mins a day - not what we expected. Outside one side of the apartment block is a massive construction site that will be there for a long time for sure - work men looking straight into our glass walled apartment. There is no room service, no mini bar (it is written up as a hotel apartment on wotif so we thought there would be some arrangements) and the restaurant downstairs if not great, and doesn't bill to the rooms. The apartments themselves are quite nicely fitted out, but be aware that you can't stop a car outside the block as it's a main road with no stopping. All in all, we had quite a few disappointments that affected all of us quite a bit. I don't think the Oaks staff particularly cared. Would not recommend due to the above.  IF they are honest with the location, inclusions, and get things functioning, then it wouldn't be a bad place to stay - just need to be clear up front with the actual information and let guests know what they are in for.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_463825628~“Great location & very comfortable”~Nicely appointed, comfortable apartments. Those on higher floors enjoy amazing wrap around views of the city. The location is great - 5 minutes to Southbank & Southgate restaurants. Staff were friendly & helpful. Love it!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_463310211~“Great place, Great Design, Great Service, Great Quality, Great Staff”~Everything was great in this place, rooms are comfortable appartments with everything you need. Kitchen is fully equipped so it is useful if you want to cook something when coming back or at the morning. The decoration design is modern and beautiful. Location cannot be better, on the city road, just a few steps from downtown area the view from the room was nice, we could se the golden Eureka tower every morning and sunset, it was really nice!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462792410~“Overnight stay”~We had a studio apartment room. It was enough for us for a night's stay. We found that the passage way from the lift to our room was too dark! Overall, it was pretty plain & bland. The reception was very good and found that you had to pay for a car park in the hotel, pretty excessive if I must say. Otherwise it was an ok place to stay. But it is close to the casino & Southbank.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462190288~“Repeat Visitor”~Have stayed here on a number of occasions when travelling for work as it is close to the Melbourne office and am always happy with my accommodation. All of the apartments I've stayed in have full kitchen facilities but it is also a short walk to Southbank if I don't feel like cooking or have business meetings. The apartments are always clean and well presented and staff have been friendly and helpful on every visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459570118~“Great funky hotel ”~Great fresh hotel, only a few minutes walk from Southbank promenade.  The hotel is only 3yrs old, funky exposed brick lobby. With friendly and helpful staff.  We stayed in a studio room. Comfortable room for a few nights has a washing machine, oven, cooktop, iron/ironing board.  Parking at the hotel is via the rear laneway, you need to buzz reception for entry. Parking is $25 AUD per night (which is pretty good value for parking in and around Melbourne CBD).  Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459063011~“Good Choice”~We spent one night in a 1 bed apartment. The living area was quite spacious and it had a balcony. The bedroom was average in size but there was alarge walk in robe for your cases and clothes. the bathroom was adequate. The place was very well presented and clean Check in staff were extremely pleasant as was our check out person. Only a 5 minute walk to Crown and Southbank restaurants , so we were very happy. Will stay again,~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_459045861~“Central location, great amenities”~We stayed here for our anniversary and loved it. Just a short walk to Southbank and crown casino. The staff were not bad however no mention was made upon check in regarding the pool and the fact they have room service. The apartment had everything we needed. We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment on the 17th floor, has smeg appliances, foxtel and most importantly we wanted a balcony. Great views and an indoor pool and gym on the 10th floor. We caught the train there which was good from a parking perspective and just walked from Flinders street over the yarra. One of the nicer properties we have stayed in and i will definitely come back no issues.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457017856~“You want us to park where ! For $25 per night”~On arriving we were directed down a narrow street lined side to side with cement trucks trollys delivery vans etc when we did locate the carpark entrance the opening consists of a very steep incline and a lge metal gate that opens towards you so dont park too close as this nearly caused my husband to fall out of the car as he was half hanging out trying to talk to reception into letting us in  . Ok then we enter this um car park designed for thoes cars that toddlers drive with thier feet !! We did manged about 10 meters and then we had to back up to let another car passed , now we could only park in spaces with red numbers funny that all numbers look the same colour in the gloom of an underground car park no lights as no room i guess !!! So as time passed we scored a space and confirmed it was a red number !!! After a ten min work out we were in as snug as a bug...getting out was a case of breath in and wriggle a bit we had bucklys of opening the harch to get cases out so they had to be dragged out over the front seats...now for entry to the hotel through a tiny door that we nearly had a bottle neck crush because a third person wanted to come in at the same time ...yeha we had entered into a brick lined tube with lifts....door opened we entered the lift. .full to the brim with the two of us ..reception was a bit bigger brick lined tube with three very nice staff making it look crowded who i did note were very slim in keeping with the building, reception staff were lovely ; we headed to our room clean with a view (again slim) of the ocean..33rd floor !!!! I have never had a bedroom with two corridors one for each side of the bed !!!! And now for news of our balcony thats whats its called when you book your room and it give you the image of lounging out side watching the birds fly by ( 33rd floor remember! ) chilaxing with a wine..in reality it had room for one standing !!! You could if you wanted perch on the a/c unit but as this was running due to the hot weather we declined. We found the location of this skinny little vault like building to be close to resturants etc but we were pleased to leave to next morning and cast it iff like a pair of jeans two sizes too small ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456510977~“Southbank convenience”~This hotel is a great place to stay if you're looking for something that's not too expensive and close to nice places in the city. Only a short 5 minute walk to Southgate and easy access to a tram stop that goes right up Swanston street. The executive one bedroom room was more than enough for us.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455365965~“Great location”~Recently had a family stay here. Helpful and friendly staff. Room not ready on 2pm arrival but only minor wait. Bed config. not as ordered. 2 singles for kids preferred but made do. Beds are very comfortable.  We had a corner room on 39th floor which is great for views. Awesome sunrise and hot air balloons going by. Unable to see sunset though from this location. Have stayed here a few times and comfortable and clean. Has needed facilities. Pool is great. WIFI only 1/2 hour free. Other places offer this for free at all times. Only noisy if you leave windows and balcony door open , otherwise fairly quiet, which is good. Air con. was great as it's quite hot in Melbourne at the moment. New building being constructed right next door so not sure how that will effect future views.  Main bedroom a bit squishy. TV should be in 2nd bedroom for the kids as lounge one sufficient and huge. Prefer balcony off lounge rather than bedroom, but all good. Southbank only a few minutes walk and was very busy with Chinese New Year which was great. Plenty to see, do and eat.  Overall, a good experience and will visit again.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454401955~“Average”~I stayed here for work late January.  Couldn't fault the hotel staff, they were very friendly, professional and helpful. The room itself was one bedroom apartment on the 15th floor, it was nice.  Where the hotel falls short is location. It is central to the Crown Casino and it's eateries were are a 5 minute walk, but options outside of this are scarce. There's a cafe at the base of the building, one down the road (the Rumour cafe - food is ordinary) along with a Sushi place 2 doors down. Perhaps I've previously just been spoiled for choice (previously stayed at Novotel on Collins which had 50 different places you can eat at within 200m). Along with the lack of eateries, there's construction happening with an adjacent building going up so during the day it's noisy and there's the traffic too. Facilities: They have in room dining only available for dinner. You only get half an our internet free, then you've got to pay for it (what the??). The gym is ok but the pool was murky (looked clean but cloudy so I was reluctant). The sauna and cold shower however were nice. In addition it does also have a parking garage which is secure so you don't have to park on the street. In my view the Wrap should only be 3,5 stars - it is a serviced apartment complex trying to be a hotel. In terms of the staff - it's there, it terms of facilities and location, it's got a long way to go. J. Cullen~3~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_452565122~“Surprised & Delighted”~Looking for a affordable, central location in Melb? Definitely consider Oaks WRAP on Southbank Very neat, clean room, walk to the City, Crown or the MCG  Car parking at the site, easy access off the M1 Will be back, big tick~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_451652672~“Foyer is the only place that stands out...”~Where do I begin? The checkin process was pretty seamless and an easy to find location. Once arriving in the room however, there was what appeared to be poo smears next to the toilet, stains on the carpet of the living room and a few maintenance issues (curtain pulleys no longer securely attached to the wall and holes in the wall inside cupboards). Other than that the studio apartment was quite nicely located and laid out. During the night however you can hear all the slamming doors of other apartments especially the one directly outside your door even from the bedroom! And you currently receive an early morning wake up with the demolition site behind the hotel. The checkout process also was quick and seamless, checked out the menu which seemed rather expensive and only open breakfast and dinner. Overall don't let them charge you extensively, book through hotels.com or something similar with regular coupon codes!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451417639~“2 night stay, nice room”~Well priced room, 2bedroom unit good views if city, well positioned short walk to crown and river. Hotel overall in good shape, staff helpful and courteous.

review_451406697~“Great for family”~The 2 bedroom apartment we had was ideal for two adults and a 2 year old and GREAT for access to Southbank. Very comfortable beds and more than enough room. We had a reduced rate of around $260 a night, which was GREAT value, but if we paid the normal rate of over $600 a night for it, i would have jumped off the balcony! Will be looking for a good deal here again the next time we want to stay in area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_450545248~“Studio unit with balcony, good walking location”~We checked in here on the 30th December for 7 nights, we were shown to our room which my husband had booked - studio room with a balcony, when we got into our room it didn't have a balcony, I rang reception and they said they don't have studio rooms with a balcony, to which I pointed out that I was on their website and all studio rooms have a balcony, they were quick to accommodate and changed our room, the balcony was not like the pictures but suitable for purpose. It was a really good location for walking to dinner, casino & trams. Housekeeping wasn't great, on the 31st Dec we left about 10am & got back about 3.30pm there was a letter stating that there would be limited housekeeping on the 1st to contact reception by 2pm that day or they will deem that we do not require our room to be cleaned, I'm sure we paid more to stay on this day/night. The sheets were not changed the whole stay, dishwasher did not work, dishes were washed and left on a bathroom hand towel to drip dry, we only got facecloths every second day. I'm sure that the cleaning could be stepped up a bit, the room had amazing views, full kitchen facilities in room and a restaurant by the lobby, they do a pretty good coffee, overall not a bad place to stay~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_449370453~“Great location”~Great location close to restaurants, city centre, arts centre and the casino. The staff were very helpful and the rooms had everything you needed.

review_448493753~“A really nice, modern hotel very close to the city center”~Clean, modern, comfortable with all the facilities we needed (indoor pool/gym as well), the room was really comfortable (cozy) however we wish we would have known about the restaurant/bar they have there in the foyer - we would have not made other arrangements for dinner for our only night there, we would have stayed at the hotel. Upon asking the staff, they told us it was independently operated - but had a lovely atmosphere. Also the fireplace in the foyer was a really classy touch for me.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
