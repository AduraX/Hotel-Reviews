review_478731880~“Melbourne paradise”~Close to all that is Melbourne... china town, Lygon Street, Vic Markets, Ethihad....Crown complex, South Warf.. it has it all!!! Great accommodation, needs painting and some minor fix ups, but these were going to be completed soon. The place also needs a dedicated room to store luggage for departing guests..~5~4~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_478430508~“Quest”~We enjoyed our stay. The staff were great and the location excellent. We would go back again. Just a short walk to the tram and you can travel anywhere in the city for free. We had a good stay. I would recommend the Quest.~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_477808405~“Nice spot in the Melbourne CBD”~Excellent location and value for money. Our apartment was clean and tidy but the service areas (bathrooms and kitchen) are nearing refurbishment stage. Still quite usable and the 24/7 reception is a bonus. Close to the tram stops and Bourke St Mall shopping area. A nice spot and well worth considering if visiting Melbourne.~4~5~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_477152050~“Great choice”~Well set apartment for a small family, has all the needs required. Excellent location and friendly staff.  It adds up to be a great value compared to stays in hotel rooms. Daily cleaning is a good plus.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_476993250~“Good location but apartments are tired looking”~Pros - The apartment is located on William Street which is a few streets away from Chinatown and very close to a lot of popular cafes. Checking in was swift and easy. Cons - The apartments are tired looking. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and 1 of the rooms doesn't have an aircon outlet so it's impossible to close the door as it will get stuffy and hot.~3~5~5~4~3~4~3~nan
review_476969228~“Great Location”~This place is all about location. Easy to find and easy access to free trams, buses, freeways, restaurants and facilities. The convenience of car parking was awesome. Will definitely stay again very soon.~3~5~5~3~4~3~4~nan
review_476647709~“Great Family rooms”~Location was perfect for us a family, kitchen was great and clean. Very spacious rooms even with a laundry in room. Our only issue was the noise from street but second night we all slept better. Highly reccommended and will go back.~5~5~5~3~5~4~5~nan
review_475406425~“Collins”~This property was a great price for an overnight family getaway and a great position to go into the city and go to the football also. The room was clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_475144327~“Holiday Stay”~Very friendly check in when we arrived, nice a clean apartment so close to the city centre and very handy to the tram stops, close enough to get to everything yet far enough to no get the heavy noise, we would stay here again~4~4~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_475141639~“Excellent value.”~Very nice, clean and well situated apartment. Perfectly equipped for a family with kitchen facilities and 2 bedrooms. The location was an easy trip into town and the laneways, but also very close to the bus for easy airport access. Overall it was excellent value and I will look to Quest again in future.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474210597~“Great location”~Stayed here a few times now.it has great location and clean big rooms with great staff  We stayed just for a couples escape to explore Melbournes back street lanes looking at some of the great art with ease of jumping on the city circle tram free~4~3~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473968702~“Good Location”~Nice Apartment, offers great access to the heart of the city. The Trams and the trains are at 5 mins walk.  Rooms are clean and comfy. Housekeeping services are good.  No in-house breakfast, but can order from the cafe next door.  The Gym is just a room with 2 Equipment, so don't buy into the free fitness center access advertised.  The front desk staff is very courteous and Professional.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473953610~“Great Location, Clean Rooms with Tiny Shower”~Quest on William is well located on Melbourne CBD. We had a quick check-in process and in this occupation we were able to check into our room around 1pm (as oppose to the official 2pm) Our 2-bedroom seem clean, and pleasant. Although the 2nd bedroom near the entrance feels quite dark with no window. It is nice to get a closet in the 2nd bedroom but the downside is that the closet prevent access to one side of the bed. Bathroom is bright and clean, however the shower was so tiny and the hot water pressure is not ideal. I thought I was in an airbnb in Europe again. One of the most extraordinary incident happen during our stay. As we were concern with getting fresh towels for the 2nd day of our stay (and we were quiet sure if the hotel offer daily room cleaning service), we ask the reception desk whether daily room daily service is offered by the hotel. The response we got was whether we are looking for a job to clean rooms. We were shock at the response, and soon the reception realised we were guest and not some off the street looking for a job. Regardless of the apologies we received after the realisation, I feel we received that response because of our race appearance (being non white Australia).~3~3~4~4~3~4~3~nan
review_473755311~“City break”~Stayed for one night for a well earned "Girl's Night out", no problems with the room or staff. Friendly concierge and room was comfy and very clean, as always. Was close to our starting point, and was easy to get back to later on. Had a FAB brekkie next morning at Hardware Lane, which is a great place for food and even better as it was in walking distance. Thoroughly enjoyable break!~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_473706842~“Great Location & Value”~Nice large apartment - we had a 2brm, for 4 people. Location excellent - everything walking distance, or close to trams. Staff was all fantastic- cheerful, professional.. Will definitely stay again when in Melbourne.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473341555~“Disappointed”~Whilst the location was good. Original booking when triple checked was completely different on arrival and staff were quick to pass the buck. Parking was an issue but there was no other option available. Rooms were clean and tidy.~3~3~3~3~3~4~3~nan
review_473311286~“Good Value”~We stayed at Quest in William Street in an apartment in April 2017. This place is really good value for money with free wifi which played a big part in our decision. (others need to note this!)  There's a great cafe' next door which is great and great restaurants handy too. Its also in the FREE TRAM zone. The apartment is spacious too, clean, and has a sofa. It is well priced and we would stay here again and recommend to others. We also found the staff great when we had an issue with the wifi. In fact I tried to think of something to complain about but could not think of one thing! Even the Queen bed is great and comfortable. If all the other apartments are similar to ours - don't hesitate staying here. As you can see my my other reviews I am very fussy.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472864982~“Family weekend”~We stayed for one night, the location of the hotel is good. The staff are friendly and professional. The TV reception was terrible. The shower rose was loose and could not be tightened as the nut for tightening it was broken.~3~3~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_472809390~“Well located and well priced and QUIET”~Very quiet inner city accomodation for a very reasonable price. Haven't had a better sleep staying in an inner city property ever. Would thoroughly recommend for all styles of visit. Close to everything and yet quiet and convenient.~5~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_472785871~“Long Weekend”~I go to Melbourne twice a year for a football long weekend and choose to stay at Quest due to the great location and friendly staff service. It's central to cafes, Vic market and in this case the Comedy Festival.~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_472784718~“Wonderful experience”~Perfect location, two blocks to Southern Cross, two blocks to the shopping district, trams right outside the door, as well as cafes which allow you to charge back to your room. The apartment was very clean, compact, with an ensuite for the master bedroom, lovely thick clean white towels and pleasant fresh scented toiletries. The bed was comfortable and the room temp was easily adjustable. Will definitely be back! ~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_472542146~“Short Stay”~Great Location very central to all shopping and great pubs and restaurants., Staff were very helpful. WI FI was excellent. The TV was fairly small and the Fox Sport Channels did not include the A- league~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_472527498~“Girls Weekend”~Great central location and affordable rooms  Easy access, one bed was quite uncomfortable but others were fine, rooms were very clean and spacious, was a bit frustrated when storing bags as advised they would be stored but were left in the lobby for over 4 hours and not secure~3~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_472523272~“Andrew Bedggood”~Have always stayed there for business and pleasure and will continue to do so. The location is central to my needs and have enjoyed each stay over the past 6 years. Staff are always friendly and accommodating.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan

review_469209033~“Accomodation”~This room was booked on wotif and a genuine mistake was made with booking a no refundable room. Wotif and myself tried to cancel but you guys were not very helpful. I would not make a booking with you again as in some circumstances this policy could be assessed better.~4~1~4~2~4~4~3~nan
review_467169069~“Great location”~Great location, walking distance to everything! Friendly helpful staff. Room was clean and was nice and roomy. View from our room was nice. The food in Melbourne was amazing, will be definitely visiting here again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466245069~“Great location and price”~We stayed in the double bedroom double bathroom appt. second bathroom shower was small for me, 6ft+, and water ran loose into rest of bathroom. But staff were happy to provide extra towels. Despite being in the heart of the city was surprisingly quiet. Amazing view over the old Supreme Court to the hills beyond. Wouldn't hesitse to recommend and we will stay there again ~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465192486~“Excellent stay”~A great place in an excellent location which is within walking distance to most areas of interest. Stayed in a two bedroom apartment which was both very spacious and comfortable. Would highly recommend Quest on William.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464944265~“Great location, great apartment, customer care lacking”~Central location. Great 2 bed apartment, clean and has everything you need. Nicely furnished. Cafe next door does great breakfasts. None of the staff on the front desk with the exception of the person who checked us in had a smile for us or a 'hello'. When we asked for a map it was put on the desk in front of us with not a word - would have been nice for them to explain where we were on the map and what's worth seeing. Even the person who we assumed was the manager did not acknowledge us and even started a conversation with the receptionist whilst he was dealing with us. One of the front desk staff's mates was sitting behind the desk playing games on his phone . It is just nice when on holiday to be welcomed by pleasant, welcoming staff. The place is worth considering though as long as you are fine with no pleasantries as everything bar the customer service was good!~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_464894725~“Excellent location and price”~A fantastic place to stay for our group of 23 people. We stayed in 2 bedroom apartments which were very spacious with a full kitchen and two bathrooms. Although the shower in the en suite was very small the bathroom part was adequate.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464695893~“Adequate and convenient location”~Visited Quest on William with two adult children. We stayed in both the 2bdrm x 2bthrm and 2bdrm x 1 bthrm apartment. Both apartments were adequate, comfortable and the living areas are surprisingly spacious. The bedrooms (especially the twin) are not so spacious in both apartments so it was a bit of challenge using our suitcases. In the 1bthrm apartment the twin room was situated off the kitchen with a folding concertina style door. The hot water system took up most of the main bedroom wardrobe so it lacked hanging space. The shower was a tight squeeze in both apartments but it was free-standing which was better than a shower over the bath combo. The kitchen was clean and spacious in both although we suggest they add a few serving platters/bowls. The gym was a bit disappointing. It's very small - more of a storeroom than a gym! Our preference was definitley for the 2brm x 2bthrm and the view was impressive - it's obviously popular so book early! Overall, the location of Quest on William is spot on! It's convenient and on the tram lines that you regularly need to get around Melbourne. It also offers excellent free wi-fi service and both apartments had all the necessities you need for kitchen, bathroom and laundry. It's not luxurious but it's fine at a very good price.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_464166409~“Comfy and convenient”~Worked out fabulously for my friend's and my needs. Good location and value plus the on-site parking option was a big help. The apartment had a great layout and the inclusion of breakfast in the minibar was a nice touch.~4~5~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_464153248~“Good for groups”~This was an excellent location for our group weekend away in Melbourne. Really good location to shops and food and cheap parking available nearby. The 3bdrm Executive suite was the perfect launching place for a weekend without the kids!~4~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_463964339~“All over excellent!”~Great location, great price ideal for business or a few days for city shopping spree! Had family so perfect for a quick stroll for some great inexpensive Asian. Ideal location for catch-ups down hardware lane!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463929650~“Great location but rooms are tired”~This hotel is well located. The signage and reception is small so you can easily walk past without knowing. Rooms are clean but tired and dated. Beds comfortable but 2BR has only one bathroom. 2nd BR is tiny with folder door. The only mirror in the apartment was in the bathroom. appliances work fine.~3~3~4~3~2~3~3~nan
review_463754785~“Perfect location”~We stayed at an apartment in this location (meant to house 5 persons). The apartment is meant to address families and included ALL relevant amenities. It is NOT an hotel (e.g. no breakfast room and other services) but it is located at an excellent spot of the city being in the center but now ultra-busy street. I certainly adopt staying at this hotel.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463739640~“Very good location”~The location is excelent. The apartment had all the necesary apliances. Everything was clean and well manteined.  The employee at the reception desk should have a better attitude at the moment of check in and when answering questions to the passangers. He should also know that when dealing with foreigners is very important to speak clear and slowly.  Also in one of the bedrooms the bed is King and comfortable but the room is so small that is imposible to open the doors of the wardrobe so you beter forget about having your cloth in it.~3~3~4~4~3~4~3~nan
review_463281924~“Great value”~The Quest on William is in a fantastic location, the property is beautiful. Rooms are spacious and well laid out. Staff were very helpful. Would work for families as well as groups staying. Would happily recommend this property.  ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_461844116~“Wifi woes”~I stayed one night in a two bedroom apartment with reasonable facilities. The wifi would not work and I was told 'it would by my firewall', and, 'it usually works'. I was told to contact the tech support, who wanted my room phone number. The phone had no number on it and reception was empty when I went downstairs. I used my own internet. I wouldn't stay on business again. The location was the reason I booked it.~3~3~4~4~3~3~3~nan
