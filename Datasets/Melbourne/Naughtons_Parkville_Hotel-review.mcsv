review_467411404~“Amazing staff, Excellent Food”~Have been twice for lunch recently. Amazing staff, beautiful food. Nothing too much trouble. Second time I was one of 30+ people who had a wonderful lunch. We phoned ahead (had 4 choices from the lunch menu), food was delivered just after we arrived. Thanks very much to Ryan and staff.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_466606552~“Hospital stayover, great value room”~I stayed overnight as it was close to Royal Melb hospital. Didnt expect a lot but it was excellent, very close to the hospital but also the tram lines. Awesome service, Ryan rang me to check what time I would be in, I didnt know and he was so accommodating to arrange key in safety box. The room was excellent, spacious & clean with comfortable bed. Very good value for money & much nicer than I expected :)  Highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465191660~“Enjoyed our stay”~We found this hotel outstanding. Staff are amazing. Meals are well above average for a pub. Rooms are very comfy. Staff couldn't do enough for us. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Made our stay while our father was in hospital an enjoyable one~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454378557~“Clean and Good transport to City”~Clean, quiet, comfortable bed and trams at the front to get access into city. Helpfull staff. Our room was small but adequate for our needs. No staff available on Sunday evenings to ask questions re transfers to airport in am but this info can be found online so no great dramas.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_445470644~“great food. Friendly service & brilliant location”~Did not stay in the hotel - went there for a meal. So impressed went back three nights running for dinner Good food (my daughter says the BEST nicoise salad she has ever had!). Good wine & beer selection ... and friendly, attentive and knowledgeable staff. Well done guys!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442028230~“Great place and great location ”~The staff were super helpful and friendly even before we arrived, and that continued when we arrived. The location is great with a tram stop right outside. It's only a few minutes to Flinders Street Station and it also stopped at Victoria markets. The room was clean with comfortable beds. Also had a meal one night at the pub downstairs which was enjoyable. Definitely recommend staying here and I would certainly stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427085140~“Close to University of Melbourne and the Zoo”~Booked a room for 3 people. The room itself was adequate. The bathroom looked like it was recently renovated but there was mold on the top half of the bathroom. We stayed for 2 nights and the service wasn't consistent. First night there were 5 bath towels and one washcloth. The next night we had 4 bath towels, floor mat and hand towel but no wash cloths. Also had a packet of cookies which wasn't there the first night. Not a deal breaker but a little odd just the same. Overall it was pleasant and adequate for what we needed and the price was right. It's walkable to CBD but can be a bit far for some. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We also liked the pub/restaurant. Thursday Night Parma! The Zoo is about 15 minutes walking distance through the park. University of Melbourne is across the street. Parkville Store a few blocks down the street is good for breakfast since the restaurant doesn't serve in the morning.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_424817762~“Great”~A couple of friends and myself wanted a weekend away in melb and this was the best place for a get away. Nice clean room, good service, very easy to find and its not to far to travel by tram from the city. Definitely would go back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408638636~“Good value for inner Melbourne”~I enjoyed staying there and the room was clean and comfortable and good value. A few initial hiccups. Given the key to a room with paint drop sheets paint and ladders to start with. This was sorted, then the hairdryer mad a dreadful noise and stopped working. Got another. No blankets for the beds, only doonas, so I found it too hot. Apart from these few things, the bed was comfy and room spacious. Parking a problem too with 1 and 2 hour parking only.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~3~nan
review_403124195~“Fabulous lunch location”~I've been to Naughtons a few times now for lunch. The quality of the food is absolutely outstanding. Today, I had the most delicious chicken supreme on a truffled mushroom risotto. Simply divine! You wouldn't expect this from a hotel around the corner. Staff are lovely and attentive. Will come back many more times.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399749547~“Nice place”~A nice little place that is fairly close to the CBD. Has a tram stop just out the front which got me into the heart of the city in ten minutes. The room was clean with fresh linen. The bathroom had recently been remodeled and was great. The price was reasonable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383812855~“Early Saturday Night Dinner”~We had heard that this pub had gone 'upmarket' after a long history of being a University student destination and were keen to find out for ourselves how good it was, and we were not disappointed. Very comfortable and well spaced out main dining room with an attractive menu of the usual reliables. Easy to find, easy parking and easy to get a table, Naughton's is highly recommended for a quiet meal with your better half. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382342946~“amazing value”~I have eaten at the finest restaurants across the length and breadth of this earth and the dining experience at Naughtons is as good as anywhere I have ever been. The service was spot on. The staff were not only attentive but also most informative.  This was topped off by the quality of the food. Absolutely amazing. We ate at the casino on Sunday night, because the restaurant was closed. We ate a reasonable meal at almost double the cost of Naughtons and furthermore the service wasn't a patch on the staff at Naughtons. We stayed 3 nights in a spotlessly clean environment and would not hesitate to go back and do it all again. Well done to all concerned~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_376597464~“Slendid again”~Probably my fifth stay at Naughtons. The menu has changed slightly with weekly specials. Their various fish dishes are excellent and like the boutique accommodation, very well priced. Central and across the road from Melb.Uni.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_370299884~“Fab location and food”~This was our first time at Naughtons Parkville. Easy to get to and lovely surrounds. We booked for dinner with friends and were very pleasantly surprised with the Menu choice. However we had to advise the staff that we were attending a concert at Melbourne University and were in a hurry, as our friends had arrived late. The staff gave us advise regarding the 'quickest' dishes and were most friendly and efficient. All of us went for different types of salads and were extremely satisfied with the freshness and 'exotic' tastes of the dishes. We will definitely come back for a slower dining experience. Well done Naughtons Parkville Hotel - Restaurant.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369122152~“Very nice surprise ”~Very nice renovation pub accommodation in beautiful parkville, Check-in from 2pm from side door with small check in counter,friendly welcome. I had room 101 which was big,high ceilings,beautiful comfortable firm bed(best nights sleep I had in a long time). I really loved the choice of pillows on the bed(soft and firm).Small bar fridge,tea and coffee with kettle. Fantastic size shower with 3 large bath towels(I would bring your own soap). Tram stop is just outside(route 19). So easy to get to & from city. Check out time is 11am which is wonderful because most hotels are 10am. The cleaner was making noise from 8am but no big deal. I highly recommend this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_354693893~“Great location to RMH & Melbourne ”~I would like to say what a great place for dinning and after work drinks. Also working at RMH Emergency Trauma centre it is also great how with one phone call they usually can accommodate the families of Trauma patient's when they need a bed & TLC in their moment of shock. Great staff ! Great rooms! Great food ! Thanks  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_346019202~“Excellent value”~Great location and unusually good value for the price. Many places at this price in Melbourne are dingy and a bit run-down. Naughton's isn't fancy, but it's very well done. The linen is bright and new, the furnishings are modern and well maintained, the staff friendly - small details that make a big difference to how the place feels. Plus, free wi-fi - should be standard by now but it isn't, so good for them for providing it. Highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_305506688~“Great location and stop over”~We chose this place because of its close location to the Melbourne University and were delighted with its clean facilities, heat pump and easy access for my 89 year old mother. There are two parks also in close walking proximity.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_303914473~“Excellent”~The rooms are bright and very well presented. The restaurant is excellent with a leaning towards modern Italian. The scaloppine and seafood are my choices. Both the accommodation and restaurant are very good value. Great location opposite the Uni of Melbourne and walking distance the the Royal Melb. Hospitals.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_284687988~“Great Place for a business lunch”~I have only been at lunch time but can image it would also be a great place for dinner. Lots of university and hospital staff hang out for drink after work. check out the menu on the web site http://www.parkvillehotel.com.au/. Let me tell you the RISOTTO OF DUCK $23.5 is fantastic, people rave about the pizza, I really like LANCASHIRE LAMB PIE $25.5 and especially the SOUTH INDIAN WILD KID GOAT CURRY $24.0. What can I say I have eaten at Naughtons lots of times and I will be back soon. Take public transport (tram)or walk, parking is hard to find.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_282519753~“Excellent facility and staff”~I needed somewhere close to the Melbourne Private Hospital, this fitted the bill perfectly a 3 minute walk. The rooms were clean, well layed out and well heated. The food in the restaurant down stairs was excellent. When I checked in the Manager immediately gave me a discount when he knew I was there with someone having to be at the hospital. The Staff overall were friendly, and eager to assist. I will be staying there again this time for pleasure. Thank you one and all for making my stay so good.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_279614269~“Good Food and service, lousy area to park”~Ate there last night with friends. Had 5 different main courses all of which were excellent. Mainly Italian but a few odd balls also on, Goat curry, Lamb pie. $40 for a bottle of wine. Nice room good pleasant professional service. Would definitely eat there if in area. Biggest issue to not going back is 1hr or 2 hr if you are lucky parking until 9pm. Very few spots available and hard to find.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_267628092~“Pretty Parkville”~Stayed overnight since I was attending a convention nearby. Arrived a bit too early (11am, since check in is at 2PM). Good thing the manager arrived after a few minutes and was very accommodating in allowing an early check-in. The place is just a ride away from the CBD and the university - a very big plus. And also quite close to the Victoria Market. The price was very good for the type of room - large, with 2 rooms and a queen + single bed. I would consider this place again when I visit Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_259865311~“Location: Quaint inner city area”~Very impressed with this hotel. Booked at last minute due to family emergency with loved one at the Royal Melbourne hospital. Room clean and comfortable, great bathroom, fridge and tea @ coffee supplied. Yes I heard the traffic or should I say the tram as whilst room was not directly on Royal Parade it was near to. Personally it was no bother. The bed and pillows were so comfortable I slept well, including an afternoon nap when traffic was heavier. The area is delightful a little store with wonderful coffee and eats just down the side street. A cafe/takeaway next door, as well as a convenience store and hairdresser. Tram across the road. Got time go for a walk around the area beautiful old Victorian homes and lovely trees and gardens. Bar and restaurant downstairs offer an incredible menu, wish they were open on a Sunday as would love to have tried more dishes. Highly recommended the Shanghai spring rolls! Walk 5 mins to the hospital which saves any parking issues. Close to Vic market, zoo and the city on tram. Get a card from 7/11. Or get a tram card visitors pack at tourist information in Federation Square when you first get to Melbourne. Helpful management and staff, convenient, comfortable what else do you want? If you're concerned about noise ask about a back room. I will visit again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_257914415~“Excessive road noise”~I was given room 109 that faced Royal Parade. The noise from the buses, trucks, motorbikes and Trams outside was excessive and kept me awake all night. From the room I could even hear people talking on the street, not yelling. The service desk closes early so I was not able to make a request to change the room. Finally at 6am I left as I could not stand it any longer. I called Michael later to complain... that did not go very far. I asked why he didn't tell me when I booked the hotel that he was booking me into a "noisy" room. He said that people complain and ask to be moved to a quieter room if they are staying more than one night. I was only staying one night so this was not helpful. I realised I was not going to get very much sympathy from him. Never again.~1~nan~3~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_241373468~“Fabulous 5 STAR location”~Fabulous Location - Clean newly renovated comfortable 140 year old Parkville Historic hotel   Warm welcome from Peter & Michael - the Managers.  10 day stay while family member having surgery at Royal Melbourne. They could not have done enough to make us feel at home, always clean towels, comfortable beds, clean linens and delicious menu options each night and great Aussie wines. We took the 2 bedroom / 1 bathroom set - perfect for 2-3 people.  5 star location to all the hospitals, Vic Market, Melbourne CBD, Carlton, Melb Uni - right on the tram line.  Raining - would you like an umbrella.   Need to stay another night - of course.  Tired and hungry - what would you like to eat and drink?   Breakfast - Cafe next door -opened at 7am - cooked to order   Walk - everywhere - or pick up a tram ticket from the 7 Eleven 2 doors down.  Need your hair done / facial / a little pampering ? right next door  The Naughton's Team really gave us a wonderful home away from home while Dad underwent open heart surgery. Thank you.  PS would stay here if visiting Melbourne as a tourist - such a great practical affordable escape from the bustle of the city~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_234511589~“Big bathroom”~Recently renovated, Naughton's on Royal Parade is a pub of great character. Our bathroom had a huge shower as well as a bath. The bedroom was spacious but could have been supplied with a couple of arm chairs. The staff were very helpful and we had a good meal in the lounge bar. It was a very quiet room being at the back of the hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_207845481~“Good hotel; great location but NO WIFI AVAILABLE”~I get tired of staying in great hotels which I need to rate as 3 or 4 stars, based solely upon Internet access but here I go. This small and family-feeling hotel is in a gorgeous neighborhood in Melbourne, right off a tram stop. The room, while small, was more than adequate for me and had 2 huge windows with cool shutters which let in light and a breeze, while still maintaining privacy. Everything looked to have been recently updated. It was spotless and they even provided a refrigerator.  My only beef is that they do not offer Wifi--only corded internet access. And in this age of Smartphones and tablets, what traveler wants to lug around a laptop to plug into the wall? Sorry, but this is just out-of-touch with the modern international traveler, who is dependent on Internet access for planning any activity on his/her trip. Disappointing, because, physically, this is exactly the type of hotel that is perfect for me--clean and modern in an interesting old building with character, but not enormous and nothing too fancy. But no wifi is a deal-breaker.~3~3~5~nan~4~5~3~nan
review_167344204~“4 star or backpacker? Naughton's must decide.”~Needed last minute accommodation near Melbourne Uni. Found this on Wotif for $150 a night for queen double. Large, clean simple and quiet room at back of building. Great bathroom with full sized bath. Lovely. Quiet aircon. Comfy bed and choice of great pillows. So ... What's with the paper cups for tea and coffee, no glasses, one bedside table and lamp, no robe hook in bathroom, bath plug that doesn't fit the plughole, and no comfortable chair? Downstairs what used to be a dodgy student pub has been turned into what appears to be an upmarket pub bistro. More attention to detail is needed to justify the cost for what is otherwise a nicely done renovation in a very convenient location.~4~2~5~nan~3~5~3~nan
review_158155483~“Too noisy”~Thought this place would be good as meals had good reviews and was close to the city. I specifically asked for a quiet room. Reception said the room allocated was one of their quietest. Unfortunately we were given a room at the front of the hotel that faces Royal Parade and the street noise made for a very sleepless night. Arghhhhh- not coming back.~3~3~5~1~3~4~3~nan
