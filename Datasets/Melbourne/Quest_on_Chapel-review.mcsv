review_478076646~“Spacious apartment at the quiet end of Chapel St”~Great location within easy walking distance of Toorak Rd. The apartment was bright and spacious with a large bathroom and super comfy bed. Great value for the location. My only suggestion for improvement is to put a table and chairs on the large balcony, which was bare.~5~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_474425791~“A poor stay”~I have stayed here many times due to its good location. It is a bit tired, but always reasonably priced. The air-conditioning for the whole hotel wasn't working on the first night, and on the second night the now repaired aricon roof unit was making a loud humming noise at 40 second intervals all night. I needed to move rooms and even then it was still noticeable.~2~4~5~1~2~3~4~nan

Clean, professional & friendly service in an iconic Melbourne location. My 11 yo daughter first trip away with her mum to Adele concert. Safe & central. It's important that if you can, show your children the great places - fun, metro lifestyle has to offer!

review_459596457~“Weekend in Melbourne”~Make sure no construction is going on.

It had two bedrooms, clothes washer and dryer and nice kitchen facilities.~4~5~4~4~4~5~5~nan

review_458790642~“Title?”~Only stayed for one night this time but everything was fine. The room was large and equipped with the basics. The sporting ground next to the building was a wee bit noisy but not a big deal. Staff were nice enough but I didn't have much to do with them, it was a simple check in and check out process.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_458202160~“The Quest Chapel Street Surperb”~Stay at The Quest was most enjoyable with the staff members all very helpful and friendly. The rooms were spacious and very clean .The location of The Quest is excellent with the numerous restaurants and pubs in the vicinity. Chapel Street is alive :)~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_457928346~“Why is there a need for a title?”~Rooms are okay, nothing majorly off apart from the smell. There's a somewhat fish-like odour. Staff was very friendly (only met one). Location is great and room is slightly sound proof. Car parking a little overpriced.~4~3~4~4~3~3~4~nan
review_457725735~“Melbourne Weekend”~The apartment was very clean and tidy and met all our expectations. The staff went our of their way to please us and advise us of how to move around the Melbourne CBD and where the best eating places were close to the apartments. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable weekend in Melbourne was had due to the trouble free accommodation package offered by the Quest on Chapel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_457723181~“Weekend stay at Quest on Chapel”~Really enjoyed our stay. The location was so handy and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The room was great with everything you would need especially if you were staying for a week for work. Restaurants and cafes nearby were good and Woolworths was over the road so very handy.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_457246080~“Convenient location, good beds and rooms, really friendly helpful staff.”~We expected "OK" and got "Great"! From the guaranteed parking at only $3o per night, to the cosy, comfy room, really helpful and friendly staff, to the ease of getting myki cards, we were really happy. Chapel Street is obviously a great place to stay, and only 20 mins by tram or less by train to the city. Loved it, will definitely be back.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456651578~“Buyer be informed !”~Extremely mislead by reception - when specifically questioned prior to booking if rooms were noisy due to traffic & tram on Chapel - told rooms were *at the back of building* when in fact all are side on to Chapel!  Kitchenette couldn't have been more under facilitated if they tried. There's a reason they get you to pay up front! Buyer beware!  They're supposedly going through a Reno so the badly pulled carpet might be replaced but I doubt that will affect the noise level of the location or the so-called facilities (not) provided in the kitchen drawers. Extremely dated interior and in the lack of service/interest at reception. Staff clearly not very empowered so disinterested in outcomes such as guests experience.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454633781~“Quick Stay”~Travelled to Melbourne for a business trip and needed a hotel or apartment closest to the office + clients. Quest was able to provide this service being right in the middle of everything. The service was good and the 2 bedroom apartments we're suitable for people who was not fussy on fancy hotel/apartments. It had everything you required for a decent accomodation including price (even a washing machine and dryer). The couch and tv really need an upgrade as they've seen better days, but other than that quest is a good place for a quick business stay.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454414659~“I seen better”~The quest on chapel is in a great location however it is average. There is always a funky smell through out the hallways and the rooms are a bit rundown. You look on to the top old dirty old buildings and there's always the loud noise of construction. There are plenty of better places to stay in south Yarra/ Melbourne.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454195191~“Excellent apartments”~Helpful friendly staff in great central location. Apartment very good size, well equipped. Cleaned well daily by friendly attentive staff.

review_452887996~“below average”~in most places car parking is free and I think be realistic in inner city or fringe city hotels but chapel street is neither and $30 per car overnight in their own car park is extortion really...Rooms are a tad tired and like other Quest hotels this one is not licensed so no alcohol in rooms you will be taking a walk to the bottle shop. Staff were helpful and hotel is in a very good location but that's all it has going for it.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan

If you travelling with kids it's a great location with fish and chips and frozen yoghurt over the road and tram stops near by its a great location.  We stayed in a one bedroom and it was a good size with everything you could need.

Location was very easy to access via public transport.~5~3~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_448209883~“Unacceptable bond charged!”~I stayed at the Quest on Chapel on the 31st December 2016 and checked in at 5:30 in room 403. The couch was folded out into a bed and the room was well maintained, however Not long after settling in the couch fold out bed was lifted up only to find a big stain on the carpet, I was going to notify reception but I thought it was very likely the Quest would be aware of this prior to checking in.  Checking out the room was in good condition and nothing was broken or damaged.  Later the Quest called and stated that I will not be receiving my $200 bond as there is a stain on the carpet and it will be used to get the carpet steam cleaned. I requested that a photo was sent to my email, I thought surely they aren't talking about the stain that was already on the carpet, I questioned myself and did not recall a stain been made by myself or fellow family in the hotel room.  I'm writing this to warn anyone thinking of staying at the Quest as I don't want this happening to anyone else. I will be taking this matter further and cleaners and management in the hotel should be more curious of there surroundings and not covering the mark with a fold out bed, I feel threatened and disappointed as I have been accused of something that I did not do.  If anyone is aware of this in room 403 or if the following has happened to anyone one please let me know.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~1~4~nan

review_439857986~“Noise factor was hideous”~This hotel was suggested for its being close to the Alfred which it was but how ridiculous when it is on one of the main streets in Melbourne. Coming home from a day in hospital with no chance of resting. Nice big unit and clean but done consider if you have or you are going to hospital. But noise was unbelievable.~4~2~1~1~3~4~4~nan
review_439147520~“Melbourne Business Trip”~The units are very clean, large enough to take your family with you, nice and close to restaurants and supermarkets as you can cook in the unit.

review_439134896~“Check your bedding”~This trip didn't start well. We had booked a 1 bedroom apartment for 3 adults. Specified in booking that there was 3 adults and paid the extra. Presumed there would have been a roll away bed or a sofa bed. There was not. When we asked for a roll away bed they tried to charge us $60. What was the point in paying extra for the 3rd adult if you are just going to get charged again! They waived the fee but it never should have been suggested. Then we had to ask for more towels, again if the booking says 3 adults, have enough amenities for this. The next morning I looked at the doona which had stains all over it and blood stains as well. There was no doona cover on it, just a sheet either side. If I had of noticed this before going to bed I would never have slept there! On the up side the location is brilliant and there was a balcony with a great view overlooking Chapel St.~3~3~5~4~3~1~3~nan

review_435466600~“Melbourne November Visit 2016”~Quest Apartments, and particularly Quest on Chapel - for us, are consistently THE place to stay. They are fantastic value for the money, provide a TOP NOTCH facility always; staff are always outstanding - welcome you like family. We've been guests of Quest now for over 15 years now - and well, you get the picture :)  Being close to the action, the Quest on Chapel, has great dining / shopping / public transport access - the tram is right outside the front door, and a short 30 second walk to the trams top - and if you're like us - we use Quest for both business and pleasure visits. Parking is both on site and Quest has available parking, if they're fully booked, in a secure & CCTV monitored car park, located in Daly St - literally a 2 minute walk away. We used this facility on our visit, last week - just too easy!! We're back there again a couple more times, before we visit again, in March 2017, for the Aust Grand Prix. And if you book in advance - and we book well in advance; sometimes on very short notice - Quest on Chapel, simply say " No worries - look forward to seeing you soon ".  Quest Apartments; Why stay anywhere else.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_428957572~“Not quite there....”~Great location for our Melbourne stay, and surprised that it was so quiet being located on Chapel Street, so a big plus there. Heating/airconditioning wasn't working but discovered this on our return after a late dinner, so nothing to be done about it (and we read the manual). Reception area pretty shabby - carpets threadbare. Certainly not 4-5 star - a bit to go yet.~3~3~5~4~3~4~3~nan
review_428036850~“John Allan”~Spacious apartment, nicely furnished and appointed. Very friendly staff. Well located. However it can never be 5 star (or even 4), as reception closes at 11pm, after which time there is no-one at the reception desk, and no-one to answer the phone regarding visitors' enquiries.~4~4~4~4~4~5~3~nan
review_428025988~“Business stay”~I generally always stay at Quest in Chapel. Neat apartments and close to work. The beds are very comfortable and the staff always smile when you walk in the door. I would recommend Quest to anyone looking to be away from the city but surrounded by the good restaurants of South Yarra~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_427704063~“One night was not enough..”~It was a great location and had nice rooms. Was a shame they didn't have enough parking spaces and we had pay extra to park in an off site carpark. I was glad to see they had a dvd player in the room we were in.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_427525768~“Quest on Chapel”~We were re located from Quest Prahran to the Quest on Chapel Street after our hot water service leaked!  We were thankful that they price matched for us and we ended up in a lovely room overlooking Chapel Street!  Amongst some of the best restaurants / cafes and shops, it was the ideal location! Will stay again for sure!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_424576781~“Felt like home”~I loved everything about this place. Was actually sad to go home.  Quest South Yarra is in a perfect location with public transport right on the door step.  This complex is perfect for short stay or long stay, single or family visits.  Secure parking is offered onsite or around the corner for a fee if needed.  Great local restaurants and shopping within metres of the front door.  Staff are excellent and offer free newspapers and daily fruit in the lobby.  I was there for a month and it felt like a home to me.  A great place to stay no matter the reason.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_424554036~“Great location in South Yarra”~Quest has one of the best locations in South Yarra, close to shops, restaurants, and public transport. Everything you need is close at hand. There is secure lock-up parking available at a reasonable daily rate. Although the apartments are not very spacious, they are well equipped and spotlessly clean. The staff are friendly and very helpful, which is one of the reasons we will keep coming back.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_424231083~“Good location”~Good location with lock up carpark on site. Staff called after i made the booking and confirmed all details and ensured everything I requested wss available . Friendly and welcoming. I will stay here again.~5~5~5~3~5~4~5~nan
review_421126948~“Couldn't have asked for anything more!”~Had a fantastic stay.  The main reason for my review is to mention how we arrived and saw that we had a queen bed and king bed. I asked reception if they could make the king bed into two singles as my boys (15&13) don't like sharing. I said if it's too much trouble (it was now after 4pm) that it didn't matter. They said it could be done leave it with them. I was blown away to see the two reception staff making the bed into singles. I thank you very much for making our stay very comfortable and we will definitely be back. Thank you~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_417811797~“Review”~Excellent staff. Staff on 10th of September were the friendliest and most professional I have encountered in hospitality in many years of travel both in Australia and abroad.

review_417323247~“Excellent location. Dated rooms.”~I stayed at Quest on Chapel for two nights to attend an event nearby. The location was excellent - shopping, restaurants, supermarket, hairdressers all within walking distance. The room was dark though and had a business hotel feel, furniture was dated and although there was a no smoking sign in the room, it smelled of stale smoke. Staff were really friendly and helpful.~3~3~5~4~2~4~5~nan
review_417038283~“Business Stay”~Excellent location. Close to so many great food options around. It was even better was the arrangement they have with the gym across the road (Fit n Fast) so I could get a great workout in! Staff were friendly and the room was amazing. Sleep quality was a slight downer, having awoken several times to the sound of a loud vehicles screaming past the hotel, as well as street sweepers very early in the morning. Having said that, I would definitely come back!~5~5~5~3~5~5~5~nan
review_416326987~“Business trip”~Close to my office close to shops for incidentals. Fantastic restaurants and bars all nearby and transport is on your door step. There are laundry and cooking facilities if you are long term stay as I was and powder provided. Apartment cleaned 6 days a week and access to the gym across the road for free.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_416302799~“Until quality really decreases without commensurate price re-calibration, this is still a great location for South Yarra”~Great location for South Yarra The entire property is showing age. Maintenance though is still okay but there are indications that if upgrades are not done soon, this property may become unattractive. There is only one lift and it makes enough sounds that makes one wonder if it needs an overhaul.  The double room with one bathroom and balcony is spacious. Housekeeping is daily except Sunday and is efficient and good. The shower head and taps at our bathroom needs to be changed as you can either have really hot scalding water and in a flash have it very cold. Time for an upgrade! Pillows are too soft and need to be renewed Wifi is free but not consistent in speed and usually slow. Parking is available and very convenient but limited Food spots are closely located so there is no problem finding places to eat Until quality really decreases without commensurate price re-calibration, this is still a great location for South Yarra~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_414754349~“Business stay”~Great location, great staff, great rooms, comfy beds. Plenty of room and clean. Like the fact we had our own kitchen, even though we ate out, easing machine and dryer. Great for extended stay will be back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_414094460~“Quick visit to Melbourne”~Found Quest on Chapel a comfortable accommodation. Location is excellent with plenty of good choices to eat as well as Woolies just across the road.

review_413002945~“Excellent place to stay in Melbourne”~Nice spot to stay in Melbourne and clean apartments. have been here on and off in the last 3 months and never found any major issues. Any minor issues, if reported gets fixed ASAP. Internet connection good. Hot water in showers, clean bed and kitchen. No cleaning staff running around in the afternoon or evening when you want to return to the room. Overall a very nice place.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
