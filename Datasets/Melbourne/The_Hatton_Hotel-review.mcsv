review_307738090~“Great location, excellent value”~Very good value hotel in great neighbourhood. Easy access by tram to the city centre. The reception was friendly and the breakfast was very good. We would definitely stay here again. The Hatton may not be suitable for anyone with mobility issues.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_281037970~“At home in the Domain”~We felt like country squires on arriving at the Hatton Hotel in the Domain a stone's throw from the Royal Botanic Gardens and Toorak Road. Our room was charming featuring vintage furniture and fittings, crisp white bedding and luxurious toiletries. I loved throwing open the wooden shutters and pushing out the windows for a stimulating view across the Melbourne skyline. The blend of contemporary and oriental art was a visual feast. Staff were attentive and relaxed. This a a place to park the car and enjoy walking as if this were your own neighborhood- at least for a while.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_263114206~“THIS WONDERFUL HOTEL CLOSING ON 3 APRIL 2015”~Wanted to let the TA community know that unfortunately this hotel is closing as of tomorrow - if you visit their site, hatton.com.au, you'll be directed to a hotel nearby. I feel very very sad as the Hatton was our home away from home in Melbourne and we loved everything about it. We'll miss the wonderful breakfasts on the balcony, evening drinks on the roof, and the spare elegance of the polished boards and simple old furniture. This place really worked, and I'm very sorry to see it go. Vale Hatton.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_260940476~“Excellent location”~A beautiful historic hotel in South Yarra with a very convenient tram stop right at the door, providing easy access into central Melbourne. Friendly and helpful staff, and a very good continental breakfast. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a large bathroom - only bad point was that the mini bar fridge was surprisingly loud at night. We would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_260586349~“great location”~We stayed for 3 nights in this lovely hotel in one of the nicest streets in South Yarra just off the Botanical Gardens - and with a tram stop just outside the door, so easy access into central Melbourne. Friendly and helpful staff, and a very good continental breakfast. The only small problem was no lift, so perhaps don't stay in one of the upper bedrooms if you have excess baggage as we did. Our room was fairly simple but spacious and comfortable with a large bathroom - windows opened which was a bonus. The hotel offered free wifi and an ipad downstairs in the reception/breakfast area. Just a short walk down the road are a good choice of restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay there again.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_243896034~“Good location”~We were sent to room 6, a small room in the back basement section near the rubbish bins. Paint peeling from the bathroom ceiling, a mini refrigerator near the bed that was so noisy that it had to be unplugged at night so we could sleep. Getting in and out of the bathtub/shower was problematic - it is set very high! The water temp varied every time you showered from hot to cold and the bathroom was so small it was difficult to close the door without almost sitting on the toilet. Wi-Fi was free and available in the rooms, although it dropped out occasionally. The breakfast was served in the nice front lobby room and was more than satisfactory. As other reviewers have mentioned, at times when speaking to staff you felt like you were interrupting their conversations, texting or internet searching. It's a shame, as the building with its grand Italianate facade welcomes you with a wow factor that unfortunately stops there. Pity, its position and history could really make a positive mark. The hotel was worth about half of what we paid for the room.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_243282834~“Great Location”~Stayed for three nights to take in the sights of Melbourne and catch up its friends. The Hatton is a boutique hotel in a historic building in South Yarra just outside the Melbourne CBD. Great location with lovely parks at either end of the street, there is a tram stop outside and is only a few stops from the CBD - also stops at the Arts Precinct and Flinders Street Station. Also easy to get the tram to St Kilda and other parts of the city. If you have a car they do have 4 spaces at the back of the hotel - available on a first come basis so can be quite competitive and a problem if you don't get one and need to move your car from street paking every two hours. Our room was on the first level and towards the back. It had a small window looking out on to greenery and was quite well appointed with a sink, microwave, tea and coffee making facilities and plates, cutlery etc... The bathroom was compact and clean with all you really need without offering much in the way of special - water pressure was a bit low and the hot water fairly variable. Good linen, amenities and plenty of character, but the usual creaks and noises you often get with timber floors and historic buildings. The hotel has a small cafe/bar/breakfast room at the front of the hotel with a few table inside and on the front veranda - ok breakfast included in the room rate and really handy if you don't feel like heading out. There are restaurants, cafes and convenience stores within walking distance and the area is lovely. Would recommend to those who like historic boutique hotels close to but not right in the city centre - we would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~3~nan
review_242584960~“Comfort, character and location”~some consider boutique hotels to be very high end. Well, the Hatton is a boutique in that it has character , perfect location and friendly staff that remembered our names and what we drank for breakfast. Great to be outside of CBD, so that you get local restaurants, and walking around the neighborhood is a delight. Our room was large, bright, comfortable - nothing extraordinary but perfect. Windows that open- and you can make coffee and tea in the room The breakfast is more than ample - we were tired of having eggs every morning on the trip. From our perspective - it was simply perfect - not precious - but a delightful respite~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_241333426~“Hats off to the Hatton”~What a great find! I booked three rooms (two for three nights and one a Saturday night stay only) and everyone in my group had the same to say. The rooms are spacious and airy with their enormous ceilings. Bed linen is crisp and comfortable. Lovely waffle robes to lounge in armchairs in our room or after a bath. My husband said he could occasionally pick up the sound of the tram out front but it did not disturb his sleep and he is a light sleeper normally. I found the rooms quiet and good for sleeping. The tiny facilities in the corner cupboard that included a microwave and kettle was brilliant. And you cant fault T2 teas either. Other notable points about the Hatton: - Breakfast is continental but lovely with really good quality cereals, fruit and three or four different breads for toast along with small pastries and real coffee (including soy - which delighted my lactose intolerant travel companion as he cant always get that). Its a sensible breakfast spread and you can eat as much of it as you like, so you wont be hungry. - Small but lovely selection of wines and beer which can be consumed in the charming front area including the balcony,  - Take the stairs to the rooftop and sit admiring the Melbourne city views - and bring your drinks. There's a small fridge at the top of the stairs to keep it all cool while you are there. Perfect. And what is more, it caught a lovely breeze on our very hot first day.  - The staff are the most helpful friendly and polite people (all ladies for our stay although I don't know if that is the case usually!)  - The number 8 tram stops literally outside the door and goes all the way into the city or all the way out to Toorak so makes this a super super convenient place to stay because it is in a quiet, leafy lovely street yet is only minutes to lots of fab eating, shopping and business addresses. (You can get a Mikki travel card at the 7-eleven on the corner too) - The Botanical gardens (including the Tan run) are just at the end of the street too. That's a great place for a stroll, to sit and read or chill, or to take your run.  Considerations: - Getting into the shower was a little awkward because its in a deep bath but the supplied stool and handrail made it alright and it is not enough of an issue not to stay here - The lack of drapes on the windows (wooden shutters) does mean a little more early light gets in than I would've liked but again, this is not enough to not book this hotel. You will get a good nights sleep! I will also add that we had a terrible mix up in the booking somehow and somewhere along the way that would have seen me spend almost half the total weekend again. Disaster! But the team at the Hatton were just fabulous and waived the extra on the proviso I got the booking agent to make some adjustments to charges to them - which I was very happy to do. I cant thank them enough for being so gracious and helpful. Finally, there is no doubt that this is now the Melbourne hotel of choice. There is absolutely no reason for it not to be. Don't be put off because you think its out of the city centre; that's the whole pleasure and the tram means you wont even notice when it counts.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_239995611~“Something different....”~Nice small boutique hotel. Don't miss the rooftop terrace for a view of Melbourne skyline. The hotel is in walking distance of the botanical garden and a number of cafes around the corner. Best rooms are facing the back.~4~4~4~4~4~3~4~nan
review_239753870~“Nice and clean but not blown away either”~This hotel came highly recommended by friends and indeed there were lots of positives: nice linen and towels; designer toiletries; a high standard of cleanliness; good coffee; nice breakfast; the tram at the doorstep; shops and restaurants just minutes away. Not so positive were the hard, lumpy bed and the buzzing of the room fridge which was just one of the sounds, along with conversations, sneezes and television (until past 2am) in adjacent rooms that kept me awake most of the night. A good place for heavy sleepers (and I do use ear plugs).~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_239742318~“Something different, in a good way!”~I stayed in The Hatton for two nights in the Eastern Balcony Suite. This is located at the front of the hotel and has a sizeable balcony overlooking the street. The street is a bit noisy at night with trams passing and pedestrians talking, but that is quite normal in this part of town. The hotel has a really boutique feel and the staff was friendly. The furnishing is quite unique, mainly traditional Chinese, and functional. The room was very clear and the bed comfortable. Daily continental breakfast of excellent quality is included in the room rate. This is served in the 'hub' where the reception is located as well. Overall a really nice hotel that offer an experience that is very different from the average business hotel.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan
review_234999933~“Great Hotel”~We had ten nights at the Hatton and really enjoyed our stay. We stayed in two different rooms as we split our stay with a trip to Tasmania. Both rooms were nice, a good size, with big bathrooms and a small kitchen area. The hotel is very charecterful, lots of art and a nice roof terrace. The hotel only does breakfast and very light snacks, but that didn't matter, as there are so many good restaurants within immediate walking distance. It's in a brilliant location; there is a tram stop right outside the door. It's two minutes away from the beautiful botanical gardens and within walking distance from the city. The staff were helpful and pleasant - I loved Amy in particular. I visit Melbourne often and would definitely stay here again. One tip for elderly or disabled guests, there isn't a lift so ask for a room on the ground floor.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_234205929~“Quality and comfort in a bijou building”~This is a grand multi-level, terrace building in a lovely part of South Yarra close to the Botanical Gardens. The complimentary breakfast is a healthy self-serve continental buffet, breakfast cereals/fruit/yoghurt/juices/gourmet toast/cheese/jams/tea/barrista coffee. The rooms are all different so it invites repeat stays to experience the variety, bedding is brilliant white with the loveliest of down doonas, ( wish the mattresses were pilowtops!), bathrooms are clean and rooms are always cleaned to a high standard.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_233534961~“A find”~You cannot beat the knowledgeable, helpful staff. We really liked the location, with interesting architecture and good restaurants nearby. Its unbeatable breakfast started off each day wonderfully. We would definitely stay here again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_216442098~“Decent, but not blown away”~We stayed here 2 nights as my husband and I were visiting the MCG and wanted a hotel close by. Location is perfect for the Olympic Park and Botanical Gardens.  I booked the hotel having read the fantastic reviews other tripadvisors had written, and was impressed at first. I had emailed the hotel after booking to get some advice on the local area and the MCG tour, and Alex responded quickly and gave some great advice which I really appreciated.  When we arrived at the hotel, it was before the check in time as I had advised on the booking form, and we were able to get into our room early, which again was great. I asked the woman on duty a few questions about getting around the local area on the trams, and although she gave good advice, she was looking at her computer the whole time which I felt was a bit rude.  We ordered food in on our first night there, which the man on duty helped arrange (he was friendly, helpful and really pleasant to deal with). The continental breakfast was good, but it is the staff at breakfast that really disappointed me. On both mornings, it was 2 women on duty and they seemed much more interested in their own conversations than anything else going on. When asking a question, I felt as though I was interrupting. After all the great reviews and feedback regarding the staff, I was expecting a bit more from The Hatton.  All in all, a good stay and I would recommend the hotel for travellers wanting to avoid the city centre, but was left a bit disappointed that my husband and I did not receive the same level of friendly service as other guests have described.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_209510939~“Rustic & comfortable”~The Hatton is a place we've come back to regularly, more often if it wasn't so fully booked all the time! It's a really relaxing place to stay, at a great location next to the beautiful Botanic Gardens & the tram stop is right in front. Service staff are wonderful. Lovely restaurants at its doorstep. The rooms are large & comfortable with nice wooden floorboards (including in the bathrooms!) although the sound does carry due to the floorboards. There's a very cosy breakfast lounge cum bar which is a great place to chill any time of the day & a nice rooftop area to hang out for a drink or even breakfast. All in all a nice place to stay while in Melbourne esp if you want to avoid the bustle of the city yet living not too far away.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_209337845~“Perfect start to our honeymoon”~My husband and I stayed at the Hatton upon arriving in Melbourne for a week long honeymoon. It was just perfect. From the very friendly, hands on staff to the beautiful complimentary toiletries and quirky decor, this place has it all. The staff really make this boutique hotel really a home away from home.  Easy peasy to get into the city and great cafes and restaurants nearby.  Thank you team for making our holiday unforgettable!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_207489968~“Best location and staff”~This was my first trip to Melbourne and I felt blessed that I chose The Hatton based upon Tripadvisor reviews. The service was superb. The staff was consistently friendly, warm, and welcoming, going out of their way to be helpful. The small lounge was a comfortable place to relax, have a beer or glass of wine, snacks, and meet other guests. I was in room 14 on the ground floor in the back of the building and up a few steps. The large light-filled room had a table and two chairs next to a large window with a view of the city, a built-in kitchenette, a flat screen tv, and an immaculate bathroom with a large white porcelain tub and shower. I would take the same room, but would suggest that seniors or the disabled seek a room with a bathroom on the same level. The bathroom is down a wooden stairway about four steps. In dim light it might be difficult to judge the slight step down from the room to the landing since both are the same color. I got used to it, but it might be a challenge for others. That being said, I would take the same room again. The room was quiet, comfortable, and I slept soundly. The location was terrific. A tram stops directly in front of the hotel and goes to the CBD in minutes, passing by many major sights. The Hatton is on Park St, midway between the glorious Royal Botanical Gardens, and another park. Both are a five minute walk. On one corner is a 7-11 where you can buy your "Mika" (tram) card. Adjacent to the corner is a dry cleaners and many excellent small restaurants.  I was very pleased with The Hatton and would recommend it highly to others. It will be my first choice when I return to Melbourne. Kudos to the great staff!~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_207455876~“The perfect Melbourne experience”~This beautiful boutique hotel ticked every box for a wonderful Melbourne experience. The staff were welcoming and very knowledgable and helpful. The room was simple and stylish and very quiet and relaxing. The location is perfect with a tram right outside, although we chose to walk everywhere and loved every experience. The cosy and intimate private bar was just the icing on the cake. Thankyou for a truly wonderful Melbourne experience.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_207275002~“Small cozy boutique hotel”~Hotel is at South Yarra, very close to city. Tram stop is in front of hotel, South Yarra train station is just 10 minutes walk.

review_206129625~“Cannot be faulted”~Up to 5 years ago I stayed at the Hatton a lot. Then trips to Melbourne fell away, so it was with some anticipation I returned last week. It was a favourite of mine - small, friendly, homely. Nothing pretentious, but everything needed is supplied. Happily, nothing has changed in 5 years. Maybe some staff, and the linen, and the cups and saucers.....it was again a delight. Room, spacious, with a small external courtyard. Bathroom, with bath! Nice. Internet, free. Breakfast, healthy, free, newspapers supplied, fruit, friendly staff to make a coffee, nice little breakfast room with atmosphere.......there's a nifty wine list of boutique wines, lots of knowledge of the arty happenings in Melbourne, all good things. Literally around the corner are a couple of very nice brasseries, and the Melbourne tram is outside for a quick trip to the City. Oh, and the Botanical Gardens are next door. How good is that? And the rates are great. If you want predictable city hotels, you already know where to book. If you want comfort, value, fun, handy and feel good, book here. You will not be disappointed. I never have been.~5~5~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_203040742~“perfect for a quick trip”~great staff, large rooms, close to everything we needed. not so big that you feel like an ant, not so small you feel in the way. we stayed for the anzac long weekend to attend the dawn service and walked there from the hotel. the superior room had a small kitchenette service as well, which made it even more appealing for a few more days. definitely worth booking again for future trips.~4~4~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_202933463~“Hatton Hotel - would not stay anywhere else in Melbourne”~I have stayed at the Hatton on numerous trips and won't stay anywhere else! It's central location make it an attractive place to stay - walking distance to town, Toorak and of course my morning exercise on the Tan. Great cafes nearby, terrific breakfast included and wonderful rooms. Staff are always friendly and accommodating. I can't recommend The Hatton highly enough - and thank goodness I found it years ago!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_202814073~“Good base for business”~Stayed for a few nights while doing meetings in and around Melbourne. I utilised the free parking so I could travel by car out of the city, and caught the tram, which stops immediately outside the hotel, to get to the CBD. Staff were very helpful, room was very clean, but a bit small. Very close to the botanic gardens for morning/evenings walking/running.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_199934029~“Nice boutique hotel”~Only stayed 1 night. Huge old guest house close to gardens, bit far from cbd for some but tram right past door. Easy reception welcome and check in. Room very big, furniture inconsistent in type, some modern fittings then an old coffee cup stained sideboard. Comfortable bed and pillows. Ensuite down some stairs and bath not easy to get in so wouldnt recommend this room for older guests. Continental breakfast nice with cereals, muesli, fruit, yoghurt and pastries, toast and real coffee too. Parking difficult so ring and ask hotel what spots they have free.~3~3~4~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_197148606~“Best housekeeping”~I have stayed at The Hatton Hoteland it is by far my favourite hotel in Australia.Enjoyed myself thoroughly staying in this hotel.

review_192068793~“A great place to stay in Melbourne”~We stayed for three nights to see the Aust Open for our 30th wedding anniversary and we were able to walk to Melbourne Park, access the free on site parking (only 3 spots so. Get in early) and have lovely breakfasts on verandah in morning and drinks on roof in evening. Friendly, relaxed informative, considerate staff. They very kindly threw in some champers when they learned it was a special occasion for us. Highly recommended! ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_187752995~“Convenient location”~Great breakfast - fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, breads, juice and a proper coffee! This is included in the rate. Our room was spacious and well appointed. The only downsides are a distinct lack of parking (only 3 spaces available), although we did manage to find a space down the street. There was an issue with the toilet (it took 10 flushes to remove everything...), which I did advise staff upon leaving - the staff were very friendly. Would I stay here again - Yes, absolutely.~4~3~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_185360752~“Divine!”~I had the most incredible stay with my partner at The Hatton Hotel. It was so gorgeous and cosy. The morning breakfast was all we needed drinking T2 Tea and granola/fruit. The location was so perfect! The tram stop is right out front and a 100m walk down the road are beautiful cafes a 7-11 and the most amazing sushi bar. I honestly can't rave enough about The Hatton Hotel and we can not wait to stay here again.  PERFECTION. Tiarne Ettingshausen Escape Magazine~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_185009227~“nice boutique hotel”~The Hatton is conveniently located, with short walk to botanic gardens, fine selection of restaurants, brief cab ride to CBD, and tram stop nearby. The building itself is charming, and the décor is a surprise - eclectic modern art, and clean walls inside a traditional Victorian building. The rooms are simple and functional, with taste. We stayed in room 11, so not sure how this compares with other rooms, but can highly recommend this choice. The bath is beautifully oversized, the bed comfortable. selection of teas in the room good. The best part of this room was the opening window... located above a sprawling green mass of climbing ivy and at the rear side of the hotel, so it was quiet and peaceful, and provided a lovely calm green view. Although the room is somewhat Spartan in décor, it was very clean, as was the rest of the hotel; with one exception, the windows! Free wi fi is available. Down side, no hot meals or room service, though small snack / antipasto type foods available at the front desk during business hours. Breakfast is continental, so again no cooked eggs, but the bread selection was good, and there was some cheese. There are good cafes nearby to cater for any other food preferences. Overall, a lovely calm place to stay.~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_183478455~“A lot to like at the Hatton”~Stayed for 2 nights in room 14, a spacious twin at the rear of the hotel, so it was blissfully quiet. It had an excellent en-suite with bath and shower over, down a few steps from the bedroom providing l'Occitaine toiletries. I loved the bath bomb. Beds had excellent linens, and were very comfortable. The rest of the furniture was a bit worn, and not top quality, but perfectly serviceable. It was also nice to have kettle, sink, and plates and crockery provided Breakfast was served in the bar, and was continental, fruit, lovely pastries, toast etc. enjoyed it Staff were delightful, helpful and a great asset to the hotel Situated on a tram route, but only 40 mins walk from the centre of Adeleide, and right by the Botanical Gardens so good base for sightseeing. Near several excellent restaurants- staff very good with their suggestions. Would highly recommend~4~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan

review_177733691~“Comfortable boutique hotel.”~We were given a gift voucher for our stay - and loved being here. The location is sensational - parklands nearby, shopping village, restaurants & tram outside the door; the decor - with an eclectic art collection displayed brings this boutique hotel to another level. It's like being in a special gallery! Breakfast in the front room is fresh, tasty and better than most continental breakfast offerings. Very friendly and efficient staff. Would definitely go again!~5~5~5~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_176859684~“more like a home... great place!”~Away from the bland, chain style hotels, The Hatton, a Victorian building in S Yarra is a good place to stay. Easy walking to many cafes, shops, restaurants and bars. Tram stops outside giving access to the city. close to the Domain, botanic Gardens. Comfortable beds with good linens, spacious rooms (all a bit different), wooden floors, windows that open! rooftop area!  Reception /breakfast area/lounge has a fireplace and the fire welcomes on a chilly, winter evening. mice to sit in here with a glass of wine and mingle... or not!!!~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_176417385~“Super Stylish Melbourne Institution...Must Visit Annually!”~We are very fond of this stylish boutique hotel in the affluent suburb of South Yarra. We have visited many times over the past 7 years - and once stayed for 5 nights. It is an annual event - we must visit The Hatton...On the last 2 occasions we have stayed in the Eastern Balcony Room which has a luxurious bed, deep bath, small dining table and a wonderfully large balcony overlooking the beautiful terraces of Park Street. The other rooms we have stayed in are also lovely, roomy and simply styled. All of the rooms have L'occitane bath products, very nice. We love the small sitting room at the front of the building - nice in winter when there is a small open fire, glass of red and art/architecture magazine in hand. The breakfast is served in this room and it is equally enjoyable - a cup of T2 (tea), museli loaded with macadamias, poached fruits, artisan toast, cheeses, French pastries etc.. very Euro style. The Hatton is super close to the beautiful Royal Botanical Gardens, which is close to 40 hectares of stunning landscaped gardens, we always enjoy a beautiful stroll and then a Melbourne coffee at My Legendary Girlfriend. Right outside the Hatton is a tram stop, which is very handy to pop into the city or visit the Art Gallery (NGV). It is super close to lots of great cafes - Bacash, France-Soir, Golden Triangle, MamaBaba (George Calombaris's new one) to name a few. We adore this Hotel and look forward to our 2014 visit, or perhaps a 2nd 2013 stay!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_176270250~“My default hotel choice for Melbourne”~I prefer to stay in neighbourhoods where people actually live, rather than sticking to the beaten tourist track, which is why I usually choose The Hatton. It's half a block away from the Royal Botanic Gardens, and around the corner from great cafés and one fantastic restaurant (Bacash). I love the building's appearance from the front, and the common area is great for chilling out. The staff are helpful and friendly but non-intrusive. I asked for late check-out, which I was given at no extra charge. I got up way too late for breakfast, but the young lady at the desk was happy to let me have a couple of pastries and make me a pot of chai.  Got a bit of a dud room this time--nothing special about it. Normally I'm taken with the charm of their rooms, and they're all different, with no standard hotel-issue furniture.  Added benefit--the #8 tram stops right in front.  Quirky benefit--the TV is mounted at the perfect angle to watch telly in bed whilst propped up with pillows. BTW, I really take issue with some of the negative reviews of this place. I think some people would be impossible to please even if champagne was flowing out of the taps.~4~3~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_174223777~“Oasis of calm in Toorak”~After arriving around 8.30pm on a dark, cold, blustery night, a long working day and an inter-state flight, the warm welcome and wonderful room appeased my senses. Downstairs the superior room was large, with high ceilings, beautiful timbered floors, and doors gave onto a private terrace. Unfortunately I couldn't use this or the roof terrace because of the weather, but the large oak table in the room was perfect for spreading maps, papers, i-pad and the clutter of travel. Bed lights were excellent, great for reading, something overlooked by many hotels. The roomy bathroom had a bath and plenty of shelf space where the Occitan toiletries stood. The residential street and the soft bedding meant quiet nights. I enjoyed breakfast: a choice of home-made mueslis, a dish of thick Greek style yoghurt , a dish of soft ripe strawberries, various breads, jams, juice and your choice of coffees or T2 teas. Only disappointment were the croissants and pastries. I'm sure the lovely small A la Folie patisserie in Chapel Street or similar could provide better. Service was always friendly and helpful. Next morning, umbrellas at the door, I caught a tram around the corner into Toorak Road-so easy with the stop right outside although it is an easy walk. Next time I'll visit the Botanical Gardens at the other end of the street. Interesting restaurants, shops and the station all fairly close.~5~5~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_173593087~“Wonderful building in central location”~First impression is what a stunning building. I checked in and walked up the grand staircase and down the wide hallway to my room and was so pleasantly surprised by the spacious room with lovely old polished floor boards, modern and understated decor, and large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and amenities perfect for the business traveller, the rates are very reasonable and restaurants in walking distance. I'll definitely stay again.~5~4~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_173105176~“great stay, but stale breakfast”~first the positive: we spent five nights there in August and we loved the building, the location, the room and bathroom decor, the bedding, we even did not mind the stairs (we stayed in a downstairs room). And of course we loved the FREE WI-Fi, a rarity in Australia. And now for the less positive: breakfast is plenty and generally really good, the staff make you endless cups of whatever coffee you want etc. My only complaints? The pastries were ancient. I paid attention and the same tray of pastries was put out on the buffet for at least three days in a row. By the day we left, it started to look really bad. One day the yogurt was sour and another day the milk, so that one of us ended up not feeling too well. These are small but important details that can make a huge difference for a traveler.~3~5~5~5~5~3~5~nan
review_170079408~“A wonderful weekend”~We recently spent a weekend in Melbourne and thoroughly enjoyed the two nights we stayed at The Hatton. Our room #10 was large as was the ensuite and there was plenty of storage space available. While we didn't make full use of it the microwave, fridge and tea and coffee making facilities were an added bonus.  The food on offer for breakfast was healthy, tasty and plentiful.  The location was excellent and while there was a tram stop at the door we walked into the CBD at a leisurely pace in about half an hour. All staff were friendly and helpful and up for a chat.  We had a memorable stay at The Hatton and have already planned our next visit!~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_166156690~“Still a great place to stay”~5th visit to the Hatton and as always we found it to be a very welcoming. We had a late flight and did not check in until around midnight, staff were quick to let us in and let us get settled.  Can't really fault it, yes it has some quirks but that is why we keep going back. Clean rooms, great beds and bathrooms with plenty of privacy if you want it. Location is great, trams stop right out front with an easy 10 minute ride into the city. Stacks of geat places to eat and drink within easy walking distance. (Chapel St, Toorak Rd) Breakfast is plentiful with good coffee. Ipad, magazines and newspapers are available in the dining room/bar. A great alternative to staying right in the city.~4~4~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_164852354~“Grand old Victorian charm”~I had a very comfortable and restful stay in this beautiful hotel with a grand bedroom and lovely clean bathroom. I loved the old stately architecture reminiscent of my childhood home. Breakfast was great as it was non fuss in a cosy little dining room. The location is perfect to embrace the charm of Melbourne with the trams outside in the street and the Tan down the road for a morning walk plus the Botanical gardens. Good restaurant and great coffee are just a short walk down the road. Highly recommend.~4~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_156084792~“fresh and creatively decorated rooms”~I have stayed at this hotel twice- once on my own in December 2011 and again with my husband in November 2012. The hotel is very relaxed and informal with a happiness-making feel from the great decor and beautiful, super clean bathrooms . We both travel a great deal for business and this was decidedly not a business hotel, something we both enjoyed very much. The distance by tram from the city centre is short but also makes it seem like you have seen more of the city than you might if you stayed in the city centre.  The only reason I did not give it an excellent rating is because when I was there the first time I overheard staff members talking about the possibility that the hotel might close if the owners didn't pay closer attention to upkeep, and it did not feel like things were clearly explained at check-in. For instance, I had to ask about breakfast and I had to ask about getting a tram pass. I did not have a sense of that during my second visit almost a year later although things seemed slightly more rundown than the year before. Still, it's a popular hotel in a wonderful city and well worth a stay.~4~3~4~5~4~5~4~nan
review_155567629~“Great Location, Friendly Service”~Came here on the recommendation of an Aussie friend. Great success and nice to find something other than a cookie cutter sameish hotel with no character. The Hatton has it in spades. Comfortable, quiet room with a great bed after a long flight from the UK and a super breakfast on arrival. The Hatton is in a lovely part of town right by the Botanical Gardens. A ride on the tram, which stops right outside and comes by every few minutes, takes you to Flinders Street in 10 minutes or so. A good selection of coffee bars asnd restaurants is right around the corner from the hotel. A rare find.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
