review_452791809~“A Cosmopolitan Stopover”~Whenever we travel to Melbourne we always make time for a one night stopover in Carlton. We choose Lygon Lodge because it is in the heart of Lygon Street Carlton, surrounded by a great choice of restaurants and is close to the City and Vic Markets. This motel is clean, quiet and offers a balcony but without views I'm afraid. I only pop out on the balcony for a quick early morning smoko so it is no problem. We spend most of our time wandering Lygon Street shops and cafes. Highly recommended as a convenient stopover. Room rate is around $130-$140 p/n.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_452537632~“Wonderful location”~We came to Melbourne for 5 days for a rare holiday. We chose Lygon Court for its location and were not disappointed. We walked to and from the City and all the interesting historical sites & sights of Melbourne everyday. It's a decent walk but a very do-able distance and enjoyable. At night jumped on the tram which is only a five minute walk from the hotel. Lygon Lodge has every type of eatery you can imagine within a few minutes walk plus supermarkets for essentials. The room was made up every day and the staff were very obliging. I will be recommending it to anyone who is wanting to maximise their tourist experience in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449393175~“Just What We Needed”~Great location in the middle of Lygon Street. My husband actually walked into the city one morning. Staff were helpful. We were able to get a car park at the Hotel which was great. Clean basic rooms -easy book in easy check out.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_446170607~“Excellent lygon st position”~Tucked away accommodation in the middle of Lygon st Carlton. No parking out front for check in so ring & describe ur vehicle then follow their back laneway directions for secure on site parking. Friendly helpful staff , clean room, bit cosy but ok ! Elevator or stairs to reception, 101 great restaurants at front door - we love Tiamo's, Nova cinema & Brunetti s nearby. Highly recommend this accommodation~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444114179~“Great Location (Limited FREE parking)”~The main reason I booked this hotel was the location and free parking. However when I checked in, the staff told me that it's not much chance to park in the hotel parking space, and suggested me the meter parking on the street. Their parking space may serve around 15 cars. We had to try our luck every time drive back to hotel.  Apart from the parking, the location is great. Room is nice as well. Many restaurants and shops nearby, and walking distance to the city and free tram zone stop.  One last thing, we prepaid the hotel booking via booking web site but when we checked out, the staff couldn't find the payment record in their system and needed us to pay. We had to show them proof and finally they found the record on the document we signed when we checked in. They forgot to update in their system.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442006223~“Handy Location ”~Great location!! Friendly efficient check in check out staff at all times.Badic but clean , quiet comfy accommodation. Situated next to Mondi restaurant which is a great place to eat or chill out on the footpath tables with a drink.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440546037~“Great value”~It's the first time we stayed in this place . It's not far from the city. It took us 15 minutes to walk going to Chinatown. Lots of restaurants in the area. The hotel itself is tidy, nice bathroom. There's a little kitchen if you decided to cook. Staff are friendly and accommodating.  For the price you pay it's worth it. I am happy to stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440496938~“Good Location”~Stayed here a few nights ago. Central location, good price but...entrance to the rooms is through the under-roof car park. Very clean but rock hard pillows and no comfy chair to sit on. Due to location, the street and cafe noises kept me awake till the early hours. Staff very pleasant and helpful.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_440028183~“Great location ”~This place is so basic and relaxed, don't come expecting high hotel standards and then complain. It's clean, bathroom looks recently renovated and we used Uber to get around the whole time. Had a hairdryer, ironing facilities and a mini kitchen with stove top.  You can walk into the city for 15 mins, or get to the other side of the city for an $8 Uber. We spent mornings getting the best coffee I've had from the restaurant directly across the road. Would definitely stay again, no fuss~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434953856~“Good value for money - great location”~I stayed here in October for 5 nights. I was very happy with the room. It was quite spacious and clean. It is not so modern but certainly adequate for the price. The kitchenette was adequate too. The staff were very helpful and friendly. There is free wifi which was fast enough and free car parking although very tight to get in and out. Very comfortable bed and pillows. The location is great. Walking distance to the CBD and also to trams, and of course, being in Lygon Street there is no shortage of places to eat. I would stay here again.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434122712~“Friendly place, great location.”~We stayed for 5 nights in October on a combination work and tourism trip. The desk staff was very friendly and tried to assist with such matters as restaurant recs, car rentals, even dealing with computer disasters. The hotel is very clean, if a bit tired looking decor-wise. Our room had a kitchen area and balcony, surprisingly quiet. The hotel is located smack dab in the heart of Carlton's Italian community, surrounded by an almost overwhelming array of coffee shops and restaurants. I could see where all the street action might be a downside, but for a short visit it was lots of fun. Easy 15 minute walk to a central train station, less than that to the fabulous Victoria Markets.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_431964393~“Great place to stay”~We booked this accommodation because it is within walking distance of the Exhibition Centre. The city is easily accessible and the Lodge is in the popular Lygon St Restaurant area. The Lodge has free parking and is equiped with basic cooking facilities. This would be a great base for a holiday in Melbourne , allowing for self catering or eating nearby. The accommodation was very comfortable and the staff very helpful. My only suggestion would be that a small table to eat at would be very helpful~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_429031119~“Where to stay when going Italian in Melbourne”~Great position, comfortable, clean, and reasonably priced. Free parking and wifi as well as the friendly staff, made our visit most enjoyable. Lygon Street is a mecca for those who love italian food, and you're on the right side of the city to visit the Queen Victoria market, the zoo and the Exhibition Building and the Museum.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_405108831~“Good location and cheap price - missing some basic necessities for me”~Overall: the location is great, a short walk into the city and restaurants everywhere. Weren't always able to secure a park, but as we stayed over the weekend, there was free parking close by. The hotel was a cheap price so I wasn't expecting anything over the top, but I do appreciate the basics, of which the venue did not fully hit the mark for me. Good: - cheap price - great location - shower was hot and had great water pressure - had a little balcony Bad: - no top sheet on the bed + thin, small douve that was too short for my partner  - hairdryer didn't work  - would have liked more than one pillow each (there were decorative cushions, however not sure how frequently they're washed given that one had a stain on it when we arrived)~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_402106940~“Fantastic everytime!!”~This is the only place we stay when visiting Melbourne!! Lygon Lodge has everything at its doorstep, food, drink, entertainment & the lifestyle, the location is second to none!! The rooms are beautifully kept and very comfortable. The staff here are also incredibly accommodating and welcoming, you seriously will not stay at a more inviting establishment anywhere, well I'm yet to find one anyway!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397167134~“Great location”~Great location to wonderful food, close to vic markets, close to trams. Perfect location to view the city area and catch free tourist tram. All trams in city area are free. The famous Lygon street is well known for its itilian restaurants and believe me they are fantastic and extremely well worth a visit.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_396014378~“Great location ”~It was everything we wanted. Catching up with my cousin we could park and make the easy walk to the city and the local shops and laneways in the area. Will definitely stay again. The shower was good the room lovely and clean a really good budget accommodation place.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395714300~“Good Location for Restaurant”~Stayed 1 night for new year eve. Convenient location access to other nice restaurant. Not a fancy or romantic hotel for couple getaway but is convenient for business or visit friends around. Facilities was ok and the room was clean too.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_384109133~“Great place to stay in the hub”~Great place to stay in the hub, so close to the cbd and right in the center of Lygon St. The place was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. For the price it was excellent. The room was simply decorated with all essentials and the bathroom was modern.  If you want somewhere quiet and the whole hotel experience then I suggest you don't stay in the hub of Lygon as there are always people bustling till late at night. My daughter and I fortunately loved it.  It was a little noisy with the bins being emptied but that didn't last long.  Keeping this on my list for when I have to go back to Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382033050~“Clean good location ”~Its a matter of you get what you pay for. When we travel to melbourne we are hardly in the room anyway. Clean, functional, comfortable. Parking is annoying with a first in first served basis. Might try some other motels in the area next time~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_372925540~“Too noisy”~The room itself was fine. If you are a light sleeper DO NOT get a front suite. I could not believe how many wankers with modified exhausts get their jollies from driving on Lygon Street. All the way to about 2.00am. Did not hear/see one police siren all night. It's a disgrace that is costing the Lodge business.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_366448758~“There really is no parking”~Room was ok, small and nothing special but price was ok. The problem is the parking. There really isn't any and you can't reserve any even if you have some one with a disability. They explained parking when I rung after I had booked. Didn't mention the parking next to them. They should have told me there is parking beside them but it is very expensive, cost me $52 from 6 pm to 8.30 the next morning. Wouldn't stay there again as most times I need parking.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_365133563~“2 stays ”~We have stayed twice both times in executive rooms. Overall these are good value, great location being on Lyon and reasonably well appointed rooms.  The first stay (4 nights), we were disturbed by the dustbins being emptied in the early hours. The balcony was also not really usable as the smell of cooking is overwhelming. We opted to stay on the other side the next 3 days which is much quieter although the romantic activities from next door were all too audible on the Saturday. Very helpful staff and lovely showers. If you want to eat on lygon, we found a simple quality rule, if there are staff trying to pull you in its probably rubbish.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362967401~“Safe and sound ”~We chose this hotel because it has what we needed; a carpark, a kitchenette, security. It's away from the busy CBD but it's within a convenient drive. The room itself is a little dark, tired and worn out. For one night, it has done its job well.  The carpark is a little small so make sure you get a spot early. There is a cool cafe by its corner serving specialty coffees.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356055322~“Great location and good value.”~As the title suggests this is ideal for many tourist attractions, eateries , pubs and parks. Staff were helpful and the tariff was reasonable. Our balcony was very tiny and had no outlook. So clean n tidy but not flash in any way.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_355323449~“Becaused I needed to”~Lygon Lodge was close enough but far enough away from the shops, from the crowds, from the bustle of city life. Rooms were clean, reception staff helpful. Lincoln Square tram station was within walking distance. I felt safe staying here.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_355165824~“Just OK”~Spent 2 night close to food and the CBD. The room was ok it was noisy and the food smells were strong but again you walk out onto Lygon Street. The only thing that made me mad was we placed a Do not disturb sign on the door and the cleaners came in anyway. This is not acceptable.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_348340326~“Plain but good”~Had a good night in a plain but clean functional room Fridge a bit noisy but good otherwise. Will stay there again. Friendly helpful staff. Good location and parking is provided if you get there early enough. Thank You~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_346018630~“Best place to stay in inner city Melbourne”~We've stayed at Lygon Lodge for years now both short term and long term stays - and it is the best place to stay in inner Melbourne. Great location, comfortable rooms with facilities, friendly relaxed atmosphere. Staff and owners are friendly and approachable.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_344896821~“Adequate but no more than that”~I stayed for 4 nights and had a standard room on the first floor. No major issues checking in and out. The room was clean and quiet, but faced the wall of the building next door so was pretty gloomy and not a place you would want to spend a lot of time in. Kitchen facilities were basic (I never did work out how to use the microwave). The shower did not have a soap holder but did have a rusty bracket where one used to be. Odd. Ironing board was not long for this world, although the iron worked fine. Cramped cupboard space. Free wifi worked fine most of the time. Location is handy as others have noted. But note that there are plenty of very ordinary tourist-trap "Italian" eateries in Lygon Street and a fair number of them are just outside the front door of Lygon Lodge, so running the gauntlet of their spruikers on the footpath can be mildly annoying. I suggest you use Trip Advisor and the like to find the better places to eat in Carlton, all within 2-3 blocks. Hard to say what other sorts of people stay here because I hardly saw anyone else.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_342595517~“Location Good but Bad Customer Service”~First impression on arrival - Young lady was very good (during the week), just what you would hope with greeting us. Room was good, adequately stocked, location fairly handy to transport. Then it all went downhill. On our 2nd morning we left our room as usual only to come back and find all our food had been taken (presumably thrown out). The items were still in the fridge but what we had in a bag on the counter - gone. This was left the day before and we certainly weren't checking out so could not understand why someone would throw out our breakfast items and snacks. When the front desk was approached (this was now a weekend), the guy was disinterested and said, nothing they could do unless we put in a complaint, which we did. No compensation, no apology. I also asked this guy the day before we checked out if we could store our bags as we had an evening flight. No problem, they had a room for this. The next day, checked again with the girl in the morning. Leave them there she said and I will put them away. We came back 6 1/2 hours later to find our bags still in reception. When the same guy as the previous day was questioned, he said oh it's ok, someone is always here. Not exactly what we had been told and since he was the only one around, unless he had a strong bladder and lack of interest in food, then I doubt that he didn't move from the desk. Again, he really couldn't have cared less. The room was pretty good however there was no soap holder in the shower except a rusty piece of what was probably a holder. The bathroom door squeaked badly which we fixed with some shaver oil. There was an odd noise which sounded like a motor bike suddenly starting up and then off again.. over and over.. not sure what it was. our windows faced another buildings windows and there were not privacy curtains so it was either open and exposed or closed and in the dark. Other than the week day reception lady, we were really dissatisfied with the service shown by the weekend people and would not stay here again... even to the point of recommending people don't stay here.!~2~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_328159686~“Great place to stay”~We always stay here and been for quite a few years now. We have seen the Lygon being transformed to the lovely place it is now,it's a great place, you would pay twice the price for right in the city. Rooms super clean. Upon our arrival tonight we heard of the passing of Bob the owner. It will be sad going down to the foyer in the morning and not to see him to have a chat.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_327103348~“Good location all you need”~Stayed here with my mum for 3 nights. Room was good clean and had tea coffee fridge and toaster with bowls plates etc so could make breakfast if you want. Good shower. Our room was quiet not being on road side. Heaps of places to eat nearby mainly italian. Argyll square opposite nice wide tree lined street. Supermarket down the road and 7/11 opposite. Couple of blocks away from tram but on bus route and cost about $10 in taxi from flinders street station. Would definitely stay here again if come back to Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
