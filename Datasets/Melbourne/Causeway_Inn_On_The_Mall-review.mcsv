review_478665261~“Shop Til You Drop . Great Location !!”~Location speaks for itself... Right in the city and across from Meyers in the Mall !! Staff were super friendly and helpful.. Room was quiet with view of a tour with clock and bell and other city buildings...Bed very comfortable and a walk in shower... Did not have breakfast however their room for breakfast was well set up offering a continental style... Each morning during the tennis we were offered a program of who was playing on which courts therefore I will be staying there again.... Very thoughtful and helpful ..~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476058700~“Basic but good location”~We booked this place because of the location right off the mall. We arrived before "checkin time" but they happily stored our bags while we ventured off for a while. The room was quite small (think your bedroom at home with an ensuite) but this suited our needs just fine as we don't spend much time in the hotel. The shower pressure was good and the towels were a decent size compared to most places I've been to and were thick and soft too which was a nice change. At first we were concerned it was going to be too noisy due to the buskers in the mall but they had finished and were gone when we got back from an evening out. The bed was comfortable and we slept fine. The continental breakfast is the usual fruit, boxes of cereal and toast with a selection of spreads, at only $12.50 each we had booked this when we booked the room. They have gluten free bread which they happily toast separately for you - just ask though because it isn't sitting out with the other stuff. The only improvement I can suggest is a little closer attention to detail with cleaning in the shower, it looks old so it could be old staining which is probably hard to resolve without replacing the whole thing, but I wonder if some bleach and a good scrub might help. Everything else was fine so the cleaners obviously do a good job but just need to set aside extra time to fix things like this.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475494656~“Adequate”~My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights It was central. Rooms small but clean. Staff were very good. View from room poor overlooked roof of alley on which the Causeway Inn was situated. did not really matter as was only for sleeping in but taking it over all a rather dull and disappointing hotel~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474880039~“WARNING DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!”~Okay now I usually do not give bad reviews and can usually live with staff who do not like their jobs and poor facilities or service. But this time I have hit rock bottom. Currently staying here until the end of the week but I will defiantly not staying in the hotel chain again. First the beds are really comfortable and the room is small but clean and well appointed that's where the good news stops. When we arrived on Monday 10th the toilet bowl was dry and therefore the room stank of sewage. Complaint and all the maintenance people could do was flush the toilet and let us know the toilet will require flushing to stop the water being drained from the bowl and the room filling with sewage smells. As far as the maintenance staff were concerned they stated we got what we paid for???? Now internet connection. This hotel advertises "free WiFi" Yes you get 2 hours free at 0.17Mbs so slow it makes a carrier bird walking look fast. Then you pay through the nose for no increase in speed but it will cost you $4/hr I know because I did a speed-test before and after I paid for the hours internet access. The rooms are not serviced until after 4:00pm if at all. Twice this week we have got back to our room at approx 6:30pm and had to go to reception to ask for our room to be serviced. Yes, go to reception as the phone has not worked in this room since we arrived. It is a pity as this hotel has a great location and the rooms are comfortable and clean just let down by poor staff attitude and services. Now to flush the toilet again. Only two days left YEY!!!!!~1~1~nan~4~nan~nan~1~nan
review_474633657~“Ideal for short break”~We stayed in Melbourne for 5 night's at this hotel has a stop over before flying on to Auckland. We did not arrive until 01:00 hrs with the guy on the desk making us welcome, however it was a little bit of a mission getting to our room, having to go up one lift through the breakfast room then another lift to our floor and room 361. The room was clean, tidy, and everything you needed for a short stay but a little on the small side but for somewhere just to sleep was ideal. If we had been stopping longer would have preferred something with a bit more comfort and space. Breakfast is a very basic continental breakfast but plenty of it and the staff in general are very friendly This hotel is also an ideal location for exploring Melbourne's shop's, restaurant's, cafe's and attraction's most within walking distance. Would we stay here again. Yes!! I think we would but only for a short break.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_472214787~“No respobsibility”~Even though the location is good you only need one bad staff member to ruin a trip. That staff member was on reception on 3rd April at approx 7.30am. Stayed here several times won't be again. Over priced as well~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471979832~“First Time Melbourne Holiday”~Found on arrival reception staff very friendly & so helpful. Perfect location, with Bourke St one side & Little Collins Street on the other side. The room was clean & tidy, & quiet, with everything we needed. We walked to most things but had the Tram on Bourke St to use for anything out of town & also the Information Centre was right there as well.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_470240644~“Great location. Room ok for short breaks. Would recommend.”~PROS:  * The accommodation is situated in a laneway that is between Bourke St mall and Little Collins St. A few pricey eateries line the laneway which can be convenient should you want to grab a bite after 9pm.  *I stayed in room 814 which faced the mall. I could hear the buskers sing from that level but it didn't bother me as they usually stopped between 9pm-9:30pm. This could bother some people but I accepted this as part of the Melbourne nightlife. I even went to listen to Axel Winter & Eugene. Just beautiful. * All front reception staff were very friendly & helpful.  * Trams & info centre located on Bourke St side & in very close proximity to the accommodation. Location is the best thing about this place.  * Clean room with small desk & table, sofa, cupboard with clothes hangers, ironing board.  * Tea bags & instant coffee in room with jug. Bar fridge only contained long life milk & a bottle of water (which I didn't use). * 24 hr reception, quick check in/out, $50 deposit required at check in. * 7/11 is a 24hr convenient store that is a few metres from the Little Collins St laneway. CONS:  * this didn't bother me but you do have to go to the 2nd floor, walk thru the eating area, to use the lifts if your room is above the 2nd floor.  * room is close to room 813 so if occupants aren't quiet or don't close their door quietly, this could disturb you.  * I booked the room through flight centre (next time I'll mostly likely book direct as I could probably get a better deal).  * on arrival, the airport shuttle was able to drop off on Little Collins St side of the laneway, then you would need to walk a few short metres to the inn. This may bother solo travellers, families with young children who have heavy or more than a few baggage. Do take this into account when you need to get picked up for departure. I left at 6am so thankfully the shuttle was able to collect from the front door. I don't think this would have been possible from 7am onwards when the laneway eateries would start trading.  * again, this didn't bother me but could be an inconvenience to others - I stayed in the superior room, 1 QB, and there was nothing superior about it at all. Comfy bed, lights were located on one side of the room (??). Dark décor and a small bathroom. Bathroom had a shower (took a while to get hot water), shower curtain, no tub, small sink, and limited space. Overall, the room was clean though the a/c seemed like it wasn't working properly but wasn't a problem as it was still cool enough anyway.  Would stay here again & would recommend for short breaks & if location was important to you.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_470035064~“Mother/daughter weekend to see Adele.”~On opening the door to our room, I was immediately disappointed - small, boxy, no light, next to an alley, just an utter let down. Our weekend in Melbourne had been spoilt, by Flight Centre booking this sub standard accomodation on our behalf. Yes, it is in a good location, but everything oozes student/backpackers level of accomodation! Access to the room is via 2 separate elevators. On such a hot weekend as the one to see Adele - 34 deg Celsius - the a/c did not work. When we left to have dinner, we reported the problem to the desk. On return from dinner some 2 hours later, we made comment about our request to have the a/c fixed, & it was confirmed that it had been fixed. On arrival to our room - it was clear that the corridor was cooler than our room & the a/c problem had not been considered!!!! The young man apologised for it not working & offered a fan. He returned some 15 or so minutes later with a vertical fan that he said he needed to get from another hotel. As it turned out it was from another hotel's kitchen!!!! I asked if he could provide us with another room, but he said no other rooms were available. The fan made next to no difference. We only got relief from opening our window, but it didn't have any insect screens on it - so mosquitos were in the room.  The sliding door to the bathroom felt like a fire door, as it was sooooo difficult to slide open. The floor was filthy, from a build up of dirt & grime........no-one had bothered to clean the tiles or grout over time & it is just filthy. So too is the pre-fab shower recess!!!! This too needs a damn good clean. And....for basic human needs, it would've been nice to have facial tissues available, rather than have to revert to toilet paper to blow/wipe our noses on!!! Absolutely shameful, for the amount of money we payed to stay here!!!! I would NEVER suggest that anyone stay here!!!!!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469268846~“Perfect location”~Perfect location. Tram station is right at the front.  The room is not too small and very clean. Just the bed is not too comfortable for two people. Next time I will book a twin bed room even with my husband :p~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_468184936~“Very convenient location”~The Causeway Inn is located in a laneway in the middle of the shopping district of central Melbourne and so is great for a short shopping trip. Staff are very friendly, helpful and efficient. The bed was very very comfortable and the continental breakfast was nice. While the music and singing in Bourke Street Mall was pleasant during the day, some performers were a little too enthusiastic and persevered on into the evening when silence would have been nicer. But that was part of the experience.  Being able to leave bags in the foyer on the first and last day was very helpful.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465572042~“Dont be put off by this off the main street location!”~We arrived after midnight after a long flight from the UK. At first we wondered if we were in the right place the reception seemed a little cramped and tired. The guy on reception was welcoming and very friendly trying to quickly get us to our rooms aware that we needed sleep. We had been told that this was a good place to stay and when we went to our room we were not disappointed. The room was clean, spotless in fact and very comfortable. Whilst the room seemed small it was in fact totally adequate for our needs for 3 nights. We didn't have much of a view from our room window but that didnt matter. The bed was comfortable and the laundry was spotless. Our room was serviced daily and left tidy and clean with tea and bathroom materials replenished daily. We were at the end of a corridor and hthis offered us a quiet night sleep each night. The breakfasts being included is not just a plus it is an extra plus given that you have a full provision of fresh fruit, yoghurts to die for (mmm so thick and creamy!) cereals, danish pastries and toast. Tea and Coffee from the machine was surprisingly good and so made breakfast enjoyable. At the end of the dining room is a lcomfortable lounge with large TV and a selection of morning newspapares to read. The location is about 5mins walk from the Railway station and Tourist Information office and so most central attractions. Overall we very much recommend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again should we return to Melbourne.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_464167113~“Great Location!”~We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, location was amazing and the rooms were comfortable and clean. Our only downside was having to catch two separate lifts to our room but all in all it wasn't that big of a deal. This is a great hotel for wanting to be in the center of the CBD cheaply. Will definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_461284224~“Very conveniently located Hotel”~The hotel is in a laneway and so is not noisy -- no traffic going past. I stayed here some years ago and found it to be very nice and my opinion remains the same after this recent stay. The receptionist are very friendly and helpful. On this stay the building next door was doing something and a jackhammer kept working --- drowning out conversation in the Causeway hotel. Full marks to the receptionists who remained calm and helpful -- very apologetic --- and still managed a smile despite them having to have been very stressed by the problem that was not of their making. The noise was confined to reception and not the rooms. The building is rather old and the lift from the ground floor to level two is very slow. You go to level 2 using your room key to activate the lift but then change lifts to go to your floor. The second lift seems much better. Breakfast is on the 2nd floor and is very nice --- basic continental but everything fresh and plenty to eat. The room was clean and comfortable --- aging but OK for a short stay.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_460885801~“Excellent location and good value”~This hotel has a fantastic location with most of Melbourne's attractions within walking distance. The hotel itself is relatively basic but clean, well maintained and you have what you need, comfortable beds, bathroom with walk in shower. tea/coffee. We had no problems with noise. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was alright with plenty of choices. Basic dining room. Can be recommended as a central located Melbourne hotel.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459539822~“central location and good value”~Nothing fancy but good value. Excellent location easily accessible with 24hr lobby service. Room was nothing fancy but was clean and had all necessities. Bathroom pretty dated and the Bathroom door was sliding door had no handle pretty annoying to open and close. Given location right on Bourke Street Mall was pretty quiet, late night busker on friday night but is to be expected in City Centre. Basic breakfast cereal and toast available. Not fancy but served the purpose we needed.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_456611107~“Excellent for the price”~Stayed her for last 3 nights of my 4 week holiday in Oz. I could not have picked a more suitable convienent hotel. I had been staying outside of the city but wanted to see more so decided on this hotel. Nothing fancy but done the job. Right in the middle of shopping area, situated up a small lane, short walk from everything I wanted to see and trams stop right outside. Reception staff very friendly. My room was on second floor looking out to Bourke St, can be bit noisy but that didn't bother me, I loved watching all the hussell and bussell. Rooms are plain but everything you need, bed so comfy, tea/ coffe, ironing board and iron and a safe. Bathroom fine with walk in shower. I was in this hotel alone but felt very safe because of the security system they have in place. If I ever visit Melbourne again I will definitely use this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_455542126~“As expected”~We booked Causeway as it was pretty cheap. I'd read a fair amount of reviews here and think most are pretty accurate, we got what we were expecting, and I think it was good for what we paid. -Hotel staff were very helpful, happy people. -It is located right in town close to heaps of great shops and TONS of cafes/restaurants -Breakfast was plain but great, there was heaps to choose from -Bathrooms could really use an update, but ours was clean, though suffering from age -Room was small, but adequate and comfortable or 4 nights. -We had no trouble finding it, it is where it says it is and was clearly sign posted from Bourke Street. -We had a room facing onto Bourke street and the noise was generally non-existent, when you could hear it was during the day when it wasn't a problem anyway, at night it was never an issue. -We stayed for part of the Australian open and walked to and from Rod Laver arena each day/night. It was just over 2km and quite an easy walk. We would happily stay here again if we were wanting good value accommodation, though if we were wanting a "fancy" place to stay we wouldn't choose it.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455357054~“Great location and good value”~This hotel is located directly off Bourke St Mall, it has a fantastic location and restaurants ,shopping and tourist attractions are with in walking distance. The hotel itself is relatively basic but the rooms are clean and reasonably well maintained. Not sure if it is a permanent deal but our rate included breakfast which was a bonus. Breakfast was well catered for with plenty of choices.  My only complaint was we were having a girls trip to Melbourne and arriving from different cities, my friends plane was delayed so I arrived early, as the booking was in her name they would not grant me access to the room which was very disappointing as I had to wait 4 hours for my friend to arrive, the receptionist tried to help but the Manager would not budge and interesting did not come down to see me either they left it too the receptionist to deal with. I understand the privacy issue but surely common sense should prevail, so a tip for you is too make sure bookings are in both names.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_452545515~“Small and tight down a lane but the rooms were adequate”~Small and tight down a lane but the rooms were adequate but right in the middle of Bourke Street mall. We didn't realise but you can catch the free tram to the door from Southern Cross station instead of catching the airport transit bus which takes you all over the place before reaching your hotel. This added about 45min to the trip~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_452321514~“Prime Location”~Stayed here not long ago whilst on a short break in Melbourne. I love Melbourne city & when I visit this hotel is always my go to for consistent, reliable, well priced, basic accommodation.  It's incredibly well located being just off Bourke Street Mall, giving ultimate accessibility to all of Melbourne's attractions as well as a multitude of options for a bite to eat in the many little - and very close - eat street lanes.  Rooms are smallish, with just a bathroom, no small kitchen available.  Asked for a late check out here & it was granted with no issues.  The staff are so friendly and helpful, lovely to chat too.  I'd definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a simple stay in Melbourne.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_451084163~“4 daybreak in Melbourne”~The Causeway Inn could not be better located. Airbus in from the airport to Spencer St. 200 metre walk to the 86 or 96 tram and in five stops you are in Bourke St. Mall 100 metres from the hotel. The Hotel itself is very dated. We were greeted by a strange smell when walking into the reception area which is quite small. Not sure where it came from as there was no carpet on the floor. The rooms are clean but pretty small The beds (and pillows) are really comfortable. Rooms are air- conditioned and TV has some Foxtel channels. Bathroom was in need of an update. The slip resistant floor in the shower was definitely showing signs of age with some in-ground mould around the edges. Shower was hot however and towels nice and fresh. Price for the stay was very reasonable and included a continental breakfast. Staff were helpful throughout. If you want something up market then go somewhere else but if you want something that is comfortable , good value for money and fantastically located then this is the place. We would be happy to stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450011786~“A neat little hotel”~Going by reviews, I was expecting a shoebox room, with a tiny bathroom. The room size was actually quite good, the bathroom was very big and everything was clean and comfortable. Not a lot of natural light in the rooms that face the alley, but that's good if you want a solid sleep in.  There was very little noise overall, from in the hotel or the alleyway. Staff were very friendly and accommodating, and the continental breakfast was simple but satisfying.  My only grizzle is lift access up to the first floor can be quite slow, the doors of the lift open at glacial pace, and if the lift is all the way at the top, it's quicker to take the stairs. One must use this lift to get to the 1st floor, then walk across to the other bank of lifts at the far end to access the rooms. Those with walking issues might find this a bit much after a while.  Overall though, a good stay. Would stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_447114751~“Central but to be renewed ”~The hotel is in the center of Melbourne and if you are a shopping addicted is a perfect solution for a budget hotel.  Otherwise the hotel have to be renewed and you can't expect big rooms with nice bathrooms or a panoramic view of Melbourne.  Breakfast is ok if you like light menù.  The staff is very friendly.  Down in the street You can find little bars, restaurants and take away for a budget eating.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446664783~“Location Location Location”~We go to Melbourne every year to enjoy the great inner city cafes and atmosphere and the location of Causeway Inn On The Mall is perfectly suited for this. Straight out the front door and you are in the heart of things and an easy walk to Flinders Station should you wish to venture further. The hotel rooms have everything you need but are very basic - although this is fine if you are just looking for a base in the centre of the city. Make sure that you have a room that is suitable size as, when we first arrived, we needed to upgrade our room as the first one we were given wasn't big enough for my husband and I and our two bags to be in all at the same time! We did however get moved to a good sized room with a view of the mall so great for taking in the atmosphere which we go to Melbourne to enjoy. All in all, the location of Causeway Inn On The Mall is more important to us than larger rooms or expensive decor.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_444364940~“Very good for price and location but basic”~If you want a very basic hotel but at an amazing central location on Bourke St Mall, at an inexpensive rate, then this is for you. The lobby could do with a coat of paint and a makeover, but the staff there were great. The rooms were adequate with all facilities . Breakfast looked extremely basic, but we had tea and coffee making facilities in the room and a fridge and there were many beautiful cafes around.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443948594~“One night in Melbouren”~Over priced, mould on bathroom tiles. Clean sheets which was nice. Curtains flimsy. Overall...avoid.

review_441838317~“Better than Average but not Very Good (3 1/2)”~The location is great. The lobby is found down an arcade running off the City's mall, so you are in the heart of the City. Trams stop right outside. We had a room on the top floor. The room was fairly small, not made for spending time lounging around in but that was ok as that was not what we were there for. Bed was comfortable and the shower clean. Also had a room safe and iron and ironing board. Tea/coffee in room and a small fridge and TV. The breakfast was ok as it was included (juice, yoghurt, cereal, toast and spreads, sliced fruit and tea and coffee) but if I had to pay the extra $25 PP that I saw quoted I would eat out as we saw plenty of little places offering breakfast close by. Check in/out was quick and easy, and all the staff we dealt with were pleasant. If you want a no frills place to stay in the centre of the City you should consider this hotel.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_441232694~“Great place to stay, excellent location!!”~Upon arrival I found the staff at reception to be great and check-in was smooth. The thing I found a bit strange however, was the lift taking you to the 2nd floor along with a walk through the dinning area and then a 2nd lift for the bedroom floors. The bedroom itself was nice. its got all the basics one would need such as tea/coffee making facilities, mini fridge, hair dryer, clock and phone plus laundry and internet services in the hotel as well. Unfortunately though wifi is paid but 2 hours is free to customers daily. As in Nov. 2016 when I was there, the cost of wifi was 36 aud for 7 days 24 aud for 3 days. The shower had good water pressure but needed adjustment every so often and personally I found the bed to be cozy, you definitely could get a good night sleep after a long day sightseeing. The daily services I found to be clean efficient as well. As for location, everything is at your fingertips from landmarks, shops to eateries. Such places like David Jones and Myers right at your doorstep on the Bourke St. Mall, then other famous places like The State Library, Chinatown, Flinders Station, Southern Cross Station, just to name a few. Check-out was also efficient. All in all, it was a great stay 4/5~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440685116~“City getaway”~We stayed in a queen room for 2 nights 19-21st Nov.  We arrived early and reception had the duty manager came over to complete our room check so we could check in early :) The staff were super lovely and attended to all our questions, brought us additional milk and coffee at request.  The bed was very comfortable and the room clean. Quiet - we were on the 8th floor and weren't bothered by the light music of the mall.  Breakfast was continental and plenty-the ladies on staff even baked crossants early for us as we had a early flight out on our last day-thank you X Parking at galleria as very easy to find and authorisation meant ourc ticket was only $20 for the whole weekend.  Location was perfect- the lane way was great and the staff on the little cafes helpful when we a wanted a late night snack. The mall was 20m from the front door - walking distance to everywhere and the tram.  Would recommend and will hopefully be back again soon.  Thanks Causeway Inn ;)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440482279~“Convenience Plus”~This is THE most convenient place in town. Certainly no 5 stars, but you cant beat it for location, small eateries and other shops nearby.

review_440464448~“Great location in CBD but beware compact room”~Booked because of a good rate which includes breakfast. Very well located in CBD so you have great access to so much at hand. The room (314) was compact! But that was OK for the 2 nights we stayed. The room had a musty smell due we think to stale water in the drains. Needs flushing with hot water and bleach/antiseptic. The sliding door between the bathroom and bedroom worked till about halfway when you had to apply a huge effort to get it to close. As is often the case the bathroom tiles could do with a scrub using a brush and bleach. They are mouldy/grotty. If worked on concsistently then they will be better. The bed was fine and came with nice soft pillows which was good. At times the room was a little noisy because it looked straight onto the mall, opposite Myers. Continental Breakfast was adequate and they even had some gluten free for my wife! WiFi access (free for 2 hours / day) was absolutely hopeless. If you couldn't access the log in or when you did it was very difficult to get access to some sites I was trying to look at. I think they have mucked up the CC payments because when I looked at my account on returning home there were 2 entries and they did not make up the amount I was supposed to be paying correctly. If you want a relatively inexpensive room in a central location with a breakfast thrown in then this is fine.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan

review_440248263~“Location, location, location!”~Technically this hotel is 3 1/2 star, but the location gives it a fabulous edge. You are right in the heart of the cbd, cafes, shopping, quirky bars, everything Melbourne is famous for, right at your door. Parking validation is available with 2 nearby parking lots, (check the inns website), plus the trams run right outside the lane. Yes, the rooms are small, but they were very clean and the beds and linen are top quality and extremely comfortable. Didn't try the included continental breakfast but it looked fresh with a good variety. No street noise overnight. Very happy with our stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Sure, the room is poky but its clean and the beds are comfy. Breakfast is part of the deal and its fresh and plenty of it! The showers have good water pressure and you can walk everywhere! My only suggestion would be to do something about the room doors as they slam shut as you exit and the noise wakes you up and makes the walls shudder.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438685222~“Useful basic hotel”~If you are after a simple room in the centre of the city this may fit the bill. In reality it is only a three star set up. But I've given it a fourth one for location which is brilliant for the traveller. The concise story is this: - It is a simple hotel with a small reception area right in the centre of Melbourne on a pedestrian only street (well, also trams). The reception is down a somewhat dingy looking laneway. A couple of lifts are necessary to get to your room and once there you'll discover a very basic set up with a small bathroom, no minibar and bare bones amenities in general. However don't let this fool you. If you are just after a bed to sleep in on a work trip or if you really want to spend your time sightseeing and not sitting around a swish hotel room this could be for you. The price is cheap for Melbourne, they have an arrangement with a parking lot at 180 Russell St and you really are spoiled for retail therapy choice and just a few blocks from Chinatown or the Yarra River and that district. A very basic but very conveniently located hotel well worth consideration.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_437942863~“Great location, awful reception staff”~Booked online and all was well and confirmed by Booking.com. Then came the string of emails saying they needed this and that otherwise our booking would be cancelled. Great first impression. Arrived at the hotel to a VERY DINGY reception area where a 50 dollar EXTRA deposit was demanded otherwise our reservation would be cancelled! When challenged we were told this was in case we trashed the minibar. Got to the room and of course there was no minibar!! Great location, good clean room but terrible reception staff.~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan~1~nan
review_437021962~“Back Again!”~This is our second visit to the Causeway Inn. I don't think we will use any other place now. The staff are very helpful and attentive. Oh, and we just love the central location! The bed was very comfortable - always a must after busy day running around Melbourne!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_437016345~“Heart of the city”~Entrance to this hotel is in one of the very narrow lanes. The lane is always dark but has the entrance to some lovely little shops and cafes, tables, chairs and umbrellas always outside. Lots of athmosphere. The hotel itself is really okay. It's very clean with very helpful staff, decor is nice. The great draw to this hotel is location. Trams to get around the city is right outside in the mall area. Train station to access anywhere is no more than 10 minutes walk or a tram to take you there. Shops all around you. Bars all around you. The cost of staying here is very reasonable.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_436046152~“Causeway Inn on The Mall”~This is a city centre hotel, with no access to parking on site. The room was only average, but did have a refrigerator and tea/coffee making facilities. The heating system did not appear to work efficiently and therefore the room was cool. Our room overlooked an alley which housed a number of eating establishments, therefore it was noisy. The outlook was onto a disused building which had broken windows which housed pigeons! The bathroom was a "wet room", which met that once you had showered the whole bathroom was wet! Above all this, the reception staff were friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was adequate.~3~3~3~3~3~3~3~nan

review_434438591~“Tidy, efficient hotel”~This hotel is very centrally located, with efficient, tidy rooms. Our Superior Room included breakfast each morning (which was not glamorous or very innovative), and was a typical city-center hotel. The staff was accommodating, happily getting ice from its other hotel facility for our drinks. Excellent location for anyone who wants to stay right in the heart of Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_434100215~“Perfect hotel and perfect location ”~This hotel is perfect. It's now the second time we've stayed here. It's clean, comfortable and convenient. The breakfast is great- cereal, toast, fruit and pastries.  You literally walk up a the street and your right on the main shopping streetZ the metro stop is there as well which can get you anywhere for free.  I would literally stay here everytime!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433647156~“First Place we visited in Australia”~Our first experience of Australian hospitality and it was absolutely fabulous. First class, professional ,helpful staff at reception. Rooms spotlessly clean,(although a little small) and perfectly adequate Continental breakfast. Hotel situated right in the heart of Melbourne. If we are ever in a position to revisit, this hotel would certainly be considered.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433068648~“Can't get any closer to the CBD”~I'm usually a fan of 5 star hotels but when I stay in Melbourne, I go to the Causeway Inn on the Mall. It is a stones throw from Bourke Street Mall, walking distance to major attractions and shops and trams are close by. Rooms were comfortable and clean enough, but a little claustrophobic if anything. Staff were friendly and helpful. See you next time on my travels to Melbourne.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
