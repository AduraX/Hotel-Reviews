review_478378776~“Great for short visit, has some shortcomings”~Have spent close to 3 months at this property and the sister Oaks on Collins St in recent years (for business), so thought it was time to write my own review. I always get the cheapest room option and find the rooms nice and pleasant. Oaks Market gives you a huge bathroom which is literally three times the size of the bathrooms at Oaks on Collins, where the bathrooms are shower width. This is a key difference between the two properties.  I found the staff helpful and polite at both properties.  Oaks on Collins provide in-room safes, whereas Market St does not. I think this is significant omission at Market St. In terms of view, perhaps 50% (probably more) of the rooms at both properties face an alleyway or a another building so you're less likely to get anything nice. At Oaks Collin St, the rooms facing Collins St sometimes have a nice view, however the rooms at the back of the property have balconies. So if fresh air is important, you can request a room at the back. Certain rooms at Collins St do not have any external windows at all and instead get their light from an internal (corridor facing) window. These room seem to be a bit bigger, so I didn't mind.  Market St is a slightly larger property and also has a pool which I estimate to be between 15m to 20m in length. However, while I was there the heating broke down and it was not fixed for over a week. Perhaps this is not considered a priority in Autumn. The "pool" at Collins St is very small and not suitable for doing laps or anything other than sitting in the water.  The pool, gym and laundry at Market St are all located in the basement. Only one lift travels directly to the basement and usually the faster way is to transfer at ground floor. From ground, there are about 8 flights of stairs to the laundry/gym/ pool. If you wait for the lift, it is about 2 flights of stairs. Either way, it is a surprisingly convoluted system.  The Collins St layout, which has a laundry on each level, is far more convenient. Lift access is good at Collins St, whereas at Market St the lifts are often slow. In theory, Market St has 5 lifts for 20+ floors, but one of these is reserved for residents and it is common for others to be reserved for staff. So, service can be slow at peak times, especially when a bunch of people check in at once. Housekeeping will always keep you on your toes. Some recent experiences include forgetting to take out the trash (they cleaned the rest of the room!), leaving their cleaning stuff behind and forgetting to plug the TV in. Once, the remote had some kind of sticky substance on it from the previous occupant.  Overall, I think it just depends on who you get servicing your room and they're nice if you ask them for help.  The appliances are unpredictable. For example, the TV remotes almost never function as expected and you have to learn little tricks like using "channel up/down" instead of pressing the desired number. Channel 9 Gem mysteriously disappeared on my most recent visit. Market St has this interesting air con which displays the current temperature, not the preset temp, so you spend a lot of time pressing buttons until you figure this out. Apparently they get a lot of enquiries about this (and the TVs) at reception. I'm guessing there's not much that can be done until the whole system is due to be updated. Anyway, my conclusion is that it is very enjoyable for a short trip, but if you're here for a long time you do start to notice the little stuff. I would recommend both properties to prospective visitors.~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_478373464~“Great location ”~Stayed 6 nights and enjoyed the whole time. Top floor studio room with view over city, newly renovated. Kitchenette had small fridge, kettle, toaster and two electric hobs. Didn't bother cooking as meals downstairs at Oak and Vine were delicious. Happy hour and evening meal specials and hot buffet breakfast in the mornings. Gluten-free diet catered for very well. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Leigh helped us with directions around Melbourne, and carried our bags out on departure. All staff were polite, friendly and smiling. They obviously enjoy their work. Great place. Will return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478209397~“Disappointed in our room”~We had a family stay for 3 nights and firstly I must say the beds were clean and comfortable and breakfast was nice in the restaurant.  That being said there were quite few annoying things that contributed to the average rating.  Initially when we walked in there was a large cleaning product/water patch on the lounge room floor. I approached reception about this and was offered a towel to clean it up. Half an hour after we arrived our toilet blocked up but was attended to whilst we were out for dinner. The room was very tired, with mould in the shower and marks on walls. Our apartment had glass panelled doors into both bedrooms which made it impossible with 3 kids for anyone to go to sleep or have any privacy. The kitchen was poorly stocked with only 1 coffee cup and 2 glasses in the apartment.  No extra blankets were available and kids were cold at times along with it being difficult to sleep with fire detectors (??) flashing on each bedroom ceiling all night.  I feel these are things I may have mentioned on checkout but I was not asked how our stay was or given any verbal opportunity for feedback, although staff were always friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately I would not stay in this property again with my family.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477609647~“Splendid view, Decent Amenities, At the heart of Melbourne”~I stayed twice at this hotel. Primarily for the view and the excellent location. Price: 180-250 AUD Location: Superb. Walking distance to river Yarra and to Collins street. (Right next to tram stop - William Street 3). Well connected to all tourist attractions, shopping and eateries, and main train stations ( Southern cross and Flinders) Room: Both studio and one bedroom has kitchenette and they are decently spacious for a couple. Service: Daily housekeeping, which included cleaning of vessels. Food: Not many options within the hotel but plenty nearby. Breakfast is typical standard buffet one. Note: Don't miss the daily evening crown casino fireworks which is visible from the room facing river. Follow @chirpchirpfly on Instagram for interesting travel experiences.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~3~nan

review_477279953~“One of the worst hotel experiences ”~We stayed over eater and was so disappointed with this property. Beside how impersonal it felt to be a guest, constantly ignored or avoided by front desk staff, housekeeping was poor and ridiculous cost saving provided poor value for money.  We arrived 2am Friday morning. We went out for the day and returned to find our room had not been services. When we called reception we were told there'd be no housekeeping on Good Friday or Easter Sunday as house guests had previously indicated they didn't want rooms cleaned on these days. They told us we had to tell reception by midday the day before if we wanted servicing. I pointed out that we checked in after midday ( usual check in is 2pm anyways) and they said there was no service available. In all my Years working and using hotels, I've never heard such a poor excuse for cost savings! Further issues - stained sheets - badly made bed - old flat pillows(2 only) - filthy filthy windows  - Fridge seal broken and wouldn't close - the worst shower/bath mould I've ever seen - rubbish bags in bins not fitting bins - dusty on ledges - dust balls hanging from bathroom air vents - broken shower head ( water sprayed on ceiling when turned on) On Saturday, housekeeping knocked on door for service. I asked if they could come back in 10 minutes. They said no as it was their last room to service for the day. I asked them If they could wait 5 minutes as my partner was on the toilet ( I felt I had to justify myself and really didn't want to tell them where my partner was!) We left the room about 3-4 minutes later to catch the housekeepers in the elevator leaving the floor. I had to ask them to go back to our room and service it. They weren't happy!! On the last day we stored our bags and received a ticket number. When we picked up our bags, the receptionist told us to go into the room (full of bags) and find our own bags without supervision. He didn't t even bother to take our tickets so we could have walked in off the street and stolen people's bags without any proof we were a house guest - appalling security.  Most hotels I've stayed in Australia, credit card security is usually a $1 process transaction that's not charged to account and adjusted if here's a missed charge. This hotel charged $75 and processed it to the account and then I have to wait up To 5 working days for a credit - poor form!!!! OAKS HOTELS understand this-a hotel stay should make a guest feel at home and not an inconvenience. It must be well maintained and pleasant experience.  Im sorry but i was really happy to check out to go home. Your hotel didnt make us feel welcome, valued or comfortable. It was certainly Not value for money and failed to meet our expectations. I rarely use trip advisor for bad experiences, only positive, preferring to contact the property directly. I sent feedback to the hotel but failed to receive a response so don't bother using their feedback option.  As the hotel industry is competitive, this is the first and last stay at an Oaks property or related brands.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476600957~“vvery good overall”~best location, clean, good breakfast, friendly and helpful staff! stayed during the Easter break with bub. convenient location to all major attractions of Melbourne CBD. Breakfast spread was good and rooms were clean. Excellent customer service by all staff.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_476572765~“Pleasant Stay in the Heart of Melbourne”~Pros: Fairly large room has a mini kitchen with two burners, a fridge and a microwave; very large bathroom (although it feels over large); ironing board and iron in closet; good food at the hotel restaurant with cheap daily specials; very reasonable rates (booked through hotels.com); there are power outlets within easy reach of the bed. Cons: Internet is not free or cheap (there is a 30 minute option, but it can only be used once per day) - cost is AU $10 for 2 hours or AU $18 for 24 hours; adjusting the water in the shower is a hassle - it might sound overly nitpicky, but it seriously took almost 5 minutes for the hot water to actually get hot, and you have to keep turning the cold water until it finally kicks in... and then the water will turn icy. Things to note: Breakfast is not always included, but is worth getting when you book - the breakfast was delicious, but not exactly cheap at AU $25 per person - but it can be included with the cost of the room, depending on the package deal you pick, so be sure to look for it; don't bother with happy hour if you want a cocktail - my travel partner and I each ordered a gin and tonic and it seemed like it was more of a gin-flavored tonic!~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476299450~“A couple of things let it down”~I actually didn't mind Oaks on Market but am giving it three stars for the following reasons: We booked through Wotif and were given a disability room. That's okay if you have a disability but we do not. The disability bathroom shower doesn't have a shower bottom, basically its a shower head on the wall and when you shower the water filled up the entire bathroom floor which then meant if you needed to go to the toilet or brush your teeth you were waddling through a very wet bathroom floor (not to mention dangerous if you slip!). One of the other reasons we chose Oaks on Market was for the fact it was an apartment with cooking facilities. On the first night as we have a young family and don't want to be out dining all the time, I went to cook dinner on the stove and there was not one fry pan or saucepan in the apartment. When my husband rang up, an employee brought up one fry pan and that was it! A saucepan to cook some pasta would have been handy! Apart from the negatives, the hotel is in a good and quiet location, the indoor spa and pool was very handy practically when we ended up with bad weather. The room was spacious, the front end staff were friendly, the happy hour in the bar was great. Just a shame about the items that mattered to us!~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_476269875~“All things included a great place to stay.”~Great central spot. Staff were generally good with a stand whew that were amazing. Both Jodie and David at the front desk greated and farwelled us with a very happy and professional manner. Courtney in the bar was also a delight to deal with. Her personal conversation and great hospitality service kept us coming back for more and I think it was only her second week. Great work Courtney.~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan
review_476236541~“Terrible”~We stayed at this hotel recently and the rooms are terrible. Old tired and dirty. The bathroom was so bad with mould I complained to the reception who were fairly disinterested saying they were due for a revamp of the hotel rooms. They told me they didn't have any other rooms available but then miraculously found another which I went and had a look to check what it was like... same dirty inground mouldy bathroom even though it was a 1 bed as opposed to a studio. I didn't bother moving rooms for the same filth. We paid $250 night for the pleasure and they gave us a cheese platter thinking that would suffice. The location is great but I would never stay here again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475783028~“Decent stay”~Great location, spacious and fully equipped room but odd shaped custom shower stall. It should be fine for a night or two but would have been a problem for longer stay. Another funny thing was i actually had to pay to use the wifi, 30 mins free then $10 for 2.5hrs or $20 for 24 hrs, pretty surprising in this digital age. Nevertheless, the staff were super duper nice, especially the restaurant staff, very accommodating and attentive.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475690578~“Usually a good hotel but this time I was dissapointed”~I have been to this hotel before with the family and had a great time but this time I booked through Wotif and when I checked in my booking was not available. It took them over half an hour to book us in to a spare room, which made us late for our evening show booking. Then the next day we went to have a swim in the heated pool, which is one of the only reasons we pick this hotel and the heating has failed. It was 23 Deg and even I could not stay in. I went and spoke to reception and they said the only thing they could do is let us use a pool in another hotel. Not really good enough when I am paying for this facility.  Warning to people booking in the next few days, check that the pool is fixed.  We won't be back ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475660468~“great location”~Awesome place to stay, in a great location. Short walk over the bridge to Crown complex and the South bank. Tram stop right there, Collins on one side and Flinders Lane on the other, and if you need to unwind after a hard day eating and shopping Oak and Vine their bar area is great and Courtney (one of the bar staff, who by the way was relatively new to Oaks) is AMAZING, she's a star, Courtney is the friendliest, most on-to-it wee gem in the bar!! If it wasn't for Courtney we would have spent our time (and money) elsewhere. Thanks Courtney. Another Star is David at the hotel reception - very very helpful, nothing was a problem and he was always cheery - love that!! Over all awesome stay and thanks to those two stars, Courtney and David we are looking forward to coming back again~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475126882~“Great location and no surprises”~Those who follow our reviews will know we like it rough, we like it smooth we travel both ways. This year has been exhausting - renovating, working full time, caring for mum....we had 2 days free, Ruby wax was in town doing her Melbourne show - after our last stay in Melbourne at a random "4 star" hotel (mould, rotten boards, noisy) we needed 100% guarentee that we would be at least as comfortable at the hotel for a night on the town as we would be at home in NSW - hence we went with OAKs on market. As soon as we got to the counter the friendly and helpful staff take their time with you and engage you till your feeling like your home. The foyer was as you would require and expect and within minutes we were on our way up to the studio. A cosy secure room, sound proof, kettle teas, kitchenette and the bonus of the bath which we made use of - we are short and we both fit it- yummy! The GOOD - a brand that delivers and gives you what you expect, in this case cookie cutter model is good -location -staff -tea, milk, fridge THE BAD  - it was cold and the blanket was like a mini CPT blankey- air con wasn't adjustable, no sink plug for the bath(although they brought it straight up when we called) The UGLY Air con vent over the shower meant the air con was sucking through all the steam and water drops before our eyes into the air con vents - scarey recipe for a bacterial death sentence - we reported it and hopefully will be addressed asap - would check that's been addressed before we stay there again.... Air con vents over showers don't work anywhere ... Would have been a four star review if not for that and the mini blanky which left us giggling all night and forgetting how ungenerous it actually was. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474389046~“Good location”~We stayed in this hotel for about five weeks when we relocated from the UK to Melbourne. The hotel was organised by my husbands employer for us.  Pros: Staff are great. Several members of the reception team were great and very helpful. I believe one of the men's names was Pradip - he was brilliant.  Pool - lovely and clean, usually pretty quiet. Sauna and jacuzzi good too.  Gym - good equipment, good size and good aircon!  Location - really good, just off Collins street and a short walk from lots of great bars and restaurants.  Beds - comfy and clean, sheets made every day.  Food - we had a couple meals in the bar and food was good value.  View - we had a great view over the river.  Cons Towels -Often we had to wait till late in the evening for fresh towels, a few times we didn't get any at all. We had to bring hen to the pool as well as its towel area was frequently empty.  Cleaning - sometimes the cleaning wasn't very good. I phoned reception to ask if the room be hoovered the next day as we had broken a glass and it was about three days before it was hoovered.  Wifi We had to move rooms as the first one had absolutely no wifi unless u stood right at the window. The second room had great wifi!  Suggestions  Water - it might be nice to provide bottles of water in the room.  Condition  Our first room was quite shabby with rips in the couch but the second was better. Definitely in need of a freshen up. Ripped curtains, broken curtain rails, damaged plug sockets etc.  Kitchen Good size kitchen with lots of storage. But barely any cutlery provided. Had to ask for forks and extra pans etc to be able to cook. Plenty of crockery though.  Doors A couple times we came back to find our door hadn't been shut properly and could just be pushed open.  In conclusion. A great hotel if you are on holiday - good location and good rooms. Few problems with the rooms only really got to us as we spent five weeks there and needed to cook as couldn't afford to just eat out all the time. Staff are all amazing so it's not their fault - seems just a lack of investment in maintenance and upgrades.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473425838~“I LOVED THIS PLACE”~FROM CHECK IN TO CHECK OUT, The service i received from the reception,front desk agents was subperb. There were 2 agents that really man a difference in my stay in 2 week vacation in Australia.LEIGH AND ANTHONY stood out. LEIGH is a extremely friendly,happy professional that made each day for me feel welcome and was there to provide the service I needed at every given time..I was impressed with his infectious smile...when he smiled at you..you have to smile back..which make you feel happy and welcomed. Anthony was special because he was able to help me with issues I was having with my credit card..the strip was not working properly,and I was worried about being able to used the card..so he manually entered my info and it went through..something that was giving me trouble at my other hotels stays in the country. So because that simple jester..all my worry went away and I was able to relax. Through out my stay when ever i seen both men..they were very professional and considerate. I want to mention the day shift supervisor also..he was very informative about the area and the tours I inquired about. I also liked the hostess in the restaurant for breakfast was very nice and friendly. I stayed at 3 different hotel in the country.,OAK ON MARKET made the difference in my stays in a good way. My room was nice, big,clean with a view of the Melbourne skyline, overall my stay was very nice and comfortable. I RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET,THIS IS THE PLACE TO STAY IN MELBOURNE.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_473293352~“Good Downtown location”~This hotel is well located for a stay in the heart of Melbourne with friendly staff at reception. The street access can be a little difficult as the kerbside drop off area is often full or even double parked. Our King studio room (804) was spacious with a good sized kitchenette which meant we could organise our own meals if we wanted. The bathroom was enormous but we puzzled over why such a big space had such a small vanity. It was also in need of a deep clean, there were some nasty stains on the wall by the toilet. Yuck! The king bed was very firm and on arrival we had to request extra pillows as the room only had 2. We ate in the bar and the restaurant during our stay, the service staff were friendly and the food was plentiful. The evening special was good value, a main meal and a drink for $18.00. There are plenty of dining options within easy walking distance and the trams are nearby. Our biggest gripe was the ridiculous internet access. Half an hour free each day and then very expensive. Why not build the fee into the room rate and be done with it, in this day and age internet access is no longer an extra, but a necessity.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_472243697~“Horrible from start to end”~This place was horrible from start to end. 1. On arrival, 3 receptionists looked up at us, said nothing and continued talking. We walked up to the counter and they looked amongst themselves as if they were deciding who had the poor job of checking us in.  2. We asked for 3 room keys as there were 3 of us, but they said that they couldn't do that. 3. Our toilet didn't flush! 4. Room service was avaliable for "limited hours". However no staff could inform us of when those hours were. 5. Water was leaking down through our roof on the last day of our stay.  6. Restaurant was never open. We had to eat in the bar with about 4 choices of food.  The service was terrible and the facilities not much better. Only good thing was the location.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471008175~“Nothing special -Expensive average and dirty.”~Expensive average and dirty sums it up. The only thing good is the location right in the centre of Melbourne. Whist the room (1213) i stayed was a decent size with sofa, workdesk small kichenette. It was in desperate need of a makeover. Bathroom was decent size but poor layout, old fittings and very poor lighting. Shower was in the bath although a seperate one could easily be fitted in and dark blue tiles added to the gloom. Four vertical taps was new and very confusing to work out hot cold shower bath in the dark. A broken wordrobe shelf had been left as it was and the kichen facilities dirty and lacking. There was a flat screen TV although small cheap version badly located for watching from the sofa. The Bed was average and nothing to talk about. I sampled the breakfast which didnt fail to dissapoint. Firstly it took a long time to find cutlery and plates that were actually clean with LOTS of food residue left on many of them. No excuses please they should never be put out like that. Whilst the food spread was good much of the food appeared dried up, overcooked or burned and the baked beans appeared a mix of left overs of every type of bean from the past week. The cup of tea I made tasted good. This was a business trip and I would certainly be disappointed if i had payed for this.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470985299~“Great location - clean & tidy”~We booked a last minute deal and it was everything we hoped for. I see various reviews but I couldn't fault our room. It had everything we needed - small kitchenette, huge bathroom and was immaculately tidy & clean.  We used the pool facilities which were clean & tidy and a treat after walking around all day. Minutes from anywhere and bonus parking down the road for $10 p day when staying here. Would definitely stay again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469983878~“Nice stay at Oaks on Market ”~Our stay at this hotel didn't start too good as my partner and I arrived this hotel to a room on a lower floor directly opposite a construction site. Despite our phone call a month earlier not to have a room with this noise going on ... we still were given a room opposite. Not realising these rooms are cheaper so we requested to be moved and we were upgraded the next morning to a great room with a nice view and away from noise. Apart from this we found the hotel great the breakfast downstairs was fantastic as was the meal during happy hour next door. It's a great location central to everything and staff are very friendly.We will be staying here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469043881~“Better than expected.”~Booked accommodation as a package deal. One option was Oaks On Market. We had stayed at previous Oaks in Melbourne and in NZ and this is one of the better ones. I would have to say that i am surprised by some of the reviews on Trip Advisor for this hotel as we did not come up against many negative issues at all and when there was something amiss they actioned immediately that i will mention below. Arrived at hotel early evening - check-in was busy however they kept up the same professional service with each client whilst i was in line. Easy process and some basic necessities explained before we went to our room. Stayed in a One Bedroom apartment in 814 - got out of the lifts and the room was right there - your first impression is oh damn, right by the lifts, however when you are in the room it is very spacious but then you realise that you are behind all the lifts. The noise barriers in the walls must be very good as we did not notice the lifts at all in our room over the 5 nights. Views were ok but hey we werent there to stare out a window all day. Had a couple of small issues with a TV remote and needed some extra pillows, the response was both queries were remedied in a maximum of 15 mins. Impressed. Service team were informative when queried for directions, Taxi bookings etc. Overall a very good hotel, great location, rooms are good, service very professional.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The good: * Clean room and bath. * Kitchenette is well stocked with all the necessary utensils, etc. * Location - turn the corner and you're on Collins Street, short walk from Southbank, and a few tram stops to Flinders St Station. * Tram stop about 2 minutes walk away The bad: * Not much to speak of, but the 10am check out time is a bit early for me, considering I have a 7pm flight. * No free wi-fi, but free wi-fi isn't something I expect as a standard in Australia. (Its free for a short period only, payable after the free period is over) Overall: * Good business option in CBD, well located and clean.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_468245815~“Disappointed ”~While there is plenty to do in Melbourne, the hotel lacked the basics. The room was not cleaned properly, housekeeping was poor,the tv was unable to pick up free to air tv and to access wifi was $18 a day. Even the bus to the airport had free wifi. Doubt I'll be returning to Oaks.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468097480~“Fabulous!! Amazing view!!”~My partner and I stayed for a couple of nights in March. Really nice large apartment with comfy bed and million dollar views over the Yarra river! Great location, 5 minute walk to crown casino and south bank. Trams and trains very close. Very helpful staff. Great value!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467671144~“well situated for all of CBD requirements”~Stayed 3 nights in a twin room and thought it good for all types of travellers, good size and good amenities for self catering to an extent. Beds were ok. Staff at front desk are helpful, considerate and cheerful which is good to be met with after a long day. Position within CBD is handy, walking distance to major shopping, sight seeing and free circle tram. Bistro specials each night and happy hour drinks mean you don't have to cook for yourself if you don't wish to. Parmie night was great, steak night not so great. WIFI worked but had to keep reconnecting, air conditioning was average, at lowest possible setting the temps were still mid 20's.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan
review_467466204~“disappointing stay”~Checked in on the 10th of March for a little get away with my daughter before attending a concert. I booked a room with floor to ceiling windows, when i got to the room it was like a shoe box! Tiny windows, not what I booked at all! The lady at the front desk was not very helpful at all. She then moved me to another room that was even worse! Shower floor looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks, black hairs everywhere. Bed was uncomfortable (two singles pushed together with a lump down the middle where they stick them together) and the mattress was filthy. Very disappointing stay. No offer from any of the staff to help move the luggage considering it was just myself and young daughter.~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_467078421~“Shameful ”~With a busy Melbourne, I was offered this hotel at short notice as other usual properties for my organisation, a charity, were full.  What a shameful mess this place is. Bland staff performing their basic functions, large rooms full of cheap poor quality furniture, numerous service issues like a broken towel rail, torn carpet, air cond that would not cool below 22 degrees and curtains that didn't fit the window so the room was bright all night. The kitchen was super basic, poorly equipped etc. the bathroom was enormous with a tiny shower tucked into one corner. A good example of building and furnishing down to a price.  Whinging - maybe, but at $411.99 per night you can do a lot better in Melbourne.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466450151~“GO ELSEWHERE”~I stayed for two nights last week. The rooms look like they've been furnished by some cheap furniture shop with the decor poor. Maintenance of the apartment was an issue. The towel rail fell off - repeatedly and had clearly been broken previously with a tissue used to jam it back in. Hot water took forever to come through the shower head and the air conditioning was useless. The room did not get below about 25-27 despite the controller saying a lower temp. The lifts were quite slow - and very warm (hot). There was also a tear in the carpet which was a trip hazard. The curtains dropped from ceiling to floor, but there was a foot wide ledge which made them ill fitting and next to useless. On the upside, the bed was comfortable and the location excellent. I'll find another location in the future.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466167114~“Larger Rooms on upgrade, air con fail...”~Staff were helpful on check in with parking advice and upgrading rooms. Rooms are large and spacious from what I could see.The only issue was a faulty air con unit in a very large suite. When I queried the unit i was told i would be downgraded to a studio. A little disappointing at first. I had to press the desk to come to the room and witness the air con stuck on 26 degrees. Hardly comfortable sleeping conditions. On inspection the desk clerk could see the issue and promptly moved me to a more suitable room. Nice work. Breakfast is quite reasonable with a chef on board for poached eggs or omelettes. Nice touch. Trams were noisy early ni the morning. But bearable, Would return here.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_466127433~“Weekend away in Melbourne”~The hotel is nice, clean and modern. The location is amazing and close to everything. We got the 15th floor and we looked across to Southbank. Staff are friendly. We had a well equipped kitchenette. An extra pillow would have made the stay more comfy. Overall highly recommend it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465982853~“Amazing customer Service, nothing can beat this !”~I stayed at Oaks on market for 3 weeks. They have all the amenities that a hotel should have. The restaurant and bar is amazing, the breakfast chef Paulo was very helpful. But what stands out is their front desk folks, I cant thank enough, Jodie, David, Monica among others who were not only just pleasant, but always available and eager to help. I had to move my rooms, and they gave me another room with even better view and made sure everything was working. Monica went above and beyond to accommodate my early checkout and make sure I had no issues while leaving. I travel a lot and had never encountered so much of hospitality and care by the staff. Enjoyed my stay totally !~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_465938093~“Query”~Hi. I know this is not the right place for a query, but here goes. i will be in Melbourne for two weeks and I will be staying here. I am wondering if the rooms come with complimentary breakfasts? Also, how do I get from the airport to the hotel? Thanks!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465693855~“nice but disappointed in service”~I was in Melbourne on a business trip to have a look at accommodation for our company. The property is nice and specious, however i requested for a wake-up call at 08:30AM as i had a flight that morning but received a call at 09:58AM which in turn has left me with a missed flight to an important meeting. Highly disappointed with how the situation was handled and will not be staying here again~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~2~nan
review_464665524~“Wow and Wow”~Love this place. The staff are great and have a fantastic sense of humour and nothing is too much trouble for them. The rooms are clean and lovely. The bar has great beverage choice and the meals in the restaurant are great value and great tasting.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_464660354~“Hope you like Doof Doof”~This is a really great location to explore Melbourne from. Unfortunately the central location mean you are also exposed to the night life until 4 am with the rooms not sufficiently insulated from the driving beats of the nearby nightclub. Rooms are comfortable without being luxurious and a late check out is available - you'll need that if your aren't at the night club!  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464478242~“1 Bed Apartment, 3 nights, Feb 2017”~Let me count the ways I disliked thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach. Or something. Choosing to stay here is possibly my biggest mistake in accommodation in Australia. It was thoroughly frustrating. It goes against some of the reviews here so perhaps I just had a bad experience - individual elements perhaps weren’t so bad, but you join them all up and I really totally regret choosing to stay here. I had a 1 bedroom apartment on the 20th floor, and I stayed for three nights in February 2017. Room was fairly large, and with a decent bathroom. It was aged however, it really does need a bit of modernising. Sofa had a hole in it, and the rest of the furniture too looked like it had seen better days. What were my specific problems…? Well…let’s see: Lifts If you’re staying on a higher floor be prepared to spend half your trip trying to either get to the lobby from your room, or get to your room from the lobby. The lifts were utterly horrific. To give you an idea, I booked an uber, and it said it was 12-13 minutes away. I was already waiting for the lift when I booked the uber, and the car had arrived before I’d made it to the lobby. Think about that - over 10 minutes waiting for a lift. Infuriating. Talking to reception they informed me that ‘one of the lifts had recently failed and they were hoping to get it working soon’. Funnily enough, this was completely contradicted by the cleaning staff who told me the lifts had been out of action ‘for months’. Ridiculously annoying. Air Conditioning When I first checked in to the apartment, the temperature of the room was about 26-27 degrees. Fair enough, turn on the aircon you think, given there’s a control panel and the room is designated as having air-con. It didn’t work. Coolest it would go was 25 degrees - which of course was only achieved when it was 25 degrees outside. It was to Air-Conditioning what President Bush was to Mensa.  What’s worse is that on informing reception they sent someone up who told me that this was correct, the air-con was working, and that 25 degrees was about right as it was a ‘central system’. Right-o. After talking to someone else and escalating it, they wheeled in a small unit that proceeded to make a lot of noise, and still the room was at 25 degrees. At this point, I gave up and just started looking forward to my next hotel in Sydney. What else? Half the TV channels weren’t watchable, it was like the signal wasn’t strong enough and it would constantly freeze like it had lost synchronisation. Unit was supposed to be an apartment and yet was barely furbished as such - no dish washer/washing machine, or basic supplies to actually enable you to use the stuff. Like detergent etc. Perhaps that’s asking for a lot, but it’s what I’m used to in other similar apartment offerings (in one right now in fact, in Sydney). Internet was expensive, and didn’t really work up on the 20th. Still had to pay for it though. On check out I got the usual ‘How was you stay Sir?’ - I answered honestly and said terrible. She wasn’t listening - wandered off to validate my parking while saying ‘Good!’ Or something, and with a look of someone who realises the morning is getting away from her. What about parking? Well, don’t make the mistake of doing the sensible, obvious thing such as parking in the parking garage attached to the hotel. It’s furiously expensive, and no deal with the hotel. Obviously what you should do is drive 2/300 meters up the road, and park in a more secluded and tucked away car park that looks like it’s in no way associated with the hotel. Hated staying here, it was horrific, will not be returning.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~2~nan
