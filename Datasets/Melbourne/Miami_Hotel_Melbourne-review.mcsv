review_478719658~“Good stay! ”~This hotel is a good stay! Wifi, beds and location are good. A nice bathroom and a shared kitchen if you want to dine in.  For us it was a great value for our money.  We loved our stay here.  George is really friendly!  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472263581~“A very adequate hotel, in an old area, with CBD close by”~Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Very clean hotel and very clean room. Room was serviced well bystaff. Shower was wonderful. Great coffee at cafe. Stayed here due to great reviews. Hate that we had some negative experiences. First impressions were of a drab room. Colourful bedspreads, shown in ad, were missing...blankets grey and carpet dark. Lack of lift proved a problem for my unfit partner when taking his lugguage up stairs. Neighbours' door continually closing...their kids running noisily up and down corridor...this was at about 10:30pm. We contacted hotel staff and they remedied this situation. We had the same problem the following evening and happily contacted staff at reception so problem could be rectified early. Hotel is not to blame for inconsiderate guests. Kitchen is on the second floor and may be reason for constant comings and goings of our neighbours. Otherwise the hotel was quite.~3~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471206138~“Excellent budget hotel”~Stayed for a couple of days and found it an excellent budget hotel with a decent room and excellent en-suite. The reception staff were very helpful and even lent me a needle and thread to put a button back on. Some nice touches such as a shaving gel dispenser by the sink which was a great touch and a fridge hidden away so that the noise and heat didn't affect the bed-room.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_470449613~“Cheap and cheerful - great location”~Arriving late at night was daunting, as the local area was a bit dark and ominous but the welcome in the hotel was excellent. Secure parking at the rear was a must for us - very useful for driving the coast road or visiting family in the suburbs. Hotel room was quite small, but clean and well equipped for a budget room, especially given the space available! 10 mins walk to Victoria Market, walked into town a few times, local brunch place is awesome (lots of eateries in the area) and the free wifi was reliable. Would recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465955880~“Miami Hotel”~This was our first stop in Australia. Close to CBD and transit, lots of restaurants and cafes close by. Also close to Queen Victoria Market. Staff was pleasant and helpful. We extended our stay and they accommodated us so that we wouldn't have to change rooms. The room had air conditioning and a fridge, as well as a TV and free wifi. Only minor complaint is the bathroom door didn't close completely. There is no elevator but this wasn't an issue for us. Overall great place to stay on a budget.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463932775~“Great hotel - loud on the weekend ”~We stopped here as a base for our few days in Melbourne, couldn't have been happier with the room and service on the first night, we found checkin, and booking trips easy with the friendly receptionists and being able to leave our bags in storage before checkin was an added bonus.  On the final night (Friday) there was a pub/party in the ally behind the hotel which went on till the very early hours of the morning. When we asked to move we were told it is a Friday night, this dampened our spirits on the hotel but we would stop again in the week!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463890873~“Good budget location close to CBD”~We stayed here in a twin room for a week, room was very comfortable with spacious bathroom and kettle/fridge area. Heating is controlled centrally from reception and we had no problems with this. Friendly reception staff who helped with maps, directions and trips etc. Good location, just outside the free tram zone and close to IGA supermarket and restaurants.  Kitchen was an asset, well stocked and functional.  Wifi just needs a new code from reception each day and works reliably.  Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463431838~“Great accommodation”~My daughter and I stayed at the Miami Hotel for three nights. The rooms we had were small but comfortable and extremely clean. The staff were all amazing and very helpful. We would definitely stay there again. Budget accommodation at it's best. There is a small but pleasant cafe attached to the hotel, the only down side to this though is it closes early at 11.30am~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_462597392~“Nice little hotel with great service”~My wife and I recently stayed here and were quite impressed with the level of service. We arrived at 11am after a very early morning flight from NZ. We were greeted by the friendly front desk person. We told her we were checking in and knew it was very early, but hoped to at least drop our bags off. She said that would be no problem and said she would try to get our room ready ASAP. She directed us to their cafe, which was closing soon, for a quick bite to eat while we waited. They stayed open an extra minute or two to make sure we could get some food. By the time we were done eating, our rooms was ready! The room itself was a little small, but clean and in good condition. More than adequate for us. That night, my wife got very sick (we think she got a stomach bug from someone on the plane). I called down to reception and requested a late check out, so my wife could rest a little longer. They said that this would be no problem. I went to pickup our rental car, while my wife napped. When I returned, both the front desk woman and the hotel manager were waiting for me. One of the maids had entered our room mistakenly and found my wife not looking well. She reported this to the front desk, who were very concerned about her health. They told us to take our time getting out of the room and even brought her some green tea to drink. The manager told me of a nearby doctor and where the hospital was. They let us park the car right in front, so I could get my wife and bags in before taking her to see a doctor. They were very courteous, and professional throughout this whole ordeal. They went above and beyond to make sure we had as good a stay as possible. My wife is fine now, after getting checked out at the hospital and we would absolutely stay here again. Thank you Miami Hotel!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_462584408~“Fit for purpose!”~My wife and I visited Melbourne as tourists and stayed at Miami. The hotel is located just outside the CBD but Melbourne's world class transport system connects Miami very conveniently to all the major locations - very crucial for a tourist! The hotel is nicely maintained and have all the basics in right place. They have a kitchen and laundary that can be used if required. There is a small cafe at the ground floor but the hotel doesn't serve breakfast/ meals by itself. The rooms do feel a bit cramped and one would have to go up the staircase to access the rooms. These are the only slight downsides that I could see. The bathrooms on the other hand are spacious and are about 60% of the size of the bedroom!  The staff is extremely friendly, so much so that you can't help but form a strong positive opinion about people in Melbourne in general! Would definitely recommend staying here if you one is looking for a fit for purpose accommodation.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_462573831~“Close to transport & main street”~Hotel was clean, staff were friendly. Close to tram, train and Errol St. with cafe's, restaurants, supermarkets close by. Private room and bed were very clean and comfortable but there was no view accept for a tiny courtyard that was a little ugly. But the price was good for the location & a private room.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456526609~“Very good”~Very friendly stuff. Clean room. Close to tram station and Queen Victory Market. 2 minute walk with many restaurants & cafes in street corner. Little Cafe on site for breakfast. There is no lift but not our concern.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_455791042~“Great place”~We booked a twin room. Very clean, comfortable and excellent location. Friendly staff. Keep doing what you are doing!

review_452830134~“Lovely place, staff very friendly ”~We had a Double Ensuite here. It was a lovely place with a nice little cafe on site which opened for breakfast. Room was clean and comfortable - a little small but that didn't bother us. Free Wifi was good. Location wise this has amenities around such as shops and restaurants but is about 30 minutes to the centre. Again this didn't bother us as we like to explore. St Kilda beach was lovely!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452582040~“Do not judge a book by it's cover”~Changed to stay here rather than alternative accommodation. All I will say is this place is a little gem.

review_451124397~“Highly recommendable”~Good hotel close to city centre with nothing negative to add. Fullfilled our every need and prob the friendliest and most helpfull staff we encountered on our roundtrip. Wifi was free (500 mb a day) and reliable~5~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450303539~“Pleasantly surprised”~We usually seek out budget accommodations when we travel so are used to some pretty sub-par hotels, but we were pleasantly surprised by the Miami Hotel. Our room was very clean and up-to-date. Our bed was very comfortable with good, quality sheets. The staff was courteous and helpful. The hotel is within a reasonable walking distance of downtown which was great and there are quite a few restaurants close by the hotel. Most tour companies also pick up from the Miami which is great if you plan on doing a number of day trips.  The only two down sides were that there was no elevator (lift) so carrying our suitcases to the 2nd floor was not ideal and the air conditioning was controlled by the front desk. It seemed that one of the nights we were there, the person working the night staff tampered with our room temperature and my entire family woke up drenched in sweat. When we went down to the front desk in the morning, the staff checked it and confirmed that someone had messed with it and it was set to be quite hot. Other than that, though, everything else was very good and I would definitely recommend it.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_450298425~“Location excellent, restaurants, public transport only steps away...”~On arrival staff welcoming ( could not do enough for you ) we came for the Lithuanian Festival... our Club house in Errol street was only 2 minute walk with many restaurants & cafes to choose from. Transport to the famous Markets only 2 tram stops away & another stop away from the City centre ( a ladies paradise for retail therapy ). The room was very small however very clean daily room serviced with fresh clean towels good bathroom with excellent shower - great water pressure. Beds ( 2 x single ) were firm & comfortable. Only draw back is NO LIFT ? so if elderly make sure you book on ground floor.... we stayed on the 2nd floor & changing several times a day became some what questionable. Overall the staff & location made up for the small room ( air con' controlled by reception - you need to ask & works excellent ) we had 36 -39 degrees daily so the COOL room was a welcome relief !!! .... Definitely would stay there again, many thanks to the staff over Xmas New Year stay.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_449740418~“Close, clean and calming”~Wonderful staff greeted us and made our stay in their well ventillated, clean, well located and, did I mention, clean hotel a breeze. Close to 57 tram straight to city centre and walking distance to restaurants of varying price on Errol Street. Also features skybus to airport option and walking distance to North Melbourne Train station. Will stay again in a heartbeat!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449656150~“Close to city and public transport.”~Very clean functional hotel, good sized (king) firm bed, large bathroom. Nice little area for tea and coffee making along with bar fridge. Very helpful courteous staff. And off street parking would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_447290239~“THE RIGHT CHOICE TO STAY OVER CHRISTMAS”~Nice sized twin room with Foxtel channels. No lift so hauling big bags can be challenging up the stairs. Good that there is a kitchen area to cook own meals, always useful when on the road. Can get a little noisy at times with younger families often choosing this motel to stay but to the credit of the staff this was pointed out upon check in (which was slower than normal thanks to a lack of cleaners on Christmas Day). Wi-Fi free although limited and a new code needed each day.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_447019757~“Helpful staffs and complete for holiday ”~We had a good time staying at that hotel. Local is perfect very close with trams and you can get easily everything that you want. Staffs are so sweet and helpful. Hotel rooms are very clean and Highly recommended to this hotel.  But the air conditioning system is not so good we have to call reception when we want to on or off~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445760888~“Great spot for short stay”~This is in such a convenient location, being only 20 mins walk from Elizabeth street where free trams are accessed from. The rooms are ideal for those who want to spend the day exploring the city rather than stay at the accommodation. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445126138~“Really good place to stay ”~Amazing staff and the room is basic but has a new bathroom and fridge to store food you can use in their communal kitchen. Also secure parking that has a gate you can only open with your room key. Highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444761129~“Excellent value small hotel”~I had the pleasure of staying at the Miami Hotel a few weeks ago,and found it perfect for my needs. A small ,budget hotel that doesn't pretend to be otherwise,but exceptionally well run with clean,comfortable well designed rooms complete with a fridge and lovely toiletries. The kitchen on the second floor is very handy for those wishing to self cater,and the cafe adjoining the hotel is perfect for breakfast or light morning snacks. The area is very convinent with the no 57 taking 10 minutes to the CBD ,and the wonderful Queen Victoria Market only 10 minutes walk away. Erroll St has a good selection of cafes and restaurants,all good value. I can recommend the fish and chip shop?Salt.. I will certainly stay at the Miami on my next visit to Melbourne.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442948686~“Inexpensive Option close to the CBD”~I stayed a few days there. The place fulfills its purpose. The rooms are clean and the staff is super helpful. Obviously you wouldn't pick this hotel for a romantic weekend, but it is a good budget place close enough to the center. You could walk and there is also a tram line close by. Everyone who works there was very nice. But I think it that is an Australian thing.  The only thing I thought was a bit disappointing is: The internet. You had to get a new password daily (ok. not a problem). But the upload speed was like it's 1998. Before I was in Australia I visited several 3rd world countries in South East Asia, where every cheap hotel had much better internet. It is somewhat annoying if you take pictures all day and then it takes an hour (not exaggerating) to upload them. I discovered that the internet modem (I think) was on the second floor. So then I stood under it and it worked better. I am not sure if that is a hotel internet problem or an Australian internet problem. I just think that in this day and age you should be able to upload your stuff to the internet in a hotel. Ok. other than that it was a great place and I think I mentioned it GREAT STAFF.~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_442291640~“Simple yet value for money”~Location is nice as it is walking distance to tram stop, Queen Victoria market and the cbd. Very basic hotel with basic room amenities. Room is quite small but serves its purpose. Only different thing about this hotel is that the a/c controls is on the front desk, so you have to call front desk to turn on/off and for adjustments (front desk is 24hrs anyway so no issue). Staff are very friendly and helpful. No frills hotet, simple but nice to stay in.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_442131794~“Nice stay”~Miami hotel is like no frill airlines.. which commit less but perform as per the commitment or sometime even beyond that. Staff is very courteous, rooms are neat & clean, location is a great advantage. Not too far from city.Easy availability of trams.Nearby restaurants specially Indian is superb.Restaurent coffee is awesome..highly recommend. Couple of disadvantages... one, Kitchen is at second floor, irritates a lot if you're staying at ground floor.. second, no lift for second floor..so if you're carrying luggage than request hotel to allot rooms in lower floor. Rest is fine~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_441200212~“Good hotel”~We stayed in this hotel for two nights in November. The hotel is located on a reasonably good location, it's not in the free tram zone (it's near stop 10, free tram zone ends at stop 8) but the neighbourhood is good and it's not far from the Queen Victoria Market. Personnel at the reception was friendly. The best thing was the room, we had booked a room for 2 people but there were beds for 4 people. The beds were comfortable, the room is spacious, there is a flatscreen tv and the shower was good. There is free wifi (500 mb per day) which worked good. The only negative thing in the room was that you can't turn the airconditioning on or off by yourself, you had to ask the reception. This should be improved. We had a great stay and we paid AUD 321 in total for two nights.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440505750~“great services and good facilities”~We thought that a hotel with that price might have some shortages but Miami actually surprised us. The room has everything we want（clean bathroom，hair dryer，warm water，big mirror，comfortable bed and everything housecleaning services）Except that，check-in was quick and friendly. I have spend a lot of time ask receptionist about restaurant and transport nearby，skybus booking and day-tour booking. Staff presented warm and welcoming. Great kitchen facilities，very clean. although it's a small room，we feel really comfortable and will definitely recommended it to friends and families.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440427141~“What a gem !!”~This hotel is great. The beds are comfortable - don't know about the pillows, I always have my own - and it was so clean. The reason I gave it a Very Good rating is because of the stairs and no lift. Otherwise it would be a 10. Will stay again. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Give it a try you will be pleasantly surprised.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_439399820~“A pleasant surprise”~I booked online a few hours before arriving at the Miami Hotel, despite mixed online reviews. The hotel is an easy 20 minute walk (1.5km) from Southern Cross Station, with no obvious public transport between the two locations. From the service at reception to my room, I was pleasantly surprised. My room (15) was obviously a room for wheelchair access and had plenty of space with a queen and single bed. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with toiletries. Windows opened to a small enclosed courtyard. There was no traffic noise reaching this room. Soft-closing doors meant no slamming doors from inconsiderate guests. A bonus is the shopping area on nearby Victoria Parade with a supermarkets, restaurants and take always covering a wide range of foods. Wi-fi comes free, with 250mb per guest. The CBD is nearby and the free tram zone is not far away. I left early the next morning so couldn't try breakfast at the adjoining cafe, which offered discount coffee for guests. I would certainly use this hotel again, for both overnight or longer stays.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434989397~“Excellent Hotel”~Before booking this hotel I searched trip advisor for the best guest review hotel under $100 in the area. I then contacted the hotel and booked directly with them (discount given for direct booking and free parking). Staff were very prompt replying with questions I had and check in helpful and friendly. The superior room booked is a good size and overall cleanliness excellent. I'm not sure how recently the rooms have refurbished but they are in great condition. Dined at a few nice restaurants around the corner on Errol and Victoria Streets and it's an easy walk to Victoria markets and CBD. I'll definitely be booking here again provided it stays value for money and looking forward to my next visit to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434677917~“Very good place”~We have stayed during three days at the hotel. The room (confortable and clean) and facilities (there are kitchen and laundry avaiable) are very good, the location is excelent as well, near the trams stop and near the Queen Victoria Marcket (around 10 minutes walking). The staff were very friendly and helpfull all the time. Recomended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433422982~“Clean budget hotel not far from city”~The room is rather small but cosy and comfortable. The bathroom is very clean and hair dryer, towels, shampoo and bodywash are provided. The common kitchen is big and well equipped with all kinds of cooking utensils. There is no elevator so the hotel might not be suitable for the elderly or travellers with heavy baggages. It is about 10min's walk to the free tram zone and the Queen Victoria market.  Take Starbus for direct shuttle between the hotel and the Melbourne airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

There is a tram stop close by, as well as an IGA and bakery, and 711.~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan

It does not claim to be, nor is it "the Ritz", but it was clean, easy to get to and from good beds and parking for $9.00. A great guests kitchen, all manner of eateries and bottle shops within 5 minutes walk and a 15 minute drive, at 6.30am on Saturday morning to the Tassie Ferry.

review_429839958~“Miami Hotel”~The staff were very friendly and accommodating, The rooms neat and tidy however it was disappointing that they don't have a lift. It's accessible to local shops where you can stock up if your staying more than 1 night. The rooms do not have a microwave or any crockery other than a couple of coffee cups and saucers. It was most inconvenient when in your night attire to have to go down to the big kitchen to access the microwave etc. I did enjoy the large shower.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_429523908~“Good for the price”~Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. Booked the hotel because of cheap rate. However I can't complain about the stay. There were some disturbances from the upstair room, but otherwise it was calm. Reasonable place with 24 hours front desk and free internet (250 MB per day per person). If your looking for a low price option this hotel is good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428639876~“Disappointing ”~We have had a great stay here in Melbourne. Very clean rooms, bathrooms. Nothing to complain about until we asked if we could book for the night of 22nd October. Receptionist was very accommodating and would check this morning. On arrival back from a day trip we checked out the availability. We were advised there was a room available, the Manager was asked what cost only to be advised it would be $199 for the night least double the normal price. I realise that the weekends can be dearer but $199 for one night. Needless to say we are not staying at Miami Hotel Melbourne. We have a room in a hotel close to the airport for $129. The mannerism of the Manger left a lot to be desired. The girls at reception had been so helpful and polite.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
