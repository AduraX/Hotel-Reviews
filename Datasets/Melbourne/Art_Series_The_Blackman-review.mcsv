review_478079434~“Easter break ”~Stayed here for one night in April and it was fantastic! The bed was so amazing, the views beautiful from our room and staff polite and friendly! It's a bit further from the st kilda foreshore but there's a tram stop nearby to get into the city. Thank you so much for the complimentary champagne for my partners birthday surprise too! The French cafe in the hotel serves delicious pastries and coffee , wish that was included in the room rate. Would highly recommend this modern hotel!! Fantastic~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477601216~“Great service, lovely hotel”~Upon check-in, the lovely staff gave our three year old a canvas and paint set - which he loved and couldn't wait to use. What a welcome! The room was lovely, the bed very comfy, and my son loved the little card inviting him to jump on the bed. It's the little touches that count! There's also a fantastic park across the road, perfect for an evening stroll. Thanks for a wonderful stay, we'll be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477598290~“Excellent hotel but..”~A little inaccessible from the main attractions. Room was smaller than expected. However, service was top-notch, and decoration was true to the art series hotels: tasteful. It was the best hotel bed that we've ever slept on!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_476019145~“Most amazing place to stay in Melbourne!”~I had to find a hotel quickly as my flight was canceled and was stuck here solo on Easter weekend. This place was PERFECT! Not only are the hotel and rooms EXCELLENT, each room comes with a kitchenette! I would call these an actual kitchen because it's a full size fridge and freezer, stove top, microwave, tea kettle, toaster, and pretty much everything you need to heat up food or make snacks. The decor was gorgeous, the view lovely and I was right across the street from the beautiful Fawken Park, where I spent Easter Sunday since everything in town was closed. The staff WAS EXCELLENT! So kind, sweet, went out of their way to help me book a facial and find a pharmacy that was open. The restaurants at the base of the property are lovely and deliver to the room if you want. I cannot say enough great things about this place. Also LOVE all the eco-friendly products - this place is truly amazing. I will stay here again next time I am In melbourne. It has a perfect mix of art, boutiquey feel, and home all wrapped up into a hotel. I LOVE THIS PLACE!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475988049~“AMAZING. Can't recommend highly enough”~Stayed here for 2 nights this weekend, and WOW. I am/was so impressed. This hotel is definitely deserving of its ranking, and probably even deserves a higher one. Everything was perfect. The beds are amazingly comfortable, and the rooms are incredibly well appointed. The bathrooms are also quite nice, but not the best I've used - but the shower was strong and hot, and the bathroom had everything that you needed.  Rooms were also very clean - and the housekeeping team did a spectacular job of cleaning the room, and keeping the hotel clean throughout. The hotel is super accessible - 10 minutes on the tram from Flinders Street station, or about the same in an uber.  The restaurants are good too. Both Fleur and Classico have excellent food, but I found the service at Fleur to be far superior to Classico.  Overall, an incredible hotel, and will not hesitate to recommend it to anyone that I know is coming to the city - not to mention the fact that I will be back myself.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_475694609~“Worth every bit”~The hotel is great. Rooms quiet and comfortable. Although its fine for now they will soon need to refurbish. The staff is great and acimodating and food also good. It's best to pay directly for breakfast as there are two restaurants and you can choose. Location is terrific trams and easy access to the city. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475467256~“Melbourne getaway ”~I love this hotel. My hisband and i go often for a quick local break from the kids. Near St Kilda road a quick tram ride to Southbank or the heart of the city. The artwork is amazing and the hotel quaint.  They often have great deals for priority members too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475250331~“Fantastic !!!”~I stayed here for 6 nights in April 2017 with my wife and two boys (aged 3 and 5). Overall, we had a great stay.  The staff were consistently friendly and professional, be it at the reception or at the restaurants or on the phone.  I stayed in a room with two twin beds. The room was done up artfully yet tastefully and was of a fairly decent size. The room came with a small kitchenette along with basic cutlery, crockery and appliances. Moreover, there was also a balcony in the room. The quality of the food at the restaurant was consistently good. Our package did not include breakfast. So we ordered breakfast a la carte everyday and it was pretty good. The location was quiet and we could find restaurants within perhaps a 15-20 minute walking distance. The central CBD area was a quick 10 minute taxi ride away.  However, there is construction taking place right next door and in case you happen to stay in your room late morning or afternoon, you would hear it. It did not bother us too much though. Overall, I would recommend this hotel~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_474840256~“Everything about the room was great”~Tidy room with all that we needed. Comfortable bed with crisp white linen; great and not too expensive mini bar. Good shampoo and conditioner products provided in the bathroom. Totally recommend The Blackman.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474784601~“Friendly, Helpful staff; Great Location”~After arriving very late at this hotel after a 17 hour flight from the UK it was such a relief to meet a helpful, patient and friendly person at reception who quickly checked us in, gave us the info we needed for the time of day and got us to our room nice and fast. The room was clean and comfortable with everything we needed for a 4 night stay in Melbourne. The next day the advice we got from front of house for getting into the city was great and they even ordered us taxis with no fuss whenever we asked. There were some works going on next door to the hotel but by now I imagine these are finished and really nothing to do with the hotel from what I could see. The restaurants attached to the hotel were nothing to write home about but there are plenty of good places to eat nearby. Perfect location within walking distance of so many sights in the city.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474536781~“Short but pleasant stay”~We stayed in this location as it was convenient to both Melbourne CBD and to the other locations we needed to access. We were greeted by a very pleasant reception. Our room was located on the 12th floor facing St Kilda Rd. It was a balcony room facing east which gave us a bright sunny outlook in the morning. There was some construction going on adjacent the hotel which was a bit noisy with the balcony door open. The room itself was not large but had a small kitchen with everything provided. Large king bed clean and tidy bathroom. Definitely come back here again.~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_474375195~“One night stay”~Always a pleasure to stay here.. Our second time here.. We love the bed.. wish we could afford one of our own..

review_474256684~“Fantastic service”~We showed up in the rain on a stormy afternoon after our wedding. The first thing that happened was a staff member ran out into the rain to grab our bag. The second thing was they realised we were in wedding clothes, and within minutes, complimentary champagne and a handwritten not of Congratulations materialised. The staff made us feel like princesses, and the room (Alice Suite) was very comfortable, with all we could ever need. (Thank you Yesoo & Johan for helping to make our mini-honeymoon special). Room service dinner was also really flavourful and quick to arrive. Will definitely be back to The Blackman!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473995826~“A little disappointed”~We love the Art Series but the Blackman didn't live up to expectations. I understand that the noise of building sites are outside of the Hotels control but even a heads up at check in about the extremely loud jack hammering every morning would have been appreciated. Just didn't feel like we were valued guests.~2~3~nan~nan~5~nan~2~nan
review_473466985~“Nothing exceptional”~Not a fan of in bath showers and small bathrooms! Staff were a cut above, but other than that the experience was average. Comfortable bed and reasonably close to Melbourne CBD. I would look elsewhere on a future visit.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_473308251~“Very Artsy and Fun Hotel! ”~Awesome hotel, I had a great time.  The staff were friendly, funny and were always smiling. Robert , checked me out at 4:30am and kept my company until my car arrived. Genuine conversation and not just idol chit chat.  There's construction going on but not the fault of the hotel. The pizza through room service was delicious and quick. The rooms are fancy and the bed very comfortable! The kitchen is well stocked and there's a washer and dryer on the floor. It's a very popular hotel , noisy a bit for entrainment purposes but not annoying . Great for business and pleasure! You can catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel . Also, thank you Johann and Leonard for everything, it was greatly appreciated.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472176819~“Great location”~This is a really nice, quirky hotel part way down St Kilda road so easily accessible by tram. We were upgraded to a suite with balcony which had a great view over the city. The room itself was lovely, clean and comfortable though it would have been nice if the balcony could have been swept over the time we were there. There are two restaurants on the ground floor but we only ever went in one of them for breakfast as the other was always really busy - the eggs benedict were fantastic! This is a really great place to stay in Melbourne; close enough to the city but not too close. We'll definitely consider staying again when we're back next!~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_471782182~“Deluxe Romantic and Handy to the CBD and transport. Super friendly and helpful staff.”~We had a friend tell us about this hotel due to her love of Charles Blackmans' artworks. We were not dissapointed. The rooms were so comfortable with kitchenettes and balconies and trendy furniture. Very luxurious at a comparable rate to some of the average properties that we have staying in in the CBD. This hotel is on the outskirts of Albert Park and it is a one minutes stroll to the tram network into the CBD or out to St Kilda. The restaurants downstairs offered a mix of cuisines and the restaurant over the road - name escapes me is really, really, really good.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471310632~“fantastic!”~room for myself and 2 children, spacious room with 2 QS beds, one in a separate alcove, kitchenette enabled us to eat in the room if desired, quality furnishings, balcony, room service was delicious, friendly staff...~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470717508~“Just outstanding”~What an incredible hotel. All of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. From check in to check out our stay was amazing. The restaurants are great. The rooms are comfortable. Just ordered 2 of the pillows. Best night's sleep in a hotel ever.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469753480~“Business trip ideal location”~Fabulous rooms, bathrooms very small though. Really nice facilities and reception staff are just lovely. The restaurants on both sides need a bit of a rocket in the mornings for a quick breakfast with a rush. There was no urgency when we gave them a time frame and often looked a little listless and unsure of what to do. Needed quick service, was not what we were given. At the end of the day the bar staff and restaurant staff in the Italian restaurant were our favourite. Will definitely stay there again, but hoping the breakfast team improve!~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468135084~“Long Weekend”~Awesome stay! I normally stay closer to the city, however, The Blackman may now have changed my mind! Location, facilities and service were exceptional. Great morning coffee, afternoon champagne was perfect out in the sunshine and the fries hit the spot. Staff were very accommodating -in particular Maddie at reception was divine-she sets a great benchmark for customer service. It was also fun to see a variety of artists dropping in with their artwork. Highly recommend for families, couples or a single person~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467079412~“Gorgeous Hotel”~This hotel is lovely, personalised by the numerous interesting art works throughout done by Blackman. They are quirky and add so much character to this very nicely furnished hotel. We had a room on the 13th floor so the views over the city & to the ocean were great. We had a balcony that added to the already large room that had a full kitchen, plenty of sitting space and a comfy bed...except for the pillows. I don't like feather as they squash too much but I'm sure they would change them.....the staff are very helpful and friendly. We rented their Smart car for a couple of days. You can't take it out overnight, curfew is 11pm for the car. Such a dinky little roomy car to whiz around in!! Definitely recommend both the hotel and (car @$50.00 per day). It's not in the centre of the city but trams run close by. It is walkable but not when it's hot! LOVED it. :-) Also a nice small restaurant on site and many in the street. Definitely has WIFI but can't remember if it's free.~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467034657~“City Week End Get Away!”~On arrival at The Blackman we were treated by warm & friendly staff. We were shown our suite on the 16th Floor. It was stunning! It had a great view over Albert Park Lake & Port Philip Bay. The room itself was spacious, stylish & 'cosy' at the same time. The bathroom was a great size & had a beautiful shower & great spa. The bed was sensational I felt like I was floating on a cloud! Heaven! The Hotel is in the best location. We were walking distance to the city, the laneway bars & restaurants as well as the Botanic Gardens! We were close enough to all the 'activity' in the city but also removed enough to feel relaxed & removed from the noise, hustle & bustle of the CBD. We took advantage of the vintage bikes the hotel had available for guests & rode along the Yarra Trail stopping at the best cafes along the way. We also went around the gardens (the tan) & looked at the great restaurants & shops in Domain Road on our way back to the hotel. We had brunch in the French cafe at the Hotel & had a yummy meal & the best coffee! We couldn't ask for a better week end escape! We cannot wait till our next staff in the not so distant future!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466857277~“Great City Hotel”~We'd paid for an upgrade but got a further upgrade so we had a lovely kitchenette. Left car in underground car park as right on tram routes into the CBD. The receptionist made us so welcome it was like someone greeting you when you go to their house. Our room was fantastic - no complaints. The only issue, which was outside of their control was the building site next door starting work at 4am!! Loved it - want to go back.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466645287~“Comfy, friendly and convenient ”~Beds are super comfortable - best sleeps I've had in a long time in a hotel.  Reception staff are great and restaurants below are both excellent. At present there are some construction sites right next door that start work at 7am Mon - Sat so if you want to sleep late make sure you ask for a quiet room. Would stay again for sure.  Laundry charges are pretty steep but there is a laundrette 2 mins walk round the corner if you don't mind doing it yourself!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466175967~“Absolutely gorgeous rooms!”~Wow - we were so impressed the minute we walked into reception - the friendly and helpful assistance from staff, the art on the walls and of course the stunning spacious room - spoilt with a bay view on the 15th floor. The computers were down on arrival so had to wait 20 min to check in - but were given a free upgrade to an executive room with a complimentary bottle of bubbly. Nothing was too much trouble and will definitely stay here again when back in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466127378~“Great Hotel and excellent Restaurant”~The restaurant is great if you eat at the bar. One night I made the mistake of ordering takeaway so I could enjoy my balcony that had fabulous views but the food did not taste great like it did downstairs. My room was great and on the 14th floor but I could still hear traffic on both sides. I had a fabulous view. The bed was superb. I was disappointed that the hotel lost TV reception on one night and did not put a message up. I wasted one HR flicking channels thinking it was me and I was only advised in the morning. I would loved to have spent more time downstairs enjoying the ambience. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465944863~“Great Getaway!”~We had a wonderful stay at The Blackman last weekend.The room was lovely, the reception staff super friendly and welcoming, and the personal handwritten note & bottle of chilled bubbles waiting for us in our room was such a lovely surprise!! Best Wedding Anniversary ever!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465196806~“What more could you ask for?”~You know it's going to be a good stay when you hear the words "free upgrade" when you check in! We stayed in a beautiful, spacious, well-appointed Junior suite. You could easily make this your base for a longer stay. The hotel is situated in a quieter part of the city, just a short tram ride or leisurely walk from the cbd. The facilities are fantastic. A good, well-equipped gym, access to guest laundry and two great dining options downstairs. The staff are friendly, helpful and couldn't have done more for us. We will be back, for a longer stay next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464917397~“Fantastic hotel”~My SO and I stayed in The Blackman recently and had a wonderful time. This hotel looked ever so classy and chiq. There were cool people sitting outside enjoying their coffee in the afternoon sun when we arrived, and both of the hotel eateries were in full swing, making the place look warm and inviting. The front desk staff were super friendly and efficient, check in was an absolute breeze and they set us up with complementary wifi. When we headed up to the room we were greeted with some swish artwork, and ultra modern but tasteful furniture. The rooms are a bit quirky, but you wouldn't stay in an Art Hotel and expect boring. While the room was small, we never felt cramped, and we had a cute little balcony to enjoy coffee on. We also stayed on the second floor which made the balcony a great place to sit and people watch. The bed was a little small, but extremely comfortable. The pillows were so soft it was like sleeping on a giant marshmallow. If you prefer a firmer pillow, double up (as I did for that ultimate marshmallow experience) or bring your own. The hotel was very quiet at night so a good nights rest is guaranteed. Our only complaint would have been the bathroom. The shower door did naff all to prevent water getting all over the floor. Given that it was hot outside I just squeezed out the foot towel and left it in the sun to dry, but in the winter months preventing slips might be more difficult. There was also very little bench space. I abandoned the idea of doing my hair and makeup in the bathroom and used the mirrored wall by the door instead. This hotel was also serviced by the #23 tram stop on St Kilda Road, making it extremely easy to get into the CBD and out to St Kilda. Trams whizzed by constantly, the longest wait we had was maybe 5 minutes. The Royal Botanics were also within walking distance as were a few cute little weekday cafes. We had a great time and will probably stay here next time we're in Melbourne. We're keen on checking out the Art Series as a whole though, the sister hotels look just as unique and awesome as The Blackman. This is a hotel chain we can really get behind!~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_464876761~“Lovely hotel! ”~This hotel is stunning, the room was beautiful and we had a very nice view. The staff were so helpful with any issues we had, and quickly arranged for us to change rooms when we had a problem with the toilet. Highly highly recommended!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464862631~“Loved this Hotel”~Very friendly staff, made us feel right at home... My favorite service is that they have a washer and dryer! Yes , they care enough to provide a laundry room, ( which we did not have this service in any other Hotel in Australia! So important if your on the road for 3 -4 weeks! The French coffee press was another wonderful item in the room! Its these little things that one ususally does not think about , that makes a Hotel stand out! Great Location, great staff, lovely large rooms, with a kichentte, and a nice balcony , 7 -11 nearby, streetcar stops , and takes you in a few min into the heart of the city ....We enjoyed our stay here very much!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464692853~“We will be back!”~Wow, what a hotel.  We loved the rooms, the fact that they were decked out with the most amazing art work. All the little touches made our stay wonderful. Unlike other hotels their little kitchenettes, equipped with stove top and all necessary equipment to make your own meals in the room. It is a little out of the way but if you hire one of their on site Smart Cars for $50, you can zip around town all day. Excellent service, great rooms, we will definitely return again and we are now looking forward to staying in their other sister hotels around town.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464405526~“The best hotel I have stayed in for many years!”~From the first moment I arrived until I left I felt welcomed and comfortable. The front desk were friendly and helpful, the restaurant food delivered promptly to the room was lovely, the bed soooo comfortable. While the room was smaller than many it didn't feel cramped, but cosy instead.I didn't even hear any other guests - either there was no-one else staying in a room anywhere near me (unlikely!) or there is great sound proofing. Lovely to have T2 tea - often hotels have nice coffee but then a cheap tea bag as an after thought.  The only one downside is the building site next door (not a great view, but I didn't hear anything) and on a high floor with a string wind blowing the building seemed to sway a little (maybe due to the empty building space next door).  I travel and stay in hotels a lot, and this was such a pleasant surprise compared to most of the others I have stayed in! A little further out of town than i would usually pick (the meeting I was attending was in St Kilda so convenient this time) but even if I'm based in the CBD next visit I will seriously consider staying here again - the Tram is so simple to use it would be worth it. :)~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_463842327~“Fantastic Hotel Home from Home”~Our plane landed late evening and we were met by a smiling helpful Johan who helped us up to our room with our cases. All the staff went out of their way to help us enjoy our stay. We first stayed for 6 nights then went to Apollo Bay for a week and returned to the Blackman for another 11 nights. It took 10 minutes from the hotel on the frequent trams to the centre and 10 minutes the other way to St Kilda's. 20 minutes walk through the Park to South Yarra and lots of restaurants and the train station. The room was large and we paid for a Bay View everything there for a comfortable stay. Special mention for Yesool and of course Johan who actually was the last member of staff we saw as he held the umbrella over us getting to the taxi as it was pouring. He was still smiling . I would recommend this hotel highly . Thanks for a wonderful stay .~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462805447~“Great place - bit of construction going on. ”~I purchased two nights here via the Wotif mystery hotel section. After various fees it worked out to be about $5 cheaper than if I had selected it off the regular list. Regardless, we were excited for our stay.  When we entered the room, we were blown away with the modern look. Mirrors all over the place, a frosted glass toilet door and a plethora of natural light via the two large windows.  As we explored further, we found the balcony on one side and a courtyard on the other. Both of these would have been amazing and useful had the room not overlooked three construction sites - nevertheless, the design was good.  Undoubtably, the highlight of the stay was the bed. It was beyond comfortable and certainly added to the enjoyment of the stay.  From a location perspective, the hotel is right on Albert park (great if you want a lazy afternoon stroll) and within close proximity of the shrine of remembrance and a few nice little cafes.  All in all, a wonderful hotel - just a pity about the noise from the nearby construction zones.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461572134~“Surprise Girls Night for my Sister's Bridal Shower!”~From the moment we booked our room over the phone, the service was outstanding and so incredibly friendly. We received a gorgeous reception on arrival and a bottle of champagne for my sister's bridal shower celebrations - my Mum and I surprised my little sister with a special nights accomodation at The Blackman Art Series Hotel for her Bridal Shower! The room was better than the photos online, so clean & spacious with a balcony that was big enough to fit all 3 of us on. We were so close to Albert Park Lake & the Gardens which we walked through the next morning before our delicious breakfast. Parking was fabulous & underneath the hotel itself - easily accessible. Overall a fabulous, fun, girls night - thank you to the friendly team! You guys and gals rock!!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

Our room had a kitchenette...handy if you wanted to eat in..balcony with view...comfortable bed and plenty of space. We had dinner in the restaurant downstairs each visit...great food and service. Decor throughout includes stunning artwork which is another feature that sets this Hotel apart. Beautiful place to stay, walk through the parks and gardens, friendly helpful staff...wonderful place to stay.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460783291~“Awesome family stay”~We stayed in Melbourne for a short three night stay and decided upon our favourite family friendly accomodation. This hotel suits us perfectly and we love the fact that the one queen bed is in a curtained nook and the other is in the main part of the room. This added to the fact that there is a small kitchenette takes The Blackman well above a standard hotel room. The service is always awesome and staff are particularly excellent with our kids - aged 10 & 11. We dined downstairs in both the restaurant for dinner and the cafe for breakfast and both were faultless. The quirky feel and wonderful service of The Blackman makes this one place we are always happy to recommend and often do.... add to this the great rates we receive for being a member of their loyalty program and it can't be beaten. Thanks!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460554623~“Beautiful hotel - fantastic stay”~My partner and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago and it was a wonderful stay. The hotel is beautiful with the rooms in particular excellent.  However, the highlight of the stay was the friendliness of the staff in particular the lady whom managed our reservation ( Pip ) who was fantastic. The staff do a brilliant job, with no request or question too difficult. Yes, the hotel is beautiful, but the staff are the reason as to why I would return.  I enjoyed it so much, we picked this hotel as the place to stay tomorrow night when we are back in Melbourne.  Outstanding place to stay and cannot recommend it highly enough.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460293694~“Sightseeing in Melbourne”~The hotel was conveniently located for us, with the city centre easy to get to by tram. The hotel room was luxurious and spacious, ideal for our needs. However, at check-in we felt that we were treated with indifference.For example, it would have been helpful to understand parking arrangements and amenities. Also, on one of our 3 nights the room was not serviced.~3~nan~4~5~nan~nan~1~nan
review_460262102~“Quirky and a nice change”~This is a quirky little place in a great location. We’ve stayed twice and enjoyed both visits. Its small and very personal and the staff seem to be having fun and you can’t help but smile - especially at the front desk dude riding around the tiny lobby on a kids’ scooter! The junior suite that we stayed in this time had a large living area/kitchenette with a balcony and a teeny tiny bathroom and bedroom. The bathroom was a bit too small and was certainly a challenge for two of us. The bed was comfy but only divided from the living area by a filmy curtain - not particularly useful while we entertained friends in the living area! That said, it is a clean, pleasant place to stay and makes a break from the impersonal chains. There’s a small gym, but no pool. There are smart cars to hire and bikes as well.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_459488952~“A wonderful stay in Melbourne.”~Our recent stay at "The Blackman" was excellent. We stayed in a studio apartment with a beautiful view across Albert Park Lake and further on to Port Phillip Bay. The apartment is small but very serviceable with large windows to take in the sweeping views. I loved the Blackman "touch" with prints and other references made to his fabulous work. The hotel has a quirky/fun feel about it. Parking was easy but easier still to leave your car parked and jump on the numerous trams running along the beautiful St Kilda Rd. 10 mins to the city. Would happily return to "The Blackman" , not the cheapest option for staying in Melbourne but certainly a great place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458944044~“A splash of colour”~Great hotel, wonderful art throughout - there was a Alice in Wonderland theme when I visited. Our room was six floors up, had a balcony, was roomy and well designed. There's two restaurants either side of reception - the Italian was excellent (pasta and a Victorian red, v. good) the other less formal and open throughout the day. Staff on reception were approachable and knowledgeable on how to get around Melbourne. Albert Park is a short distance - went for a morning run around the lake. It's five or six stops on the tram to Flinders St and a taxi to airport ~ $60.00.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458843167~“beautiful hotel with equally beautiful staff”~The hotel:1/5 It was most difficult to find as it was not on St. Kilda's Road, but on Arthur St. Being out of town, it was difficult to find. There was construction next door which didn't help. The hotel is beautiful, the staff perfect, and the breakfast was yummy. I had the best sleep on the bed. One surprise was finding the kitchenette and the laundry facilities which really suited us-extremely handy I will recommend this place for business, couples, family, friends, and solo~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458637165~“Great gem away from the chaos of the city”~Approximately a 30 minute walk from Federation Square, The Blackman hotel is the perfect place for a weekend getaway. Located on St Kilda road, it's in the heart of the trendy St Kilda/Toorak area full of great cafes and restaurants. Spacious rooms with all the modern amenities - I love the fact that I never feel squashed like other hotels. Decor is funky and the hotel is full of Charles Blackman's artwork. Classico restaurant located downstairs - food is great Italian cuisine, a must when staying at the Blackman. It's the only place my husband and I stay when in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458347816~“A Delight!”~Stayed overnight in Melbourne for a show. Had always wanted to try The Blackman because it looked different from every other hotel. It was everything I hoped for...amazing, amazing service, spacious rooms, excellent shower, quirky decorating, super comfy beds, great food in the restaurant. Went to our show at The Art Centre and walked home 3km down St Kilda Road on a beautiful Melbourne night. Will definitely be returning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457913658~“Nice hotel in a good location”~The Blackman is a beautiful, modern hotel in a good location in Melbourne. Great quiet parks and a tram stop are within walking distance. We were two adults and one child and had a beautiful huge room with two large beds and even two TVs. The equipment was very modern and we liked it really well. We also had more than enough space for our clothes and cosmetics in the closets. The kitchen in the room was also well equipped with everything you need for cooking. The staff was very friendly and took good care of us and our daughter. We would love to stay there again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457724800~“No car parking, party happening above until 11.30pm with loud music!”~We arrived at the Blackman with high expectations. Unfortunately they were not met. Car parking was not available on the premises due to the construction work being undertaken and our we had to park our car on a building site nearby, not what I would call secure in the current Melbourne climate of car jackings. The next morning to get to the 'car park' (luckily our car was still there) we had to walk around the block more than a km with all of our luggage in tow. We were still charged $25 for this pleasure and experience. The beds were really comfortable, in fact awesome. Unfortunately the pillows did not block out the loud music coming from above which sounded like a party. To my amazement when I phoned reception at 11.30pm and asked if there was a party happening above me, they replied that yes there was! So they knew about the noise, they knew that we requested a quiet room if possible and yet here we were in this position being placed one floor from a late party with loud doof doof music. We will not be staying here again and will be passing on this feedback to all of our friends who also regularly travel to Melbourne from the country.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457057366~“Very good”~Stayed here for my wedding night recently and could hardly fault it. Very friendly, professional and helpful staff! Room service was good and punctual! Check in and check out was seamless. I would only suggest a design flaw in the shower screen that, no matter the angle of the shower head, still resulted in water getting all over the floor.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_455127611~“Super cool hotel and brilliant location”~Friendly check in service from the front desk staff who were very helpful with all my questions. On entry to my room I was wowed by the suite, double aspect balconies with views up to across the city and also down to St Kilda. The room itself was comfortable with a well equipped, smart kitchenette if you did want to prepare any drinks or food. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Location wise there is a tram stop three minutes from the door, ten minutes into Melbourne CBD or twenty five minutes if you want a trip down to the beach, bars and restaurants of St Kilda. The bar in the hotel was rocking although I never managed to visit and there is a lovely gastro pub/restaurant across on the other side of the road which makes a great easy choice if you don't want to travel far one night. Thumbs up to The Blackman.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_454423239~“Just as good second time round”~This is the second time I have stayed at the Blackman, I enjoyed it the first time and enjoyed it just as much on this occasion. It's got a "boutique hotel" type feel to it, even though there are 209 rooms. The room I had was a great size, it had a small kitchenette, full size fridge, good selection of mini bar items and a balcony. I found the position of the TV at a right angle to the bed a bit annoying, you couldn't lay in bed and watch TV comfortably.  I had a pizza delivered from the room service menu which was very tasty but though the price of the pizza was reasonable, the extra $5 tray service charge turned it into an expensive pizza. I would have happily walked down to the restaurant to collect it myself rather than paying the $5 charge. All the staff I came across were great, they were friendly, happy, helpful and easy to talk to. I'd definitely make it stay number 3 if I needed to be in that part of Melbourne in the future.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_454193751~“Great location, great service!”~Had one night at the Blackman and was very satisfied with the entire experience. We got given a room that overlooked a construction site, one call to front desk and we were swiftly located to a new room with an upgrade, this was great customer experience to go out of their way for us. Highly recommended. Easy to get into the city or South Yarra via the tram stop out the front.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_452453408~“Great hotel. Great stay.”~The Blackman Hotel was a real turn up for the books in terms of hotels we have stayed in. My partner and I have stayed in many hotels around the world but consider the Blackman to be at the very top of out experiences. The room was very spacious and well appointed. We had a functional kitchen as well as eating and lounge space and the price was extremely reasonable. The view over Pot Philip Bay was the icing on the cake. With Albert Park Lake in the foreground it made it look like a tropical paradise. The construction work we were warned about did not worry us at all as we were on the opposite side of the building we did not hear a thing. The staff were excellent and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Johann in particular was very helpful. I would always stay at the Blackman because it is an excellent hotel and its situation on St Kilda Road just out of the city. There is a tram stop on the corner and convenience stores nearby. The hotel restaurant is also excellent.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452069305~“The Blackman - Delux Suite”~Loved it! Paid just a little extra to upgrade to delux suite and room was fantastic. Very spacious and quite with peaceful private balcony.

review_451578880~“Fabulous place to stay in the heart of Melbourne”~The studio that we booked was fantastic with great facilities (fridge, microwave, hot plate etc) and lovely table settings.

review_449794218~“Boutique relaxation”~I have stayed at the Blackman almost 10 times for work and later leisure. The boutique modern styled rooms are a joy to relax in. The free car hire is amazing! Small smart car great for heading to the wine region. Hotel is located close to Albert park and trams to the city.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_449098011~“Superb place to stay and wonderful staff”~We only spent a night at The Blackman but it was terrific! The art makes it such a lively and interesting place, and the staff were tremendous - couldn't have been more helpful. Both cafes on the ground level are great, fabulous Italian food for dinner then French patisserie for breakfast, you couldn't ask for better. Loved the room with two queen beds, with one partitioned off in its own space, that worked really well with children.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_448819221~“Good to stay”~The impression is good. We arrived hotel at 10am. Surprisingly, Room is already available for us. That's Comfortable place and good environment around. Only 2 mins walk to reach tram station. All trams may take you to the centre.  Yet, most of the tours do not have direct pick up point from this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448727418~“Great Hotel Just Far Enough out of Town”~The Blackman never fails to impress, stayed often for work and couldn't look past it to stay for pleasure. The rooms are well set out and super impressive with the artwork and boutique feel, which is impressive given the size of the hotel.  Ideally located infront of a tram stop which is only minutes into Fed Square will definitely be back!!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_448396863~“Best hotel I've stayed in”~Loved it. Great room, excellent staff, lovely restaurants. Highly recommend. I spent extra time at the hotel because the room was so comfortable. Great Italian restaurant and close to trams. I'll definitely be back.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_446801879~“Second stay - Fantastic Hotel”~We stayed here for 3 nights on a trip to Melbourne. Great location, rooms, food and service. We stayed here when it first opened a few years ago and it's still the same fantastic hotel. Planning to stay there again next week and couldn't be happier with the hotel choice.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446055379~“Very nice hotel in a reasonable location”~I had to attend a work meeting in Melbourne and was put up in the Blackman. The staff were terrific and willing to assist with any request. The room was spacious and well appointed which included a cooking facility. There are tram stops within a 2min walk from the hotel. This was a big plus if you wanted to go to the CBD or St Kilda. For what I needed during my stay, it was the perfect location. If I was visiting Melbourne as a tourist, it would be a reasonable location only for the fact of the lack of dining choices in the area.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445455979~“Art & Food”~My wife and I booked through "Luxury Escapes" we stayed at The Blackman Hotel.  Beautifully appointed room filled with artwork. The Italian restaurant downstairs was also to die for with authentic Italian food and drinks. I highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445420970~“Superb Stay”~Enjoyed a 1-night stay for a work trip and didn't want to leave. This hotel honestly is a feast for the senses - gorgeous art, chill out music as you enter the room, amazing pasta from Classico, and the bed is the best. Just heaven. Looking forward to coming back for a recreational visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445117212~“Very comfortable”~We have previously stayed at the Cullen and Olsen so we had high expectations. We were not disappointed. The staff were very friendly and professional. The room was spacious and had a well equipped kitchen. It was very clean. The hotel is located right on the tram line which made it very easy to get into the heat of Melbourne. We loved the art work around the hotel and in our room.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_445084659~“Comfortable and close to the city”~A comfortable, clean room with a nice view of Melbourne. A little different from most generic hotel rooms, with interesting decor (based on the art of Charles Blackman) that made the stay that more special. Great customer service upon arrival. Also close to the tram line with easy access to the city. I would recommend a stay and would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_444361775~“Fantastic”~We stayed 2 nights at the Blackman hotel , and from the moment we arrived the experience was fantastic, staff were firnxly and helpful, our request for a high room was granted and the view from the 17 floor was great . The hotel standard in everything offered was high. Breakfast at classico was huge and again of a high standard. Less than 1 minute walk from the tram made for easy access to and from the city centre.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Staff were welcoming and helpful, and we will definitely be back on our next visit to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443640085~“Friendliest of Hotels”~Recommend a stay at The Blackman for a different ambience to what is found in the larger hotels. The art is great and have not found a friendlier, welcoming and more efficient staff at any of the many hotels we have stayed at. The rooms are a bit quirky; on the whole good but we had a junior suite and found the bed (only queen) and the bedroom a bit small. We were offered a glass of bubbly at reception while awaiting our transport and yet another on our return from dinner - a nice touch!~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443401115~“Fantastic hotel on St Kilda Road with amazing amenities”~Stayed here for one night and loved the Blackman. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels before and this is up with the best. I was on the 10th floor with a balcony overlooking St Kilda Road. Room had a kitchenette, lovely bathroom, generous lounge area and extremely comfy bed and pillows. Had the best night's sleep in ages. Staff were very welcoming and even offered a free glass of bubbly in the foyer prior to eating in the dining room.~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443229438~“Curious hotel near the Lake ”~Stayed for business trip for 2 nights in Nov16, on 14th floor in executive suite overlooking Albert Park across from St Kilda road. Facilities and basics all there, and hotel, rooms, lobby and everything decked out in art and very left field. Definitely different! Only a short stroll to good restaurants and the Albert Park lake - worth checking out~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478079434~“Easter break ”~Stayed here for one night in April and it was fantastic! The bed was so amazing, the views beautiful from our room and staff polite and friendly! It's a bit further from the st kilda foreshore but there's a tram stop nearby to get into the city. Thank you so much for the complimentary champagne for my partners birthday surprise too! The French cafe in the hotel serves delicious pastries and coffee , wish that was included in the room rate. Would highly recommend this modern hotel!! Fantastic~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477601216~“Great service, lovely hotel”~Upon check-in, the lovely staff gave our three year old a canvas and paint set - which he loved and couldn't wait to use. What a welcome! The room was lovely, the bed very comfy, and my son loved the little card inviting him to jump on the bed. It's the little touches that count! There's also a fantastic park across the road, perfect for an evening stroll. Thanks for a wonderful stay, we'll be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477598290~“Excellent hotel but..”~A little inaccessible from the main attractions. Room was smaller than expected. However, service was top-notch, and decoration was true to the art series hotels: tasteful. It was the best hotel bed that we've ever slept on!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_476019145~“Most amazing place to stay in Melbourne!”~I had to find a hotel quickly as my flight was canceled and was stuck here solo on Easter weekend. This place was PERFECT! Not only are the hotel and rooms EXCELLENT, each room comes with a kitchenette! I would call these an actual kitchen because it's a full size fridge and freezer, stove top, microwave, tea kettle, toaster, and pretty much everything you need to heat up food or make snacks. The decor was gorgeous, the view lovely and I was right across the street from the beautiful Fawken Park, where I spent Easter Sunday since everything in town was closed. The staff WAS EXCELLENT! So kind, sweet, went out of their way to help me book a facial and find a pharmacy that was open. The restaurants at the base of the property are lovely and deliver to the room if you want. I cannot say enough great things about this place. Also LOVE all the eco-friendly products - this place is truly amazing. I will stay here again next time I am In melbourne. It has a perfect mix of art, boutiquey feel, and home all wrapped up into a hotel. I LOVE THIS PLACE!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475988049~“AMAZING. Can't recommend highly enough”~Stayed here for 2 nights this weekend, and WOW. I am/was so impressed. This hotel is definitely deserving of its ranking, and probably even deserves a higher one. Everything was perfect. The beds are amazingly comfortable, and the rooms are incredibly well appointed. The bathrooms are also quite nice, but not the best I've used - but the shower was strong and hot, and the bathroom had everything that you needed.  Rooms were also very clean - and the housekeeping team did a spectacular job of cleaning the room, and keeping the hotel clean throughout. The hotel is super accessible - 10 minutes on the tram from Flinders Street station, or about the same in an uber.  The restaurants are good too. Both Fleur and Classico have excellent food, but I found the service at Fleur to be far superior to Classico.  Overall, an incredible hotel, and will not hesitate to recommend it to anyone that I know is coming to the city - not to mention the fact that I will be back myself.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_475694609~“Worth every bit”~The hotel is great. Rooms quiet and comfortable. Although its fine for now they will soon need to refurbish. The staff is great and acimodating and food also good. It's best to pay directly for breakfast as there are two restaurants and you can choose. Location is terrific trams and easy access to the city. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475467256~“Melbourne getaway ”~I love this hotel. My hisband and i go often for a quick local break from the kids. Near St Kilda road a quick tram ride to Southbank or the heart of the city. The artwork is amazing and the hotel quaint.  They often have great deals for priority members too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475250331~“Fantastic !!!”~I stayed here for 6 nights in April 2017 with my wife and two boys (aged 3 and 5). Overall, we had a great stay.  The staff were consistently friendly and professional, be it at the reception or at the restaurants or on the phone.  I stayed in a room with two twin beds. The room was done up artfully yet tastefully and was of a fairly decent size. The room came with a small kitchenette along with basic cutlery, crockery and appliances. Moreover, there was also a balcony in the room. The quality of the food at the restaurant was consistently good. Our package did not include breakfast. So we ordered breakfast a la carte everyday and it was pretty good. The location was quiet and we could find restaurants within perhaps a 15-20 minute walking distance. The central CBD area was a quick 10 minute taxi ride away.  However, there is construction taking place right next door and in case you happen to stay in your room late morning or afternoon, you would hear it. It did not bother us too much though. Overall, I would recommend this hotel~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_474840256~“Everything about the room was great”~Tidy room with all that we needed. Comfortable bed with crisp white linen; great and not too expensive mini bar. Good shampoo and conditioner products provided in the bathroom. Totally recommend The Blackman.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474784601~“Friendly, Helpful staff; Great Location”~After arriving very late at this hotel after a 17 hour flight from the UK it was such a relief to meet a helpful, patient and friendly person at reception who quickly checked us in, gave us the info we needed for the time of day and got us to our room nice and fast. The room was clean and comfortable with everything we needed for a 4 night stay in Melbourne. The next day the advice we got from front of house for getting into the city was great and they even ordered us taxis with no fuss whenever we asked. There were some works going on next door to the hotel but by now I imagine these are finished and really nothing to do with the hotel from what I could see. The restaurants attached to the hotel were nothing to write home about but there are plenty of good places to eat nearby. Perfect location within walking distance of so many sights in the city.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474536781~“Short but pleasant stay”~We stayed in this location as it was convenient to both Melbourne CBD and to the other locations we needed to access. We were greeted by a very pleasant reception. Our room was located on the 12th floor facing St Kilda Rd. It was a balcony room facing east which gave us a bright sunny outlook in the morning. There was some construction going on adjacent the hotel which was a bit noisy with the balcony door open. The room itself was not large but had a small kitchen with everything provided. Large king bed clean and tidy bathroom. Definitely come back here again.~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_474375195~“One night stay”~Always a pleasure to stay here.. Our second time here.. We love the bed.. wish we could afford one of our own..

review_474256684~“Fantastic service”~We showed up in the rain on a stormy afternoon after our wedding. The first thing that happened was a staff member ran out into the rain to grab our bag. The second thing was they realised we were in wedding clothes, and within minutes, complimentary champagne and a handwritten not of Congratulations materialised. The staff made us feel like princesses, and the room (Alice Suite) was very comfortable, with all we could ever need. (Thank you Yesoo & Johan for helping to make our mini-honeymoon special). Room service dinner was also really flavourful and quick to arrive. Will definitely be back to The Blackman!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473995826~“A little disappointed”~We love the Art Series but the Blackman didn't live up to expectations. I understand that the noise of building sites are outside of the Hotels control but even a heads up at check in about the extremely loud jack hammering every morning would have been appreciated. Just didn't feel like we were valued guests.~2~3~nan~nan~5~nan~2~nan
review_473466985~“Nothing exceptional”~Not a fan of in bath showers and small bathrooms! Staff were a cut above, but other than that the experience was average. Comfortable bed and reasonably close to Melbourne CBD. I would look elsewhere on a future visit.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_473308251~“Very Artsy and Fun Hotel! ”~Awesome hotel, I had a great time.  The staff were friendly, funny and were always smiling. Robert , checked me out at 4:30am and kept my company until my car arrived. Genuine conversation and not just idol chit chat.  There's construction going on but not the fault of the hotel. The pizza through room service was delicious and quick. The rooms are fancy and the bed very comfortable! The kitchen is well stocked and there's a washer and dryer on the floor. It's a very popular hotel , noisy a bit for entrainment purposes but not annoying . Great for business and pleasure! You can catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel . Also, thank you Johann and Leonard for everything, it was greatly appreciated.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472176819~“Great location”~This is a really nice, quirky hotel part way down St Kilda road so easily accessible by tram. We were upgraded to a suite with balcony which had a great view over the city. The room itself was lovely, clean and comfortable though it would have been nice if the balcony could have been swept over the time we were there. There are two restaurants on the ground floor but we only ever went in one of them for breakfast as the other was always really busy - the eggs benedict were fantastic! This is a really great place to stay in Melbourne; close enough to the city but not too close. We'll definitely consider staying again when we're back next!~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_471782182~“Deluxe Romantic and Handy to the CBD and transport. Super friendly and helpful staff.”~We had a friend tell us about this hotel due to her love of Charles Blackmans' artworks. We were not dissapointed. The rooms were so comfortable with kitchenettes and balconies and trendy furniture. Very luxurious at a comparable rate to some of the average properties that we have staying in in the CBD. This hotel is on the outskirts of Albert Park and it is a one minutes stroll to the tram network into the CBD or out to St Kilda. The restaurants downstairs offered a mix of cuisines and the restaurant over the road - name escapes me is really, really, really good.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_469753480~“Business trip ideal location”~Fabulous rooms, bathrooms very small though. Really nice facilities and reception staff are just lovely. The restaurants on both sides need a bit of a rocket in the mornings for a quick breakfast with a rush. There was no urgency when we gave them a time frame and often looked a little listless and unsure of what to do. Needed quick service, was not what we were given. At the end of the day the bar staff and restaurant staff in the Italian restaurant were our favourite. Will definitely stay there again, but hoping the breakfast team improve!~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

Great morning coffee, afternoon champagne was perfect out in the sunshine and the fries hit the spot. Staff were very accommodating -in particular Maddie at reception was divine-she sets a great benchmark for customer service. It was also fun to see a variety of artists dropping in with their artwork. Highly recommend for families, couples or a single person~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467768458~“Home away from home”~We stayed in a Deluxe Studio Suite Twin room and were so impressed by the amount of space! Plenty of room for the whole family. The view from where we were on the 16th floor was breathtaking. Perfect location too! When the kids got cabin-fever, it was a very short walk to the most gorgeous parklands and a quick tram ride to restaurants in either the city, South Melbourne or St Kilda. The decor was gorgeous across the whole hotel and having access to two cafe / restaurants on site was fantastic. I would highly recommend The Blackman as a place to stay in Melbourne. So close to everything, but away from the hustle and bustle of the main city streets.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

Nothing was too much for staff. Cafe/bar was a bonus. Superb location. Easy walk to Fawkner Park or Albert Park lake. Would certainly recommend to family's or couples.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467753571~“A pleasure to stay”~We have stayed here 3 times, each occasion was honestly fantastic. The staff are wonderful and helpful. The rooms are well appointed and clean. The rooms with views on the upper floors facing the lake are highly recommended. Little touches like 'welcome back' notes from the staff make us feel like valued guests, and the EVO products in the bathrooms are always appreciated. Oh, and the cafe downstairs in great for breakky. We will be back (again)!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467683818~“A favourite in Melbourne”~Room was spacious , however cleaning standard could have been better. Sink wasn't wiped down after servicing and had to ask for tea to be replaced on 2 occasions. More like a small apartment than a hotel room. Great little balcony to enjoy the view of St Kilda Rd. Both restaurants in the hotel were fantastic. Food was delicious and staff were outstanding.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~5~nan
review_467385347~“Wonderful!”~Great location, funky little rooms, awesome are work everywhere. This is a great hotel to stay for a short time while visiting Melbourne. Staff are helpful and accommodating to your needs. Everything feels like new and linen and pillows are to die for. 100% recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467079412~“Gorgeous Hotel”~This hotel is lovely, personalised by the numerous interesting art works throughout done by Blackman. They are quirky and add so much character to this very nicely furnished hotel. We had a room on the 13th floor so the views over the city & to the ocean were great. We had a balcony that added to the already large room that had a full kitchen, plenty of sitting space and a comfy bed...except for the pillows. I don't like feather as they squash too much but I'm sure they would change them.....the staff are very helpful and friendly. We rented their Smart car for a couple of days. You can't take it out overnight, curfew is 11pm for the car. Such a dinky little roomy car to whiz around in!! Definitely recommend both the hotel and (car @$50.00 per day). It's not in the centre of the city but trams run close by. It is walkable but not when it's hot! LOVED it. :-) Also a nice small restaurant on site and many in the street. Definitely has WIFI but can't remember if it's free.~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467034657~“City Week End Get Away!”~On arrival at The Blackman we were treated by warm & friendly staff. We were shown our suite on the 16th Floor. It was stunning! It had a great view over Albert Park Lake & Port Philip Bay. The room itself was spacious, stylish & 'cosy' at the same time. The bathroom was a great size & had a beautiful shower & great spa. The bed was sensational I felt like I was floating on a cloud! Heaven! The Hotel is in the best location. We were walking distance to the city, the laneway bars & restaurants as well as the Botanic Gardens! We were close enough to all the 'activity' in the city but also removed enough to feel relaxed & removed from the noise, hustle & bustle of the CBD. We took advantage of the vintage bikes the hotel had available for guests & rode along the Yarra Trail stopping at the best cafes along the way. We also went around the gardens (the tan) & looked at the great restaurants & shops in Domain Road on our way back to the hotel. We had brunch in the French cafe at the Hotel & had a yummy meal & the best coffee! We couldn't ask for a better week end escape! We cannot wait till our next staff in the not so distant future!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466857277~“Great City Hotel”~We'd paid for an upgrade but got a further upgrade so we had a lovely kitchenette. Left car in underground car park as right on tram routes into the CBD. The receptionist made us so welcome it was like someone greeting you when you go to their house. Our room was fantastic - no complaints. The only issue, which was outside of their control was the building site next door starting work at 4am!! Loved it - want to go back.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466645287~“Comfy, friendly and convenient ”~Beds are super comfortable - best sleeps I've had in a long time in a hotel.  Reception staff are great and restaurants below are both excellent. At present there are some construction sites right next door that start work at 7am Mon - Sat so if you want to sleep late make sure you ask for a quiet room. Would stay again for sure.  Laundry charges are pretty steep but there is a laundrette 2 mins walk round the corner if you don't mind doing it yourself!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466175967~“Absolutely gorgeous rooms!”~Wow - we were so impressed the minute we walked into reception - the friendly and helpful assistance from staff, the art on the walls and of course the stunning spacious room - spoilt with a bay view on the 15th floor. The computers were down on arrival so had to wait 20 min to check in - but were given a free upgrade to an executive room with a complimentary bottle of bubbly. Nothing was too much trouble and will definitely stay here again when back in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466127378~“Great Hotel and excellent Restaurant”~The restaurant is great if you eat at the bar. One night I made the mistake of ordering takeaway so I could enjoy my balcony that had fabulous views but the food did not taste great like it did downstairs. My room was great and on the 14th floor but I could still hear traffic on both sides. I had a fabulous view. The bed was superb. I was disappointed that the hotel lost TV reception on one night and did not put a message up. I wasted one HR flicking channels thinking it was me and I was only advised in the morning. I would loved to have spent more time downstairs enjoying the ambience. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465944863~“Great Getaway!”~We had a wonderful stay at The Blackman last weekend.The room was lovely, the reception staff super friendly and welcoming, and the personal handwritten note & bottle of chilled bubbles waiting for us in our room was such a lovely surprise!! Best Wedding Anniversary ever!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465196806~“What more could you ask for?”~You know it's going to be a good stay when you hear the words "free upgrade" when you check in! We stayed in a beautiful, spacious, well-appointed Junior suite. You could easily make this your base for a longer stay. The hotel is situated in a quieter part of the city, just a short tram ride or leisurely walk from the cbd. The facilities are fantastic. A good, well-equipped gym, access to guest laundry and two great dining options downstairs. The staff are friendly, helpful and couldn't have done more for us. We will be back, for a longer stay next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464917397~“Fantastic hotel”~My SO and I stayed in The Blackman recently and had a wonderful time. This hotel looked ever so classy and chiq. There were cool people sitting outside enjoying their coffee in the afternoon sun when we arrived, and both of the hotel eateries were in full swing, making the place look warm and inviting. The front desk staff were super friendly and efficient, check in was an absolute breeze and they set us up with complementary wifi. When we headed up to the room we were greeted with some swish artwork, and ultra modern but tasteful furniture. The rooms are a bit quirky, but you wouldn't stay in an Art Hotel and expect boring. While the room was small, we never felt cramped, and we had a cute little balcony to enjoy coffee on. We also stayed on the second floor which made the balcony a great place to sit and people watch. The bed was a little small, but extremely comfortable. The pillows were so soft it was like sleeping on a giant marshmallow. If you prefer a firmer pillow, double up (as I did for that ultimate marshmallow experience) or bring your own. The hotel was very quiet at night so a good nights rest is guaranteed. Our only complaint would have been the bathroom. The shower door did naff all to prevent water getting all over the floor. Given that it was hot outside I just squeezed out the foot towel and left it in the sun to dry, but in the winter months preventing slips might be more difficult. There was also very little bench space. I abandoned the idea of doing my hair and makeup in the bathroom and used the mirrored wall by the door instead. This hotel was also serviced by the #23 tram stop on St Kilda Road, making it extremely easy to get into the CBD and out to St Kilda. Trams whizzed by constantly, the longest wait we had was maybe 5 minutes. The Royal Botanics were also within walking distance as were a few cute little weekday cafes. We had a great time and will probably stay here next time we're in Melbourne. We're keen on checking out the Art Series as a whole though, the sister hotels look just as unique and awesome as The Blackman. This is a hotel chain we can really get behind!~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_464876761~“Lovely hotel! ”~This hotel is stunning, the room was beautiful and we had a very nice view. The staff were so helpful with any issues we had, and quickly arranged for us to change rooms when we had a problem with the toilet. Highly highly recommended!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464862631~“Loved this Hotel”~Very friendly staff, made us feel right at home... My favorite service is that they have a washer and dryer! Yes , they care enough to provide a laundry room, ( which we did not have this service in any other Hotel in Australia! So important if your on the road for 3 -4 weeks! The French coffee press was another wonderful item in the room! Its these little things that one ususally does not think about , that makes a Hotel stand out! Great Location, great staff, lovely large rooms, with a kichentte, and a nice balcony , 7 -11 nearby, streetcar stops , and takes you in a few min into the heart of the city ....We enjoyed our stay here very much!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464692853~“We will be back!”~Wow, what a hotel.  We loved the rooms, the fact that they were decked out with the most amazing art work. All the little touches made our stay wonderful. Unlike other hotels their little kitchenettes, equipped with stove top and all necessary equipment to make your own meals in the room. It is a little out of the way but if you hire one of their on site Smart Cars for $50, you can zip around town all day. Excellent service, great rooms, we will definitely return again and we are now looking forward to staying in their other sister hotels around town.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464405526~“The best hotel I have stayed in for many years!”~From the first moment I arrived until I left I felt welcomed and comfortable. The front desk were friendly and helpful, the restaurant food delivered promptly to the room was lovely, the bed soooo comfortable. While the room was smaller than many it didn't feel cramped, but cosy instead.I didn't even hear any other guests - either there was no-one else staying in a room anywhere near me (unlikely!) or there is great sound proofing. Lovely to have T2 tea - often hotels have nice coffee but then a cheap tea bag as an after thought.  The only one downside is the building site next door (not a great view, but I didn't hear anything) and on a high floor with a string wind blowing the building seemed to sway a little (maybe due to the empty building space next door).  I travel and stay in hotels a lot, and this was such a pleasant surprise compared to most of the others I have stayed in! A little further out of town than i would usually pick (the meeting I was attending was in St Kilda so convenient this time) but even if I'm based in the CBD next visit I will seriously consider staying here again - the Tram is so simple to use it would be worth it. :)~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_463842327~“Fantastic Hotel Home from Home”~Our plane landed late evening and we were met by a smiling helpful Johan who helped us up to our room with our cases. All the staff went out of their way to help us enjoy our stay. We first stayed for 6 nights then went to Apollo Bay for a week and returned to the Blackman for another 11 nights. It took 10 minutes from the hotel on the frequent trams to the centre and 10 minutes the other way to St Kilda's. 20 minutes walk through the Park to South Yarra and lots of restaurants and the train station. The room was large and we paid for a Bay View everything there for a comfortable stay. Special mention for Yesool and of course Johan who actually was the last member of staff we saw as he held the umbrella over us getting to the taxi as it was pouring. He was still smiling . I would recommend this hotel highly . Thanks for a wonderful stay .~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462805447~“Great place - bit of construction going on. ”~I purchased two nights here via the Wotif mystery hotel section. After various fees it worked out to be about $5 cheaper than if I had selected it off the regular list. Regardless, we were excited for our stay.  When we entered the room, we were blown away with the modern look. Mirrors all over the place, a frosted glass toilet door and a plethora of natural light via the two large windows.  As we explored further, we found the balcony on one side and a courtyard on the other. Both of these would have been amazing and useful had the room not overlooked three construction sites - nevertheless, the design was good.  Undoubtably, the highlight of the stay was the bed. It was beyond comfortable and certainly added to the enjoyment of the stay.  From a location perspective, the hotel is right on Albert park (great if you want a lazy afternoon stroll) and within close proximity of the shrine of remembrance and a few nice little cafes.  All in all, a wonderful hotel - just a pity about the noise from the nearby construction zones.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461572134~“Surprise Girls Night for my Sister's Bridal Shower!”~From the moment we booked our room over the phone, the service was outstanding and so incredibly friendly. We received a gorgeous reception on arrival and a bottle of champagne for my sister's bridal shower celebrations - my Mum and I surprised my little sister with a special nights accomodation at The Blackman Art Series Hotel for her Bridal Shower! The room was better than the photos online, so clean & spacious with a balcony that was big enough to fit all 3 of us on. We were so close to Albert Park Lake & the Gardens which we walked through the next morning before our delicious breakfast. Parking was fabulous & underneath the hotel itself - easily accessible. Overall a fabulous, fun, girls night - thank you to the friendly team! You guys and gals rock!!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_461364089~“Wonderful rooms and service.”~We stay at The Blackman whenever we are in Melbourne and are never disappointed. The rooms are all very well appointed with interesting features. The beds are the most comfortable you will find anywhere.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460836731~“Beautiful place to stay...”~We've stayed here a couple of times and loved it. Superb location along St Kilda Road, easy walk into the City or catch the tram. Our room had a kitchenette...handy if you wanted to eat in..balcony with view...comfortable bed and plenty of space. We had dinner in the restaurant downstairs each visit...great food and service. Decor throughout includes stunning artwork which is another feature that sets this Hotel apart. Beautiful place to stay, walk through the parks and gardens, friendly helpful staff...wonderful place to stay.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460783291~“Awesome family stay”~We stayed in Melbourne for a short three night stay and decided upon our favourite family friendly accomodation. This hotel suits us perfectly and we love the fact that the one queen bed is in a curtained nook and the other is in the main part of the room. This added to the fact that there is a small kitchenette takes The Blackman well above a standard hotel room. The service is always awesome and staff are particularly excellent with our kids - aged 10 & 11. We dined downstairs in both the restaurant for dinner and the cafe for breakfast and both were faultless. The quirky feel and wonderful service of The Blackman makes this one place we are always happy to recommend and often do.... add to this the great rates we receive for being a member of their loyalty program and it can't be beaten. Thanks!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460554623~“Beautiful hotel - fantastic stay”~My partner and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago and it was a wonderful stay. The hotel is beautiful with the rooms in particular excellent.  However, the highlight of the stay was the friendliness of the staff in particular the lady whom managed our reservation ( Pip ) who was fantastic. The staff do a brilliant job, with no request or question too difficult. Yes, the hotel is beautiful, but the staff are the reason as to why I would return.  I enjoyed it so much, we picked this hotel as the place to stay tomorrow night when we are back in Melbourne.  Outstanding place to stay and cannot recommend it highly enough.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
