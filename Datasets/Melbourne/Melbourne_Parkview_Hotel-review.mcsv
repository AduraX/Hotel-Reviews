review_478382980~“Still excellent, but........”~We recently stayed at this hotel and, once again, found everything to be excellent during our four day stay. My previous review could be rewritten word for word as we experienced top quality at a very reasonable price. We will also return for all future visits to Melbourne (one in just a few months time). Why the four rating this time? My wife left behind an iPad charger cord and, upon calling the hotel later in the day of our departure, was told that housekeeping had found it and put it aside. So far so good. She was then told that the hotel would charge her $15 to return it. We felt that this was very petty, especially as we are regular guests. Surely, a complimentary service would have generated a great deal of good will through this review and by word of mouth. A wasted opportunity. As an addition, to make matters worse, the Australia Post delivery person broke the lock on our letterbox to get the parcel in and we have had to pay a locksmith $99 to replace the lock. However, the hotel is still a great place to stay in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478118841~“Convenient but expensive”~I stayed at the Parkroyal for one night after arriving late into Tullamarine. The location is perfect - I was checked into my room 20 minutes after collecting my luggage. The reception staff were courteous and efficient and my room was allocated prior to my arrival, which sped up the process even more. The room overlooked the airport, which was an unattractive view, but not so important as the room was spacious and very comfortable. In room tea and coffee making facilities were much appreciated. My one criticism of the hotel is that the breakfast option was $30 which I found incredible. However, I would certainly stay there again after another late arrival into Tullamarine.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan

review_477607874~“Easter Weekend Stay 2017”~We arrived at the hotel at about 11 am for a 2 pm booking in, we were expecting to book our car into the car park and go for a walk around the park areas.To our surprise our room was cleaned and ready.This was our first booking at this Hotel and we were told to book direct and save. We were given an upgrade without asking from a large double to a queen. I selected this hotel because of its position -!12 a block between a tram stop 25 -quick access to the tram to Flinders Station and further on . I knew from the booking photos that the hotel used colours of brown and orange and black from the 70s era and had wood in their rooms .  I was pleasantly surprised that the room was comfortable , inviting and easily accessible.  I have to say that though the bathroom was on the small side - the room was set out to get max use of the available space.  The products offered for hair and skin smelt beautiful and my hair was so soft after using them . The shower I must say was comfortable for one person and had the best pressure and heat I have felt in so many hotels that I loved using it.Only problem is that the shower floor was so flat that the water ran out into the floor space in front of the door entry to the bathroom.. The pool,gym and sauna were situated so nicely overlooking the cricket grounds, and had city views.I am not sure if there is wheelchair access to the pool as we had to climb 3 sets of stairs- there might be lift access that is supplied if disabled - I suggest asking the reception before making the booking if you want to use the pool, sauna or gym.. We had buffet breakfast and the fruit was fresh, the breads soft and the coffee very tasty. The service was attentive and the area very clean.  The bed was very comfortable and the room airy , large and overlooking the city and parks. The whole hotel staff were affable and cheery and helpful- old world charm that I enjoyed . I suggest if you want somewhere calm and restful and pleasant -try this hotel it surprised us. Only problem we saw was that the under hotel parking was tight on entry and exit - a large car might have issues but go slow and it should be ok. Try this place if you want a change from the Melbourne central area.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_470422609~“5 Star Service & 5 Star Stay”~From the moment we arrived at reception to check in the professionalism shown by the staff was second to none. The room was more than what we expected it was well presented and very clean with a great view of the city and surrounds. Room service and the quality of food in the restaurant was excellent and again the staff were great. I strongly recommend staying at the Parkview as I know all your needs will be met and surpassed.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_468726821~“Poor services”~At the reception no presentation of services and choices, inability to put the customer comfortable. The restaurant service was very poor from the point of view of the presentation of the menu and service as a whole: long waiting times and lack of details (I had to recover salt and pepper from a nearby table ...). Very dark room with a bad view of a wall of the front building: details that had to be specified at the check in.~2~2~3~2~1~3~2~nan

review_468662301~“graet location and great staff”~Conveniently located, modern clean rooms, good food and great staff. Over the past 20 years when in Melbourne I stay nowhere else. Trams basically outside the front door. And great views of the city and Albert Park Lake~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468661446~“Sleep”~My rating for sleep quality is not a reflection of your hotel, rather that I have sleep apnoea and was unable to travel with my machine. The bed was very soft, and I prefer a harder mattress. The shower was fantastic, great pressure and temperature.~4~4~5~3~4~5~4~nan

review_467415446~“March 17 review”~Hi there,  Third or fourth return weekend stay. Really appreciate the packages available for return customers. We wouldn't be able to return so often without them. Keep it going.  Bar closed at 11pm on a Saturday and breakfast gets very crowded at times were the only real negatives. Will certainly look to book again as a first choice when we can next spend a weekend in the city.~5~5~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_467045948~“Lovely Staff, Average Facilites”~We recently stayed at the Parkview hotel looking forward to relaxing in the Spa and going for a swim in the pool. However, when we got into the spa it was overly hot, and the chemicals were so strong that mine and my partners eyes were both stinging and we had to get out.  The pool was also warm, full of chemicals that left a reaction on my skin and very very shallow. We could only sit in the pool. The staff and room were lovely, however walls are very thin and you can hear everything.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_467023064~“Great room, really quiet, good value,”~Had family in Alfred Hospital, this property was closest to hospital. Pleasantly surprised at how nice it was, spotlessly clean, great facilities except for the pool it was really small. Staff were lovely. Easy tram ride from city.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_466642151~“Lovely hotel for a weekend getaway”~Stayed here for a weekend of catching up with friends. The rooms were spacious and had great facilities and the beds are so comfortable. Our room overlooked the cricket field and high rises. The buffet breakfast caters for everyone and offers a good selection of dishes, and there's a bar for a quick drink before heading out, with a taxi rank right out the front of the hotel, and the tram is right there too. The only downside I had was it is quite tight to get into the underground car park. We have a wagon and its designed for small cars. We would definitely come back for another visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466185216~“Spacious”~I was in town for 2 days at conference at another hotel close by. I had stayed at the Parkview previously a long time ago, and I remembered the feeling of having plenty of room which is why I chose it again. I think this is because of being surrounded by Albert Park, Albert cricket oval and St Kilda Road. I booked online (easy) no fuss check in (I was welcomed back even though I hadn't stayed for a number of years) I was given a $20 meal voucher which I wasn't expecting, a nice surprise. My room didn't have views of the city, but I could see across Albert Park onto Port Phillip Bay which is just as good. The room was big, although the bathroom was small the shower space was big which is great. Massive bed which you melt into. The walls are a little thin, someone yelling next door for a while could be plainly heard. Room service dinner was quick, food was fantastic and great value. Breakfast time was busy but efficient, I was welcomed to sit by name and remarkably thanked by name when I left even though service was busy. Checkout was again no fuss. Would I stay again?.... certainly will, its great value if you wish to stay close to the city without being in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465827090~“Fantastic Staff, Excellent Hotel”~I had two nights at the Parkview Hotel Melbourne.  Check in was very quick and the staff very friendly. I had an excellent room (618) with plenty of space; the room had two double beds but they were closer to a queen in size and the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! You just melted into them. There was also a reasonably large room/area just as you walked in on the right. This is where the bar fridge, closest etc could be found and then off that was the bathroom. The bathroom was ok although certainly not large and really could only fit one person in it at a time. The air conditioning worked perfectly and went to whatever temp you set it at which makes a pleasant change! The only complaint I have with the room was the entrance doors; they were reasonable heavy and you could hear them slamming closed as people came and went. It wasn't their fault as no matter how hard you tried, there was no way of closing them quietly it seemed.  Breakfast at the hotel was very nice with a good choice of hot and cold dishes, juices, fresh fruit, cereals and pastries. The location. It is located on St Kilda road, around 10 mins by tram from the CBD or around a 20 min walk. It is less than five minutes walk from Albert Park, which is perfect if you like to go for some exercise. Although not in the CBD as such, I didn't find the location an issue at all, especially with the tram stop just two minutes walk away. Onsite parking is available for $15 per night. Getting there; A taxi from the CBD will set you back around $20, or around $80 from the airport depending on traffic of course.  Overall the hotel was excellent, the staff in all areas extremely helpful, cheerful and friendly and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Highly recommended!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_465761712~“Close to Alfred HOSPITAL where I went for a weekend course.”~Oldish hotel but room on 8th was well refurbished, it was also Large +++ with separate dressing, luggage area.

review_465487173~“Good value Good position”~We were looking at an alternative to some of the more expensive city hotels and this was certainly an excellent choice. Easy tram ride to the city although suggest you avoid peak times. It was great to go to bed and wake up to sweeping views of the city. My wife who is a very bad sleeper found the bed extremely comfortable. St.Kilda is also very close by as an alternative to the city. We will certainly return.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465211063~“Very comfortable and close to public transport.”~We spent 2 nights at the Parkview Hotel and found the place very comfortable and great value for money. We had a 2 day package deal which included, breakfast, a free car park and $30 a day to spend on drinks at the bar.  The room was clean and the bathroom was big and easy to use with a shower recess. Our room was a double room with two double beds and still had plenty of room to move around. There was a big flat screen TV and the room had complimentary WiFi. You can actually pay an extra $10 per day and get superfast WiFi. The room had the usual stocked fridge with drinks and snacks. Coffee and tea facilities were provided. The hotel is located at tram stop 25 on St Kilda Road and can easily be reached by tram and taxi. It is a little too far from the centre of Melbourne to walk but the tram is readily available every 5 minutes or so. Tram and train travel is not expensive but you need a MYKI card and it is available everywhere for purchase. There is a special MYKI explorer card for visitors which can be purchased at the airport from the Skytrain outlets outside the terminal. Breakfast was excellent with plenty to choose from with the food regularly topped up from the kitchen. One advantage was the food was always hot and enjoyable. ( I have stayed at plenty of hotels where the food is cold.) There is a roof top enclosed swimming pool with a gym area. The smaller pool is heated so you could easily swim in winter. Towels are provided at the pool. The hotel is recommended for family visits to Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan

review_464581436~“First trip to melbourne”~Great location, clean & friendly. Lovely view over the city and crickey oval, tram is out the front, taxi rank also conveniently located out front! We caught a tram straight to the city no problem. A beautiful walk each day, cafes and shops a mild stroll away, but no need to go out for coffee, the coffee here at the Parkview is great, with beautiful fresh muffins...yummy!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464457953~“A great hotel with super friendly and helpful staff”~We were worried when booking a hotel in country and City we had never visited but we shouldn't have been. The Parkview Hotel is very well appointed with everything we needed in the room. It was great to have a separate dressing area, tea and coffee making facilities, a fridge and ironing equipment. We had a corner room with windows to 2 sides with views of the sea and lake. The bed was very comfortable and it was good to have arm chairs and a work desk. The V.large flat screen TV swings out making it ideal for viewing from the bed or sitting area.  The bathroom is great with a spacious walk in shower and lovely toiletries. The only things missing are some drawers and a shower cap would have been handy, but this a minor complaint.  The hotel has a laundry which was very useful and a pool and gym. However the pool is really a big bath, with jacuzzi jets. You can't really swim in it. The views from the top floor over the city are great and it would have been lovely to go outside on a roof terrace.  The staff in the bar (Ryan) and the waiting staff and receptionists were all lovely, friendly and helpful. We were invited to drinks and canapés on Wednesday to meet the manager which was a lovely touch and Laurie made us very welcome. All in all we spent a wonderful week at the Park view. And if we ever get the chance to come to Australia we would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464442420~“loved everything except the spa”~The only thing that detracted from the score was the spa. We were really looking forward to a long relaxing soak in the spa but instead of enjoying it, we felt like we indured it. The temperature was a bit hot(and I like hot) and the amount of chemicals being used in the spa made our eyes sting to the point that we gave up and hopped out. I stayed at your hotel back in November 2016 and this was also the case, i had hoped it was a one off but afraid not.I've used your facility a couple times a year for over 4 years now and I really like it. This is the only complaint I've ever made. Hopefully the spa will get back to enjoyable and relaxing.~4~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_464410155~“An enjoyable stay”~Friendly staff, a good buffet breakfast, clean rooms, good city view & comfortable beds. We appreciated a taxi rank at the front door as the city is very accessible. We would recommend The Parkview as a good place to stay in Melbourne!~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_464407240~“Let Down This Time”~No where near as good as our last visit a couple of years ago, the reception staff seemed disinterested, unsmiling and uncaring which is a big no for me, 1 star down. The room was nice and quiet with a good view up St Kilda road but I found the bed very uncomfortable, perhaps an old mattress. The biggest let down compared to our last visit was breakfast in a word it was DISGRACEFUL, lots of staff buzzing around but not doing anything, salt and pepper shakers empty, no place settings on tables and the Buffet, what can I say. Cold greasy bacon , eggs that were inedible and that's just a start. Loved it on our previous visit but unlikely to return. Staff need to lift there game by 80/90 % or find another job~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_463887754~“Appalling hotel”~It's pretty bad for many reasons so I'm looking at other options for tonight as I barely slept last night.  I've asked them but they said it was booked through Expedia.  Pls let me know as I'll work out a solution from there.  Beds are awful, room dirty and stuffy and the walls are paper thin so I've had some Chinese guy hacking up all night and other things I won't disgust you with.  I'm always conscious of money. Equally conscious for being well slept and on form for a productive day.  If they say you can't then don't worry. I have friends here or can use my own budget.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan

review_461054320~“Good night out.”~Clean, tidy room. Good location. Good website deal with parking, breakfast and vouchers. Easy access to trams or long but enjoyable stroll to city. Nice view of adjoining park and easy parking. Bar closed after show and not much else around in area was only small disappointment.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

review_460828197~“Excellent Hotel”~A great place to launch our 5 day visit to Melbourne. Room was very well prepared, all staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful, the food in-house was very good and the tram stop just outside in St Kilda Road gave us cheap and effective access to the inner city and suburbs as required so we didn't need to consider driving. There is also a taxi rank at the front door which we used once. The Park View was a key factor in a great holiday break.~4~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_460795643~“Convenience”~Easy parking, clean rooms, close to public transport and easy pick up of taxis. Disappointing that restaurant not open later for refreshments e.g. after stage shows etc. Could do with coffee machine e.g."nespresso" or similar.~5~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_460782193~“Clean, well located with obliging staff”~We enjoyed this hotel. The location was good, the room , a city view room was clean and well appointed, the bathroom appeared to,have been done up. Parking was good, well priced and we appreciated the come and go access. The staff were pleasant and obliging.~4~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_460203253~“Perfect”~Great hotel. Always immaculately clean with an amazing breakfast. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Buetiful views of the Melbourne skyline from the northern facing rooms. Very central to the city and suburbs.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460165754~“Friendly Atmosphere”~Stayed for a few days and was greeted with a pleasant smile every time I made any enquiry.  Staff seemed to enjoy working there, which made being anywhere on the premises enjoyable. Perhaps the lifts could do with a facelift but apart from that it was perfect for what we wanted. City views. especially at night, adds to the ambiance. Close to Melbourne and St Kilda, with a tram stop out the front and taxis readily available. Will definitely be staying there again when we travel to Melbourne.~5~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_459797965~“Great views”~We liked the location, close to town however near parks also. We were able to walk to Chapel Street easily. The pool was rather smaller than I expected but it was lovely overlooking the city. The room was great and we enjoyed the breakfast.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_459558377~“20th Anniversary”~We celebrated our 20th Anniversary at The Parkview and were thoroughly surprised by all the added special extras including champagne, chocolates and a beautiful card that we will always keep as a reminder of a lovely night at this beautiful accommodation house. The bed was fantastic, the pillows were perfect and everything was clean. Excellent staff really topped it off. Thanks so much.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_459402473~“Quality from ground up.”~I spent 4 nights at the Parkview as part of a golfing trip, and was impressed by many aspects of its operation. Staff were friendly and welcoming, the room I stayed in was well appointed and clean, I enjoyed the buffet breakfasts I had, and I appreciated the gym facilities (plus the view of the Melbourne skyline that came level that these were on). Location near the Commercial Rd tram stop was convenient for visits into the CBD. There were subtle touches that I did not utilise, such as the wide range of accessory kits in the bathroom for polishing shoes, shaving, etc. however if I was in Melbourne for business in the future these would be very handy. All in all I can only extend my appreciation to the management and staff for making the stay as pleasing as it was, and I look forward to staying there in the future!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_459277281~“Nice place to stay”~Stayed at the Hotel for business booked through Corporate Travel, all hotels I stay at includes meals and drinks. Unfortunately I was still charged for drinks bought before diner at the bar. Not real happy about that.~3~3~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_459048869~“Friendly staff... & clean room..”~The only downside for us was the tight curved entrance/exit to the underground carpark!! But the motel room & staff were great!! Near tram stop too!!! Loverly looking over cricket grounds/tennis courts!! Bar & Restaurant were good!!~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_459038873~“Not as Good As Last Time”~We booked a return package as the last time we stayed it was excellent. However, we were a little disappointed this time. On arrival at 2.00 pm on a Saturday we were given two complimentary drink vouchers. After unpacking we went to the bar to find it closed until 5.00 pm. We then went to a concert and thought we would have a drink afterwards. However at 11.00 pm on a Saturday night the bar was closed. This is obviously a cost cutting measure as the owners don't want to pay wages to bar staff. It is not what I expect from a Hotel of this quality. Also, the breakfast on the Sunday was not as good as last time. The poached eggs were like hard boiled eggs, there was no bacon and you had to put your toast through three times to get a bit of colour. The room was very comfortable and clean and the bed was also comfortable. We will give them another go and I hope that the standard next time,will reflect the first time we stayed their.~4~5~5~5~4~5~3~nan
review_458996222~“Most enjoyable stay at the Parkview Hotel.”~Another most enjoyable stay at the Parkview Hotel. The gymnasium has been updated, the staff are always friendly and professional. The food is great. The coffee shop is ideal for small lunches and coffees if required. Parking on site is a benefit.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_458618974~“Excellent accommodation”~I came for a course being conducted in the hotel's conference facility and stayed for a week. The rooms were clean and very comfortable, with good facilities. The showers in particular are great - very hard to bring yourself to get out of. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfasts in the restaurant are very good, as is the catering if you're using the conference facility. The gym is small, but well equipped for cardio and has a great view. The car park is quite small, and some of the spots are difficult to get to. The in-room wi-fi is also quite slow. Overall, would recommend and stay again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458431083~“Another great stay”~This is my second time staying here and again we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. On arrival we were welcomed back which was nice to hear. The room was perfect and the bed was super comfortable. The buffet breakfast is extensive and delicious. We found all of the staff we interacted with very pleasant. Thanks again. We will be back to explore more of Melbourne.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_457958948~“Safe, friendly and reliable.”~We have had a great stay, the staff are very friendly, helpful and non-intimidating. The hotel even though a little older, is in a great location, with ease of transport access to either the CBD by tram or taxi. Very safe area. The room is fabulous with a great view and a lounge chair for the man while he awaits his wife's transition in the bathroom.The breakfast is great as well as the dinner. This place is reliable, and we will always return.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_457715048~“Would stay again ”~I didn't spend much time at the hotel, as I was attending the Australian Open. However it was. Very comfortable stay and the staff were friendly and helpful. A bit pricey but it's a pricey city! Would stay again~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457264243~“Clean and convient.”~Clean comfortable room, very good breakfast and close to public transport. We have stayed there before and would stay there again. We had to visit the Alfred Hospital and attend a function in the city. so location was perfect.~5~4~5~5~5~4~5~nan
