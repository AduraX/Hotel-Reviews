review_478664036~“Comfortable and convenient ”~I regularly stay here when I work in Melbourne. It's very conveniently located on Collins street to Southern Cross Station, Etihad Stadium and a few blocks to the river and Melbourne ICC, SeaWorld etc  The staff are always friendly, professional and helpful. The hotel is steeped in history and a beautiful old building. Room service food is average and the rooms have all the relevant amenities. Two gripes I have were to have a bath in my room would be an additional $75 per night...ouch!! And there is a $6 charge for delivery of room service.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478454548~“Pleasant hotel”~Nice hotel , clean , and good service. Not a 5 star hotel but certainly clean and good location . The room (535) had no view at all but a comfy king size bed and the hotel was so close to get to Vue du Monde restaurant , which is right next door . The bar was closed 2 times we tried to go in , slightly disappointing , as it looked amazing. We had hamburgers and club sandwiches downstairs in the cafe which were fantastic , really great .  A very nice , fairly basic hotel~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_478427701~“Consistency ”~My last 3 trips I have stayed at the Intercontinental in Melbourne. The accomodation is very comfortable. The rooms are a great size and the amenities are just fantastic. The cocktail bar is first class and would provide one of the best Long Island Teas I have had. The breakfast buffet is of a very high standard. The location is fantastic as it is close to trams and so close to theatres and Southbank.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478361553~“Beautiful property and exceptional service, as always ”~Service, in true intercon style was faultless. The property itself is beautiful and well maintained. My only peeve was the amenities were not what I'm used to in a 5 star property, however all I had to do was ask and I was given what I needed. Great location too AND there's a Haigh's shop right downstairs!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478354246~“Family long weekend”~This was our 1st time to Melbourne (mum, dad & 2 kids 8 & 10) - we had big plans to get out of the city etc....we didn't get that chance as we were totally absorbed in the city and what it has to offer. Transferring to the airport was easy and the drive into the city during peak hour was a breeze compared to driving from Sydney airport to the city in peak hour! The hotel greeting was wonderful and friendly. We arrived at 9.30am and as Ambassador Aspire Elite members were provided with a standard room until our room was available (this room was great for a small family or couple - overlooked the inside of the hotel), we enjoyed breakfast in the Club lounge - where the staff were amazingly accommodating - then we took off to walk and explore the city....We had tickets booked for our first AFL game that night at Etihad stadium....we walked to the stadium which took us about 10mins - too easy with 2 kids!! Loving this city as it just so easy to get around....We were put into a signature suite - The Laneway suite and it was amazing...totally loved the layout - separate courtyard which was great for my 2 kids to hangout in - gave us extra space....The bathroom was awesome! The facilities in this hotel spa/pool/gym were great and were used by all of our family. The breakfast buffet was great - our kids really enjoyed the variety....the Club breakfast was perfect for mum & dad....the afternoon tea in the Club was great and thank you to the staff there for being so friendly and helpful prior and during our stay (Kyriacos & Kishor). This is truly a beautiful hotel - layout of the hotel is awesome. We enjoyed our stay so very much we cannot wait to get another chance to return.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478061373~“Everything can be fixed”~Recently visited the Intercontinental in Collins Street and stayed in a junior suite. Had a mishap in the room and the concierge couldn't have been more helpful. Rhianna offered to move us to another room. They moved all our stuff whilst we were out for the morning and even left us a bottle of champagne and a lovely note. So accomodating and thoughtful. Would recommend the Intercontinental as a centrally located and very well run establishment. Breakfast, whilst not cheap was extensive and delicious.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_477010928~“Nice property, a bit noisy from the restaurant set up”~Stayed over the Easter weekend and had breakfast inclusive. I work in hotels and admired this property when I saw it last time visiting therefore wanted to experience it. Check in was easy and quick. No explanation about hotel facilities apart from breakfast as it was included. Late checkout request of 12pm was accepted with ease. Rooms were nice. Water leaks through the shower door. Door doesn't sit flush with the glass so it quite easily leaks which is annoying as the toilet is right next to it. The right bed side light was flickering and left it on for housekeeping to report it. Came back after service and it was still flickering.  Entering the property and departing greeted by the door man. The concierge with the Les Clef dor keys didn't really acknowledge when returning though which was odd.  Sound proofing of the rooms isn't the best when the lobby is quite big. When they're setting up for breakfast or areas around reception it can be heard from the room. I was on Level 4 room 4.  Had a strange situation with a staff member wanting to enter the room and check for lost property from a previous guest. Assumed they could have done that during the day when it was being serviced by housekeeping.  Breakfast is great and service from the host in the morning was friendly.  Location very efficient and easy to Southern cross train station for the bus that goes to and from the airport. Easy walk to the main areas and casino.  Kind of odd you have to sign up with IHG for free wireless internet. Otherwise you have to pay. Didn't need it though.  Overall enjoyed the hotel.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_476615001~“lovely hotel,great location”~all in all a very good hotel with exceptional service ,however it was tainted by the constant trouble with door keys not working,it happened 4 times in 3 days,and at one time when I rang from a friends room I was told to come down to reception to fix,i also found a set of used headphones on floor behind curtains,so cleaners need to be aware,and pool access is a drama as you need to cross reception from one tower to the next,but as I said I would stay again they just need to tweek a few thngs,~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_476373248~“Great place to stay”~I had a one night stay here whilst training in Melbourne. The king bed was so comfortable and the pillows were the best I've ever slept on. The room was clean, quiet, spacious and perfect for a one night stay. It is in a great position and within walking distance to all the Melbourne sights. I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474920587~“Wonderful Experience”~This a stunningly beautiful hotel visually with retained features from its days as a woolstore! The service thruout our stay could not be faulted. We paid a little bit more and upgraded so that we had access to the Intercontinental Club which I think was well worthwhile. Breakfast in the Club, great coffee, all you need for breakky including a cooked breakfast. Afternoon tea and the drinks and Canapes(hot and cold) for 3 hours every evening- forget dinner! Our room was spacious and clean, the beds were so comfortable and it was quiet. Great in house movie list. I would definitely go back. The only downside is you need to hop on the tram(outside the door) to get to the shopping!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474865593~“Only stayed a night, but was very nice”~My husband and I were only here for one night, so in that short time, we had a very nice stay. The staff were VERY accommodating, and there was plenty of them. My husband arrived early (10am) and was allowed to go in early, which was impressive. The room was comfortable. not huge, but adequate. Beautiful bathroom, no bath in ours. It also is a good halfway distance between Southern Cross station ( where the skybus terminal is) and all of the action of Bourke St Mall. I would stay again.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472259620~“Great value”~Some friends and I visited Alluvial restaurant to have high tea. The in house service was excellent and all our requests were dealt with. However, it was dissapointing that despite calling and confirming via email our bookings had not been combined. They accommodated us sitting together on arrival but this resulted in us being seated as a 4 at a table for 2, which meant the whole experience felt cramped. The wait staff were great and very helpful and we really enjoyed the sparkling, which being free flow is fantastic value.  The food choices are typical of a high tea in Melbourne. It would be good to see the options be a little more inventive but it was all tasty.  I would recommend if you want a classic, good value high tea.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471973511~“Great service and location, but very tired property”~The management and staff were excellent; however the property is quite outdated. We booked a suite room with Club access and were very disappointed in both. They were rather dark and drab, even on sunny days. Our suite had inadequate artificial lighting, keep the room very drab. A few more light fixtures may have helped.    The main concierge staff were excellent. The Club concierge was not helpful. In fact when we checked in at the club level, the person did not even know where I room was located, although she had the room number.  The hotel was centrally located with easy access to public transportation and the river area.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan

I would like to express my gratitude to every team member from the Club Lounge,as the high level of dedication and service is demonstrated. My two daughters had a wonderful time in the Club Lounge. Thank you Kishor Narayanamurthi for making the reservation for my daughters at the Alluvial Restaurant. We had the pleasure to met other team members from the Alluvial Restaurant. This was the most relaxing and welcoming stay that our family had experienced. Once again thank you Kishor Narayanamurthi and your team members for making this experience possible.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471302187~“A great motel for all occasions ”~I stayed here for 2 nights for a work conference and I was very impressed.  On entry the open interior is remarkable as are the entire layouts.

Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469885700~“Great location”~My husband and I recently stayed here for 4 nights, primarily to attend the Adele concert but to also have a short break in Melbourne. What a great location this is - a 5 minute walk to shopping central, and a 10 minute walk to Etihad stadium. There is also tram stop very close, which is part of the free central city tram system. We also walked over to the Southbank one day and this took about 15-20 mins. This hotel was quite pricey, but overall we felt it was worth it. While the building is old and of historical significance, our room was modern and clean. The bed was comfortable and the room had all the amenities you would expect. The shower did not have quite as much pressure as I would like, but was still ok. Staff were pleasant, friendly and accommodating. We had breakfast here one morning from the a la carte menu, which was nice and much more reasonably priced than the buffet breakfast - just depends on how you like to start the day! They were a wee bit slow to bring our breakfast to us, so give yourself plenty of time if you want to order a la carte.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay here very much, and would stay here again. Note that there is some sort of construction going on nearby, but the noise was very muted and did not affect our stay (construction in the daytime only).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469519696~“3 Day Business Trip”~If i was personally paying l would not have paid close to $500 for this hotel. It has a grand appearance as you enter and frankly that's as good as it gets. l had to wait about 15 minutes to check in because the check in person was too busy cracking jokes with a group of about 12 tourists in front of me. When i finally got to her she told me i had to pay and wouldn't believe me when l told her that everything had been paid for as by the email l was showing her, wasted another 10 minutes whilst she verified this with someone.  The room was ok and yes the bathrooms are quite small. During the night i could hear people downstairs in the bar much to my annoyance! The facilities for the conference were pretty alright and we were also served lunch and morning tea through the hotel and the food was quite yummy.  l did go to check out the restaurant but l couldn't justify the prices so went out instead and had a great meal for less than half of what l would have paid at their restaurant,which is the good thing about the location plenty of choices around!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469265661~“Lovely & Quiet”~We had a 2 night stay last week and chose this hotel as it was a nice walk to Etihad Stadium. Lovely room, great pool, lovely staff and our room was so quiet. We heard no noise from the construction next door and our room was really dark at night resulting in a fabulous sleep. We will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469257268~“A wonderful birthday celebration ”~Recently stayed 3 nights, having booked King Club Room. As an IHG Ambassador we were given an upgrade to an amazing suite overlooking Collins St.  The hotel is very stylish and elegant with that true Melbourne 'European feel'. The location is excellent - a quick walk from Southern Cross Station, Southbank and the casino, the east end theatre district and some beautiful shopping. The Club experience was faultless - from checkin to checkout! Kishor and his team are a 'class act'. Kishor ensured that everything was just perfect for my birthday celebration, and whilst all his staff were wonderful, a special thank you must go to Emily who just went the extra mile to add to our enjoyment. We really forward to returning to InterCon Melbourne- soon!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468982017~“Good but great?”~Listed as a 5* hotel it is disappointing in its decor. Small bathroom , no bath, tired carpets and stained hallway carpets. Brown and functional would be my judgement. It was very busy which might partly explain the $400+ per night cost but we have stayed in much nicer hotels at a lower cost. What was included in the cost is the construction noise next door but disappointingly ( this seems std in Australia, who knows why????) the wifi is not. Neither is a complimentary bottle of water in the room. Poor service , I think so. Used the Market Place bar downstairs and again the cost is quite high in a city inundated by bars, just goes to show you need to venture outside the hotel to get most value in your trip. Bar food average.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_468969287~“Calmness descends ”~After a week on the road around northern Victoria and southern New South Wales it was fantastic to arrive at the IHG Melbourne. As soon as you walk through the front doors the calming decor puts your mind at rest. The rooms are modern and comfortable. Loads of quality restaurants on South Bank within walking distance and the tram goes past the front door. Love this place. Worth being a IHG member and receive points for the stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468728175~“Wheezy&OJ”~My daughter and I booked the last room available for the weekend and paid a premium price. It was our second visit to this InterCon hotel. As a member of the loyalty program we expected more. The call to tell us the room was available did not come, the room was not clean and you needed a cushion to sit on the lounge due to the collapsed upholstery in the seat. When I told reception about the poor condition of the room and problem with service, there was a very underwhelming response, and no real apology. 'I'll let housekeeping know.' Not really what I would expect from the InterCon. We have stayed in Hotels in this chain all over the world. Won't rush back to this one.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468693557~“Disappointing and in need of a refit”~Having stayed in all of Melbourne's 5 star hotels, I would say the Intercontinental falls way below the mark. Our 'King Deluxe' room was pretty disappointing, with doors that open onto a balcony overlooking the interior of the hotel that have been permanently fixed closed, giving the feeling of sleeping in a jail cell. The bathroom had no bath, only a shower, with stained grouting and a musty smell and the robes were greying and old. There are much better hotels in Melbourne for the same price (or less) and the Intercontinental fell way short of our expectations.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_468462899~“Wonderful stay.”~Loved our stay at the intercontinental on Friday evening. Everything was wonderful starting with the gentleman at the valet, through to quick and easy check in, where we were given a voucher for 2 glasses of champagne in the wine bar. We stayed in an executive room on the 8th floor (worth the upgrade I believe) as other reviews have stated the rooms on the lower levels being too dark, our room was bathed in sunlight. The bed was very comfortable, the shower water pressure wasn't the best however still acceptable. The room amenities were wonderful. Apart from some early morning construction noise (can't be helped as there is so much construction going on right now in the city) the room was quiet and very comfortable. Location is great. Buffet breakfast was included in our package and was plentiful and tasty. Overall it was a wonderful stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468441993~“Not worth the trouble”~When we have visited Melbourne we have stayed at a lot of very good hotels across the spectrum and our favourites would be split between the Park Hyatt, Langham and the Lyall in South Yarra. This trip I had actually booked a King Club Room at the Park Hyatt but had joined the Intercontinental Ambassador Club so cancelled the booking and instead booked a King Club Junior Suite at the Intercontinental Rialto on Collins St. Ambassador status entitles me to an automatic GUARANTEED upgrade on arrival however we were not afforded this benefit due to lack of availability (note that this is NOT a condition - the upgrade is GUARANTEED). Instead we were offered a $75 food and beverage voucher for use in the hotel. Normally that would be useless as breakfast and evening canapes in the Club Lounge are included in the room rate, but we did make a booking for lunch in the Merchant, so in this case it will be applied. So we did not get an upgrade and on top of that got placed in a first floor Junior Suite facing Collins St and endured traffic noise and people shouting and cars blowing horns all night, making for a very restless night. After missing breakfast because we were so tired I went down and complained and got moved to another Junior Suite that faced inwards, so away from traffic noise and much quieter....BUT....it is a much smaller room and the bathroom doesn't even have hooks to hang towels on. What the??? Get your act together Intercontinental. Don't charge people to belong to an exclusive Ambassador Club and then don't deliver. It would have cost me HALF the rate to stay at Park Hyatt and I would have got a much better room. The Intercontinental Club is pretty ordinary as well compared to the Park Hyatt. Don't think we will be coming back.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_467418277~“Great Hotel, But Disappointing This Time.”~I have stayed at this hotel several times for business and always found the hotel to be very good. However, on this occasion, my room had a problem with water noise that kept me awake on both nights of my stay. After the first night, I asked for the situation to be fixed, but it wasn't resolved. Unfortunately, this impacts on my overall perception and review - if it had been my only experience with this hotel, I would probably never go back. The hotel has been very diligent about follow up my complaint since check out. If I look beyond that one issue, my room had some signs of wear and tear that I would not normally expect of a hotel of this quality, but was spacious and comfortable. It was more that adequate for both business and leisure travellers: easily accessible power points, good quality hairdryer, and good bench space in the bathroom (with a magnifying mirror). Wifi was complimentary (fast and reliable) with my loyalty membership, but free wifi is otherwise limited. The service (reception, concierge, doorman and follow up) are outstanding. The location is excellent - a short walk to the heart of Melbourne and to restaurants. I will return to this hotel - generally, the quality of stay is excellent.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467148809~“Happy with history ”~This hotel has character, it's very laid back it has a calm feel about it, a heritage building that's been transformed into a stunning place to stay. We stayed in a suite which is the older side it was clean, spacious and the staff were attentive and helped with any request that we had. The down side was the cleaning staff yes they do a wonderful job but the front doors are very heavy and while going in an out of empty rooms I was still in mine and the walls just vibrate and the doors slam so hard. If this is all I can complain about that's pretty good, so maybe the cleaners can use a door stopper as some people are there for holidays and like to sleep in.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467063264~“Achieved all expectations”~I had booked an executive king room at the Intercontinental Rialto for a weekend getaway with my girlfriend. Upon checking in at just after 4pm, we were quickly and courteously taken care of via reception before being given keys to our room on the 8th floor (819). Although our room did not face the atrium, we were instead given great views of the Yarra and Crown casino. The room was spacious, well maintained and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the mattress was firm which is what I personally prefer so I had an excellent nights sleep. The rainfall shower faucet in the bathroom was a nice touch, with the shower also including a handheld nozzle for alternative use. The shower was extremely large, and could easily have fit 3 people inside it. In the morning, my girlfriend and I made use of the facilities. The gym was nice, with a beautiful view of the Rialto building and of the Yarra. The pool and spa were fantastic, as was the rooftop garden. Although the view from the rooftop garden wasn't spectacular, it still provided a nice balcony to get some fresh air. Upon asking the doorman for a breakfast spot suggestion, he recommended a place very close by called "Henry and the fox", to which he told me he had recommended to hotel guests before only to be met with great reviews. I was pleased to find that this was true as the eggs benedict I received was one of the nicest I have ever eaten. Additionally that night upon asking a different doorman for an ice-cream suggestion - we were referred to a place just outside the Southbank entrance to Crown Casino, which also proved delicious. Overall our experience was excellent, and I look forward to returning again. My only gripe was lack of free Wifi - however this to me was not a big deal. Depending on the traveler this could prove an inconvenience.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_465954012~“Very unique property!”~Stayed here for a quick trip on business. Hotel is located in a historic property which has been refurbished into a modern hotel. They've done a great job of making the hotel feel very modern and hip while retaining the historic elements. The room size was generous though the shape was a bit elongated probably due to the historic nature of the building. Relatively to Grand Hyatt, Westin, Park Hyatt and Sofitel which I've also stayed at in Melbourne, the Rialto rates the highest (unless you place absolutely need to be in the East end of the city).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465747525~“Worst Intercontinental I've experienced”~This hotel is a disaster, the quality of the rooms are so poor I found myself making my own repairs.  1. Curtains didn't close due to rail - reported it, promised to be repaired, wasnt, after 4 days. 2. Bath wouldn't drain - yes, seriously 3. Lights not working 4. TV system laughably antique 5. Housekeeping terrible - sheets left on table, towels not tidied, tissue box empty. I'd pay a maximum of $200 for this place and it was $400. Staff service was excellent, this is worth pointing out, but the maintenance and upkeep is a disgrace. This hotel is complacent in the extreme.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~5~nan
review_465116508~“Just Not Quite Up to Scratch”~If you believe the marketing then an Intercontinental hotel is about as good as it gets; except that doesn't apply here in Melbourne as well as it does in other genuine articles - the one in KL for example knocks Melbourne into a cocked-hat. That's not to say this is a bad hotel, it isn't, it just doesn't quite hit the mark or warrant the associated price tag: I stayed for a week on business arriving at about 6AM after 20 hours travelling. A bit disappointed to find no valet or concierge on hand to help. Front desk staff were l course efficient and polite and this theme runs throughout a willing team. Unfortunately I had to consistently ask for items to be replaced or replenished in the room and that lack of attention to detail wears after a while. The rooms are well-appointed and tastefully decorated. The hotel is an extremely clever conversion of old warehouses but as a consequence the rooms are a little on the small size. Additionally if you below the top floors there is no light save that filters through the atrium roof. Food is of an excellent quality but breakfast doesn't start until 06:30 and the in-room option is unreliable to the point that on one occasion it didn't arrive at all. Facilities are limited by the location but sadly compromise means that the pool and gym are small and the changing facilities really quite unpleasant.  If you want genuine top-end in Melbourne go elsewhere but, if you can accept that this is not a genuine Intercontinental, stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Just 2 minutes walking to the famous Melbourne tram bringing us to any place in town.

review_463804758~“Well located”~It's not a long way from the airport but the traffic was very bad and it cost 65AUS in a taxi (mid day). Very grand building, not sure how old it is but it has a very nice Georgian feel to it. All the staff were very friendly and service was good. Rooms were very spacious and well maintained. Very well placed for all the nightlife down by the river. Even by Australian standards I found it a little pricey (especially the candy and soda in the mini-bar).~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_463062492~“Great stay”~I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Melbourne and booked to stay on the club level. The room was fantastic and positioned well away from any noise and the club level, while small, was well appointed with great staff. If you stay on the club level you can have breakfast in either the club room or in the main restaurant downstairs. We selected the restaurant because there was a wider offering available... and it was not too busy. This is a nice hotel established in an amazing heritage listed building. Can highly recommend it!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462880135~“Beautiful hotel let down by reception staff ”~Currently staying in room 533 for a few nights with my 7 month old son for work purposes. The hotel is a beautiful building and with a great location on Collins Street. The rooms are nice and I guess what you expect for a 5star hotel with nice bathroom amenities, comfortable bed (more firm than soft) and good thread count sheets (always important). It is a little odd to be facing into the courtyard area so you can see in everyone's room windows but you get used to it.  Unfortunately all the nice things about this hotel is let down by one member of staff at reception. I was checking in at 9pm with a very tired baby (and tired mum) and as I walked up to reception I thought I imagined a look of disdain by the lady at reception but ignored it thinking maybe I'm just tired. When I prompted her by saying I was checking she seemed surprised and whilst not warm and friendly she was efficient.  She then advised that as I booked on a 3rd party website (Expedia) I was required to provide ID. I asked whether it was to be photo ID as I hadn't brought any as I didn't bring my bulky purse as I travel light and efficiently with my son as I don't want to carry too much between him, luggage and a pram. She said yes and if I didn't have any I wouldn't be able to check in. I advised her that I had my business credit card, personal credit card, debit card and my Medicare card for my son and I. I was dismissed with a "you will need to wait over there whilst I call the manager who will make a decision". Not I don't really have an issue with the requirement of the photo ID (despite the fact I stay in a hotel for work every single week for the past 2 years and this was a first for me) I felt embarrassed by the way I was spoken to as if I had done something wrong. I was concerned too that it was now getting late and I would possibly need to try find another hotel (although I would happily have went up to the Sofitel at the top of Collins St where I usually stay and have never been asked for ID) and had a baby who was tired and not really the time of night to be walking about Melbourne with.  The duty manager attended and was at least a friendlier human and allowed me to check in using the ID I did have with me.  So sadly I'm a little shook up by the dismissiveness and what I perceived as rudeness from the initial staff member. She dealt with the situation poorly and came across as arrogant in her manner. I would have taken it personally however I then watched her be rather short to an older lady who's room keys weren't working. No apology, no warmth and she dismissed the women when she had enquired as to checking out this evening in case it was going to be busy the next morning. I use that word dismissed as that's what she came across like. She shouldn't apply her judgementalism to others based on how they look as she may get it very very wrong.  I also have no idea where breakfast is or any other information about the hotel as no one has told me. The room service menu has an icon for vegan options however I only found a fruit salad :-(. I write on a website for parents who travel with children and I'm afraid this hotels fails dismally. I'm sad to say that as I wanted to really like this hotel so I could mix up my stays a bit.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462842712~“$16 for a coffee, club floor not worth it”~The staff throughout this hotel are excellent. Club floor too busy and certainly not worth it. Food overall very average. First time I have ever been charged $16 for a coffee delivered to room when paying $400 a night in a club room. I will not be staying again as I explained on check out - they weren't too bothered....good luck.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462586218~“Excellent Staff – Comfortable room”~Check in went without a hitch, the staff were all very professional and friendly making you feel welcome from the moment you approach the front door. They say the first impression is important, well at the Rialto it starts as you approach the front door with a friendly welcome from the doorman and it stays that way for the entire stay. The room was comfortable and spacious, yes I know that is what you expect at a 5 star hotel, but I have been in other so called 5 star hotels that don’t come anywhere near the standard of the Rialto. The night blind works like a treat, and the bed was so comfortable. A great night’s sleep. The buffet breakfast was very good with a huge selection of hold and cold dishes to choose from and again the staff were very helpful and nothing seemed like too much trouble. Complete with real coffee from a barista who was not only friendly but made great coffee. And if it is a well earned drink at the end of the day then try either the Bluestone Wine Lounge or the Market Lane Bar. I did, tried them both and they have a good selection of wine and beer and reasonably priced. Perfect for the end of a busy day. Great location, close to transport and the Southbank entertainment area. Just a quick walk up Collins Street to the main shopping area or there is a taxi rank right at the front door and a tram stop about 50 meters up the road. Take your pick it couldn’t be easier to get around.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_461335947~“Hmmmm.”~Not sure what they were thinking when they renovated this Hotel, but the rooms are all stuffy now as the windows can't be opened as they now all face in to the middle of the courtyard. You can't have your curtains open for the same reason. Not my favourite.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461323417~“Very Good”~I stayed at InterContinental Melbourne The Rialto in mid February of 2017 for a weekend with my girlfriend and it was a great hotel and everything I expected. Upon arrival, the room was ready early and we were welcomed in a friendly manner. The room was perfect in size for what we needed and bathroom was clean and presentable. The TV worked well and provided us with a range of channels to view. The room was cleaned daily and bathroom towels/mats/shampoo was replenished each time. The entrance to the hotel is spectacular as it showcases every room from levels 1 to 5 which overlook the lobby. I would give this restaurant four and a half stars if I could and the reasoning behind not giving it the extra star is that I personally think it is a little overpriced for what you get. The meals as well were tiny for the price paid ($43 for a tiny chicken breast with broccolini and an extra $6 for the room service). Also, I know that every hotel mini bar in the world is extremely steep in price, however $12 for a mount franklin bottle of water is laughable. The passageway between lifts and rooms were very cold, however this didn't matter as the room temperature was perfect and provided a cozy setting. I would definitely stay at this hotel again except perhaps dine elsewhere. Great stay overall.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460834249~“Comfortable quiet stay excellent locatiom”~The Intercontinental Rialto is an excellent hotel. Room was spacious and quiet. Staff helpful and attentive. The Club lounge is nice offering breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes in a relaxed setting. The location is ideal for trams, trains and shops as well as easy walking distance to the river.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_459801188~“Great luxury hotel in a historical building”~Ours was a weekend stay. We had booked a Junior Suite with club lounge access. Upon check in, we were upgraded to a Senior Suite. Extremely well appointed room with everything except good lighting. As the room was internal facing, it was pretty dark and dingy and there was not enough lighting options. This was especially bad in the bedroom as apart from the 2 down lights directly above the bed, there was nothing other than darkness! Service was attentive and prompt when called upon. Restaurant was great, the food may be a bit pricey but the presentation and quality makes for good value. The club lounge staff were very efficient and helpful and super friendly, and went out of their way to help out with dining and sightseeing suggestions. Check out was a breeze, there was a couple of big errors on our bill but this was sorted right away.  Overall, we were left with a very good impression of the hotel and staff even though there were a couple of minor issues and faults. I guess the speed at which things were fixed up and the efficiency in service more than made up for the imperfections.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459785475~“Beautiful historic house with dated charme”~I had admired The Rialto years ago when I stayed in another hotel across the street. The stylish old building is beautiful and the rooms are spacious, the main hall has an unusual architecture with rooms facing into the courtyard. To our disappointment, our room, advertised as "Garden View" faced a courtyard to a new building, and both the courtyard and the building are currently under construction. Also, the courtyard hardly lets any daylight into the room, so you need to have artificial light on even on the brightest, sunniest day. The service was friendly (especially concierge, valet parking, reception desk at the dining room) but at breakfast, the stations (egg station, setting up tables to prepare for newly arrived guests, bringing coffee and clearing tables) are obviously understaffed. The carpets in the hallways off the rooms were not clean on our first day, and only on our last day (of 5) were they cleaned. While the hotel certainly has charme ( especially the architecture) and is ideally located both for sightseeing and business on Collins Street in the CBD, it lagged behind what I imagined this expensive 5 star hotel to be when I first saw it from across the street~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459519602~“Welcoming with nicely appointed rooms”~Enjoyed my stay at the intercon couldnt fault anything - rooms a good size nice and modern- beautifully comfortable bed. Good location in the city. Didn't eat at the hotel as so many places around to eat at. Love the fragrance in the foyer which is pumped through the air con on check out when I commented they were nice enough to look it up on line so I could purchase the same for home.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458628416~“Valentines weekend gone wrong”~Check in for this hotel is 3pm, which is an hour later than most hotels. My partner and I arrived at 4:10 to check in. We were told that our room was not ready and that we had to wait. After standing around for about 20 minutes, holding our bags because no one actually ever approached us to take our bags for us, the manager came out, did something for another 5 minutes and checked us into a room that was not vacuumed. We called and requested for a room change. 30 minutes later, we were moved to another room that was just as ordinary. The whole stay was ordinary. When I pulled back the sheets and checked the bed, there were hairs found on the mattress. Oh, for crying out loud! Is this supposed to be a 5 star hotel? I didn't bother calling reception again as I'd already seen two rooms and they were just as bad as each other. I was so disappointed. This was supposed to be a romantic weekend and it just got off to such a bad start.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458530463~“Wow Wow Wow”~What an amazing hotel. Intercontinental have managed to create the perfect union of old world charm and modern convenience. The lobby/atrium that incorporates the facades of the old wool store is absolutely stunning and could be admired for hours.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and what they lack in natural light they more than make up for with views of the atrium. The breakfast menu is both reasonably priced and delicious. Front of house went out of their way to help us and offer advice on local restaurants and activities. Our only criticism all be it a minor one was the tardiness of housekeeping. It was frustrating to return to our room late afternoon 2 days in a row, in need of a shower and nap to find that the room had not yet been serviced. This was only a minor issue and wouldn't put us off returning to this beautiful hotel.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_456564679~“A wonderful, luxurious stay”~We found the staff to be super friendly and helpful here. We had booked for a special birthday celebration and stayed in a lovely room.

review_452922673~“Faultless, Five Star Service ”~We had a wonderful experience staying at the Intercontinental Melbourne The Rialto. We arrived at the hotel around 10:30am after our flight from Sydney, eager to drop our bags off and get a late breakfast before returning to our rooms in the afternoon. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that our rooms, both King Club, were ready! This was simply unheard of, and we were so delighted to have early access to our rooms to unwind after our flight.  The rooms are well laid-out and have all the comforts you come to expect from the Intercontinental. Whilst the room itself was more classic than modern, the large size and space (41sqm) of the room definitely made up for the lack of ultra-modern furnishings. Also, we found the bed to be exceptionally comfy and provided a consistently good night's sleep over the duration of our stay.  The hotel itself is located in a historic and nicely preserved gothic style building and our room provided a nice view into the large 10 storey atrium where the facade is illuminated at night.  The club lounge was bar far the highlight of our stay and I would highly recommend a club access room. The full buffet breakfast (from the lounge or downstairs restaurant), afternoon high tea and evening drinks and canapés were simply divine and the friendly and professional service continued to make a pleasant and highly enjoyable stay. There was a wonderful range provided and the food selection on offered changed daily.  We loved using the glass-roofed pool and spa that provided great CBD views. The convenient Collins St location also ensured that were were within walking distance to all the major CBD attractions.  We will definitely be back!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452728583~“Excellent city centre location ”~First visit to Melbourne, this hotel is a perfect base, central location and such good value for money. The breakfasts are wonderful, staff are helpful and so friendly. Rooms spacious (junior suite), highly recommended~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452313754~“Convenient and comfortable”~Im not that old, but I can remember when the building that houses this lovely hotel was abandoned warehousing either side of a bluestone laneway that lead to the Yarra river. Now, of course, it is an interesting and tastefully refurbished building that retains some of that heritage while being very comfortable and convenient accommodation in the heart of Melbourne. The staff and services and food are also very good as you would expect from an IC. All of the rooms I have stayed in have been generously proportioned and very comfortable but all slightly different configurations due to the obvious reconfiguration of the space from its original purpose. To my mind it adds interest and makes a nice diversion from the usual repetition of rooms and furnishing you find in many hotels. Despite being in the CBD I have found it to be a quiet and restful location with access to the best Melbourne has to offer once you step out the front door. Because of the style of building dont expect grand views of Melbourne but that would be the only caveat I would mention to potential guests. Otherwise there is very little not to enjoy.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_452250055~“World class”~Check in is from 3pm so you would expect things to be quiet and staff attentive. They were very welcoming. We walked from Southern Cross Station, the old Spencer Street. We had been here for our 25th wedding anniversary and now it was our 40th. That was worth mentioning because we were complimented with a free drink each in the Bluestone Bar. At an early 4:30 I’m sure the barman appreciated some real work with just a half dozen of us there. Peroni on tap was a refreshing idea. Walk around and you’ll see a few interesting art works, maybe a silver octopus or a bull, appropriately outside the Market Bar. Currently a set of portraits by Vincent Fantauzzo, Asher Keddie’s partner, are on display. We were allotted a suite on the 6th floor and although our balcony was locked for safety reasons, I did achieve access via a door near the lifts. From there you can see the originally facade of the building which would have had a laneway running through the hub. As such it’s hard to define the hotel as either modern or classic. It’s got both. It’s not budget but for what is on offer I say it represents fair value. Our room and bed were spacious, with a little chaise long to watch TV and a chair and desk to write up some notes. Mirrors are a big feature for my lady and the excellent large, swivelling contraption in the bathroom received praise. I stood outside the bathroom and used the big mirror on the door to do up my tie etc.  The mini-bar was heavily stocked and heavily priced but we were off for a night on the town so it held so sway. Breakfast is not cheap but there are plenty of budget offerings nearby. The Australian Open Tennis started on the day of our departure so while things were busier we never felt rushed. If we last another ten years I shall happily return.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_451609681~“Nice hotel, great location and staff, missing the mark”~I wanted to stay in this hotel because my mother worked there in the 1920s, and I was being a little sentimental. The check in staff were lovely, and the room very comfortable. It was very conveniently located, but there was something missing. There was no inviting lounge or cafe into which I could invite a guest for a coffee and snack in the afternoon (or any time of day, actually). The cavernous restaurant and bar area are cold and uninviting, although very stylish. Probably the concierge area had what I was looking for but a hotel of this standard should have a more welcoming entertaining area.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_451216172~“Tired hotel”~Having stayed at several Intercontinental Hotels I was disappointed with the Rialto. Had paid extra for a club room, which was gloomy. The room was large but there was no armchair in it. When I requested an armchair, an office chair was provided. The carpet in the corridor outside our room was very stained and in need of repair. The Club facilities (breakfast and evening canapés) were ok but not outstanding. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. However, due to the general state of this hotel I would not stay here again.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan

The restaurant and bar were fabulous and services again was outstanding even to the conqac presentation brilliant.The only flaws that I incounted were that when approaching the head concierge and asking for restaurants to dine and for shopping for suits I was quickly directed to a map pointed towards the front door. Apon a very early check out I had requested a boxed breakfast which never arrived, besides from these two flaws it was a very memorable experience. Will definitely be back in the future.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450038093~“Worst high tea and restaurant experience I've ever had at a hotel.”~I had booked a high tea at this hotel and received confirmation via email and text. I had also called to ensure the booking was made and informed them of two special dietary requirements. When we turned up, they had no idea about us, then told us that it was fine and they actually did know about our booking and the dietary requirements. We gave them a chance to let us go elsewhere as the dietary requirements would have needed some preparation. Instead we were kept waiting for 45 mins. I had a drink spilt on me and when the high tea turned up it was embarrassingly poor. Definitely not $65 worth. Then we asked to speak to the restaurant manager, we were kept waiting another 20 minutes while he was "doing paper work". His only response about the high tea, was that he agreed it was not good. Given that one of our party was pregnant also, it was completely unacceptable customer service and food. Completely ruined our day out.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_449491087~“Very average - nothing to shout about”~We stayed 4 nights over New Year's eve weekend. Rooms do not have a view and blinds have to kept shut to at all times as it overlooks other rooms. Our room was modern, spacious and clean. Do not expect a full suite of amenities though (eg. no bedroom slippers). Service is ok but not 5-star. Breakfast spread was basic, nothing to shout about - best to spend the money on cafes nearby instead. Hotel charges a surcharge for paying with credit cards (up to 3%) - bizarre for a supposedly luxury hotel. Feels like the hotel is trying to skimp and cut costs where possible (turn-down service on request only, amenities/newspaper has to be specifically asked for etc). Water pressure is weak. I reckon it is worth paying a bit more for a much better service and value-for-money at The Westin Melbourne instead.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan

Room was ok size, comfy bed, good bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. Good gym and pool (although really hot in humid weather). Only down sides are windows faced inside which means curtains had to be drawn at all times and it could have been a little cleaner. Would still recommend.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_478354246~“Family long weekend”~This was our 1st time to Melbourne (mum, dad & 2 kids 8 & 10) - we had big plans to get out of the city etc....we didn't get that chance as we were totally absorbed in the city and what it has to offer. Transferring to the airport was easy and the drive into the city during peak hour was a breeze compared to driving from Sydney airport to the city in peak hour! The hotel greeting was wonderful and friendly. We arrived at 9.30am and as Ambassador Aspire Elite members were provided with a standard room until our room was available (this room was great for a small family or couple - overlooked the inside of the hotel), we enjoyed breakfast in the Club lounge - where the staff were amazingly accommodating - then we took off to walk and explore the city....We had tickets booked for our first AFL game that night at Etihad stadium....we walked to the stadium which took us about 10mins - too easy with 2 kids!! Loving this city as it just so easy to get around....We were put into a signature suite - The Laneway suite and it was amazing...totally loved the layout - separate courtyard which was great for my 2 kids to hangout in - gave us extra space....The bathroom was awesome! The facilities in this hotel spa/pool/gym were great and were used by all of our family. The breakfast buffet was great - our kids really enjoyed the variety....the Club breakfast was perfect for mum & dad....the afternoon tea in the Club was great and thank you to the staff there for being so friendly and helpful prior and during our stay (Kyriacos & Kishor). This is truly a beautiful hotel - layout of the hotel is awesome. We enjoyed our stay so very much we cannot wait to get another chance to return.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

Had a mishap in the room and the concierge couldn't have been more helpful. Rhianna offered to move us to another room. They moved all our stuff whilst we were out for the morning and even left us a bottle of champagne and a lovely note. So accomodating and thoughtful.

review_477010928~“Nice property, a bit noisy from the restaurant set up”~Stayed over the Easter weekend and had breakfast inclusive. I work in hotels and admired this property when I saw it last time visiting therefore wanted to experience it. Check in was easy and quick. No explanation about hotel facilities apart from breakfast as it was included. Late checkout request of 12pm was accepted with ease. Rooms were nice. Water leaks through the shower door. Door doesn't sit flush with the glass so it quite easily leaks which is annoying as the toilet is right next to it. The right bed side light was flickering and left it on for housekeeping to report it. Came back after service and it was still flickering.  Entering the property and departing greeted by the door man. The concierge with the Les Clef dor keys didn't really acknowledge when returning though which was odd.  Sound proofing of the rooms isn't the best when the lobby is quite big. When they're setting up for breakfast or areas around reception it can be heard from the room. I was on Level 4 room 4.  Had a strange situation with a staff member wanting to enter the room and check for lost property from a previous guest. Assumed they could have done that during the day when it was being serviced by housekeeping.  Breakfast is great and service from the host in the morning was friendly.  Location very efficient and easy to Southern cross train station for the bus that goes to and from the airport. Easy walk to the main areas and casino.  Kind of odd you have to sign up with IHG for free wireless internet. Otherwise you have to pay. Didn't need it though.  Overall enjoyed the hotel.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

Located in the heart of the CBD, it is a short walk to shops, the Casino and other attractions and a short taxi or tram ride to everywhere else (cab rank is at the door) I have stayed at this hotel more than 30 times, the staff are excellent and the hotel amenities are first class, breakfast, the rooms and facilities are world class. The concierge service is superb and the staff always greet you, which means that management is top notch. Probably the only downside is if you drive your car they have to park it elsewhere, so the tip is ask for your car early so you don't have to wait if your are going somewhere in a rush.  I highly recommend this hotel to you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474920587~“Wonderful Experience”~This a stunningly beautiful hotel visually with retained features from its days as a woolstore! The service thruout our stay could not be faulted. We paid a little bit more and upgraded so that we had access to the Intercontinental Club which I think was well worthwhile. Breakfast in the Club, great coffee, all you need for breakky including a cooked breakfast. Afternoon tea and the drinks and Canapes(hot and cold) for 3 hours every evening- forget dinner! Our room was spacious and clean, the beds were so comfortable and it was quiet. Great in house movie list. I would definitely go back. The only downside is you need to hop on the tram(outside the door) to get to the shopping!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474865593~“Only stayed a night, but was very nice”~My husband and I were only here for one night, so in that short time, we had a very nice stay. The staff were VERY accommodating, and there was plenty of them. My husband arrived early (10am) and was allowed to go in early, which was impressive. The room was comfortable. not huge, but adequate. Beautiful bathroom, no bath in ours. It also is a good halfway distance between Southern Cross station ( where the skybus terminal is) and all of the action of Bourke St Mall. I would stay again.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474570234~“Consistently excellent - Intercontinental should be proud”~I stay at the Intercontinental/ Rialto Melbourne every month on business ... probably 25-30 times now, so i feel at home when I arrive. This is a delightful, historic, and character-filled hotel in the heart of the Melbourne CBD. It's an older hotel, but it has been renovated and maintained to the highest standards. In all my stays there have only been one or two occurrences of very minor things not working (such a a bulb out, etc). Importantly, it's big enough to have all the facilities, pool, gym, choice or bars and restaurants, but not too big to lose the personal touch. The hotel exudes charm and intimacy. I contrast this to the likes of Crown Towers or the Metropol where it's a volume business.  The basic rooms are fine in terms of space and don't feel at all cramped, but go for a Suite or Junior suite if you can as they are very spacious! The Rialto is consistently excellent, always immaculately clean, and the staff are all very professional and customer service focused. Kudos to the management and staff as this is a hotel the Intercontinental Brand should be very proud of!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474005943~“Awesome bed, great for business”~Having lived in Melbourne in my earlier years I never had a reason to stay at this historic hotel. I'm glad I did on this occasion as I discovered a well appointed business suitable hotel. Most impressive was the wonderfully comfortable bed that afforded me a perfect nights rest. The bathroom may not be that of the Hyatt or Westin, but it still met all my needs and then some given the rain shower. The breakfast was reasonable, service impeccable and the ambience in keeping with expectations. I'd not hesitate to stay again !!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473819495~“Service was outstanding ”~Booked a room for my wife and I for our anniversary and they upgraded us to their best room just because it was available!

review_473435604~“really amazing place to stay”~I stayed her with my wife for 4 nights. It is really a very good hotel. The location is excellent and very central, it is easy to get around as it is in the free tram zone. The rooms were excellent and the staff very helpful. I have to give a special mention to Thomas who remembered our names and took time to ask us every day how our day went, a true gent.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_472552411~“Poor service and bad management, disappointing stay”~I booked a room at the hotel. I was provided an upgrade that was part of my benefit as a paid Platinum Ambassador member. When I arrived the upgrade that was represented ted on my reservation through the mobile app and the web page were not honored. The front desk management could give a care about the discrepancy. I would highly recommend checking in with this hotel before you visit. The descriptions provided for the different room categories are not accurate and the management at the hotel does not care to remedy.~1~2~5~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_471973511~“Great service and location, but very tired property”~The management and staff were excellent; however the property is quite outdated. We booked a suite room with Club access and were very disappointed in both. They were rather dark and drab, even on sunny days. Our suite had inadequate artificial lighting, keep the room very drab. A few more light fixtures may have helped.    The main concierge staff were excellent. The Club concierge was not helpful. In fact when we checked in at the club level, the person did not even know where I room was located, although she had the room number.  The hotel was centrally located with easy access to public transportation and the river area.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_471770502~“" Our Family Special Place"”~During our stay,we had a wonderful and relaxing 3 days. I would like to express my gratitude to every team member from the Club Lounge,as the high level of dedication and service is demonstrated. My two daughters had a wonderful time in the Club Lounge. Thank you Kishor Narayanamurthi for making the reservation for my daughters at the Alluvial Restaurant. We had the pleasure to met other team members from the Alluvial Restaurant. This was the most relaxing and welcoming stay that our family had experienced. Once again thank you Kishor Narayanamurthi and your team members for making this experience possible.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468728175~“Wheezy&OJ”~My daughter and I booked the last room available for the weekend and paid a premium price. It was our second visit to this InterCon hotel. As a member of the loyalty program we expected more. The call to tell us the room was available did not come, the room was not clean and you needed a cushion to sit on the lounge due to the collapsed upholstery in the seat. When I told reception about the poor condition of the room and problem with service, there was a very underwhelming response, and no real apology. 'I'll let housekeeping know.' Not really what I would expect from the InterCon. We have stayed in Hotels in this chain all over the world. Won't rush back to this one.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468693557~“Disappointing and in need of a refit”~Having stayed in all of Melbourne's 5 star hotels, I would say the Intercontinental falls way below the mark. Our 'King Deluxe' room was pretty disappointing, with doors that open onto a balcony overlooking the interior of the hotel that have been permanently fixed closed, giving the feeling of sleeping in a jail cell. The bathroom had no bath, only a shower, with stained grouting and a musty smell and the robes were greying and old. There are much better hotels in Melbourne for the same price (or less) and the Intercontinental fell way short of our expectations.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_468462899~“Wonderful stay.”~Loved our stay at the intercontinental on Friday evening. Everything was wonderful starting with the gentleman at the valet, through to quick and easy check in, where we were given a voucher for 2 glasses of champagne in the wine bar. We stayed in an executive room on the 8th floor (worth the upgrade I believe) as other reviews have stated the rooms on the lower levels being too dark, our room was bathed in sunlight. The bed was very comfortable, the shower water pressure wasn't the best however still acceptable. The room amenities were wonderful. Apart from some early morning construction noise (can't be helped as there is so much construction going on right now in the city) the room was quiet and very comfortable. Location is great. Buffet breakfast was included in our package and was plentiful and tasty. Overall it was a wonderful stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468441993~“Not worth the trouble”~When we have visited Melbourne we have stayed at a lot of very good hotels across the spectrum and our favourites would be split between the Park Hyatt, Langham and the Lyall in South Yarra. This trip I had actually booked a King Club Room at the Park Hyatt but had joined the Intercontinental Ambassador Club so cancelled the booking and instead booked a King Club Junior Suite at the Intercontinental Rialto on Collins St. Ambassador status entitles me to an automatic GUARANTEED upgrade on arrival however we were not afforded this benefit due to lack of availability (note that this is NOT a condition - the upgrade is GUARANTEED). Instead we were offered a $75 food and beverage voucher for use in the hotel. Normally that would be useless as breakfast and evening canapes in the Club Lounge are included in the room rate, but we did make a booking for lunch in the Merchant, so in this case it will be applied. So we did not get an upgrade and on top of that got placed in a first floor Junior Suite facing Collins St and endured traffic noise and people shouting and cars blowing horns all night, making for a very restless night. After missing breakfast because we were so tired I went down and complained and got moved to another Junior Suite that faced inwards, so away from traffic noise and much quieter....BUT....it is a much smaller room and the bathroom doesn't even have hooks to hang towels on. What the??? Get your act together Intercontinental. Don't charge people to belong to an exclusive Ambassador Club and then don't deliver. It would have cost me HALF the rate to stay at Park Hyatt and I would have got a much better room. The Intercontinental Club is pretty ordinary as well compared to the Park Hyatt. Don't think we will be coming back.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_467418277~“Great Hotel, But Disappointing This Time.”~I have stayed at this hotel several times for business and always found the hotel to be very good. However, on this occasion, my room had a problem with water noise that kept me awake on both nights of my stay. After the first night, I asked for the situation to be fixed, but it wasn't resolved. Unfortunately, this impacts on my overall perception and review - if it had been my only experience with this hotel, I would probably never go back. The hotel has been very diligent about follow up my complaint since check out. If I look beyond that one issue, my room had some signs of wear and tear that I would not normally expect of a hotel of this quality, but was spacious and comfortable. It was more that adequate for both business and leisure travellers: easily accessible power points, good quality hairdryer, and good bench space in the bathroom (with a magnifying mirror). Wifi was complimentary (fast and reliable) with my loyalty membership, but free wifi is otherwise limited. The service (reception, concierge, doorman and follow up) are outstanding. The location is excellent - a short walk to the heart of Melbourne and to restaurants. I will return to this hotel - generally, the quality of stay is excellent.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467148809~“Happy with history ”~This hotel has character, it's very laid back it has a calm feel about it, a heritage building that's been transformed into a stunning place to stay. We stayed in a suite which is the older side it was clean, spacious and the staff were attentive and helped with any request that we had. The down side was the cleaning staff yes they do a wonderful job but the front doors are very heavy and while going in an out of empty rooms I was still in mine and the walls just vibrate and the doors slam so hard. If this is all I can complain about that's pretty good, so maybe the cleaners can use a door stopper as some people are there for holidays and like to sleep in.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467063264~“Achieved all expectations”~I had booked an executive king room at the Intercontinental Rialto for a weekend getaway with my girlfriend. Upon checking in at just after 4pm, we were quickly and courteously taken care of via reception before being given keys to our room on the 8th floor (819). Although our room did not face the atrium, we were instead given great views of the Yarra and Crown casino. The room was spacious, well maintained and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the mattress was firm which is what I personally prefer so I had an excellent nights sleep. The rainfall shower faucet in the bathroom was a nice touch, with the shower also including a handheld nozzle for alternative use. The shower was extremely large, and could easily have fit 3 people inside it. In the morning, my girlfriend and I made use of the facilities. The gym was nice, with a beautiful view of the Rialto building and of the Yarra. The pool and spa were fantastic, as was the rooftop garden. Although the view from the rooftop garden wasn't spectacular, it still provided a nice balcony to get some fresh air. Upon asking the doorman for a breakfast spot suggestion, he recommended a place very close by called "Henry and the fox", to which he told me he had recommended to hotel guests before only to be met with great reviews. I was pleased to find that this was true as the eggs benedict I received was one of the nicest I have ever eaten. Additionally that night upon asking a different doorman for an ice-cream suggestion - we were referred to a place just outside the Southbank entrance to Crown Casino, which also proved delicious. Overall our experience was excellent, and I look forward to returning again. My only gripe was lack of free Wifi - however this to me was not a big deal. Depending on the traveler this could prove an inconvenience.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466470277~“Hotel stay ”~Loved our stay. Service impeccable. Room was less luxurious than I was expecting for the price. But that said, the best bed and pillows.  Very central and top location. Close to everything. Would definitely stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466423020~“Disappointed ”~Is this 5 star??? I think not....that's not to say that the staff were not lovely but the hotel itself left a lot to be desired.....to start with the balcony door do not open so basically no windows to open no balcony to open.....you look at the doors and say why....the room set up is a bit weird and if you're in the bed on the right you'll struggle to see the tv....the bathroom was lovely but could probably do with a freshen up,I wouldn't say it's a 5 star bathroom....location is good but I've stayed in 4 star around cbd and I have to admit I've stayed in 4 star that were a lot nicer than here~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465954012~“Very unique property!”~Stayed here for a quick trip on business. Hotel is located in a historic property which has been refurbished into a modern hotel. They've done a great job of making the hotel feel very modern and hip while retaining the historic elements. The room size was generous though the shape was a bit elongated probably due to the historic nature of the building. Relatively to Grand Hyatt, Westin, Park Hyatt and Sofitel which I've also stayed at in Melbourne, the Rialto rates the highest (unless you place absolutely need to be in the East end of the city).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465747525~“Worst Intercontinental I've experienced”~This hotel is a disaster, the quality of the rooms are so poor I found myself making my own repairs.  1. Curtains didn't close due to rail - reported it, promised to be repaired, wasnt, after 4 days. 2. Bath wouldn't drain - yes, seriously 3. Lights not working 4. TV system laughably antique 5. Housekeeping terrible - sheets left on table, towels not tidied, tissue box empty. I'd pay a maximum of $200 for this place and it was $400. Staff service was excellent, this is worth pointing out, but the maintenance and upkeep is a disgrace. This hotel is complacent in the extreme.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~5~nan
review_465116508~“Just Not Quite Up to Scratch”~If you believe the marketing then an Intercontinental hotel is about as good as it gets; except that doesn't apply here in Melbourne as well as it does in other genuine articles - the one in KL for example knocks Melbourne into a cocked-hat. That's not to say this is a bad hotel, it isn't, it just doesn't quite hit the mark or warrant the associated price tag: I stayed for a week on business arriving at about 6AM after 20 hours travelling. A bit disappointed to find no valet or concierge on hand to help. Front desk staff were l course efficient and polite and this theme runs throughout a willing team. Unfortunately I had to consistently ask for items to be replaced or replenished in the room and that lack of attention to detail wears after a while. The rooms are well-appointed and tastefully decorated. The hotel is an extremely clever conversion of old warehouses but as a consequence the rooms are a little on the small size. Additionally if you below the top floors there is no light save that filters through the atrium roof. Food is of an excellent quality but breakfast doesn't start until 06:30 and the in-room option is unreliable to the point that on one occasion it didn't arrive at all. Facilities are limited by the location but sadly compromise means that the pool and gym are small and the changing facilities really quite unpleasant.  If you want genuine top-end in Melbourne go elsewhere but, if you can accept that this is not a genuine Intercontinental, stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464875083~“Intercontinental Rialto our preferred choice in Melbourne”~We came back for a second visit to Melbourne and have choosen the Intercontinental Rialto again because the location is excellent. Just 2 minutes walking to the famous Melbourne tram bringing us to any place in town.  We had a junior suite with club lounge access and Mr. Kishor Narayanamurthi, Director of the club lounge personally took care about us. The service provided by him and his team was very much appreciated. Many thanks to Mr. Kishor and his team.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463902819~“Nice hotel, but lots of noise”~Stayed for one night. The hotel and room itself are excellent, however I was disturbed by noise (it was a Friday night) and on Saturday morning I was woken up by some sort of drilling / construction work. Service was professional, but I didn't feel it was anything extraordinary.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463804758~“Well located”~It's not a long way from the airport but the traffic was very bad and it cost 65AUS in a taxi (mid day). Very grand building, not sure how old it is but it has a very nice Georgian feel to it. All the staff were very friendly and service was good. Rooms were very spacious and well maintained. Very well placed for all the nightlife down by the river. Even by Australian standards I found it a little pricey (especially the candy and soda in the mini-bar).~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan

The service, staff and quality of food is always on point here at the InterContinental Melbourne. Kishor and his team has provided me with the very best service Melbourne has to offer for quite some time now. Not only is the hotel beautiful and unique, the service that goes with It Is outstanding and this hotel will always get my business.

review_463062492~“Great stay”~I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Melbourne and booked to stay on the club level. The room was fantastic and positioned well away from any noise and the club level, while small, was well appointed with great staff. If you stay on the club level you can have breakfast in either the club room or in the main restaurant downstairs. We selected the restaurant because there was a wider offering available... and it was not too busy. This is a nice hotel established in an amazing heritage listed building. Can highly recommend it!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462880135~“Beautiful hotel let down by reception staff ”~Currently staying in room 533 for a few nights with my 7 month old son for work purposes. The hotel is a beautiful building and with a great location on Collins Street. The rooms are nice and I guess what you expect for a 5star hotel with nice bathroom amenities, comfortable bed (more firm than soft) and good thread count sheets (always important). It is a little odd to be facing into the courtyard area so you can see in everyone's room windows but you get used to it.  Unfortunately all the nice things about this hotel is let down by one member of staff at reception. I was checking in at 9pm with a very tired baby (and tired mum) and as I walked up to reception I thought I imagined a look of disdain by the lady at reception but ignored it thinking maybe I'm just tired. When I prompted her by saying I was checking she seemed surprised and whilst not warm and friendly she was efficient.  She then advised that as I booked on a 3rd party website (Expedia) I was required to provide ID. I asked whether it was to be photo ID as I hadn't brought any as I didn't bring my bulky purse as I travel light and efficiently with my son as I don't want to carry too much between him, luggage and a pram. She said yes and if I didn't have any I wouldn't be able to check in. I advised her that I had my business credit card, personal credit card, debit card and my Medicare card for my son and I. I was dismissed with a "you will need to wait over there whilst I call the manager who will make a decision". Not I don't really have an issue with the requirement of the photo ID (despite the fact I stay in a hotel for work every single week for the past 2 years and this was a first for me) I felt embarrassed by the way I was spoken to as if I had done something wrong. I was concerned too that it was now getting late and I would possibly need to try find another hotel (although I would happily have went up to the Sofitel at the top of Collins St where I usually stay and have never been asked for ID) and had a baby who was tired and not really the time of night to be walking about Melbourne with.  The duty manager attended and was at least a friendlier human and allowed me to check in using the ID I did have with me.  So sadly I'm a little shook up by the dismissiveness and what I perceived as rudeness from the initial staff member. She dealt with the situation poorly and came across as arrogant in her manner. I would have taken it personally however I then watched her be rather short to an older lady who's room keys weren't working. No apology, no warmth and she dismissed the women when she had enquired as to checking out this evening in case it was going to be busy the next morning. I use that word dismissed as that's what she came across like. She shouldn't apply her judgementalism to others based on how they look as she may get it very very wrong.  I also have no idea where breakfast is or any other information about the hotel as no one has told me. The room service menu has an icon for vegan options however I only found a fruit salad :-(. I write on a website for parents who travel with children and I'm afraid this hotels fails dismally. I'm sad to say that as I wanted to really like this hotel so I could mix up my stays a bit.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462842712~“$16 for a coffee, club floor not worth it”~The staff throughout this hotel are excellent. Club floor too busy and certainly not worth it. Food overall very average.
