review_479013394~“Anniversary stay”~I chose the new Four Points by Sheraton for our 25th anniversary, I must say we were not disappointed, we arrived and were greeted by both concierge and reception welcoming us to the hotel. Check in was smooth, pleasant and smart. Given out keys explained the hotel and where our room was. Upon entering our room, ( still smell the fresh paint and linen, as the hotel has been open for only 3 weeks we were not disappointed, the view of Melbourne Star was amazing, however sitting on the desk was a plate of delicious pettifor's with the word Happy 25th anniversary written in chocolate. Lovely.  We had a table booked for dinner after a cocktail in the bar we moved to the restaurant with our friends, Paulina, our waitress took our order and left us to talk, she appeared now and then topped our water glasses up, brought the cutlery for entrees all without being intrusive, a great member of staff. Each course arrived in due time and each time our party gasp and awed as the meals were placed in front of their respective guest. All the dishes were presented in a way they inspired visual eyeing. Each dish was flavorful, as were the accompaniments that we ordered. The food equals some of the high end restaurants and hotels that we have eaten in and stayed at, well done the chef and his team.  Overall I would suggest that, even if you are not staying visit the restaurant for dinner, I don't think your will be disappointed by the experience. The photos attached really don't do justice to the food. You really need to see and taste for yourself. Thank you Four Points for making our 25th anniversary a memorable one.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478758099~“Weekend Getaway”~Brand new property with friendly relaxed service. Our room was very quiet on a higher floor with great views. Location is very convenient with multiple trams outside the front door or a nice walk along Docklands into the city.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478698225~“When the dust settles.”~When the dust settles from its own construction and set up and when the surrounding new buildings are completed this hotel will be a great option in the docklands.  The fundamentals are in place; good facilities, comfortable rooms and a convenient location. During our stay it was apparent that housekeeping and maintainance staff need more training regarding attention to detail(vaccuming carpets, wiping mirrors, cleaning the pool) and a few final touches will make all the difference when using the facilties (towel hooks outside the steam room, non slip mats in wet areas). The gym is small but well equipped with the latest machines,The 7th floor outdoor heated pool is ideal for lap swimming,and on grey Melbourne days it's great to warm up in the spa and steam room. We would stay at Four Points by Sheraton Melbourne docklands again and look forward to seeing the hotel improve as it becomes more established. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478366719~“Kimm”~Location suited our needs, staff were courteous, rooms were well appointed. Parking could be an issue if checking in the busy times during the day .Close to many eateries along the waterside and shopping.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477857843~“Modern Chic Hotel”~Our group decided to stay in the docklands precinct for a recent convention in Melbourne- and when this hotel popped up as an option we were surprised and pounced on the opportunity to give it a try The group all thought the same - that this hotel was a great choice! Apart from only being open for little over a week the hotel did have the obvious teething problems however these were minimal which makes me think that it will be a great option for business travellers and families alike who want to be a little out of the city and have an excellent value for money option  The rooms are new and very modern and contemporary along with spacious and very comfortable Definitely worth considering for your stay whether business or pleasure whilst in Melbourne~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477632006~“Teething problems”~I will start with the positives, Brand new hotel and very comfortable bed and pillows, free tram outside hotel. Its only been open a short time and there were lots of little issues, poor room cleaning, Pool only open limited hours, fire alarm went off at 6am , offered free bottled water never came, not enough robes for all rooms. Staff were quite friendly but seemed on the back foot due to the number of issues guests were raising. I would wait a few months until they sort themselves out~3~nan~3~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477292640~“average hotel, good transport options”~Staying one night on a night in the city for my partner and I, the location was a little out of the CBD but transport options plentiful. the entrance is a little uneventful, with just a door leading up to reception and no drop off/pick up facilities up front. Check in was quick, although $100 hold for incidentals for one night was excessive, when there's no minibar (didn't realise this until later). The reception/bar area was nice, well appointed and clean. Room was equally clean, with a sensational bed and pillows. Bathroom was nice, with rainfall shower a nice touch although photos on the website indicated a bath, which wasn't present. The website lacked detail on what each room type consisted of and photos were scarce. I've noted that this has been updated in the past few days.  I reserved a city view room and the view from the room was over the Harbour Town shopping centre and Melbourne Star Observation Wheel. Not sure if this was in error, but certainly wasn't a city view. Another negative was the lack of bottled water, as an SPG member is offered and the minibar wasn't stocked, nor was robes/slippers ect available as you would expect from a 4 star hotel.  Overall, nice experience for what you pay for.~3~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476583453~“Good place a little out of the way but nice”~Stayed here to try out and enjoyed it. It's at the end of docklands and as an interstate tourist, was not easy to locate without a lot of googling and asking locals. When arrived, staff were brilliant and really helpful. Room was very comfortable albeit small but for CBD accomodation the price reflected that and there is no complaint on that. Bar was terrific and well priced with amazing staff. Food in the restaurant was fantastic. Would absolutely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476237273~“Pleasant short-stay”~Good location and a stone's throw away from the CBD. Easily accessible as it's 25 minutes drive from Melbourne airport, less than 5 minutes drive from the CBD and there's a tram stop right in front of the hotel. Rooms are small (28 sq m), clean and functional with all amenities provided. As an SPG member, there were certain expectations that were not met e.g. daily complimentary water bottles, daily newspaper. Forgivable considering it was the Easter long weekend and staff were friendly and helpful.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475245316~“Good quality ”~Stayed for one night on business.  Location is pretty good in that it is right beside the shops in docklands and there is a tram that goes past the door to get to the CBD. Build quality is good with nice lobby area and modern room design.  Had dinner in the hotel restaurant which was very good, good selection served in a modern style. Staff in the restaurant were excellent.  Strangely although the dinner was great the breakfast was very underwhelming and considering it was $40 it was very over priced for what you got. A couple of niggly things that could be improved a) staff could not find me a firm pillow despite two attempts, assume this is just a new hotel issue that will be sorted; b) strange light switch situation, master switches only on one side of the bed which is annoying what you want to sleep on the other side. One major complaint, which was being completely taken advantage of for a bottle of water. There is a fridge in the room but it is not stocked. So I ordered a bottle of sparkling water whilst trying to get the pillow. Got a one ltr bottle which was fine. However I did not pay attention to the bill when checking out and only looked later in the day. I was charged $11 for the water (expensive but maybe not completely outrageous) the completely outrageous part was the $7 for 'room service delivery'. So $18 for a bottle of water!! Disappointing to say the least.  That really took away all the good feeling generated by the staff in the restaurant~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474560467~“Promising new hotel”~My partner and I recently stayed here for 4 nights as a getaway from Sydney. Its a new, clean fuss free hotel. The room we had is a perfect size for a couple and I do love toilets with rain showers and a bath! The bed is to die for and the black out curtains really does the job from keeping the sun away. The view overlooked the water so it was perfect. Its also a great location that is not right smacked in the city and super convenient with the tram stop just outside of the hotel that goes straight into the city.  We do know that the hotel is new, so there are things that will certainly improve over time, also coming from hospitality background there are things you just tend to pick on unintentionally. While waiting to check in, the girls at reception did not recognise our presence to say they would attend to us shortly. One staff member was also a bit rude to another guest she was assisting. We arrived at the hotel early so we do understand check in time is not until 3; perhaps starting the check in process would have been better so that when we returned we could have our room ready for us.  On the second day, we had left the room later and had advised reception that we have taken the DND sign off to please have our room made up ,which the staff member said it would be. To our surprise, we had returned back past midnight and our room was not made. Called guest services and was told that we could have another room for the night which we appreciated , however not ideal when you already have all your stuff in one room , so we just requested for fresh towels. It wasnt the fact that the room was not made up, it was more so that if one said it would get done, it should be then. Special mention to the f&b staff who were always very friendly and smiley with us, as well as Jovan from reception, it really made the difference. Also to the housekeeping lady from Sunday morning, who was even apologetic to us for knocking when it was already midday!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474056507~“Average services and ammenities - Room not as advertised.”~Still here and disappointed with my stay. Parking is $45 dollars despite hotel not being full and not being in the busy CBD. No drop-off area to park car while checking in/dropping off people & bags. If you are not willing to pay for 'valet', be prepared to park two blocks away at the shopping centre and you must pay per exit. Spa and swimming pool not heated even after calling ahead of booking to check, nor were they heated after mentioning it to guest service, some litter in pool too. Room is not as advertised on the website and in photos. Also don't expect items in room that you might usually expect from a 4 star-full price luxury hotel - No slippers, Robe, stocked mini fridge or microwave. Only giving stars because staff have been well mannered, kind and helpful. There is a convenient tram stop to the CBD out the front of the hotel. Room is clean and modern with nice furnishings.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_473715547~“New, well built hotel, with service still to be fine tuned”~Located in the Docklands, not quite the beating heart of Melbourne, however with plenty of choice for food and a 10 minutes drive from the CBD. Competitive room pricing. Rooms are exactly what you expect them to be from this level of hotel: pleasant, well built, but very standard and not exciting.  Brand new and well conceived facilities, with a well equipped gym and an outdoor pool (why outdoors? Although the pool is heated Melbourne can be cold, windy and rainy!). The hotel had only been officially open a few days and service was not perfect: I experienced issues with my back to back bookings that caused my room not to be serviced one day and keys in need to be changed every day. Only on the second last day of my 8 days stay did a staff figure out how to combine my bookings into one, after I had been told on check in and on previous days that this was not possible. I was stealthifily charged AUD 5 for an espresso coffee at breakfast (going price in the city is 3.5) without anybody telling me (I just found out on check out). Socks were returned all crumpled from laundry.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_473713403~“View over the river”~Parking to check in was hard to find due to all the worksite vehicles & lack of signage, so as the carpark doorway was open we went in & parked in the unfinished carpark & got locked in. Once we found a person to assist we made our way to the reception desk & was told it is velay parking only. Our room had a/c & was a good size clean & tidy (as it had only been open for 4 days) with a large window over looking the pool & river.The bed pillows were way too high & hard for a good night sleep, although the bed was comfortable & the hotel was quiet at night. We would have slept better if not for the pillows. The bathroom was really dark & did't have a good place to hang the towels as the towelrail is in the shower. It had a hairdryer, soap but no shower cap. There was a lamp, but no light bulb, a kettle in the cupboard, but it was on a shelf too high for me to use, it was not in the easiest or best of places to reach. The hotel is close to tram stop (in the free trams zone) so it was easy to head off to the city. The staff were not confident in their rolls & it was frustrating & showing. When asked how our stay was on checkout, our feedback was not welcomed.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_473523380~“Great value and beautiful pool!”~This hotel is a fabulous 4 star brand new one located just outside the Melbourne CBD at the Docklands. Free Tram out the front which takes you into CBD. Opposite is Harbourtown which is discount shopping outlets. Walking distance to Etihad stadium. Staff are friendly. Fit out is great. Rooms small but adequate. Bar and restaurant are great and comfortable setting. There is free parking spaces down the road on Sundays but not many. We were lucky to get one.  Curtains great so nice dark room. Only 15 stories with nice Melbourne views. Pool area is great on 7th floor. Will return and recommend especially with opening special prices~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472009152~“Peaceful and convenient location, great for couples and families”~Friendly and genuinely helpful staff, with stunning views of the harbour and city particularly when the night lights are lit up. Gym facilities were first class and the outdoor pool deck was classy and well-designed. Dessert at the restaurant was also lovely. Great location with easy access to the free Melbourne tram at the front entrance which takes you to the CBD in a few minutes. They may have opened a little too soon, as some minor details needed a bit of work. Overall however, an enjoyable stay by the harbour and a great escape from the busy CBD at the end of the day. We look forward to staying again the next time we are visiting Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471976237~“A good addition to the SPG/Marriott Family in Melbourne”~It is a sparkling brand new hotel. New building and new rooms. Nothing outstanding or impressive, but a decent Four Points category in Australia. It doesn't try to impress you but it also won't let you down.  The hotel has a rooftop pool which will be shared with the next door apartment building when it is completed.  Parking and drop on/off is a bit difficult because it doesn't have big laneways outside.  The hotel is located in Dockland which the area struggles to attract visitors. It has the water view although the building is not located next to the water.  Breakfast is too average. Not worth it for the $35 price tag.  The service can be polished further to enhance the value propoaition.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471963861~“Loved our stay! ”~From the minute we arrived we loved the fresh look of the hotel. The front desk was always very friendly both with checking in and out.  We loved the room and how modern everything was with the wooden and black accents. The Deluxe Harbour view of the Bolte Bridge was gorgeous only with some construction happening below that didn't bother us.  A small room but perfect for us, this is what we paid for.  Breakfast was enjoyable with all the normal buffet breakfast selections. The staff here were also very friendly and attentive. The Foxtel was great and Internet. Didn't get a chance to swim or use the gym because of this Melbourne weather but wish we did!  Overall, we loved our stay at Four points and would be happy to stay again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471774976~“opened too soon”~Knowing it only opened a few days before we stayed so you expect things to be not perfect. But the 4 points in Docklands have excelled in their lack of staff training , rooms not adequate, and poor front desk staff. The only experience of using the dining room, we ordered cocktails and cakes after dinner out on our return. We ordered but the menu had a miss prints so what we ordered did not served. We pointed out the mistake . The staff tired hard and apologised at the time.  Then the TV didn't work in the room. Rang guest services and said they would send some one up. Twenty minutes we were still waiting , so we rang back cancelled them as we were going to bed. And finally the next morning the Buffet breakfast was very average, we asked for a pot of tea made from a tea bag only to be told you need to go out to the bar outside the dining area. Finally on check out we are told we cant use EFTPOS on a saving # but we can use a credit card. of course they will charge you 1.5% service fee on top of the bill. We told them about no TV , and they said they would get the duty manger to ring?? No compensation offer of $20 off or something from the bill or a discount on your next stay?? We had reservations for Easter in 2 weeks but we not be going.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~2~1~nan
review_471771626~“Well Appointed”~The Four Points Sheraton has just been unveiled at Melbourne Docklands. This hotel has a rather compact lobby although staff were attentive and helpful. The adjacent bar and cafe are modern but not large. Stayed in a bay studio on the top floor which afforded a pleasant view over the water and Bolte bridge. This larger room option has separate zones although the design gave the impression it was spatially limited. The bedroom is equipped with a television and the bathroom is large and includes a separate bathtub. There is a nice outdoor pooldeck on level seven with a large rectagular pool and spa. Harbourfront shopping and many options for eating nearby. Overall, this is a nice hotel consistent with the Sheraton name.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
