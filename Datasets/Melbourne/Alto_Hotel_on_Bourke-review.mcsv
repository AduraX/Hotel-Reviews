review_478164765~“Great location and very clean and comfortable rooms”~I have stayed in this hotel before and the rooms are consistently clean and comfortable. The hotel is so convenient as it is less than 5 minutes away from Southern Cross Station making the travel to and from the airport via the Skybus very easy. The staff are friendly and helpful.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_478099107~“Boutique hotel in a great location”~Less than 3 minutes walk to Southern Cross station and the Skybus terminal. We stayed in a one bedroom on the 2nd floor. Quiet, clean and the staff were very friendly. Totally recommend this place especially to newbies to Melbourne. Tram stop outside that takes you up to the centre of the city!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477206199~“Overall Great Experience”~Recently stayed here for 5 nights. I was very satisfied with my stay and would absolutely stay here again. The room was nice and comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The hotel is in a convenient location. The Sky Bus is across the street at Southern Cross. The hotel is in walking distance to the popular areas. I had the breakfast at the hotel and it was great. There were many options to choose from.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476692697~“Bourke st.”~Checked in here late this afternoon.  Very pleasant chap behind the counter. Found my room and am very happy with it. Queen studio, not huge but ample room for myself. Nice and quite which is a plus. Room service is available and really yummy. I had the seafood selection and I scoffed it. They provide plenty of milk for your tea/coffee which frankly is rare. This place is in a terrific location, close to Spencer st station and the Skybus terminal. Nice spot. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476590358~“Amazing Staff and Great Location”~The staff were what made this place - really friendly and unbelievably helpful - made our stay in Melbourne really lovely. Front of house staff remembered you and what your plans were and asked after your day. They were really helpful in providing information that was top rate, and right on the mark. An added bonus was that the hotel is right next to the Southern Cross train station making transport to and from the airport on the Sky Bus a breeze, and a tram station on the free tram line right by the front door. Great location for travellers~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_476221034~“Ou Favourite hotel in Melbourne!”~We go to Melbourne regularly to watch the footy (AFL) and have stayed at the Alto on Burke the last 4 times. We love this hotel as it has so many great features. The beds are super comfortable the shower wonderful and the 24 hour coffee machine has barista quality coffee. The breakfast offers a good selection at a very reasonable price and always perfectly cooked. Reception and breakfast staff all very friendly and helpful. And the location is ideal - it's only a 3 mins walk from Souther Cross Station for anyone taking the Skybus to and from the Airport, near tram stops, easy walk to Etihad as well as all the major shopping plazas.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474845981~“Fabulous”~My friend and I booked a 2 bedroom apartment for 3 nights on a recent shopping trip to Melbourne. The apartment was perfect for us and had everything we required. Our experience was made even more perfect by the fabulous staff. Everyone was so helpful and friendly and happy to advise us, from the right places to shop and the right places to eat and even how to get around the city. Having free Espresso downstairs was great for me friend who can't start her day without at least two cups. She was down in reception in her dressing gown at 5.30am on the first morning!! This is a wonderful place to stay. Warm, friendly and comfortable and right in the heart of the city.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473752538~“Always delivers!”~This is a great little hotel which consistently delivers great service. It is spotlessly clean, has all the amenities you would need and is well located in the CBD of Melbourne. Staff are polite, friendly and always helpful.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473253923~“Melbourne City stay”~Daughter and I stayed at Alto in Burke St Melbourne after the Adele concert in March We rented a two bed apartment due to my snoring (I don't snore daughter just wanted her own room)  The apartment was well fitted and had everything we needed. The manager left a lovely little gift for us (chocolate) to share. Check in was fine and the staff very friendly, we paid extra for breakfast and parking up front but be warned, despite paying a discounted rate of $16 each for a full breakfast, if you order from the menu they will charge an exorbitant fee for items such as beans or hash browns, for instance if you order the big breakfast which has eggs, sausages bacon, has brown~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473229834~“Great central location and nice room”~Nicely greeted and treated by staff, the room was fairly spacious and clean. Pub across the street offers good value meals. Cenral location means great place to explore Melbourne from including Casino, Exhibition Centre and sporting venues. Overall pretty good.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_471967344~“Great well located spot”~Great for any length of stay we stayed a week. Great location short walk to Southern Cross Station, free tram outside. Quiet our room had no road noise. Good breakfast.  Car parking if needed. Staff very welcoming & friendly Would stay again ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470969860~“Everything you Need”~have stayed several times now. Friendly staff that offer good service. The rooms are quiet (they face a walking lane away from the main road so no traffic noise) and clean with usual mini bar and bathroom supplies. A decent breakfast is offered in the small dinning area off reception. The location is excellent and though not in the shopping heart of Melbourne is only three tram stops away with the tram stop almost at the door,and the train station at the end of the road.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_470723768~“My "go to" place in Melbourne”~I have been staying at the Alto on visits to Melbourne for over 10 years for business and personal trips. Always welcoming. Not 5-star but nor is the price. Always efficient. Always clean. Always ready to assist.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469992012~“Good location and centrally licated”~This hotel is very straight forward, meaning it's a warm and neat hotel for the price you pay for near CBD. Best part about this hotel is the location as just outside of the hotel there is a station that takes you to the shopping district and for its free. Because Alto is situated between Bourke St and not far from Crown Hotel where the casino is, it saves slot of transportation cost and there are lots of restaurants and pubs and shopping malls near the hotel.  The staff at Alto are exceptionally friendly, professional and helpful. I feel at home when I stay there. The rooms are typical apartment style where there are at least two rooms and a comfy living area. I will definitely go back there again if I visit Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468977508~“Comfortable Hotel”~I was here for a week on business. Very friendly & helpful staff, clean rooms, very good CBD location. Only issue is I had a room that overlooked the street, and even with their sound proof glass, I heard the trams on the street from about 4am onwards as I am a light sleeper.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466163935~“Great find”~So central to everything and the friendliest staff I have come across in the city. Couldn't be more helpful.easy walk from train station and central to everything you need in the city. Rooms had everything needed for a night in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464882197~“Wondeful little find, would definitely stay again!”~After spending 5 nights on the outskirts of Melbourne on business, it was nice to transfer into town for Sat night. I love this little hotel, what a great find. My husband and I arrived early morning after dropping off a hire car at Southern Cross Station (right around the corner). We planned on dropping our bags off, but were delighted to be offered an early check in. As we only had one day/night in Melbourne, this just made our life so much easier. Great room, excellent facilities, although we didn't get to stay long enough to take advantage of them. Everything is compact and well thought out, super clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend. Loved the Massage chairs, very relaxing after spending the morning at Victoria Markets. Friendly efficient staff, great location, within walking distance to all major attractions. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again. Well done Alto Hotel for providing an excellent experience all round.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464520748~“Fabulous place to stay ”~We stayed here for three nights last week. It is well located. The rooms are well appointed and modern. There is a microwave, sink and cooking equipment should you need it. There are also washing machines and dryers which is incredibly useful when you've been living out of a suitcase for a few weeks already. breakfast served by efficient and pleasant staff. Reception staff very helpful too. It was good to see a manager present...not that we needed to speak to him at all but just the re-assurance that someone has their finger on the pulse so to speak.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464157126~“Ticked all the boxes ”~Great boutique hotel in great location with tram stop right outside. Included breakfast was ample and a good choice served by jolly staff. Nothing too much trouble for all on reception from arranging a slightly later check out to advising on the best coffee shops. Well done, keep it up!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463902374~“Great Locatin”~This is the second time we have stayed here. The location is perfect, just down the street from the terminus of the Skybus. It is in a quiet location, but there are many restaurant/bar options nearby. I really enjoyed the Calamari salad at the Bar Humbug. It is also right by the free Melbourne tourist trolley system. We also enjoyed lunch on the Colonial tram.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463591696~“Best stay in Melbourne”~Excellent location, very friendly staff and super-comfortable rooms. This hotel is kept exceptionally clean and the rooms have everything you need. I also love that they are environmentally friendly. There is a restaurant on site which serves a great breakfast. They also have a fantastic selection of Foxtel channels.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463561814~“Small rooms but the location couldn't be beat”~We stayed here for one night on our way back from Hamilton Island to the United States and were pretty happy with it. The room was very small but it had everything we needed. The location however couldn't be beat. It was 1/2 a block from the train station and had plenty of "tourist traps" around it. Not only that, but we didn't have any issues finding a place to grab a bite for dinner or a bite for breakfast. Overall i would stay here again if we ever go back, but i would upgrade to a bigger room. I was literally a bed and a bathroom with a small love seat in the corner. No room to sit and unwind, but they crammed a kitchenette in the entryway.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan~nan
review_463369464~“Great little place to stay”~Great Central location, handy for the free tram and for exploring the city. Very Comfortable apartment with all amenities. Beds were luxurious! Staff were friendly and helpful. Free coffee and apples all day We would definitely recommend this place.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462860124~“Good location, comfortable”~Location is very convenient. Just a few steps away from the Southern Cross train station and airport Skybus, there is also a tram station just outside the hotel.  We had a room on the second floor. We had studio queen and the room was nicely sized and well furnished. It also had a small kitchenette and a fridge. A view from the room was nothing special, but it the windows were well soundproofed. Bathroom was also OK. I had a good sleep on a very comfortable bed. Room were spotlessly clean. Wifi was working well throughout the hotel.  Included in the price was also the breakfast, which is quite good (though much too expensive if I would have to pay it extra) and cooked to order. I do have a complaint about the waiter - although she was friendly and professional to the guests, she was also constantly loudly gossiping in the open kitchen - complaining about other cooks, staff.. etc... Very unprofessional from her, as the guests (willingly or non-willingly) could hear everything. This area can also be used as a day lounge, during the day apples and hot drinks were available.  Otherwise I can only praise the staff behind the check-in desk. A young lady there was working two (or even three?) nights in the row there, and she was friendly and very helpful with recommendations about where to go or where to eat in Melbourne (or even to take a takeaway!). I would certainly recommend this hotel. Relatively small and it doesn't belong to a big chains - i actually like that, as the staff was genuinely friendly.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462845421~“Home”~If ever we had a home away from home in Melbourne, Alto is it. Everything is so comfortable. Location, amenities, value and great staff who actually remember you. And of course we love the apples. Thank You.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462832538~“Very good location in CBD”~Well appointed, spacious room. Everything very clean and all that we needed for a few nights. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Good location in CBD as well as quite close to waterfront. Our king bed was a little tired and warn in. Try to get a room on upper floors. We were on the second floor and there was a lot of street noise until midnight or so.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~5~nan
review_461264673~“Location, comfort and best WiFi in the CBD.”~We couldn't fault our stay at the Alto Hotel on Bourke in any way (February 2017). It started with some super friendly customer service at front reception (it ended the same way also) and this set the tone for our stay. Everything was easy. The location of the Alto is basically perfect. It's close to Southern Cross Train Station on Spencer Street, but also not far from the main shopping district (a short, free tram ride which conveniently leaves from the Alto doorstep). It's so easy.  The rooms are very nice. Not the best you'll find in the city by any stretch, but they are cosy, clean and comfortable. The thing is with the Alto, you're not paying $300-$400 for a room. We secured our room for approximately $200 and this great value for this (King) room. The bed was very comfortable, one of the better sleeps we've had in the city. What stands the Alto apart from many other hotels in the very fast and reliable WiFi. I saw other reviews mention the great WiFi and I am pleased to report it was excellent. There was only a small drop-out late on Saturday night, that may have been "peak" time for the hotel WiFi, but at all other times it was fantastic (and remember, it's free!). We didn't try the restaurant downstairs. Perhaps another time. We would strongly recommend the Alto to friends and family, especially because it won't set you back $300-$400 like other hotels, and for this reason I have rated the property 5 stars.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460335587~“Great location, comfortable”~Great location right in town. We took the one bedroom apartment but were upgraded to the two bedroom which was more than adequate space wise and had great a/c. Had everything we needed, clean and tidy, and service was good (although we arrived at 11pm at night). Great little common room/coffee room/library too. Good value for money. Only small downsides were check-out was a bit early at 10am and that it was a little loud as being right by train station. Would come again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_458677463~“Customer Friendly - Top Rating”~The Alto is conveniently located right next to a tram stop and within an easy walk to Southern Cross Station. Bourke Street busy and interestig. While the rooms are nicely average, the superb customer interface is terrific and the breakfasts are well worth adding to your reservations. Recommend!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458044796~“Perfect Home Away In The Big City”~Within walking distance to Southern Cross Station and Etihad stadium -for the soccer! The tram stop is at the corner (and its free if you are roaming in the city area). We took it up to Mrs Parma's for the best chicken parm dinner you will ever have. The rooms are very quiet so you can't hear the city noises. Spacious bathroom and big amazing shower. We had a 2 Bedroom apartment and both bedrooms are well appointed with own air conditioning in each, TV in queen room. Lounge/dining/kitchen was very clean, had comfy chairs and a big fridge. You could live here, easily! Free foxtel and wifi..........and cheap breakky.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457745098~“A bit of a squash but great location”~Our family of five stayed here in December. The location is good - tram outside and groceries nearby. The actual apartment offered all the amenities we needed but the space really is tight. Having just come from another serviced apartment in Sydney j found us eating out more in comparison because the table only sat 3 people at a time and we were just more on top of each other. Also one of our kids had to sleep downstairs where the sleeper couch is, which made doing washing etc at night a bit more complicated.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457247110~“Well located for airport access and city trams”~A perfectly adequate if modest hotel very close Skybus service to airport and on free trams into city (as well as walking distance to a number of attractions at this end of town). Room was clean, small and well insulated from street noise. Staff friendly and helpful. But on balance decided to spend a little more to get a nicer hotel on a return visit this coming week.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_456252496~“Reasonably good”~I enjoyed the night at the hotel as it was clean quiet spacious enough. The price was reasonable too so I couldn't have asked for more just for one night in the middle of the city. I recommend this hotel for sure.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456102356~“great stay at Alto Hotel”~We stayed here for 3 nights recently and could not be happier with the staff and service. The location was great, take the Skybus from the airport to Southern Cross and walk across the street and you are there, the free tram just in front to everywhere within the free zone and of course we walked and walked all over as well. We had the studio queen room, the size is a bit small but for two people it's manageable. There is a microwave, a kitchen sink in the room with cups and dishes etc...just in case if you want to cook up something quick but we didn't need to because the breakfast was fantastic with many choices, just beware some items on the breakfast menu will have a small extra charge. The room has double windows so it is very quiet at night, it also has double blinds to block out the lights if you want to sleep late. The bathroom is clean and well equipped with shampoo, lotions, shower gel and hair conditioner. The staff are friendly and helpful especially the two ladies at the breakfast service. All in all, cannot we were very happy with this hotel and would highly recommend it.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455488664~“Not bad for tennis week”~We made a late decision to attend the final Saturday of the Australian Open and needed a place for our family of four. We booked the 2 bedroom deluxe apartment. It had a narrow staircase up to two small bedrooms and a tiny full bathroom. One bedroom had a small balcony that looked out onto rooftops and alleyways, with a queen sized bed and small flat screen tv. The other bedroom had two single beds and no windows. Downstairs was a small kitchen with washer/dryer, dishwasher, cooktop, fridge, and microwave; another small bathroom with shower, and a small living room area with balcony, couch, chairs, table, and TV. Overall the apartment was small but comfortable, yet rather dated and worn. Service people are at the desk 24 hours and were very nice and helpful with suggestions on getting around, sights to see, etc.  We did not purchase the breakfast or use the restaurant. The breakfast looked good though, and priced from A$19-24 pp. We went down the street a bit and bought cereal and milk at the E-Z Mart instead.  One nice thing about Melbourne is the free tram zone. You can use it to get around easily in the heart of the city and it's free within the zone. They also ran a free tram past the zone boundary specifically for the tennis tournament. This hotel is near southern cross train station and very near the Skybus terminal - we didn't use skybus but it would have been a fast and inexpensive way to get to/from the airport with only a 100 meter walk to the hotel.  One note- the hotel is on Bourke on the west end of the CBD, just one block south on King Street are strip clubs and bars; we unfortunately had to walk past there with the kids in the evening from the Flinders St tram stop. The area it is a bit seedy with rowdy and drunk people.  At A$588 per night, it was a lot to pay, except that this is the Melbourne CBD and it was tennis weekend and we booked only about 30 days out. I would consider booking again if needing more space for the family, button probably wouldn't be my first choice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455466403~“Great location”~We recently stayed at Alto Hotel, the location was great 2 minute walk from Skybus, tram at front door, easy walking distance to cafes and CBD.

review_452757426~“My Melbourne Hotel”~2nd time I've stayed here, last time was 2 years ago. This is a fine hotel, centrally located, good for getting the bus to and from the airport and a tram stop at the front door.  My one tip is don't book the petit queen room if you're a couple, it's a bit on the small side, I made this mistake on my most recent visit, last time we had a studio apartment.  The shower in the petit queen also wasn't as good as my last visit, the pressure wasn't the best.  The wifi in this hotel is excellent.  I'd stay here again but in one of the bigger rooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452570005~“Beginning of an Australian vacation”~The staff at this hotel were all excellent. The room was very clean, breakfasts were all great, and the location was perfect. Should I ever return to Melbourne I would definitely stay again. The day we had to leave, the dinning staff got our breakfast order ready slightly ahead of "opening time" so we would not miss our bus to the airport.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_450639577~“Still Amazing”~We returned to the Alto on Bourke after a previously positive stay. This stay did not disappoint. Our welcome was warm, the hotel is keen to make the stay as pleasant as possible. Parking is interesting, but do able and as with everything at the Alto, small but perfectly formed. Our unit had a small sitting area, kitchen, two bathrooms and two bedrooms. The lounge area near reception and it's supply of fresh apples, and hot drinks was used extensively during our stay. Our friends found the relaxation room and enjoyed using it several times. Alto has a fantastic position near Spencer Street station, a tram stop just outside the door and an easy walk into the centre of Melbourne or to Southbank. We are glad that we chose to stay again at the Alto, it has once again exceeded our expectations.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450333197~“fabulous again”~This is my third stay at the Alto, again it was great, from the helpful staff to the great rooms. I cant fault it, its my place to stay whilst in Melbourne. The breakfast was great , the room very clean, bed comfortable and staff willing to assist with holding luggage . Its great if you are attending an event at Etihad as its a 3 minute walk.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450267510~“very central location”~We enjoyed our stay and would use the hotel again. The front room we were given was too noisy for us but the staff happily moved us to a quieter one.

review_449758783~“Glad we found Alto”~It was a great stay and sincerely loved every minute of being in this hotel. I was not looking for "home away from home" especially on vacation, but it was absolutely wonderful. I stayed at Grand Hyatt & Mariott for few days before this hotel, but I believe this was worth it, and possibly next time I come, I would prefer Alto over other hotels. Staff was so polite, helpful and always willing to go that extra mile to help. I would especially mention Gemma, who was their to help whenever I requested. Location is brilliant as it right on the tram station and walking to various near by attractions. Breakfast was just awesome and the chef prepares your meal as you want, other than standard cereals and fruits, which is what I really liked. Rooms were very nice and fully quipped kitchen in case you need to make things for your kids/ young one's.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_449071725~“Superb As Always”~Staying at the Alto is like coming home. The staff are always friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful. The rooms are lovely and clean, with a kitchenette, extremely comfortable beds and a lovely feel to them. It's in a great location with a tram stop just metres away from the front door and Southern Cross Station a short walk away.  Breakfast was included in our booking and offered delicious choices for a satisfying start to the day. My husband and I stayed 3 nights when in Melbourne recently, I love staying at this hotel, it is a beautiful hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_448155626~“Great location, awesome service”~I recently visited Melbourne with a group and stayed at the Alto on Bourke on two separate occasions. The hotel is in a great location and very convenient to Southern Cross Station and the airport Skybus. Also very convenient with a tram stop right outside which is within the free Melbourne city tram loop. All of our group loved the eco friendly rooms, fantastic breakfast and the very friendly and exceptional service from the staff. One of our guests had left a jacket in his room after the first stay. Not only did the hotel retrieve it but it was waiting in his room for our return visit. I'd particularly like to acknowledge Charly and Rebecca who were truly wonderful.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

Complementary tea coffee making facilities were available 24 hours~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_447082147~“Fantastic green hotel”~It has a tiny lobby and I couldn't see a chandelier, but it is an unpretentious, comfortable and elegant hotel with 100% of its energy coming from renewable sources. If you pay an extra $4, a conservation organisation will plant a tree and the Alto will pay to plant another one. It has a tiny corner library where you can take the books home if you haven't finished reading them. There is a quiet room with 2 massage chairs. It is a short walk from Southern Cross Station and the airport skybus, so very convenient for travellers. The staff are cheerful and friendly. Altogether my favourite hotel in Melbourne.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_445742191~“Not having been back in about 5 yrs it was good to find it was just the same fantastic place.”~the reason we chose this hotel was because of its green credentials, it is really quiet as all the rooms are down a quiet side lane. it is great to see the same faces on each visit, wich to me indicates a place that cares for its employees. Nice quiet rooms, breakfast cooked to order, friendly staff all around~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_441786718~“Cool place to stay”~The Alto Hotel was booked for it's location and convenience. It was within walking distance to all my needs during my 48 hours business blitz of the Melbourne CBD. I book a petite queen room which was clean, everything worked and ample for me.  The hotel was a cool and funky ambience and the staff very friendly and helpful particularly Charlie at the front desk. He made me feel at home just with his smile and sense of humour. The breakfast in the morning was fresh and there was plenty of variety. I found my place to stay when I venture to Melbourne.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_441374620~“very good hotel in a great location”~Was here for 7 nights on a business trip. most of my time was in the CBD so this location was excellent. Room was clean, neat and quiet. Bed was comfortable but soft. Restaurant was good but a bit expensive but might be just Melbourne. Good front desk. Would recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440429906~“Quietness and convenience”~A great location, quite close to Spencer Street Station and very quiet compared to other hotels right in the central CBD. Room was comfortably sized for a twin share situation. Staff were very efficient and friendly. Breakfast menu was good.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_440020724~“Nice cbd hotel”~I'm impressed with the staff. They were helpful. I came in at 6 am & need to go tour the whole day. They store my luggage & when i came in at 8.30 pm, the luggage is already in the room. They also allows late check out at 11 am next day which was nice as I was so exhausted. I love staying in a hotel that have staff who don't act like a military or robot. Thank you!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439399678~“Great location”~Perfect location for my business trip in the heat of Melbourne CBD.  Rooms were excellent, lots of free Foxtel channels that other hotels don't provide. Clean and modern. Will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439215492~“Great for a work trip”~In Melbourne for three nights for work, I took a Queen studio overlooking Langs Lane. Size is fine for a short work trip or for one person, if staying longer with two people I would ask for an apartment. I am currently sitting in the room now and there are roadworks directly outside the hotel but I cannot hear them at all. It has been very quiet every night so far. The decor outside the rooms respects the heritage of the building, which made me worry that the room may be old and weary, so I was pleasantly surprised at the clean fresh decor of the room. The AV is excellent with full Foxtel and FreeView channels and the ability to stream from your phone to the TV. The wireless speed is good and free. The bathroom is small but not squeezy, and very clean. The bed is by far the most comfortable I have slept in at a hotel, and I have slept very well. The highlight to me are the staff. I tend to be a bit long winded yet never felt like I was imposing. Very helpful, well informed and relaxed. Unlike some of the more expensive options, they exemplify an Australian trait of providing great service without ever being subservient, creating a very relaxed atmosphere. Free tea/coffee in the lounge, and free apples in the lobby, are a nice touch.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_438895564~“A Stay Away From My Regular - Nice Hotel”~I travel regularly to Melbourne for both business and pleasure, so it was a little sad when my normal hotel was too full to get a reasonably priced room. I booked this through QANTAS and received a smallish Queen room which was perfect for my one night stay by myself. I asked for a quite room and got it - facing a lane-way on the side of the building, and combined with the double glazing - had no noise at all. The only possible downside was a slight chemical smell I guess from cleaning the bathroom - but otherwise it was a really nice room - spot on 4 star and everything you need. The beds were very good and all in all, I had a good sleep and would be very happy to return.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_438638730~“Studio queen stay”~Great location and friendly staff make this an excellent choice for our needs. Despite construction work literally right outside the building we slept well thanks to sound-proofing on the windows. The breakfast deal in our accommodation package was good value, and any-time access to good tea and coffee in the foyer was an added bonus. The hotel's commitment to sustainable choices is refreshing and appreciated.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437728773~“Fantastic hotel in great location”~My wife and I stayed at Alto for 4 nights and were impressed with all aspects of the hotel. The room was very clean and in great condition and the staff were extremely helpful in dealing with any issues and providing information on trips and Melboune as a whole. The location was great - right outside was a tram stop that was in the free travel zone. Breakfast was very good and a welcome bonus was the tea/coffee available throughout the day. Would definitely recommend friends and family coming to Melbourne to stay here.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437603375~“Happy return to wonderful Alto”~We haven't been to Melbourne for 3 years but we are so pleased to again stay at the Alto. So clean, staff so friendly and helpful (as my dear old father said--they act like they are glad to see you). We dined in last night: superb. I cho se chicken madras curry and my dining copanion lamb shanks which she declared the best ever. For breakfast, she chose mixed mushrooms with feta and balsamic reduction, I was less adventurous with scrambled eggs and bacon. IMHO Alto...the best stay in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436746134~“Great location”~Great location. Walking distance from Southern cross station. Short walk to the city centre or catch a tram .Tram stop is out in front  Comfy beds, clean rooms.Hotel provided everything you need including free Wifi.  Staff are very polite and helpful.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_436282602~“Perfect for family”~Must say the level of service that we received during our stay at Alto was exceptional. We traveled with family (6 yr and a 2 yr old) and the room was super convenient. We took the one with built in kitchen and it was just perfect for us (good for all scenarios light and heavy cooking). The beds provided are top notch quality, I cant complain much about the sofa bed though it was a bit uncomfortable (just enough for the older one to sleep). Needless to mention about the staff who were very helpful especially Amy at the reception, who always had a smile on her face and great ideas for what to explore locally. We would definitely visit again.~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_435496612~“Excellent hotel with both comfort and refreshing environmental values!”~Friendly and helpful staff. Compact but clear, functional rooms with wonderfully comfortable beds. Limited surface /shelf space in bathrooms. Could not fault attention to environmental awareness from in room recycling bins to toiletries and power source! Excellent example to set some of the larger hotel chains. Exceptional location right next to Skybus and tram station and walkable distance to CBD. Will definitely recommend and will stay  again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433452661~“Alto hotel”~Very clean, beautiful beds I was tempted to buy a mattress and base and ship back to NZ (you can actually do that!!) Nice helpful people at the counter did a good job, Chefs were quite animated and friendly, one went to the trouble of finding a particular sauce my wife was interested in and where to get it.  Be my pick of midtown Melbourne to stay at again, Trains across the corner and trams literally on the doorstep. Good place.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433418271~“Pleasant Stay but unlikely to stay again”~Location is excellent, close to Southern Cross Station and Tram out front. Room clean and had basic comforts. Bathroom is very tiny. Rooms are not sound proof and we found this to be annoying. If you have an expectation that your room will be fully serviced each day then reception needs to be advised of the request or it will not occur. Their is no signage in the rooms to state this The breakfast/bar area is small and décor is dated but the service and food was good. Cost of stay was expensive and we did not find the overall stay value for money. Many other places cheaper and as nice.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_433383702~“Great place to stay in Melbourne”~This is a great hotel in a convenient location. Staff are all friendly and helpful. The offer of free coffee in the lounge is an excellent service. We had one night in a one bedroom apartment and two nights in a studio queen apartment. The one bedroom apt was best, space to move around and a comfortable couch. Studio apt was quite small, but we'll set out. Dinner in the restaurant was very good, note that it is not open Sunday. Breakfast was also very good. Well situated, within walking distance of Victoria Markets, Bourke St Mall and close to Southern Crooss Station.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433112540~“It was a real pleasure to stay here”~This hotel is so convenient to transport and shopping. The best and cheapest way to get here from the airport is by the Skybus which is $19 one way. The skybus drops you to Southern Cross station which is about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom Deluxe apartment. It would be great for a family visiting with 2 bedrooms and bathroom upstairs and downstairs another bathroom, lounge and compact kitchen which also had a washing machine. The apartment was on the 4th floor and was very quiet and the room was dark at night making it easy for sleeping.  If you make your booking directly with the hotel breakfast is included. There is a buffet breakfast which includes cereal, toast, fruit, pastries and a choice of one cooked hot meal off the menu. Yumalicious! Help yourself to coffee and cool water anytime during the day. The staff were very friendly and enjoyed having a chat, but at the same time were still going about their duties. We would definitely return to this hotel for another stay!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_432600426~“Great Hotel - Convient Location”~Two travelers in their early 70’s stayed at this hotel for five nights in October. Overall the hotel is very nice and I recommend it for several reasons. The location is very convenient to the train station and the Skybus from the airport, both within a block. There is also a free tram for the Central Business District (CBD) right out front. We were able to visit everything we wanted by taking this tram or walking. We had a Studio Queen which was decent size, the wi-fi worked well for all three of our devices and it was nice to have a refrigerator, tea kettle and microwave. The bathroom was fine but it was a little tight getting in the shower and one of us had to keep our toiletries out on the counter by the teapot because not a lot of counter space. (We have found this to be typical in Australia.) We included breakfast when booking and were glad we did – nice buffet plus a hot dish from a list of six or seven items. We ate dinner there one night and enjoyed our meal. The staff were very helpful and quite friendly. We would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_431955202~“Intimate boutique hotel”~We stayed at the Alto on Bourke last week. It is a lovely intimate boutique hotel. The reception staff were incredibly friendly and obliging. The room was modest but nice, very clean, and more than adequate. The accessible bathroom was well thought out and a pleasure to use.  The dining room and lounge area was intimate and relaxing. Dinner was superb. Breakfast was not only exceptional value, it was well done and the staff friendly and efficient. Its location is fantastic. A short walk to Southern Cross station and a tram stop almost outside the door.  Even with road works going on outside overnight, our room was so quiet. No noisy fridge. No noisy air conditioning.  The hotels commitment to the environment is also commendable. Bee hives on the roof, green energy and minimal landfill waste.  I would highly recommendthis hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again. Overall, it was excellent value and very enjoyable.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_431938058~“Well-locatedmid tier CBD Hotel”~I was looking for a centrally located modestly price hotel located in Melbourne's CBD and I found it in the Alto Hotel on Bourke. The Alto is a boutique hotel a short distance to the Spencer Street Station and will trams just outside the door (but you don't hear the noise of the tram). Its also close to the airport bus terminal. Travel within the immediate CBD is free on the tram so that makes the Alto a great base to move around the city without cost. The rooms are typical of a mid tier hotel - clean, compact - nothing particularly fancy - but appropriate for someone like me who doesn't particularly want to pay for unnecessary luxuries, even if they are on a corporate credit card. I booked through Qantas Hotel Bookings so go extra Qantas Frequent Flyer Points.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_431892750~“Weekend away”~A very nice quiet hotel with helpful and friendly staff. The room i stayed in had everything that i needed. A comfortable bed , top of my list, a good sized shower , wi fi , a desk with a chair, a small table as well as a lounge chair . A good sized TV with foxtel. Catching the bus from the airport, which finishes up a southern cross station , the hotel is a 5 minute walk up the road. The trams run past the hotel , with a stop outside your front door . Breakfast has everything you need , from a continental , to the big breakfast. I like my food but i could not finish it. There are plenty of food places near by , as well as a Coles supermarket. Well worth a stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431031057~“Great mid level option with old fashioned feel”~We booked on the net, and were pleasantly surprised to arrive very late (midnight horror) to a smile with genuine warmth from the desk clerk. The room was clean, ready and no fuss, as was checking in. Wonderful at the end of a long flight from Perth. Over a four night stay we enjoyed consistently good service, from desk staff to cleaning level. All solidly and reliably pleasant, with an old fashioned feel of good quality but not over done, that really made the stay a delight. Modern with a light touch of older Melbourne grandeur. The room was ample for two, quiet as over a lane not Bourke St, with kitchenette plus basics of tea/coffee, microwave etc. the bed clean and very comfortable with good lighting and good blinds to block out the light. All in well kept and maintained condition. Shower only, and pressure not great, but adjustable. We could also walk or tram very easily from the location. Good solid pricing. We were also able to leave our bags for the day, as flying out late, and were able to return and sit in the small lounge area, despite checking out in the morning. Really really happy with the whole experience and noted as our stay place for the next trip/s to Melbourne. Highly recommended in the mid range. Noted also appeared to be wheelchair accessible but suggest this be checked.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_430196043~“Unexpected little gem”~I didnt know what to expect with this one. I booked last minute for a business trip and was on a budget, I'd never heard of the place. The reviews looked good though so I gave it a whirl. When I arrived the carpet put me off...looked like the place needed updating immediately. I was pleasantly suprised by the spacious clean and modern room. The bathroom and its amenities also another great suprise as was the kitchenette. Add in the bonus of having all the foxtel channels including movies and free coffee on 24hours in the lounge...on to a winner here! One last point...the staff are incredible. Helpful, considerate and super friendly. Thanks for a great 2 days. This will definitely now be my go to hotel in Melbourne!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429541746~“Lovely modern hotel in good location”~I stayed here with my mother while visiting Melbourne for her 80th birthday. I chose the 1 bedroom Spa Apartment, this was nice and spacious and included a kitchenette. We found the hotel very well located, the Sky Bus stops nearby, and the tram is directly outside. It was a small, comfortable, welcoming hotel. We ate in the small restaurant one night and the food was excellent. The Queen bed in the apartment was extremely comfortable. The sofa bed was not, you could feel the springs in that, and I would suggest a mattress topper would make all the difference. But this was the only negative I can find. Service was excellent. Little things like free coffee in lounge and library area were lovely touches. Overall we loved it and would stay again when visiting Melbourne.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428999446~“Great location”~I stayed at Alto Hotel for 2 nights for a conference. This hotel was only a few hundred meters from the station.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Petite queen room - clean, comfy, in-room wifi (free and working well) Highly recommended!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_427672714~“3 Night Stay at The Alto Hotel.”~Pros: the feather-bed!, great location, friendly staff, clean room and property Cons: n/a Tips: Taxi rides to and from the airport to this hotel are expensive. From the airport I paid 65AUS and to the airport in the early morning my fare was 85AUS! So I would recommend Ubering whenever you can! I really enjoyed my stay at this cute hotel. Check-in and checkout was a breeze. The location was perfect for walking to several restaurants/shops and a short 5min walk to the Outlet Mall/Train Station. They have a really nice cafe with a small and super cozy reading nook! I thought it was really cute and nice touch! I appreciated the cleanliness of my room. The desk came equipped with a HDMI cable to hookup a laptop to the nice sized flat screen TV. I thought that was a pleasant addition to the room - as I was able to watch Netflix late night after a day of exploring the city! Perhaps the only issue of concern I had with my room was the shower floor. The shower floor was a little slick when wet. And there were no anti-slips or an anti-slip mat available. So I always had to be super cautious when showering or use a hand cloth to stand on. Overall this was a perfect hotel for my short stay in Melbourne and I would book it again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427453752~“Overnight stay”~Stayed overnight before our flight next day, and it was as good as ever. Love the Alto.  The staff are so helpful and nothing is a problem to them. Lovely breakfast as well. We will be back. Can recommend it.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_427125597~“Very Convenient Location”~We enjoyed our stay with the Alto Hotel recently. The Studio apartment was well appointed, very clean, friendly staff, with a free wi-fi (which worked well) and full Foxtel Service (instead of just selected channels such as the Sports package). Breakfast was very nice and there are a selection of places to eat in the area. The Alto's location, a few minutes walk from the Southern Cross Railway Station, is very convenient. If you catch the Skybus from the airport it is a snappy 3 minutes walk to the hotel from the terminus. All up I would not hesitate in recommending the Alto Hotel to anyone visiting Melbourne.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_427118895~“Great hotel, superb service and good location”~The Alto was a great choice for a spring break in Melbourne. We chose the hotel based on my spouse having stayed there once before during a business trip, and the fact that it is so well located for an independent traveller.  The location is excellent for airport travel -the airport buses arrive at Southern Cross station just a block away from the hotel (literally 2 minute walk), and several tram lines pass the hotel which is great as the free tram zone covers most of the inner city so hopping on a tram is a great way to get around Melbourne. If you need to get any further away by the public transport, the reception sells Myki travel cards -great if you want to explore the city outskirts. Walking is also an option with the Bourke St mall being only a 10-15 minute walk away and the laneways only a bit further away.  The hotel itself is stylish, well-kept and the rooms, if not huge, spotlessly clean, decorated with fresh colours and have all the usual amenities such as a safe, ironing equipment, wifi, hairdryer, coffee/tea making equipment etc. A petite studio was completely fine for a couple on a weekend break, but the hotel has rooms and apartments of various sizes if you need a bigger room. A few little things raise the Alto beyond an average city hotel: chocolates to welcome you, eco-friendly approach (energy, recycling, cosmetics), a good hairdryer (my personal hotel pet peeve are useless wall-mounted hairdryers!), lots of tv channels and very reasonable priced minibar and hotel breakfast. The breakfast is of good quality and there are several buffet and grab and go options available. They even serve their own honey from the hotel's rooftop hive!  However, it's the friendly but professional service that really raises Alto above the average hotels -all staff members we met were friendly, professional and had a great customer service attitude. Absolutely top notch service from everyone. Just as an example: my husband, by mistake, thought that a bottle of bubbly we had bought and put to cool in the minibar had gone missing during cleaning (we assumed the room service had thought there was an extra bottle and had removed ours) and when he mentioned that to the staff, they immediately promised to investigate the matter. We soon realised that he had made a mistake and the bottle was exactly where he had put it, and informed the staff and apologised for our mistake -just to be presented with a bottle of bubbly that they insisted we take despite the whole matter having been our own error.  I would warmly recommend the Alto for anyone needing an easy, comfortable and friendly base for a city stay.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_427086354~“Charming Hotel”~The building has a nice architecture. The staff were lovely. Especially bar/kitchen staff.

review_426812342~“Fantastic Location”~Had a nice apartment at the Alto for recent stay in Melbourne. Location 2 mins walk from Southern Cross station and tram right outside.

Beautiful comfy bed with lovely crisp sheets. all in all, will definitely stay there again.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_426552199~“A great choice for a stay in Melbourne”~My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a single night and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The location was extremely convenient since we could walk only 5 minutes to Southern Cross Station where the airport bus stops. The hotel staff were extremely courteous and helpful. they allowed us to check in mid morning after we had arrived on a 15 1/2 hour flight from Los Angeles. I phoned the hotel before our stay and was advised that we would get a free hot breakfast if we booked our room on their website. The room and the breakfast were both excellent. The location of the hotel was also convenient for seeing all the sights in the central part of the city by walking.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_425969207~“Comfortable and cosy hotel”~Flopped into this hotel very late after a flight from Venice in July, very tired etc. It was so good - an effective heater in the room, nice hot shower and very comfortable bed.

review_425415735~“Alto experience”~I have stayed at the Alto Hotel for several years now, and always feel so secure, safe and so welcomed there. The rooms are clean (choccies are a nice touch) and adequate in size. but what makes this place so special is the warm, friendly staff who always greet you with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. It is very centralized and close to everything (just a short walk across Spencer St from Southern Cross station) and just near the tram stop as well. Thoroughly recommend this boutique hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_425174242~“Fanstastic”~Localtion, staff, comfort level were all prefect I booked for a business trip with my boss. I booked a studio queen for my boss and a petite queen for myself, but I got upgraded into a studio queen for both nights in the end which I much appreciated. The bed was very comfortable and the TV was magnificemt. I stayed in another hotel of similar price in Melbourne (right across the street actually, for another few days) and understood these cannot be taken for granted... The staff was friendly and helpful. Helped with booking restaurants, looking up of closing times etx. The service was efficient and friendly Also I received a box of chocolate for my second night and I really appreciated it. It may seem tacky and a routine marketing trick according to hotel procedures but I still appreciated it because I was quite strssed for my business trip and I need the chocolate antidepressants! there were complimentary biscuits too for all nights too. In the end, I guess it was these little things that matter most. Overall it was a very stisfactory stay and worth every penny.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_424608269~“Location and value ”~I was in Melbourne on a conference with my wife. We stayed here without recommendations. Soooo glad we did. The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was well appointed and clean, and the wifi was free. The location was so handy to public transport, especially with the free zone around the CBD. The breakfast was delicious, we chose the buffet and menu option. The chef did a fantastic job of our meals every morning. Can't rate this hotel highly enough.

review_423413889~“Great place to stay, close to everything!”~We love staying at the Alto!. It is so easy to catch the Skybus from the airport with just a short walk (about a block) from the bus terminal. The tram stop is close to the hotel to catch into the city or down to St Kilda. If you are going to the football at Etihad, then it is a short walk to get there. There are so many eating places close by as well as a Coles supermarket. The rooms have plenty of room. My husband loves the fact that they have all of the foxtel channels and having free wii fii is a bonus. The beds are sooo comfortable and the shower is awesome. We like the fact that they have a reasonably sized fridge that works well to keep drinks cold. We also like that they supply cutlery and plates with a microwave if you want to make a snack or light meal in your room. They have a relaxation room downstairs which you can hire free of charge. These rooms have 2 massage chairs in them and you can hire the room for half an hour. They have water, proper coffee and tea available all day downstairs as well as apples. You can use computers in this room or sit and relax and read in their library. We will always stay here when we come to Melbourne!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_422267006~“Great choice”~We spend only one night here, however we really enjoyed it. The hotel is very central. The service is really good and the staff is really helpful. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready. Amy tried her best to help us with an early check in, it didn't work in the end but she clearly did her best. Rooms are spacious and comfy. There is a small kitchenette which is useful to make coffee and tea. Our bathroom had a big shower and the products are of good quality. The parking has an extra cost of $20 per day it's quite close and convenient. Happy with our stay. Would certainly consider this hotel again in the future.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422241323~“Great family CBD getaway”~Thoroughly enjoyed an overnight stay with husband and 3yr old son in 2bdrm Superior Room. Friendly, professional and helpful staff. Pre-purchased parking, so after check in we parked the car in the hotel garage and used free tram system around CBD. Easy walking distance to Southern Cross Station. Well appointed apartment with modern technology as standard. Mini bar prices very reasonable for example $3.50 soft drink, $8 small bottle wine. Room service was efficient and the Minestrone Soup tasted homemade and was seriously delicious! The conti buffet breakfast is good value, with options to upgrade. The Big Breakfast is huge. Loved the automatic coffee machine in the lounge which makes a good coffee or hot chocolate any time of day or night. Looking forward to returning soon.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

So many little extra delights in the room, like a bathroom scale even. Very sound proof room. Slight bit of noise from the Royal Melbourne Hotel across the road. But room was extremely clean and very comfortable. TV in bedroom also and both had free Foxtel. No extra for Wi-Fi. Check out the relaxation room downstairs behind the library. What a delight. All the staff where extra polite and friendly and very helpful. I loved absolutely everything about Alto. Location is fantastic, with so many convenient things very close. Best place with the best attitude's and eco friendly awesome policies.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
