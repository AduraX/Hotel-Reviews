review_474555811~“Everything You Need”~My two children and I stayed here, we were visiting from rural Victoria and had a night in Melbourne to see the Vixens train at the State Netball Centre, and we visited a friend of our family undergoing treatment at the Royal Children's Hospital. Both places are an easy walk. Our room was 22, at the back of the complex, a queen/double and a single, and everything in the room was spotless and modern, and very welcoming. The price was more than reasonable, and my husband, in particular, was impressed by the large security gates that are closed at 11, and opened at 7am (he dropped us off). Welcoming reception, clean and modern interior. No complaints from us, and yes, we would stay. The Only drawback, if I was being picky, is the slight road noise....but....it's Melbourne :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451600260~“Quiet and comfortable”~I used this motel as a base for exploring outside the Melbourne area, and it worked well. Being near major roads meant getting out of the city quickly (and to/from the airport) was relatively easy, but being on a major road also limited the options for entering the premises - basically, only a left turn off Flemington Road. This meant some tricky u-turns in order to get in the extreme left lane in order to turn in - best plan this ahead of time. With a rear apartment there was no road noise at all - it was a nice quiet room, very modern (new tiled bathroom) and quiet air conditioner. The motel offers basic $5 breakfasts which where exactly what I wanted. The WiFi isn't reliable in the rear apartments (fine okay at reception or the breakfast room). Staff very helpful and friendly.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444983951~“Disorganised and Dishonest”~Rooms booked: We booked 4 months ahead for 2 superior apartments and 1 family apartment. Based on what is given on booking.com, the beds should be sufficient and are not makeshift beds. They should be proper beds in the apartment. Rooms given when checked in: 1 apartment with existing beds for 4 {correct}, 1 apartment with existing beds for 3 plus one roll-up bed {incorrect as it should be existing beds for 4} and 1 apartment with existing beds for 4 plus one roll-up bed {incorrect as it should be existing beds for 5 }  Common sense tells us something is wrong since none of the 2 apartments out of the booked were the same. When asked, they were unable to explain why we are given roll-up beds and the apartments does not match what we booked. We had specifically booked the 3 apartments because of the existing beds as we did not want roll-up beds. In summary, we did not get what we had booked for. We noticed that they uses manual tracking of booking. It is likely that they had been overbooked and tried to give us whatever they had to offer on hand to fit 13 pax. When I spoke to the management over the phone, all she asked was “so, what is it that you want?”. Well, the fault was done by them and they did not ever once admit that they did not give us what we had booked. She should suggest what she can do and not ask me what do I want. Apparently, they probably felt that nothing is wrong as long as there are 13 beds [regardless if they are proper beds or roll-up beds]. They are fully booked and that leaves us no other alternatives. After some discussion, they only offered us a $30 refund because we were pissed and rejected one of the roll-up bed. To be frank, 2 of our rooms were “downgraded” and the management just brush it aside like it is no big deal.  Truly disappointed with them. They should be honest with us when we checked in. All of desk staff were either afraid to speak to us {one Caucasian old man quickly ran off when we asked why are the rooms different} or very rude when the speak to us {a Chinese lady who called herself Pam – guess that is not her name as she was hesitant in sharing her name when I asked her} . I shared with her that we are not unreasonable people but we do not like to be treated like fools. I also shared with her that NO ONE even bother to apologize for the mess they created. They cannot handle 3 apartment booking and make a mess by giving wrong rooms to the wrong family. All we need as angry and mistreated customers is to be treated sincerely. A good sincere apology would have worked things out. Unfortunately, I must say frankly that our stay there was tainted by their lousy management and handing of situation.  Rooms design was bad as stated by other travelers but nothing too bad for us. Cleanliness in the apartments were fine but they placed clean pillows on the floor and I had a "cleaned" towel which has many stands of blond hair on it. Guess depends on your luck. Kitchen stuff were adequate and clean. Will I come back again? NO WAY. I am sure there are better apartment out there for us at competitive prices too. Suggest management to manage their bookings better and not mess up again for future travelers.~1~2~3~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_444277794~“Clean rooms”~I stayed two nights this month, the room was spotless with good fittings The motel is in a good location but can be a bit hard to access for the first time if driving  The outside could certainly do with a bit of a revamp but this doesn't detract from the rooms~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442051022~“Great place to stay in Melbourne”~Good value for money, large clean well-furnished rooms (even has laundrette) - would certainly stay there again. Train and tram almost at the door. Only drawback is the location in an older suburb with a mix of light industry and housing. There are no shops or restaurants anywhere close unless you're prepared to go to town or else walk for 20 minutes. And Flemington Rd (which you have to cross to get to the trams and trains) is one of the most dangerous I have ever seen. There are at least 5 push button pedestrian controlled crossings needed just to get to the other side.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_430439217~“Good value and comfort”~Drove from Sydney to the Grand Final at late notice, booked this place on the net, only 10-15mins from MCG by cab, plenty of public transport nearby though. Rooms had been renovated and were very comfortable especially after a long drive, great value as well. Serviced every day with fresh towels and a clean bathroom, would highly recommend as it is also close to flemington for the races.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_418275069~“Wow! What a change!”~We have always stayed in Park Squire when we visit Melbourne. We must say there has been a great improvement since refurbishment of themotel rooms and apartment. We are amazed and impressed with the new look. Definitely more cosy and feels at home. Only that Wi-fi seemed lagging. May need to improve on having a faster router for internet efficiency. Nevertheless, good job on those refurbishment.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_412828431~“Comfy Bed”~The bed was comfy and the room a good size. The pillow was just right and not too high..Lots of stairs to drag your heavy suitcase up so would not recommend for the elderly or sick. Basic room servicing was done each day but the milk and coffee were not replenished.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_409069301~“A good night's sleep”~The best bed ever not to had or soft just a really good night's sleep. Tram stop at the front door. Stayed in a newly renovated one bedroom apartment that had everything you could ask for. The staff were very welcoming, would recommend it for any one needing to stay close to the city at a reasonable price.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_399412133~“Apartment - great value, clean and comfortable ”~Booked a weekend in Melbourne, stayed two nights here. Have previously stayed in one of the renovated rooms, this time stayed in the serviced apartment section up the back. Easy online booking, pleasant staff, good location (just off the freeway for us), clean furnishings, amazingly well stocked kitchen, modern bathroom. Really enjoyed our stay here! Will stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_372011412~“Pleasantly surprised, great accommodation”~We stayed here for 2 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment with our 3 children. On arriving we were greeted by a friendly and welcoming lady in the reception. She was polite and helpful. When you park your car (complimentary on site parking) don't be put off as the exterior of the motel is a little tired looking, because once you get inside you will be pleasantly surprised. Our apartment was completely renovated. Great kitchen, wonderful comfortable beds and was very clean. Definitely s great and extremely affordable option to stay in Melbourne. Only a couple of minutes from the Melbourne zoo and tram stops just out the front. Definitely recommend!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_371074674~“Overnight city stay”~Ok we had a family function . In north melbourne and wanted to stay close by with out spending to much we booked a newly renovated two bedroom. This cost $175 for a sat night. apartment .that was roomy and clean eta. Just note there are stairs like a city apartment block .no lifts which was ok for us we had 1 room for 3 people 1 for 2 people . Two people was $130.00. And included parking .trams right in front.they are renovating it still so there are building material eta at the moment . Here are some photos of the two bedroom newly furnished app.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369453568~“Under renovations”~We had a few rooms booked with family and some members got newly renovated rooms which were great - BUT the old rooms not done yet are in a terrible state. ASK for a renovated room. Once completed it should be good.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_366439557~“Quick visit”~We made a quick visit to Melbourne and chose this hotel because of the location and price. From the outside it looks a little tired but we were pleasantly surprised. We arrived late evening and the gentleman on reception was helpful when we booked in. We were lucky enough to have free parking at the hotel. Our room was a refurbished room that was clean and comfortable. It was serviced each day, so great to come back to a tidy, clean room each day. Even though it says there is free wifi, it was a bit hit and miss, but that was the only drawback. The tram is located outside to take you into the city. It looked like they are working to upgrade the whole place. The staff were friendly whenever we saw them. We would gladly stay here again.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_364533038~“WYSIATI”~What You See Is All There Is - and for those who aren't prone to boasting to friends about how central or expensive their hotel was, this is as good as it gets and all you need - a very good motel with good service and clean good sized rooms at a great price. It doesn't get any better than this. We were In Melbourne for a weekend wedding so wanted something close-ish to the CBD and tram lines so we could get to our daughter in Ascot Vale. This motel fit the bill perfectly. The rooms are a good size for a couple, very clean, well laid out and for the price, excellent value for money. There's a service station over the road with a 7/11 where you can top up your Myki card for the trams. The desk top style ironing board was a bit tricky, but once mastered it did the trick on the shirt for the wedding. The rooms are up one level so the cars fit underneath. For those who might need help with their suitcases, ask the front desk when you book. If you're a bit of a princess when it comes to noise take some ear plugs because it is on a main road. But, this is such good value for money a tiny bit of traffic noise is worth the dollar or two for the price of some ear plugs. We will definitely stay here again, and recommend it to friends.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_363245100~“Just the right size”~Lovely renovated rooms with warm lighting and reverse cycle aircon. Everything was up to date and new. Tidied the room up every day and received new towels etc each day. Staff were helpful. Good value. Tram is right outside the door and very short ride to town.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359533762~“I hope they are upgrading the rooms”~While having a self contained apartment suits our needs when staying in Melbourne, the apartment needs an upgrade. The bathroom has visible mold and the shower screen was broken. The toilet cistern leaked constantly and they even had a bowl underneath but that wasn't enough to stop the toilet floor flooding. When paying $155 a night, I wouldn't expect to be using towels to mop the floor. It was a known problem because the staff happily supplied us more towels to mop up with. For 2 adults and 2 teenagers, it became quite cramped with there being 2 single beds and a couch in the lounge area, a tiny kitchenette and a separate bedroom. Good for 2 people, cramped for 4. Pros- tram stop right out the front. Close to CBD Cons- very dated and needs an upgrade.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358285318~“Good stay”~This apartment was a lot larger than we expected; a living room, bedroom and separate kitchen all at a great Yes it was a little dated but renovations were happening whilst we were staying so can't complain.

review_356916511~“Great Value for money. ”~The best part of this motel is the unbeatable value for money. Well under $200 for a family of 4 with two teenage kids. This motel is in the middle of renovations, but don't be put off by the dated looking reception area. The apartment we had was newly renovated and spotless. It was a little cramped for a family of 4 but we were only staying for one night. It had a fully self contained kitchen and could sleep 5 people comfortably. There was plenty of parking and we were close to public transport that took us straight into town by tram. Convenience store was close by to get a few groceries. I'd happily stay again next time I'm in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356479490~“2nd maybe last visit ”~Family and Grand parents shared 3 bedroom 3 others had 2 units. All there for wedding. Daily servicing very late (after 4pm) and not easy to communicate. Leak from shower upstairs right over kitchen bench. Looked like old patch job. Only plus was handiness to all transport. While double glazed still lot of road noise from intersection and aussies loving their 1st 200m in their muscle cars. Owners vow they didn't have a spare key when one member inadvertently took theirs away. Very poor customer service discussion. We got it back to them after 2 days.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356075971~“As you would expect”~The staff were kind and accommodating. Units just had enough space for sleeping and the kitchen was quite small. Coin washers and dryers were available at the ground floor. There was ample parking, most were even covered. A tram station was right in front of the inn. Across is a 7 Eleven where you can purchase and top up your myki (the reusable transpo card in Melbourne). There are also restaurants 10-15 minutes by foot from the place. The rooms needed to be updated 10-15 years ago. We noticed that someone would come in to just replace the towels and take the trash daily. No other form of cleaning was apparent on most days.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_346086665~“Perfect for our needs”~We recently spent 5 days in Melbourne so we booked an apartment. We had a hire car which was a bonus however if you don't, there is a tram stop pretty much outside the door. The apartment had just been refurbished and everything was brand new. It had everything we needed for our stay. The kitchen was lovely and everything was supplied, however the space for the small dining table and chairs was a little bit squeezy. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was small but adequate. There is a 24 hr 7/11 shop and service station across the road which is handy. We will stay here again.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_345658505~“Will not be staying here again - not a suitable business accomodation”~I was booked into this accomodation for a week whilst attending a workshop at Melbourne Uni. I won't ever be going back. It might be okay for budget / backpackers First impressions from the outside were that it was tired and run down, in need of a good clean and paint. The reception is awkward to get into with your luggage as it comes off the very steep driveway. I had been allocated a room in the units right up the very back - it was more like a frat house. After having to drag a very heavy suitcase up to the third floor the unit was basic, and whilst it appeared to be clean enough a close look revealed that to be a surface clean - there was thick dust along the edges of carpet and behind things. The worst part of this was the noise - not just the traffic noise but the noise from the units. The building is old, again looking tired and echoes a lot. Every time a self closing door closed it made a loud bang, and people coming in and out made for a very noisy stay. What made it worse was the drunk and loud people carrying on in the stairwell and foyer each night. I did not get a single good night's sleep, there was no phone to contact reception, or it was after reception was closed. After putting up with this for a few nights I decided to leave early and when I mentioned the noise to the reception staff I was grilled about who it had been, what unit they had come from, and why I hadn't confronted them - because confronting strangers in the middle of the night, especially those that have been drinking would not possibly be risky! Other problems are the lack of anywhere to source food locally - save a service station across the road and the so called wifi that was included was patchy and unreliable. Very disappointed as a business traveller I won't be staying there again.~2~nan~nan~1~nan~2~2~nan
review_345500804~“Great weekend getaway”~Recently had weekend here & was pleasantly surprised. Might not look much from outside but reception staff were polite and friendly - happy to do what they can to improve your stay. Room had obviously been recently renovated and was very comfortable. Great bed and shower - always important :-) Tram stop just across the road which takes you straight into the city. Also close to the Zoo - 20 minute walk. Very handy! Would definitely consider staying again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_343618400~“Get what you pay for”~The room (15) we stayed in was nicely renovated, which is good because the rest of the place looks tired and past its prime. While a bit on the small side for $159, the free parking and wifi make up for some of it and fair enough, the room has everything you could need. Big screen tv, sizeable fridge, small desk, sort of comfortable chair and even an iron and board for when the mood strikes. The bathroom is new and the shower is good and warm. On the downside, the thin walls, ill fitting front door and single glass windows do nearly nothing to stop sound coming in from the street and there's a lot of noise from Flemington road, the trams, trucks and people. Great to stay for one night when on business or househunting (like us).~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_343054026~“Good and few distance away from city”~Good stay in for few nights.Zoo is just walking distance. Friendly environment. opposite to petrol kiosk station which you can purchase food/ drinks and myki card. Bed so comfortable. Facilities with fridge/tv plasma/iron board etc. I would recommend people to stay here as it is also family apartment..Tram station is just few walk outside from apartment. Less noise at night. Definitely will come again to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342531220~“Surprisingly very good”~Was very hard to get accomm in Melb during the tennis and ended up booking here. I was very sceptical and upon checking in, was told I had a newly renovated room, finished only that day. The apartment was very nice, modern and a very comfy bed. I was very pleasantly surprised. Nice staff and good parking.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_342065676~“A real mix match”~I am really sorry, but this place left me extremely underwhelmed, but there are a couple of good points too.  The undercover & secure parking was the main reason I choose to stay here, & the Asian lady was extremely generous when asked about parking facilities for my daughter after we had left, & I am extremely grateful to her for her kindness. The bedding & curtains in the apartment were clean & comfortable - the net or lace curtains were grossly dirty in the lounge. That I am afraid where the good ends.. We were in an apartment, which was fine, as we asked for a quiet location. On walking through the downstairs doors, I absolutely wanted to retch - the smell was worse than disgusting & stayed that way for length of our 4 day stay. Although currently renovating - well overdue & very much needed, the place is very tired & run down. Our apartment, although clean, smelled - the windows were left open as far & as often possible to get the smell out. The bathroom taps leaked permanently, the medicine cabinet doors were warped & could not close, the shower over the bath is vert low, the towels should have been thrown out after Noah's ark sailed - they were just short of thread bare. I think the renovation workers may have been staying down stairs, given the noise & I do apologise, the very geasy & sickening smell of cooking that came through the windows at night. I guess what really peeved me off, was the poor attitude of the staff member when we booked in, coupled with the fact that I had to ask for my credit card back no less than three times, as it had been left in the desk drawer. This place has such great potential, & maybe once the renovations are complete, may be nice, but what we experienced was an absolute dump. I don't normally give poor reviews, rather looking for something more positive, but this place just left me cold.~3~1~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_341533821~“Great value accommodation”~We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment for 6 nights in January, my husband and I and our adult daughter. The beds were firm but comfortable, including a full sized bed in the living room. The apartment was a bit shabby because it hadn't yet been renovated (renovations are in progress at this motor inn), but it was clean and very well equipped, and was extremely good value. There were new aircon units in both rooms and they worked perfectly. It's not in the CBD, but the tram is right outside, and there is also a train stop nearby. The place is on a very busy intersection, but we were very happy with the lack of road noise in our apartment at the rear of the property. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and I'd recommend this as a place to stay for someone on a budget.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_341384094~“Free wifi, free parking, close to Netball/Hockey centre and zoo”~We stayed here for three nights, principally because it was close to the Netball/Hockey centre and we were going to watch a basketball game there on our first night in Melbourne, we were able to park our car (free) underneath the apartments and walk to the game. We came home and I was able to put a load of washing on and hang it on provided mini-clothes lines/airers (there is a dryer as well) the next morning, before we had a lovely breakfast in the apartment and then we walked to the Zoo, afterwards caught the tram into town and went to the museum etc. That night my daughter and I caught Tram 57 back into town and went to Fiddler on the Roof at the Princess Theatre. The tram stop is directly across the road on the Cnr of Church St. Would stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_335528424~“Poor service!”~We stayed in the one bedroom bedroom apartment, which was not ready for check in time to begin with. Then the door is jammed in a way that you need to pull it towards you in order for it to open, which we weren't told about so we stood like lemons trying to open it before we plodded down to reception to enquire about it.  We were also under the impression that there would be an oven in the one bedroom apartment, as it specifies on the website (see picture), which we told reception that they can not falsely advertise having an oven in the one bedroom apartment if they do not have them. This was extremely disappointing for us, because we had planned to cook christmas dinner, and it was one of the reasons we choose Park Squire's serviced apartment. We did inform reception that we were not happy, however the young man on reception denied that it said so on their website, even though we have clear proof that it does. And no apology was given at all. The "unlimited" wifi is laughable, the internet cuts out for hours on end, on the last day of our stay the internet was down from 1pm until 6.30pm, so if you are planning on coming here for business and hoping to get good wifi, you should think again. Everyday the internet at some point stopped working for a few hours, which is a big issue and really should be updated.  On the small plus side of this apartment was that the apartment itself is in okay condition, the beds are comfy enough and the bathroom looks like it had been recently renovated. However, the poor service at this hotel was the biggest negative for us, it was as if the staff didn't care about the problems we had explained to them.~1~nan~2~3~nan~nan~1~nan

review_327770220~“Nice surprise”~Not my usual booking as I usually like a pool and bar but I was here for business. Arrived to be greeted by a view that made me question if I had booked an ok place and then realised/ hoped they were under taking renovations.  I checked in with pleasant staff and upon entering my room relaxed. The room was fantastic and modern. Heaps of room and a awesome big tv which was positioned well.  Heaps of under cover parking.  Free wifi but to slow for what I needed so I used my own. A option for room service. Which was handy.  I had to deal with staff again before retiring and again I was very happy with how helpful they were.  Thank you for a comfortable stay and I definitely recommend a booking at park squire motor inn  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_320809450~“Dissapointing”~Stayed here for five nights in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment looked like it had been partially renovated with a new kitchen. Unfortunately we found the beds uncomfortable and the hot water was lukewarm at best. The room had a musty smell and the traffic noise meant that you really could not open the windows. Our children wanted to find another hotel! On the upside, transport is very close with a tram stop outside the motel and the train station across the road.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_317036948~“Grand Final Week Accomodation”~Fully renovated Queen Room was excellent. A few stairs to climb but the room was worth it. Very clean, fabulous bathroom, continuous hot water and great water pressure. Bed too hard for me but my husband liked it. Outside looks aweful but when renovations are completed I'm sure it will be good. Lady in reception was very helpful and went out of her way to supply whatever was needed.

review_309642333~“Another great stay in wonderful Melbourne.”~Second time staying at park squire and it was just as good as the 1st time. Staff were all very friendly. Rooms were modern and extremely clean. Park Squire is in a very convenient location with a tram stop within a 2 min easy walk from the hotel. The tram line runs past many of the major hospitals like royal children's and royal womens and shopping centers like Queen Vic Markets and Melbourne central. If traveling by train from the country it's just a short train ride from Southern Cross to flinders and then a tram ride to hotel. How easy is that. Highly recommended to all.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_306177114~“Ok for budget stay”~We've stayed at Park Squire several times over the last few years. The apartment is clean, though some of the amenities/ items e.g. dining table and sofa can be quite old in appearance. One of the good reasons why we choose to stay here is because of its location - few stops to Victoria Market and city. Hotel rates are pretty reasonable. They have private parking lots - good for visitors who drive. It will be good if the rooms are fitted with heater as it gets really cold in Winter! Good to have room slippers provided as the bathroom toilet flooring is cold to walk on. Free Internet access is provided but lagging most of the time and we got cut off pretty often.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_299045344~“Location and thats it!”~My husband, myself and 13 year old daughter stayed here only for the night for a Royal Children's Hospital appointment. It is walking distance to the hospital. It was not clean, the tv/lounge was in the room with the single bed. Found unused (still in packet) Band-Aids in the double bed . Very outdated bathroom where simple cover ups had been done. Shower over bath and my husband could not stand under it. Hairdryer was in bathroom but did not work. Our room was non smoking but it filled with the smell of cigarette smoke coming from somewhere. It was 10 degrees we certainly didn't have any windows open. I don't care if it costs a bit more next time, a night in a motel should be a bit of an escape not a place that makes you want to race home to your own house.~2~nan~nan~nan~1~1~4~nan
review_297818137~“An old favourite revitalised”~We've stayed at the Park Squire several times over the last few years, and found it clean and friendly, but definitely showing its age. On our last visit, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the owners have carried out major renovations to the motel section (and are moving on to the apartments). Our motel room was freshly renovated, with a very comfortable new bed, and a lovely shiny new bathroom. The location is very convenient to the University and several hospitals, there is a tram stop almost at the door, and it's only five minutes' walk to the nearest railway station. We are always happy to drive in, park the car and take to Melbourne's excellent public transport system. The owners are pleasant and helpful and while I've recommended this motel before, I can now do so with even more enthusiasm. Don't be put off by the rather faded entry - that will be renovated in due course.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_293428964~“Great Location and above Average Stay”~Great location – at the junction of two major intersections and with tram stops near by. The hotel rates are pretty reasonable if you are not interested in fancy properties. The rooms were neat and simple. The wifi had pretty good connectivity and speeds. Stayed there for three nights and did not have any issues worth mentioning except that with parking. There is limited space to park and if you are late coming back you might end up having to park in the driveway outside the gate! I would have expected the reception guy to inform me about this rather than finding it out myself.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_289712159~“Great short stay”~Book a refurbished room specifically due to previous reviews and wasn't disappointed. Small but clean and new layout with a great powerful shower. Free wifi was also welcome.  Close to city so ideal for my short stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_289377371~“New suite room 16”~Nice modern room in the refurbished part of motel suite section. Comfy queen bed with clean fresh linen. Slightly more traffic noise because these rooms closer to road. Great under cover free parking which we can leave car to attend hospital appointments for the day. Noted was more attention to detail than the older apartment part of motel in which stayed previous month. The older apartment section is at the back and depending on room you may have to carry bags up stairs. Must say the older part is very tired and not so clean. Have stayed here numerous times and would consider again because of location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_289010092~“Quite surprising”~This facility is under refurbishment, we booked through wotif late on a friday night, flying out next morning to be with family members at Royal Melbourne Children Hospital as newly born granddaughter underwent surgery, so this was a rushed trip, and the only accommodation we could get at such short notice. Yes the room did need a lick of paint, yes there where a couple of cracked tiles... The management are refurbishing, and we will definetly check this facility first if we travel to Melbourne again. Our apartment was spacious (we were expecting a motel style room.....WRONG!) we had a spacious bedroom with comfortable double bed, more blankets and pillows if required, Large bathroom, fully equipped kitchen, and a spacious lounge room, small balcony off (too cold for us at the moment) sofa bed, dining table desk, tv with usb stick facilities, I was very impressed with the potential once the refurbishments are done. The other main attractions for us was that the tram was nearby, and ran frequently, 7/11 across the road for supplies, and within easy walking distance of the hospital.  If you are a family visiting this is within easy walking distance of the Melbourne Zoo.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_288361974~“Not quite what we expected...”~Be careful when on wotif pictures did look good, but the reality is not the case. Old facilities, hot water runs out, water stains, chipped tiles, tired generally. Our friends who we were traveling with didn't have their room ready and it was 2 hours after check in. It ended up being cosy enough for us, heaters worked well and clean bedding but we think it just needs to live up to its description and pictures on line.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_278922220~“Was worried reading reviews, but turned out excellent!”~From the outside it looks seedy, but on the inside, the newly renovated Queen room was absolutely lovely. Parking included which is a bonus! It is in a bit of an awkward location in terms of going on to the freeway, but good for trams and trips to the zoo.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_274339223~“Great and valuable 4 nights stay”~Stayed here five times since 2012. Location is terrific, close to everything. We are surprised that a young fellow working at reception upgraded us to a fully renovated room for just small amount of money. Could not fault the new room. It has everything we needed, plus the shower pressure is excellent and we do love that heat light in the bathroom, it kept us warm in this freezing weather.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_269440234~“Great stay”~The newly renovated rooms were great. Very modern and comfortable. Close to any attractions like the zoo. Loved undercover secure parking. Would definitely stay here again. Room was right next to major road but hardly heard any cars during the night.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_268383962~“Paid good money for this?”~Do not stay here. The owner is rude and unapproachable. Left a expensive bottle of perfume in my room (which went missing) when asked reception , was told blatant ( nothing here) . Very upset about this as my daughter had just bought this for me. I will never ever stay here again and will tell others not to as well. And to the owners, teach your self and staff manners, it goes a long way. And don't touch things that don't belong to you.~1~2~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan
