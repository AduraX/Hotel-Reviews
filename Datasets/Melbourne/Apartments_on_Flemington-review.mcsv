review_424213279~“Stayed here a few times for long and short stays, in lots of different rooms”~We have stayed here numerous times while our daughter was a patient at the royal childrens hospital. Our first stay was for 3 months from August 2014-November 2014, we stayed in a one bedroom apartment and the room was fine. We had a full kitchen, fridge, TV and wifi. We then stayed there a few times for a few nights between august 2015-February 2016  More recently we lived there from March 2016 till August 2016, we had 2 different rooms during this time both 1 bedroom apartments the only difference being the second one was slightly larger and had 2 double beds, the other room had a double and single. which isn't ideal for long stays with a child as their bed is in the loungeroom. We stayed here because it was close by to the Children's hospital and we needed to spend time there while our daughter was having cancer treatment.  It is also close by to the Royal Melbourne hospital, Royal Women's hospital and Peter MacCallum cancer center. There is also an IGA 2 blocks down for groceries or a small supermarket at the Children's hospital. The staff were always friendly, helpful and courteous. The rooms are services once a week on Mondays with new linens, and the coffee and sugar replaced. Bins can be emptied every weekday, towels are replaced Monday, Wednesday and Friday. We asked to just have our room done every Monday as we didn't want to be disturbed every day, but if our daughter was out of hospital on that day and we let them know they would also do it on a day we weren't there so she could rest. It is a great place to stay for long or short stays, it gets used a lot for patients having appointments or treatment at the hospitals so can be booked out a lot.  There are 2 different trams that run straight past the front of the property, tram number 59 and 55.  Its on 15 minutes on the tram into central Melbourne (Bourke st Mall tram 59) 10 minutes on tram 55 to the market, 15 minutes to the casino. The children's hospital is only 2 stops up on either tram~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_395301327~“Just the thing for handy hospital locations”~Spent four nights in a studio unit was very roomy clean and all that we needed for a very enjoyable visit to Melbourne we wanted to take the huge bed home it was that comfortable ,all amenities were ample for our needs staff were obliging and very friendly could not ask for a better experience although traffic noise along Flemington Rd took some getting used to.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_367508279~“good value and helpful staff”~I stayed in a studio apartment. It was large but the bathroom was old and out dated. Flemington Rd is very noisy and I struggled to sleep. The position on the aircon in the window makes it impossible to close the blinds and have the aircon on, so the room was either warm or not dark enough. Staff very helpful and friendly. Very clean.~3~4~nan~1~nan~nan~4~nan
review_348200397~“Stay due to medical reason”~Very neat and tidy. Easy check in. Clean and fresh. Near to Royal Melbourne Hospital complex and trams. Has an IGA and 7/eleven for emergancy supplies but recomend a trip to a coles/woolworths for food supplies if staying longer. Am here for medical procedure and wife and kids came along for mral support and the suite we have suited our needs just fine.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_341601740~“Very convenient spot & roomy apartment.”~We stayed in a Studio apartment for 9 nights. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious with all we needed. We did have to clean a couple of pots & plates before we could use them but otherwise the room was clean. The Apartment block is in a great location for getting into the City with Trams running right outside. Also handy to Hospitals, the Zoo, great Pubs & Restaurants, and the IGA express close by was well stocked with all supplies we needed. Also very friendly and helpful Managers made the stay a good one. Would recommend the apartments as a great place to stay on a visit to Melbourne, and at reasonable cost.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_338376834~“Home away from home”~Stayed at a 1 bedroom apartment with a pre-schooler for 2 weeks and it was great. The management was very nice and accommodating. When we eventually moved to a rented apartment, they reached out to us regarding mail we received and held on to a book we accidentally left behind until we were able to get it.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_333411563~“Cozy and value for money”~It is abt 3 tram stops away fro Vic Market. It is considered accessible. But it is not in the free tram zone. You have to pay and per trip is abt AUD 3 +.  What I like is cozy room that was well maintained and it has a kitchenette. Owners are very friendly people =) We stayed facing the road... All i remember was the birds were noisy. You may want to request for rooms facing the other side of the hotel.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_327224542~“Good value for money”~Stayed here for 4 days in October in the One bedroom apartment. I was very happy with it. Good value for money. It is an older style apartment but it was clean and quite spacious. 1bdr apartment has a Double bed, a single bed and a pull out couch/sofa. There is also a small table with a kitchenette.  The bathroom is located off the bedroom though, so if someone is sleeping on the single bed (which is located in the lounge room) they will need to go through the bedroom itself to get to the bathroom/toilet. Bed was reasonably comfortable. There is also a large wardrobe and full length mirror which is handy for us girls! Staff were excellent and were able to help us out with our queries. (Even sent back my phone charge to me when I left it behind!) It is located close in the North Melbourne area but it was only a quick tram ride into the city itself.  There is a small IGA Grocery store nearby that also has a small liquor shop for those wanting some alcohol. There is also a decent cafe a street away as well. Head to up to Errol Street (5-10 min walk) for nearby restaurants etc...  This is not a 4-5 Star hotel, but it is good value for money if you're trying to save your pennies. Note: Keep the windows closed - lots of flies! ;)~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_292824182~“Fantastic value for money :-)”~We were pleasantly surprised with our stay. We stayed 3 nights in a one bedroom apartment. The owners are super nice and very helpful, giving us travel advice and locations for various things. The location is great, close to hospitals, zoo and Queen Vic market, with mini supermarket 1 block away. Tram stop right out the front, ultra convenient!!! Our room was clean and had nice new table and chairs and sofa. Big plus is the linen on the beds, it was all crisp, white and new, with lovely fuzzy mink blankets over that. Kitchen well equipped to cook all your own meals etc. They gave us a portacot and high chair to use for our infant which was lovely. Pleasantly surprised when we brought our own cot bedding (wasn't sure if it was provided) and found they had left us more lovely fresh new linen and also a fuzzy mink blanket for our infant too :-) Coin operated laundry was very convenient, they have vending machines as well. You can borrow DVD's and magazines for free (another nice surprise). Price was one of the best I had found (we were on a budget) and for such a great place, happy to pay this to stay here again We had the best sleep we'd ever had in any accommodation, we were not woken up by anything at all, not traffic or footsteps outside or anything. Such a pleasant surprise!!! :-D The only setbacks are that there is no lift, so if you're not medically capable of doing stairs you have to take your chances if you can get a ground floor room. thankfully I travelled with 2 able bodied guests who could carry all our luggage and my child up the stairs but I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own due to a medical condition. Only other setback is the parking spaces are quite compact, we had a medium sized car (kia cerato) and struggled with having to squeeze into the drivers seat as we were against the brick wall, if someone had parked next to us I don't think we would have been able to get our daughter into her car seat. So if you have a large car maybe arrange parking elsewhere. Also if you are parked in the second row and someone is parked over the exit to the left you are boxed in, so be aware of this (we moved our car to the first row the night before we had to leave to ensure we weren't boxed in as we had a plane to catch) Overall, thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again, wouldn't hesitate to recommend to fellow travellers :-) well done to the owners on such a great place~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_287159580~“Family in RMH”~Easy to find..  Fist appearance was very clean  Rooms were amazing  Everything you would want for a short stay or a long stay..

review_268481077~“Convenient, tidy & very friendly..!!!”~Stayed here at the end of January 2015.. We had a 1 bedroom apartment. It suited us perfectly. So close to the city with a tram stop right out the front. The owners were so helpful. They let us know where to see penguins for free and also that Woolworths and Coles can deliver groceries there prior to your stay... Very helpful. Just as I was leaving they were starting to refurbish the rooms. I'll definately stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_235633135~“Hospital Stay”~Over the past 2 years I have been required to travel to Melbourne on many occasions to support my daughter and grandson while he has undergone a number of surgeries. During this time I have had the pleasure of staying at the North Melbourne Serviced Apartments where I have had the privilege of meeting Octavian. These visits have been quite stressful and challenging for myself, Octavian has at all times assisted to make these times a little easier by assisting me with my bags, navigation around the city, recommends restaurants and even directed me to a nice coffee shop. I have always found Octavian to be very respectful and courteous to myself and I’m always greeted with a smile. Octavian is always more than willing to help with any special requests that I need to make in regards to my grandson.  We have stayed in different apartments ( only with balcony) and we can say that the apartments are clean , very well appointed and fully self-contained in a secure environment.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_230080083~“Great staff and wonderful location”~I stayed at the North Melbourne Services Apartments for about a month and was very happy with my stay there. The room I stayed in was great for the price; it was secure, functional and clean. The best aspect of the stay however was the staff, who were incredibly helpful and friendly. The location is superb, very close to the hospital and so much to do in the vicinity (zoo, parks, shopping, market, CBD). I would highly recommend North Melbourne Serviced Apartments.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_227192963~“location only”~I am only giving this place two stars - one for location; as we were in Melb for daughters heart surgery it was very close to RCHM. Secondly, friendly and co-operative staff. However the condition of the room was far from the 4 stars indicated on the sign out front. We had non-functioning TV remote, shower screen door fell apart, mould on shower tiles and ceiling, loose paint work in shower cubicle, old and marked furniture, toilet door didn't close. Unfortunately very disappointing, except for location........~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_226758365~“A Great Place to Stay”~This review is long overdue. I stayed at the North Melbourne Service Apartments for a year. At first, the reason I decided to stay there because it was conveniently located. It was a few step to the tram stop (either going into the city or to the Melbourne zoo) and to the Royal Children’s Hospital where I trained. A block away is a wonderful breakfast place that I always visit when I want a treat. If you walk a little further, there’s a few restaurants which serve excellent food and a convenience store isn’t far from there. There is also an Australia Post in the Royal Melbourne Hospital which is across the street from the IGA.  As time passed, I realized it was home away from home. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I started every year of my day with either Octavian or Larissa wishing me a good day and I ended each day with them asking how my day went. They always make sure I had everything I needed and they sometimes would go out of their way to help me out. I did not regret the decision I made to stay for a year and when I do visit Melbourne again, I will definitely stay there again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_226131317~“Convenient and affordable”~i booked the apartment for a 4 night stay on the internet, arriving past the check-in time and calling ahead of time i was able to get the keys from a safe at the front. The apartment was fairly clean upon walking in.And being in a very convenient location close to the hospital and within walking distance to the tram stop was a bonus. Everything was also within close distance to the apartment, making travelling easier and not having to wait overly long for the next tram. By having the zoo close by was also a bonus as my sister and i wanted to visit the zoo and as we had never been to Melbourne before this trip and wanted to experience all things touristy. The tram made travelling around easier and didn't take overly long to get to places to see the attractions. Melbourne aquarium, the markets, shopping centres etc, were all within walking distance to public transport.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_225161874~“Serviceable and friendly”~The key things that made our four month stay enjoyable we're the incredibly helpful and friendly staff (nothing was too much trouble including helping carry heavy bags up from the car to the third floor), proximity to the North Melbourne village in Errol St for supermarkets, cafés etc and secure undercover parking included. The location is close to both the Melbourne and Children's Hospital, Royal Park, the Zoo and with a trams top just outside it is easy to travel around the city although it is only 30 minutes walk to the CBD and just 10 mins to Vic Market. Our apartment on the top floor was light, clean and comfortable although the facilities are dated and consistent with a three star rating.~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_224200940~“accomodation”~we booked the apartment for one night on the internet, on arrival the receptionist had to open the garage door with a long pole, why I don't know? .Our apartment was probably the worst we have ever stayed in, the tables & chairs were badly scratched & discoloured, the shower was badly covered in mould on the tiles & on the ceiling ( didn't dare use it) no fly wire screen on the toilet window. The room smelled of Asian cooking ,we had to leave all the windows open to try to air the room but to no avail. Only way to turn the TV on is at the power point & turn off at power point, the paint work is a disgrace as it appears to be done by somebody who has no idea as to how to paint, for all of this we paid AUD189 for 1 night.~1~1~5~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_217456638~“Convenient”~Close to Royal Melb Hosp, walking distance, tram stop at practically front door, excellent and helpful staff. There were restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The city is just a short tram ride away. Victoria Market is also close by. We had everything we needed to ensure a comfortable stay while a family member was recovering from a major surgery. We had no problems booking it online.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_216131261~“Very convenient, walking distance to the hospital”~We stayed here recently and chose this because it was close to the childrens hospital. While we only had to be there overnight for or sons appointments the place would be great for an extended stay as well. The kitchen was fully equipped, there is a general store 1 block away and also some great little restaraunts nearby as well. The bathroom needed an overhaul, but other than that the place was great. The staff were very accommodating & even offered to let us leave our car in the overnight car parking for the day so that we didn't have to pay for parking at the hospital. They made a potentially stressfull stay very easy!!!~4~5~5~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_215555971~“Handy to Hospital, Congenial and Helpful Staff”~We needed somewhere to stay for an extended period close to Royal Melbourne Hospital. After trying other establishments on previous visits and been disappointed we tried North Melbourne Serviced Apartments this time and were pleasantly surprised. Octavian was a pleasant host and very helpful as were his other staff who kept the apartment well serviced. He assisted with luggage and transport, The rooms were clean and well looked after and there were handy for an extended stay close to hospital. Tariff was quite reasonable and I recommend this hotel if you are looking for accommodation in close proximity to Royal Melbourne hospital. An IGA is close by for shopping. Hospital was in reasonable walking distance and my aged mother was able to walk to it with very little trouble.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_210895495~“Clean and convenient to visit hospital”~I booked last minute for my mother and I when my father was unexpectedly admitted to Melbourne Private Hospital after collapsing at Melbourne Airport, and needing a pacemaker urgently. I had not been to Melbourne for 25 years and did not know the area at all. It was such a relief to be able to find a place to stay just 10 minutes walk from the hospital, and it would be equally convenient to Royal Melbourne, Royal Womens, and Childrens hospitals which are all in a line along Flemington Road. Taxi from airport cost me $46 to hospital. It is a level 10 minute walk to the hotel along Flemington Road. Along the way is a IgA supermarket which is very handy for picking up some food for meals.  If you are looking for 5 star luxury, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for somewhere clean and convenient to stay close to the hospital, then this is it. The Manager Octavian is an absolute gem. He will look after you and is very helpful and understanding indeed. Our apartment had a queen bed in the bedroom , and a double bed in the living room. The bathroom is off the bedroom. There is a nice kitchen with microwave, stove, oven , fridge etc and all cooking utensils and crockery and cutlery. The building is old but everything was clean and well maintained. There are about 5 steps to get into the building and another 8-9 steps to get to the first floor where reception is. There is no lift in the building.  I would highly recommend North Melbourne serviced apartments if you need somewhere clean and convenient to the hospital to stay.~5~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_207409470~“Clean and tidy”~I hesitated to write a review for this property as I am more used to staying in larger hotels. My husband was coming down to Melbourne and we needed somewhere cost effective for a 9 night stay. We booked here because of the cooking facilities, location and price. I will say that the room was adequate, however the bed was extremely uncomfortable, and the toilet sometimes failed to fill properly. The noise from the trams didn't bother us. The area seemed safe, we went out numerous times walking at night without a problem or concern. Whilst we thought the three flights of stairs would be fine for us (at 30 years old) they really did become difficult after you come and go multiple times a day. If you're sensitive to smell, do not stay here. There are multiple automatic air fresheners in the stairwell and it really is overwhelming.  Octavian was very polite and helpful throughout the stay. For me, I probably wouldn't stay here again, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for others that I think it might suit.~3~3~3~1~3~3~4~nan
review_203565609~“Hospital stay”~Our son, who has suffered from debilitating epilepsy most of his life was given the opportunity to have brain surgery at the Royal Melbourne Hospital after earlier evaluation visits from North Queensland. My wife accompanied him as carer and my role was to find suitable accommodation for possibly 4 to 5 weeks. I scoured websites for accommodation handy to RMH , hopefully close to a supermarket type foodstore and with kitchen and laundry facilities. It is difficult to choose accommodation from 3000 km. away but in the end, we settled on North Melbourne Serviced Apartments. I had read a number of client reviews, some stating the building was not new. Well, I can assure people that most hotels in Brisbane regarded a 5 or 6 star are not new either. One lady remarked how she held her nose the whole time she stayed there . Well, hello princess, ever worked in shearing sheds or cattle yards? So, how did I make a decision from a long way away? In the end it was easy. Octavian assured me that my wife and son would be looked after and if they required help, they only had to ask. True to his word, he gave excellent assistance and behaved as a friend. There seem to be some complaints about the nightly tariff. I can only say that having travelled all of Queensland, including the far western country and the Northern Territory before retirement, you don’t judge satisfaction by the nightly room rate. When you are a long way away and concerned for your wife and son, you judge satisfaction by the decency of the accommodation manager and I was not disappointed. Octavian doesn’t seem intent on assessing whether his accommodation is “how many stars”. I can only suggest that when the chips are down, whether your accommodation is 3, 4 or 5 stars is totally irrelevant if you are being looked after and you are close to loved ones. In my opinion, when the chips are down you get real, or at least we do and homely, friendly treatment is very important. Thanks Octavian.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_201861038~“Close to the hospital for an extended stay”~Initially booked for a week stay to coincide with my wife's operation in nearby Royal Melbourne. Due to complications we ended up staying for another two weeks - a total of three weeks all up. The apartment is older style, clean and comfortable. We were lucky enough to get one at the rear of the building away from the street noise. Service from the staff was excellent - very helpful and friendly. Were very accommodating when we had to keep extending our stay as we did not know how long my wife was to be in hospital. Very close to the hospital and tram outside to go into the CBD. Shops in North Melbourne a 10 minute walk,~4~4~5~3~3~4~5~nan
review_199191471~“If you're looking to stay somewhere convenient in North Melbourne these apartments are worth a look”~The apartments are not flash by any means, dated but comfortable and the service is excellent. Do ask for an apartment at the back as the trams can be a little noisy. Perfect for a quick visit where most of what you need to do is in North Melbourne.~4~4~4~nan~3~4~5~nan
review_198997665~“Convenient and comfortable”~If you are looking for luxury, this is not the place to stay. However for price, convenience and comfort it was excellent.  The bathroom and living areas were comfortable, the bedroom cosy but also comfortable.  Some of the furniture was dated but if you are only using the apartment for sleeping, who cares. We were five tram stops from the city, the cost was the same as a motel (but with cooking facilities) and the managers were extremely helpful, polite and offered on several occasions to carry cases, bags and shopping. If we are having a lengthy stay in Melbourne again where we need cooking facilities we will most certainly choose this place again.~3~5~5~nan~5~3~5~nan
review_198141175~“Just average - not your holiday hotel”~I've stayed in a lot of places and get out a lot. From sleeping onteh ground in the outback to very flash places overseas. I sat on this for a few days before reviewing. Unfortuantely this one is not favourable. It would have been acceptable if priced accordingly but for the 2 weeks we were to be in Melb I was out of this motel in 6 nights. We came here on very short notice for urgent heart surgery for our 6 week old baby. Extremely disappointed that we were told we would be charged full rate for the 2 days of the F1 GP. Considering we were not just overnighters I would expect this to be waived. This Motel gets plenty of business from the “sick children industry” and offers a reduced rate for the stays over 4 nights. We were subsidised by medicare for our accommodation so SHAME on you Nth Melb Appts for exploiting this and holding us to ransom when we had no choice. That’s business eh!  Absolutely not recommended for a holiday stay. It is run down, old and dingy. Location is pretty good for getting about but seriously if you plan to impress your favourite person, if you bring them here, they’ll bail on you before the morning and their number will be deleted from your phone and you might have “stingy tightass” keyed into the paintwork of your rented BMW   Have a read of the other reviews, look through the subjectiveness and I would say they are all pretty accurate in their own right. As in other reviews, I am sure I could have had some of the below cons rectified but things like blood on sheets and TV not working is something a proactive host would know before the guest does. 3 star rating is rather generous. I’d classify it as premium road house. Nth Melb Appts does have a market sector and is not accurately priced and portrayed to reflect this. Convenience will not be a drawcard once the Hospital’s new patient family accommodation facility is built. Convenience is the main and only benefit of this motel in my opinion. GOOD • Convenience to hospitals ( Childrens,Womens & Melb) and transport (Tram out front) • Basic and functional • Fundamentally clean • Good location • Not much noise at night • Security is good/ key access when reception unattended • Hosts are quite helpful and friendly but is mostly lip service NOT SO GOOD • Bordering run down/ dingy old room • TV wont operate ( dodgy remote buttons) • Access to rooms is for the able bodied - stairs only • Electrically unsafe extension cord under carpet • Broken items not repaired/removed eg shower screen, soap dispenser • Over priced for 3 star ( and failing to achieve 3 star) worth $80/night • School on South side.. school bell, kids screaming during day, sport & maint on weekend. Not ok if you've been in the hospital late and hoping to rest a bit in the day • Old blood spot stain on pillow case • Daily room servicing limited to 5 minute cleaning out bins/replenish toilet paper • Coffee/tea making but no milk on arrival. Really needed a cuppa when we arrived~3~2~4~3~1~3~3~nan
review_196570435~“Melbourne Short Term”~The Apartments are located in a strategic position for Hospital or city. Octavian the manager and his staff are very helpful indeed. The apartments as such are comfortable and clean, well equipped with all cooking facilities and utilities, really I cant say anything bad, just maybe a little cheaper would be nice, but we all would like more for less. The down side of North Melbourne is the lack of supermarkets, there is an IGA nearby but it offers little range of products which are costly, if nothing else the Queen Victoria Markets are nearby which certainly cater for all. Yes I would say I could recommend it. The only suggestion I would have for future visitors is that if you require late entry or internet advise immediately of you will wait until the morning to receive access codes. Thanks Octavian Cheers Allan~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_195839860~“Overpriced”~We stayed at these apartments (2 sets of grandparents) as our daughter had to have her baby in Melbourne because of the baby's heart complications. We saw other accommodation before we booked this which was MUCH nicer and the same price or less. But our daughter asked us to stay there to look after our 2 yr old grandaughter. The furniture is extremely old and stained. The sofa cushions allow you to sink in to them - no support for anyone, worse for me as I have a chronic back condition. These apartments are advertised as "serviced" but they are only serviced every few days, though the carpet is vacuumed, the linen is not changed often. Also, when they give fresh towels, they do not remove the soiled ones! We used showers in 3 apartments - none had all the sliding doors. also had dripping taps in the sink. Yes,the staff were friendly but because we could not give an exact date of leaving because of complications with the baby, we were hounded by the concierge who told us he could rent our apartments for $200 (we negotiated for $128 as we ended up staying 17 nights). He finally agreed not to charge us an extra two nights because of short notice to leave. He did give me free wifi which I was extremely grateful for. He asked if he could order us a maxi taxi and we agreed, for the airport. WE WERE VERY ANGRY that he ordered a private van WHICH COST $90 INSTEAD OF $30. We wondered if he got commission.~3~1~5~3~3~3~3~nan
review_195028070~“Terrible”~Sofa bed had no mattress, so if you sat on it, it sank to the floor. Tiles on shower floor coming off, only given one think blanket for cold Melbourne nights and the remote for the TV was not working properly. Bed sheet had pink stains all over it.

review_194089750~“Pleasant stay”~The place was clean, comfortable, convenient to the hospital. which is the reason we were in Melbourne. Stayed here for a month.  I couldn't say more about Octavian, the manager, he could not do enough and never said no when asked for something.

The staff here are so friendly and accommodating, the rooms are great value and it is such a short walk to the hospital!

review_189284359~“Perfecto”~Our experience with NMSA was lovely right from the beginning.Our unit was clean, spacious and comfy. Very strategic area, quiet and lovely, situated just across the tram stop. We stayed for 6 days and had fresh towels delivered and rubbish cleaned everyday. The laundry room was just next to our unit and I could get my clothes washed and dried in one hour max. The owners, Octavian and Larissa were really kind and helpful. They contacted us before our arrival to give the number of the chauffeur service from the airport to the apartment, and even helped us to understand the maps and directions of the trams. Overall, great experience!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_187047167~“Good accomodation close to the city.”~We enjoyed our stay in this accomodatet apartment. The staff is very helpfull and even helped with carrying our luggage. The accomodation in close to the tramway. That is very easy but brings also some noice during the late evening/early morning.~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_186018968~“Nice stay”~Very helpful and friendly staff. Clean and tidy apt and the whole building was very clean. Toys for kids available. Very close to Melb Royal Hospital and close to the CBD and Victoria Market, easy walk.~5~4~4~3~5~5~5~nan
review_185765610~“Definitely the place to stay”~Close to the tram for an easy ride into town. This gem of a place is clean and tidy. A spacious room for a fraction of the price you'd pay in the city with less noise, and hassle. The staff are very friendly and will help with anything you need. Even got a call the day of arrival to check what time I'd be getting there and repeated instructions for the key box.~4~5~4~5~4~4~5~nan
review_185540725~“Excellent customer service & great place to stay in Melbourne!”~This was our home away from home while we enjoyed a fabulous 2 week family holiday in Melbourne in Sept/Oct 2013. It is in a great location with a tram stop at the door so you can be in the CBD in minutes. We enjoyed a top floor 2 bedroom apartment that was clean and welcoming. The friendly and professional manager, Octavian and staff were always there to ensure that our stay was a pleasant one and always ready to assist if anything was needed. It is in close proximity to cafes and restaurants. I know where I will be staying on my next visit to Melbourne!~5~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_184207637~“Excellent support in a trying time”~Very convenient to Royal Children's, Royal Women's and Royal Melbourne Hospitals. Tram stop outside 10 minutes trip into CBD. Octavian was extremely friendly and helpful, because of the nature of our trip we needed to make last minute bookings for other family members on weekends and public holidays and he came back in quickly to organise our accommodation. Beds are a little firm for our liking but other than that we had everything we needed for our 4 day stay. For country visitors who are not used to city noise ask for a unit at the back away from tram noise.~3~4~5~3~4~3~5~nan
review_183335065~“"Fantastic manager and staff"”~We stayed in these apartments in October 2013 - November, 2013, with two medical patients. We found the Manager and his staff to be exceptionally helpful in every aspect. Nothing was a problem to them. The Manager carried our luggage up and down the stairs. Moved us to the ground floor due to the patient's being unable to walk to the third floor. Would definitely recommend to others. Thank you so much Octavian and staff - from the Hamilton's.~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_182892580~“Amazing management”~We stayed in this place in September while searching for a rental. What made our stay special was the manager Octavian. He was impeccably professional. He was amazingly generous with his time, always ready to help, and extremely courteous and polite in all his interactions with us. The TV in our room was not working. I called him at a late hour just to let him know. Instead of waiting until the next day, he came with a working TV and replaced it with the old one. I needed a fan in the room, he immediately brought another one upstairs. I was so impressed by his committment to servicing guests. I would certainly stay there again. Many Thanks Octavian !!!!~5~5~5~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_182294604~“"Great place to stay - Great customer service"”~What a great place to stay so close to the city. Staying as a family we were very happy as the apartments were clean, tidy and had all the conveniences we required.  Octavian the Manager went out of his way to ensure we had a great stay. Nothing was too much trouble. A quick walk to the nearby restaurants and cafés Octavian recommended made our few days away very enjoyable.  We were so lucky to find country hospitality in the city!! Just felt like home. We will be back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_182199340~“Professional Management Team”~Over the Past 3 Years, Our Company has always found the Management to be extremely helpful and professional in delivering customer service to the guests. The Manager is always praised by guests for offering that extra level of service you desire from the bigger Hotels. The rooms are clean and tidy and a simple request is never a bother, always greeted with the utmost courtesy and respect. We would always recommend staying at North Melbourne Serviced apartments.~5~5~4~4~5~4~5~nan
review_182160163~“Royal children's stay”~Very close to hospital and the management and staff couldn't be more helpful. Advice on nearest shops and eating places saved money esp at IGA. Assistance with bags to room and undercover car parking a great help. Housekeeping most attentive to our needs.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_182149418~“We would stay again because of Octavian, the manager, and location”~My husband, two children and I stayed in the North Melbourne Serviced Apartments and were blown away by the warmth and professionalism of the manager, Octavian. He made us feel "at home" and was there to meet our every need. Our kids were near in ages to his own and we got to know his family, too, which was wonderful because we had just moved to Melbourne from Honolulu and this wonderful man and his family really became our first friends. I have recommended NMSA to friends and they too have had a great experience. It's not fancy, but it had everything we needed at a reasonable price and again, Octavian was the icing on the cake. Highly recommended!~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
