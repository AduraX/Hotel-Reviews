review_476962161~“Handy location”~These apartments are in a great location on Exhibition Street, right next to the entry to Chinatown and in the theatre district. Easy 2-3 minute walk to the nearest tram line on Bourke Street. Keep in mind that all trams are free in the 'free tram zone' this includes quite a large area so no need to buy a Myki if you are just moving around the city (it's free to QV markets to)The apartments could do with a little updating they are looking somewhat tired and we did run out of hot water one night. But I'd definitely stay here again & recommend to families for its great location and spaciousness.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470795784~“So convenient”~The apartment was very clean, quiet and contained everything in it that you needed.Fresh towels were delivered every day. We had a problem with the locking mechanism in our door but the problem was sorted out straight away. It was only a short walk into the main shopping area.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_470433380~“Room and very spacious apartment”~I really enjoyed the space this apartment offered. Separate bathroom, bedroom, living room provided so much room and I felt I could move in permanently. There was also a clothes dryer and washer in the cupboards of a large bathroom.~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~3~nan
review_467185368~“BEWARE - BED BUGS!!!”~We spent 2 nights there at The Paramount Serviced Apartments in Melbourne at the end of February. Hotel location is great but they have BED BUGS there!!!  On our first night in the hotel, we were waken up at about 2am scratching all over. We turned on the light to see what was going on and were horrified to see our arms covered in multiple bites, with a few on the faces as well. We had a close look at the linen and discovered a number of small crawling insects – mostly on the pillows (both outside and inside pillow cases), on the bed sheets, in the folds of bed sheets around the mattress. A quick internet search gave us the answer what we were dealing with – bed bugs... We spent the rest of the night in the sitting room, scratching and trying to sleep in the chairs. After talking to a receptionist in the morning, we were moved to a different apartment for the rest of our stay (with no bugs found there, thankfully). The receptionist and other hotel staff inspecting the infested room expressed surprise – but had a fumigation service number on speed dial and knew the names of people working there... After that stay, we had to wash and dry, freeze or throw away everything we had on or with us (which was time-consuming and expensive), not to bring any 'guests' home, and we are till covered in multiple ugly bite spots...~2~nan~nan~1~nan~3~3~nan
review_467167813~“Good sized apartment in good location”~We had three nights in a 3 bedroom apartment for my wife and I and an adult son and daughter. We were more than happy with the size and cleanliness of the apartment which had a full size corner lounge, dining setting, kitchen, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer and 2 bathrooms. We paid $1176 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights. I agree with other reviewers that the air conditioning was noisier than usual but the beds were comfortable and none of us had any problems sleeping. We were given 3 electronic keys for which they held $250 against my credit card until we checked out. The charge had disappeared by the time we got back home to NSW that afternoon. The location is terrific being only a few doors away from Her Majestys Theatre and the top end of Chinatown. The decor is a little dated but it is not shabby or marked and the carpet seemed fairly recent. My only disappointment was the lack of free wifi which a lot of hotels provide these days. We really enjoyed our stay.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467030348~“First Impressions”~First impressions when we walked into our 1 bedroom apartment (1108) were very disappointing to the point where we actually didn't want to stay. The lounge in the room was stained, the carpet was stained and the cushions were awful, which gave it an overall 'dirty' feel. The apartment wasn't actually dirty but from the minute we walked in we felt that it was, because of that. Our friends 1 bedroom apartment, on the other hand, down at the opposite end of the floor (1101) was lovely, the difference being that when you walked into their room they had a nice leather-look lounge and a carpet that wasn't stained. If any room deserves a 'makeover' it's 1108!~3~nan~5~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_464374638~“Poor service”~We travelled here with two other couples( one from overseas) staying on the 10th floor for 4 nights. Even though the apartment is quiet large, it is tired and needs updating but for the price can't expect too much.  Reception also guaranteed us when booking the rooms were quiet. The worse thing about this apartment is the noise of the AC ..the noise is deafening! You can definitely not sleep with it on and you cannot open the windows as there is either noise ( 1004, 1005) or the smell coming from Chinese restaurant below ( 1001) ...or just general traffic noise. We asked for the filters to cleaned but these were not done. The AC motors need obvious repairing as there should be minimal noise coming from them. We also asked for the sheets to be changed on the third day and they said they would change them but it didn't happen .. they had changed the towels on that day and replaced toilet paper but didn't replace sheets. We were assured they would be changed the following day but it didn't happen yet again.  Also, the main girl on reception in the morning was not very friendly .. a good morning and a smile wouldn't go astray! Everything we asked, seemed too much trouble for her. Also again at night an elderly gentlemen let us in on two of the nights without even acknowledging us or even looking up. A simple hello would suffice so manners need to be taught to reception staff. There was, however, a young man, who was always friendly, courteous and greeted us each time with enthusiasm and he should be congratulated for his impeccable standard.  The only good thing about these apartments was that it was in a good position in walking distance to the CBD and catching trams to and from various areas in Melbourne. We wouldn't recommend these apartments unless you don't mind deafening noise.~2~2~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_463891849~“Actually 2.5 rating”~Have stayed here before and thought that room was tired but ok for the price then. This time paid more and stayed one night in a different, very tired room. Have given this a rating of 2 but really between 2 and 3. Cons: Bedrooms: one of the 3 beds had a visible bow in it making an uncomfortable sleep. The bedrooms were dusty, the smaller room came with spider webs. Bathroom: water was leaking from somewhere making the tiled floor slippery. We wiped it up but it returned, was necessary to put a towels on the floor.  Living area: Kitchen and lounge was a bit grubby, marks on the walls and floor, dusty. Airconditioner was really noisy. Could open the windows but the street noise (bottles being emptied into a skip at a nearby pub) was too much. The closed windows did a great job of blocking this out but then needed the noisy aircon on. Pros: Location. Staff friendly. Check in/out quick and efficient. Lobby is nicely decorated. Overall ok if you can get a heavily discounted price.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~5~nan
review_463098892~“Central”~I found that staying here was so central for us- chinatown around the corner, a few local drinking spots, only a couple of blocks away from Bourke st mall, theatre down the road.  The only thing about the apartment was there were no fans in the bathroom and the fridge didn't keep anything cold at all. Air con abit too loud. I would stay there again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_462080572~“Girls weekend away”~Perfect location for a long weekend in Melbourne. Easy to walk to restaurants and bars and right next to Her Majesty's theatre if you're taking in a show. The living area was quite spacious and the staff were helpful and friendly. Although one of the beds has a castor missing.~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_459800198~“Accommodation while working in the city”~We stayed for three nights while hubby worked for four consecutive days in the city. Location was brilliant. Noise level was the acceptable basic hum of the city. Apartment was spacious. Bed was average, maybe a little hard. En route to apartment, we found the hallways had a bad smell, which maybe could be fixed with a fresh fragrant cleaning detergent. Reception staff were friendly. Price was very reasonable at $136 per night.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456050943~“Getaway”~Perfectly situated for every thing, easy to get to and from, next door to china town for meals, the wonderful Elephant and Wheelbarrow english pup almost next door is awesome.

review_454848125~“Would never stay here again!”~We had booked in at another apartment but due to a plumbing problem we were 'upgraded' to Paramount. The room we were given initially had no aircon, tv didn't work, bathroom and kitchen were outdated and there were a lot of stains on the carpet - felt dirty! The funky odor on the 3F apartment and in the hall was unbearable. We asked to be moved to another apartment and found the one on the 5F was slightly better and had 2 bathrooms - still little outdated. There was still a funky smell in the air and didnt fell the apartment was cleaned properly (the bathroom sink still had toothpaste spit remnants...yuck!). I usually don't wear shoes inside but I didnt feel comfortable walking barefoot. Beds and sofas were cheap and hard - there was no mattress topper on my bed - just a thin sheet, but found what looked like one in the wardrobe so my 2nd nights sleep was little more comfortable. The apartment also has thin walls - was right next to the elevators and I could hear when they were in use. Also could hear the neighbours arguing and their radio/ tv. Would never stay here again considering location and was not value for money!~2~nan~nan~3~2~nan~1~nan
review_454595831~“Needs work but a great location”~Have been staying at this place for many years, it is our go to place pretty much. The hotel hasn't really change in 20 years, rooms could do with some upgrades (I believe an upgrade process is happening), the hallways look old and tiered and some of the furniture is less than perfect. Putting all this aside we stay here for the location. You have China town at the front door, the 2 trams that cross nearly every other tram are only around the corner, parliament station is a 2 min walk away,there are cafes everywhere, there is a pub right on the corner that does a great feed, the rooms are spacious which is hard to find these days! Once a little effort is put in to this place it will be back to its former glory.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453250740~“Convenient for travel and theatre”~This is a great location, even though I didn't have time to use any facilities, including fridge and microwave. It had a nice bed, lots of space in both bedrooms as we had a 2 room apartment. It also had a largish bathroom. It was a fantastic price and the reason we booked it initially was because it was close to the Theatre and Asian restaurants and a Pub.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_452559805~“Location 5*, Apartmenrt 3*”~We stayed here for just 1 night in a 2 Bedroom Apartment (708 facing Bourke Street) to be able to attend the Kids Hots Shots at the Australian Open the following morning. Location: The location was great. Any easy 'straight' walk to Rod Laver Arena. It was also in a good spot to access Bourke Street Mall, Emporium, QV Square and only a little bit further to Melbourne Central. CarParking: As car parking wasn't included in the rate it cost $25 for the night and we agreed to pay an extra $20 to be able to leave the car there until 8pm the following day (as we could walk to Rod Laver Arena and car parking would be hard to get there). These charges were paid at time if check-in. Unfortunately upon leaving the car park at around 3:30pm we popped our ticket into the machine for the boom gate to go up - only to have it spit back out saying "expired". We then had to intercom the car park attendants who then had to ring the hotel to confirm that we had indeed paid the extra charge. Finally they opened the boom gate for us and we went through. A bit of a nuisance when you have three hot & tired kids in the car and traffic behind us waiting exit also. Layout: As others have mentioned the whole complex is laid out very strangely with different lifts going here and there and then the car park lifts being in different spots again. Honestly I found getting to and from our room and to and from the car quite exhausting. If we had been staying there longer we may have ended up mastering the maze, but being there only 1 day/ night the whole thing left me a little confused (amplified with small children in tow). Apartment: Mmmm - I know it's not normally this price (I understand we were staying at the beginning of the Australian Open) but it's hard to process, when at $356 + parking for the night we walked into an apartment that realistically should have cost much less. It was a tough pill to swallow knowing the premium price that we paid. Had we paid around $200 for the night our reactions might have been different.  Yes its spacious and it has kitchen facilities and laundry facilities in the bathroom, but everything seemed old, dirty, dusty, peeling, mouldy and just 'past it's use by date'. The beds were ok, but being a hot night and having no air conditioning in the bedrooms (and not being able to open the window due to busy Bourke Street traffic noise) non of us had the best nights sleep.  The plug didn't fit in the bath properly, so we had to keep filling it up more during bath time. The shower wasn't much better. There was plenty of bench space in the bathroom and the hairdryer worked well. As mentioned before there's laundry facilities in the bathroom which is handy for longer stays, but we didn't use them. Swimming Pool: The indoor swimming pool was great and there were some pool lounges to sit on after the swim. You need to go and get extra towels from reception for the pool if you haven't packed your own (just bath towels really) but that was no problem.  On a whole I wouldn't use this accomodation again unless there were absolutely no other options available. I have stayed in a number of 2 Bedroom apartments in the city that are much cleaner, newer and have a better building layout that are reasonably priced.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451378917~“Great spot for Grand Finals”~First time in Melbourne for GF week,this place was recommended and we have a teen son so need 2 bdrrms-hard to find! Love the big wardrobes, kitchen/ dining and huge bathroom. Stylish glitzy decor downstairs, we checked in at midnight to a very helpful gentleman at the front desk, the hotel is over a shopping mall which has a food hall and other shops. Elephant and Wheelbarrow pub next door, 7eleven close by, found a Woolies two streets away and a Target, trams in the same street. Hotel has two ways to enter and after we got our bearings we entered off Bourke St thru the Shopping centre carpark/basement that way the lift took us straight up to our floor, the lobby entrance is weird in that you have to get out of one lift 2 floors up and get in another, we found this annoying, if you stay a week you work these things out. Great night sleep , balcony view of Exhibition St, Chinatown in next street. Grand Final parade starts in Exhibition St so we were in the right place for that.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_441020423~“Great Location”~My husband and I stayed at the Paramount Serviced Apartments for one night. It has been a few years since we last stayed there but once again it was comfortable, clean and had everything we needed.

review_437410671~“A decent 3 stars”~I booked this location at short notice and found nothing available in the CBD unless I wanted to pay over $400 per night for it!  I booked, desperate to get something, then read the reviews and nearly called to cancel!  The car park is right near the hotel, just a couple of doors down. Whilst the lift takes you some of the way up, you then need to walk up the car park ramp to the street. Perfectly safe if you stick to the walkway and over eager workers don't run you over in their hurry to go home!  Check in was fine - typical. Staff very pleasant and helpful.  It's an odd layout - take this lift, then get out, walk down a hall then another lift, but staff clearly explained so all fine. My room, 412 was a 2 bedroom 1 bath. I think it was around $215-$220 for the night at very last minute. The room was clean. I had NONE of the issues others have mentioned with cleanliness.  The room does have some age to it I think so there were some minor marks on bedside tables and in the kitchen.  The apartment is not luxurious, nor does it claim to be. It's a basic apartment, with basic amenities in my opinion and quite cheap furnishings - so they were never going to age well.  The bed has some age and is a bit saggy.  The split system air con was a bit noisy.  Bathroom was clean. Towels stock standard.  Crap, typical, toiletries - don't bother with them!  It was fine for a night. And I might come back if my usual haunts aren't available.  Business travellers probably steer clear - criminally expensive wifi and whilst parking seemed reasonable, that was providing you exit by 10am. I'll be staying an extra 1-2 hours longer and will be stung another $20 "early bird" parking. So $45 for less than 24 hours parking. That's pricey, even got the CBD.  If you think of it as a 3 star property, regardless of the rating it actually has, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The staff I encountered were really helpful.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436925739~“clean and comfortable”~very spacious apartment, everything you need, beds were comfortable, it was clean.

review_434948278~“Great location, great staff, nice big rooms, noisy on Bourke st side”~My husband has been transferred to Melbourne for work, for 4mths, and the company have put him up in one of these serviced apartments.  After a month of putting up with noisy upstairs neighbours, (private tenants), I complained about it. The staff decided to move us to a quieter room, as the tenants were not being co-operative. I cannot say enough good things about the way they handled this situation, we did not have to ask to be moved they suggested it, they moved our belongings for us to the new room and gave us extra things to make our stay more comfortable and to make us feel at home (its at least a 4 mth stay here). Robert, the service manager, is without doubt one of the nicest and friendliest person's I have met (not just in Melbourne). He has gone out of his way and above and beyond making our stay here the best he can. I am so impressed with all the staff I have met so far, from reception, to the cleaner (who cleans our apartment) to the two maintenance guys, which nothing was to much trouble for them to do for us. The rooms are clean and so big!! Yes its an older style apartment building and the walls are a little thin, but well worth staying here. The rooms are large and comfortable, with a fully self contained kitchen, a very large bathroom, which also has the washer and dryer in a cupboard. The bedroom is quite large, we are in a 2brm apartment but only have access to the main room as that is all the company is paying for, we can pay extra to open up the 2nd room if we have guests come and stay with us. You have a lounge and dining area which are also a good a size. I would suggest you ask for a room facing Lt Bourke St if you want something a little quieter, as Bourke St has the trams running all day and most of the night, plus car traffic. These apartments are also tenanted by permanent residences as well as temporary. They have great security, as you can only access the floor you are on via the lifts, you cannot access other floors either. People cannot just enter the building and go to the apartment floors, they have to be buzzed up by the tenants. They also have undercover parking (at a daily charge rate). So over all how would I rate them? Well I would stay here again! Thank you again Robert and the staff at Paramount apartments for looking after us while we are staying with you.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_426216619~“Good place for a brief stay”~We stayed at Paramount for one night in a one bedroom apartment. The room itself was reasonable, a good size and had a great balcony. The bathroom was dirty however, with hair in the sink and bath. Bed was comfortable enough. Complex was nice and pool area looked good. I wouldnt stay here if you are planning on spending a lot of time in the room. A good place to stay if you need a perfect location as it is very central and right next to china town.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422383180~“Great location and apartment but noisy”~Great location close to China Town, trams and great eating places. Only problem was how noisy the people in the apartment above us were. Seriously being woken at 3 am on a Monday morning to what sounded like elephants above us, loud music and loud singing before a 5am flight was not cool. We were on level 11. Other than that the apartment was clean, we seemed to have been upgraded to a 3 bedroom apartment for our family of 6 which was certainly appreciated and again the location was a bonus for us.~4~nan~nan~2~nan~4~4~nan
review_405482585~“Apartment style at a good rate but old and noisy”~Travelling with a family these are good apartments in a great location in the City, easy stroll up Bourke St to Spring St to catch the FREE City Circle Tram, plenty of 7/11 stores nearby and great pub (Elephant and Wheelbarrow) for lunch or dinner - be sure to check out their specials throughout the week. Pool is great, nice and clean and warm too with a nice little outdoor area. Staff were friendly and efficient. Rooms were OK, large with kitchen and laundry facilities but old. Fine if you're not spending a lot of time there as we weren't. Please be warned IT IS VERY NOISY especially on the weekend. There are several pubs beneath the hotel (and China town is right next door) and the music blared out until all hours of the morning (around 2am I think) I seriously felt like we were at the pub it was that loud in our room and the kids found it very hard to get to sleep. Our room faced the city so maybe suggest the Exhibition St facing rooms to try and avoid some noise. We had room 814 and it was VERY noisy even though I had read reviews and had specifically asked for a room that wasnt noisy due to travelling with kids....by the time we stayed the first night we didnt want to have to pack up everyone and move to another room so we just put up with it. Not sure if all rooms are like this but definitely ask for a quiet location upon check in. This hotel is very cheap in comparison to many other aprtment styles in the city though, so I guess you get what you pay for.~3~nan~5~1~nan~nan~4~nan
review_402314880~“Dirty apartment ”~Great location but the apartment was filthy. Carpet not vacuumed, hair on the floor in the bathroom, lots of grime/dust around the toilet.

Paramount provides the ideal balance between location, facilities, convenience and price. The apartments are large, comfortable and quiet.

They are large with everything you need, full kitchen, washing machine and dryer, dining table and lounge with balcony and queen size beds. They are a little noisy compared to other hotels I have stayed at. There is a pool and spa and sauna. They are very strict with check in and out, they probably do have rooms available but they never admit to it and make you come back after 2 pm to check in, but they do store your luggage. This would be a great place for families.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_368611382~“DO NOT STAY HERE. TERRIBLE SERVICE, DIRTY, NOISY, ABUSIVE STAFF.”~I unfortunately had to stay here recently on a business trip. Upon arriving at the hotel, I felt incredibly unwelcome by the check-in staff. They did not advise me of anything relating to the stay. I got to the room and it was absolutely filthy. Like it hadn't been cleaned for 10 years. The whole building is old and horrible and it's a pain to get to the rooms. The room was noisy. In the morning I was slightly late checking out, despite not being advised of a check out time. Twice, hotel staff walked straight into my room, ignoring the do-not-disturb sign on the door. I was also verbally abused and threatened by a member of the staff for being slightly late checking out. He was a large, angry man and made me feel so uncomfortable I was close to calling the police as I was afraid of being physically hurt. Upon checkout, the staff were also incredibly rude and unreasonable. After explaining the situation, they still continued to charge my company extra money for the late checkout. I have no idea how an establishment with such poor customer service can stay in business and I certainly would never stay here again, or recommend ANYONE stays here.~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
review_365024103~“Does the job...”~Stayed here with a group of 12 across 3 rooms. Good location, close to everything we required. Agree with previous reviews about cleanliness and the rooms being dated but overall the Paramount Apartments did the job for the price we paid. Ideally it would have been better to have more than 2 keys per room as this made some evenings difficult trying to get back in! On the upside, the young man working the Thursday evening shift requires a special mention for being so helpful :)~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_354842546~“Great Location, Filthy Room”~Stayed one night and wasn't expecting much as it is a budget hotel but when I arrived 30 min before check-in opened, I asked to go in early and you would have thought it was a huge problem and the female reception agent at the desk seemed very put out to help.  I went to my room, which was spacious but very dirty. The carpets didnt seem to have been vacuumed in weeks, dried paint was splattered on the floor but the worst bit was the bathroom sink has mud and dirt platters and the bathtub was still very dirty also with dirt and hair (not mine!) I had to go back to reception and ask for it to be cleaned while I was out. The second reception agent I encountered (A younger guy) was much more friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble, he was excellent. The balcony was locked so I couldn't use it anyways and it was also dirty (rubbish in the corners) and had no furniture. View was fine and I loved seeing the buildings although I could hear the trucks backing up on the main street at 5:45am even though I was on the 7th floor. The kitchenette and layout were great. The water pressure in the shower was really low which was disappointing. The tub was too grubby to use it for a bath. I was expecting cheap and cheerful, not filthy and dirty.  I would not stay here again unfortunately as the location was amazing, right out the front door and steps away from the main shopping district and loads of restaurants and cafes.~2~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_353952327~“Great location, convenient, questionable cleaning & maintenance”~The location is fabulous for theatres and attractions, and china town restaurants. For Melbourne CBD, this is reasonably priced accommodation; but the price reflects the quality and standards of accommodation. For example: the 4 burner stove top had only 2 burners working; taps in bathroom moved when you used them; the smoke detector was hanging at an angle off the ceiling; the kettle had some substance splashed over the outside of it that required washing off before use; the couch had SEVERAL nasty stains and greasy spots.. Now the good; the TV although small had foxtel channel access, there was an air conditioner (although only in one room), the apartment was relatively spacious. The pool & gym were user friendly, although the spa beside the pool had some frothy brown residue around the edges suggesting a need for good clean. The carparking is good value- directly under the apartments, and discounted for guests to $25 / day. It is really important though, if you book in here to find out how to access: the lobby from the carpark (you cant, without swipe access), the floor leading to the lifts to the apartments (yes its that complicated - also requiring swipe access); And- how to exit the carpark with the passcard issued upon checkout (you cant, you have to press the intercom, at the boom gate, while cars wait behind you). Hint: if arriving by car, park directly out the front on the street, check in, obtain the swipe card, then proceed to park car underneath. Once you have navigated the entry / exit to the accommodation, ask for a quiet & clean room. The location is fabulous.~3~nan~5~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_351744663~“Good location”~These apartments are showing their age but I think the reasonable price I paid reflected that. The apartment was clean, comfortable and was everything needed for our short stay. In a handy location with easy access to trams. Staff were pleasant, check in/out efficient. One tip: the A/C is in the lounge, so if it is warm leave it on if you go out in the evening or get a fan to push cool air down the hall because it takes time for the cool air to make its way into the bedroom. I will stay again.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_350411584~“Student Accomdation, but great spot.”~Clearly was student accommodation, with a hotel as a side bar. Had a three "run in's" with students, in pool, elevator and then in hallway that was very uncomfortable. Really felt like we were inconveniencing them, crashing at their pad. Was also a lot of security around, which made me wonder what had happened in the past to warrant it.  Great location though and room was very clean. although felt unfinished and exhaust in bathroom not working. All in all, ok accommodation. Excellent location.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_349049671~“great place to stay”~This place is very central to everything you want to do in melbourne as the public transport is fantasic. But this place is within walking distance to most places you would want to go in the city. place is very friendly clean and great pool fitness area is fantastic and no noise. upstairs from the shopping precinct which is great to go down to the food court and grab something for a meal or just a wonder highly recommend~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_348094623~“Location Location”~Recently stayed at the Paramount during a recent trip to Melbourne, was very satisfied with the experience. Room was very spacious, clean and most importantly quiet. Our room was set back from the street which helped keep noise down and had great views of parliament house and the Melbourne skyline. Walk out the front door and your surrounded by theatres, restaurants and entertainment. China Town is just around the corner and the Burke St mall and major shopping districts are only a short walk away. Getting to and from the hotel is easy thanks to the free tram zone around the CBD, simple hope on the No.86 tram at Southern Cross Station, which leaves from Burke St and get off at the Russell St stop and then walk 2 minutes to hotel. Overall I will definitely stay here again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_346038884~“Location good...”~As the title says, location good but the hotel itself could do with an overhaul. The fittings, fixtures and furniture were tired and well used. The front desk staff did not know the area and could not provide directions on how to catch a tram to the markets. Would I stay again? Maybe just due to cheap price and easy walking distance to china town, shopping, federation square, casino etc.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_345708277~“Pretty bad”~The location's great. The apartment wasn't clean (e.g. bathroom sink full of hair). Bedsheets were ancient and felt grubby. We stayed in the middle of summer and there was window unit a/c only which meant the living room was freezing and the bedrooms boiling hot. The hallway outside the rooms stank of stale cooking smells. The layout of the place was very odd and required navigating several elevators and walking an odd twisty route in between. The apartment was incredibly noisy (street noise) from nearby bars. The wifi was *FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR*. In 2016. You have to be kidding. The oddest thing: at checkout, the front desk attendant said, "It will be a few minutes." When I asked why he said, "We need to inspect the room." They made us wait while they went and looked at it. Unbelievable.~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_344387233~“If its cleanliness you're after - don't bother”~Location of premises was perfect for 2 weeks of Australian Open tennis. But that's where the good review ends. Booked a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment which we got. Room was dirty from the get go. They are "serviced" every 3 days which means they replace the towels and make the bed - Sheets were never changed in 2 weeks. Not vacuumed, toilets never cleaned etc etc I took a few photos but you can't capture the general dirtiness..... I paid $5500 for this. ..unbelievable.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342257863~“Utilitarian but Central”~Stayed at Paramount for 4 nights whilst at the Australian open. The prices were raised due to the event which you expect. We had a view over the city. Towels were changed everyday. The apartments were clean but brown furnishings (hate brown). Great for what we were doing-out all day. My friends used the pool & gym & we're happy. China town near by & plenty of places to eat. Trams a few 100yds away. BIG PLUS walking distance to the tennis.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_340483933~“Graffiti on balcony and cheap 2nd floor entry spoil the fantastic location.”~The best location to stay is undermined by a couple of easily fixed maintenance issues.All hotels need regular upkeep and improvement but the second floor entry signage and garden need attention urgently. Graffiti needs to be removed without delay. Otherwise I'd like to live in this location because it's so good.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_337465267~“Adequate but a bit run down”~Stayed over new year's eve. The hotel is close to Chinatown, restaurants and shopping. We rented a 3 bedroom apartment. The apartment itself is adequately furnished with an ensuite and a separate bathroom. It looks a bit old, cushion cover was torn and the place looks like it could do with a bit of sprucing up.  You might want to shop around for better options for the price - $1635 for 3 nights for 5 people... bear in mind parking costs $25 per day too.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_336517821~“Great position next to Chinatown restaurants.”~We had a family of 5 adults stay for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment for a family event. As the room only had 4 beds, 1 adult had to sleep on a rollaway which we were concerned about. The rollaway was great, not a flimsy thing but a proper bed great for an adult. Apartment had ample room with everything needed on hand. The queen bed was a tad hard but the single beds great. Our fridge leaked during our stay and was promptly replaced the next morning. Great position with so many restaurants and skybus and trams stops close by. My mother mentioned the fireworks for New Years Eve and they placed us so we could watch them from our balcony. Had to use 2 different lifts but not confusing. Spent time in the pool, spa and sauna, they are small but great to have there to use. We would stay again.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_332798914~“She's getting a bit tired”~We've stayed here a few times now for work functions and we get the 3bdrm apartment with extra trundles. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it could be better. The rooms are looking much more tired this time around and could really do with some updating and more comfortable couches. The location is pretty good and was only about 10 min walk to the mall and to breakfast in Degraves Street. There's a bottle shop nearby, and Flinders Lane, where there are some excellent restaurants. Bathrooms are small, bedrooms size is adequate. Not a lot of soundproofing between rooms though it seems. Our neighbours seemed really really loud, and were being raucous at times, but at other times they were just talking but we could still hear them. It was hard to sleep as a result.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_332605879~“Great location, comfortable”~We visited for the Taylor Swift concert and stayed in a 2 bdrm app. The rooms were a decent size and we had a balcony. Although the decour was nothing to rave about, it was still comfortable and close to AAMI Park and China Town. We had Foxtel and a nice pool and spa to access.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_331716539~“Good but bad ”~So we stayed here for ACDC on the 6th of December  So we got here and thought ok go to check in and the staff was so rude one of them was talking to another about something and cause we had come up from Phillip Island we just wanted to get in our room we got our key and up we went through the maze we got to our room and on arrival I thought ok not to bad but then I looked around there was dust every where it just looked like it wasn't cleaned previously, The first night of sleeping wow the bed was so uncomfortable i will say they need new ones, Then when we woke we went down to the pool and it was cold wouldn't say it's a heated pool cause it isn't the spa was ok but the jets are very powerful, The good things I will say is the location was good when we knew what trams to catch to get us around Melbourne and it was nice that we got our apartment service everyday~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_331576397~“Good and bad.”~Would be great if staff could communicate. And weren't lazy. Really, how hard is it to put 2 single trundle beds into a bedroom that you'd just taken a double bed out of? Rather than leaving them out in the lounge for my father who has back troubles to put into the room himself.  Good location though.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
