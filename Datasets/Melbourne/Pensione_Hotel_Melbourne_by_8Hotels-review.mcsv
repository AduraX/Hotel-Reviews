review_479024479~“A must stay!!”~Highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value for money, and couldn't get a better location in CBD. Small rooms but very clean and staff very accommodating. We have stayed many times before and will again.  ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478762502~“Pleasant stay in a useful location”~This hotel is very well situated in Melbourne, near to Southern Cross Station and the waterfront. The downstairs reception area is well appointed and welcoming, and the staff on reception very friendly and helpful. My room was a bit bigger than expected, which was good, but a little quirky in the way things are done. I had to move the tea tray to the top shelf of the wardrobe so that I could put my things in there, and because the fridge was sitting in the bottom of the wardrobe it was pretty warm in there. The bed was a little lumpy, but not too bad. I couldn't really get the air conditioning unit to do what I wanted it to, and there were no instructions. You can open the window, but it was onto an enclosed courtyard. The design of the bathroom was interesting and the space was well used but the tap was too large for the sink, meaning it was impossible to wash your face without getting most of the water on the floor, the sink could also have been the other way around so that you could sit on the toilet straight! The shower was a reasonable size, but very dark and could have used a light! The free internet was reliable, but not really fast enough to watch a video on youtube for example. Overall though, I had a comfortable and pleasant stay. I would recommend if this hotel suits your budget.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_478707899~“Cool Stay in Melb CBD”~sweet access, close amenities, uniquely different in it's style and approach, since my last visit (based on city access outside of business hours) a delightful little redesign of an original Spencer Street building, corridors are very entertaining too, close to Southern Cross transport hub, trams outside the door and great 24hr $1 espresso at 7/11 on the corner~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_478159625~“Good value”~This hotel is Good value close to southern cross station for early morning flight jump on the sky bus much ch eager than hotels at the airport! You are close to all restaurants and city attractions. I highly recommend fir sleeping over night to catch the sky bus!~4~5~5~3~4~3~4~nan
review_478111802~“Highly recommend! Great location! ”~This was a great hotel! We stayed in shoebox room, which we knew would be small, and it was. However the room layout was smart maximising storage space and layout, smaller bathroom but spacious shower. It didn't feel small and was very comfortable.  Room was always made up each day and always very clean. Not much noise from neighbouring units or corridors or from the street below, resulting in a great sleep every night. Corridors and lobby was always tidy, modern and smelt great!  The hotel was in a great location, with abundant available public transport. Trams just outside on the corner and the main large southern cross station just a minute walk on the same street. This was super convenient location. Also 7/11 on the street and just near a bridge close to yarra river for a nice walk along the river or southbank promenade.  Also the Cafe attached to the hotel; Olivier's, did amazing coffee and breakfast.  I highly recommend this hotel, will definitely consider staying here again if I visit Melbourne again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477940714~“Bulldog friendly”~I love staying in the courtyard rooms with my Bulldog. They're like little secret gardens in the cbd. The beds are always comfy. Some of the rooms are pretty small but it's an old building so that's to be expected.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477280635~“Small, cosy and comfortable.”~Well located hotel in Melbourne CBD with excellent rooms.

review_477055570~“What a gem, in a great central location!!”~Great hotel. Really friendly staff. Even received a call the day before to confirm arrangements and arrival time. Staff were really helpful. Room was clean and well set out. Ambience of hotel was lovely. Walls were a bit thin, but otherwise the room was great for the price. Hotel is centrally located, close walk to Southern Cross train station and major tram stops. Boutique hotel at a great price!! What a gem!!~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_476750658~“Good location”~The Pensione is in an extremely convenient location to Southern Cross station. It is not far from the CBD and a five minute walk to the Crown Casino. The room we had contained a very tiny ensuite whuch is ok if youre only staying for one night. Very comfortable beds and clean room.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_476676248~“Great stay and great location:)”~Nice and lovely hotel. Im impressed. Great location i swear, a bit walk to Crown Casino and Southern Cross Station. The bathroom is very tiny but that is acceptable. Another great hip hotel with a nice service one.~4~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_476425815~“Very helpful staff”~We stayed here for 3 nights, good location for trams & restaurants. Rooms on the small side especially the bathrooms but otherwise good, nice and clean, crisp white bed linen and soft fluffy towels. Staff were always very friendly and helpful. They let us leave some of our luggage with them when we spent 3 days driving along the great ocean road as we were staying another night on our return. They also posted postcards for us when we asked where nearest post box was. Oliver's cafe right next to hotel was great for breakfast.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476027340~“Centrally located but small rooms”~I stayed at the hotel over a month ago on a business trip. The hotel is located centrally and walking distance to everything in CBT and thats the best part. But the room i stayed in and few of my collegues were tiny with even tiny bathroom. Probably okay for single travelers but if you are sharing then it is going to very tight.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_475959794~“Great hotel. Nice room in great location”~Nice location and comfy room but the shower and toilet is very tiny. Nice bunk bed and got spaces to open bags. Very helpful and friendly staffs even we ask them a lot of questions. Easy to get to hotel from sky bus and walking distance to dfo and crown. Will definitely come back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475679179~“Great stay”~One night stay in Melb. I asked for a quiet room and they were very accommodating. I had a great sleep on a comfortable bed in a quiet room.  Also there is a book swap and a nice place to read. Only complaint is that the TV was on the wall to the left of the bed making it difficult to watch~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_475667421~“A gem in the CBD”~A great hotel with friendly helpful staff. Central location and well appointed and comfy rooms. Handy to public transport and restaurants. Great value for money and easy access into the city for shows, etc.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_475430703~“Good Location, friendly staff, clean, budget price and pet friendly”~Friendly staff (Heidi?) very efficient and good customer focus. Great location close to Etihad, Casino and tram stop which takes you to Rod Laver arena, Melbourne Cricket Ground, Southern Cross and Aquarium. Bed was comfortable, tea facilities provided and friq. Ideal for people on the go who only want some where to rest. Has a book swap library and is pet friendly a first for me. Has a bar with happy hour and you can also buy food.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_475426166~“Great Central Location”~I was in what they call a 'shoe box' and it was small for a week stay. But the room was well appointed tidy and there were space to hang out outside the room. So gripes - cleaning staff need to know that the hems on sheets go at the head and foot of a bed - not across and please tuck them in properly, there is nothing worse that sleeping in wrinkling sheets. I had to re-make the bed, not good after traveling for 12 hours. It is not quiet -trains, partying people and siren but I say that is to be expected you are right in the middle of a large city (if you need quiet to sleep you may need to book somewhere else) Good things- the on site cafe serves good coffee and cafe food. Breakfasts are good as well. The lounge areas are nicely appointed and great to chill in. Having plenty of newspapers is great. The staff were generally friendly and helpful. The calming camermile tea was fab at the end of busy days. Finally the funky decor and aprons worn by staff appealed to me.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_475396251~“Gonna Have Fun In the City”~Well, it's the lively end of town, but the Pensione was a bit of quiet (I had a room off the street), clean and comfortable budget luxe. The staff are divine and I'll definitely be back. Close, convenient and cosy, what more could a gal want!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475183805~“Free upgrade appreciated”~Although i booked the shoebox room was given a free upgrade at check in. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and bed comfortable, also very quiet. Shower toilet area is small but adequate. No clock radio in the room.~5~5~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_475145836~“Small but comfy”~Just as the hotel suggests, it's a bit of a shoebox, but it's really good for a quiet night in :) The rooms were tidy enough to sleep in, it's just that the room did not smell a fresh as it could, perhaps i's because it's an old buidling.~4~4~3~2~3~4~5~nan
review_474822914~“Two days in Melbourne”~We had a friendly and mostly comfortable stay in a good location. Pensione staff were extremely helpful and the hotel has a nice ambience. We found the room a little awkward with steps in odd places and the bathroom too small with a poorly designed shower door opening into a very small standing area.  Also, the single beds were not really long enough for anyone over 170cm.  ~3~3~4~2~3~4~4~nan
review_474435714~“Business meeting at Melbourne Expo”~Very nice people at hotel. The rooms are very small but fully equipped for a comfortable stay. The hotel is in an excellent location close to the South bank and free city centre tram. Took the skybus from the airport and the hotel is within 5 mins walk of Skybus station.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan

review_474258624~“Quick stay in Melb”~Don't be put off by the name of the room, a shoebox double, I have stayed in smaller, older, dirtier rooms before at double the price. The building is beautiful, the room was clean, fresh and comfortable. Staff were great and location was so convenient. Not one negative to say about out stay here.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473937313~“Excellent place to live in Melbourne”~Very nice people and the room is very quiet and clean. I lived in the yard room which is incredibly comfortable. The wifi is fluent and it is free! I will definitely live there if I go to Melbourne in the future.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473882808~“Review of stay.”~Staff was great and hotel was nice. Room was small. Noise of external aircon kept me awake, didn't like the shantytown of homeless people across the road from it. But overall as for the hotel itself it was nice.  ~3~3~1~2~3~4~4~nan
review_473489741~“Close to amenities and easy walk to Southern Cross or Flinders st statuons”~Very nice boutique hotel, helpful staff, clean room but bathroom v small and can hear trains if room is at front but not too intrusive. Very close to amenities and stations. Close to Southbank and museums.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_473016568~“Excellent Hotel in Melbourne CBD”~Good Value, very friendly, helpful staff. Excellent location in Melbourne. Rooms are very small (shoebox), not more or less as described. Everything you need is there (fridge, kettle) Clean room and bathroom. Everything looks very new. We would stay there again.~5~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_472996496~“Recommend”~Great location, helpful and friendly staff, clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again. Loved the exposed brickwork and old pics situated around the hotel. Beds were super comfy and even though on a busy street our room was very quiet.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_472991785~“Small but everything you need”~It is a boutique hotel but the room was really small with no room to open two suitcases at the same time. The ensuite was miniscule no bigger than a large wardrobe! Having said that what was was​ there was off a decent standard and the reception staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Great location close to the station and South Bank. Try Ludlow's weekday specials for great value.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_472872620~“Perfect Location for Touring Melbourne”~On the corner of Spencer and Flinders Street, a short stroll from Southern Cross Station, and right next door to the free City Circle trams, and the regular 'pay for' tram system, this hotel is perfectly placed for touring.  Be warned! Trains, trams, and road traffic all meet at this busy intersection, and therefore it is noisy! Ear plugs helped us overcome this problem. The room comfortably housed three adults on three single beds. There was a kettle, tea, coffee, an iron and small ironing board, a fridge and a tiny wardrobe. The downside was the teeny tiny toilet and shower area. It was small! 'Bijou' would be the trendy phrase. Forget it, if you need privacy! The room was clean and serviced daily. Reception could not be more friendly and helpful - as were the majority of the staff.  Breakfast was available on the cafe belonging to the hotel, alternatively, there was a cafe around the corner. Almost next door, there is a Seven11 supermarket.  If visiting Melbourne in the future, I would be happy to use the Pensione again - but hope I remember the earplugs.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472805927~“More than just a "Pensione"”~Excellent small hotel, friendly but professional. Mine was a good size room, clean and with everything one could ask for. Great location near the Southern Cross travel hub, easy reach of town centre and shops. ~4~3~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_472205406~“Very nice”~We enjoyed staying there. Receptionist who helped me store my luggage in the morning, she was amazingly helpful. We thought room was very small for a value, but it was clean and tidy. And bed was very comfortable! We had a good sleep!~4~3~4~5~3~5~4~nan
review_472201428~“Short and Sweet”~Our overnight stay in Melbourne was made so very comfortable by the convenience of the location and the efficiency of the staff. The perfect location to arrive to off the vline train, then a short walk to Southbank for dinner while remaining affordable made the Pensione the perfect choice. The room was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for a short visit. I will definitely be staying here again.~4~5~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_472050834~“short stay”~I stayed in "matchbox" room. Had what i needed, was clean. Hotel is well located. I would stay there again. Paid $104 for the room, thought 80-90 was more appropriate but it is Melbourne and their hotel rates are rising in my view.~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_471985072~“Great location. ”~Great! Clean and comfy. Sinks were a little small and a little challenging to use but very minor and made it a memory with friends. :). They offered to hold my luggage after check out so able to roam around the city with a lighter load.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471965516~“Good value for money!”~The room was relatively small and the bathroom was tiny but overall it was a very pleasant stay. We stayed here for 5 nights. Very reasonably priced. Good location within the free tram zone which meant getting around the city was easy! Small cafe on the ground floor with everything you need for breakfast. The cafe was also well priced. Would definitely recommend and would certainly stay here again when we next visit!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471732695~“A 2 star with a 4 star price tag”~Rooms behind reception are noisy all night, beds were extremely uncomfortable, carpets badly stained and ripped in hallways. We were moved to a front room and had a better nights sleep. Bathrooms were ok~2~2~5~2~3~3~5~nan
review_471486485~“Tiny em”~I was only travelling light (carry on only) and only wanted a bed so I booked a matchbox room and it was perfect. Worth the $90 for a night. The matchbox room is as the name implies - small, but OK for a night or 2 although a week and I might have cabni fever. You can wash your hands while sitting on the toilet but the bathroom is adequate.The room was spotless, bed comfortable, hardly heard a noise from outside. Staff were great as well, helpful, pleasant. It is an old building so has internal light-wells, which means its possible to get away from the noise of the main street and trains/trams but still see the sun. I was on the third floor so rooms 318-333 seem to be the quiet end of the hotel. Location was handy as well - sky's from the airport and a short walk from the terminus at Southern Cross Station to the hotel. Its in side the free tram zone so getting about the city was easy. ~4~5~3~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471349799~“Great hotel and well situated”~This hotel was easy to find being a short walk from Southern Cross station. We enjoyed our stay and found the staff so helpful. I needed to chang3 room due to a back injury and everyone was very accommodating and helpful.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_471241931~“Good value, but could be better”~We stayed in the second to smallest room.  The bed was comfy. The bathroom wasn't great. They put a box (with no drawer etc) under the sink, which is directly in front of the toilet, so you can't sit properly. The shower is difficult to get in and out of. The rooms are meant to be small, but they could be done better.  ~3~4~5~5~2~2~5~nan
review_471238886~“Very clean and comfortable”~Stayed here with my sister for the first time in a twin share. We found it very comfortable and clean.

review_471029766~“Will try Holiday Inn next time. ”~Hotel is 5 mins away from the train station and within walking distance of some city attractions.   Small room but manageable.  Bottles water in the room was not complimentary which was very weird.   Wifi was very poor. I mentioned this on check out and reception said my wifi was based on the price I paid for the room, and if I wanted faster wifi, it was available for a fee.   There is a Holiday Inn close to the Pensione. I might try that instead.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470962564~“Excellent value and service!”~I only stayed one night and got there early. The staff took care of my suitcases as I was on my way to the F1 GP. The room was immaculate, only paid for a double but got a triple room in the end after being upgraded for free (nothing wrong with more space). I was a little late to leave but staff were understanding and accommodating after the fact. All in all, it was a great trip and comes highly recommended!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470944930~“Hoem away from home”~This is always my first choice when staying in Melbourne. An easy walk from Southern Cross Station, so you can just drop your bags and get on with it. The rooms are small but well-appointed and very comfortable, and it's one of the only places I know (of a high standard) that accommodates singles so well. The staff are really friendly, and the little cafe that is attached is great - very reasonable priced (the continental buffet is only about $15) and good service. I always feel very comfortable when I'm staying here - like a second home. Have stayed many times, and will continue to.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_470824802~“Do not stay here”~We checked in smoothly and Joanne was great (the only good thing about the hotel). When we got up to our room (302) it was so small. We spoke to reception and Joanne was nice enough to move us rooms to a bigger one (321). Although the shower door is ridiculously small, both me and my partner had to get in sidewards! Bathroom in general is tiny anyway! There are no safes in the room and lack of storage space. Our first night here we went out for dinner and someone went into our room, broke our cases and stole our money. When reported the hotel did nothing. The manager said he would deal with it when he came in the next morning! We felt unsafe all night. When we spoke to the manager in the morning he made it feel like it was our fault. No compensation. Nothing. It was a complete joke. We refused our room to be cleaned during our stay and requested no one to enter our room during our stay. We had to barcade the door to feel like we could sleep. There was no force entry. We requested for cctv to be checked and they were reluctant to do this, although there is cameras everywhere. They also said it was up to us to get the police involved, they were not interested in this - which is suspect!! The front door of the hotel is supposed to be locked at 11 and then use room key to get in after this time. Every night we came in after 11 and it was open and no one on front desk- lack of security.  The location although close to 2 main tram stops, the actual area makes you feel unsafe and feels dodgy. The so called breakfast included "continental" was actually ceral and/or toast. Pathetic. Lifts are so slow it would be quicker to walk up the stairs. The bed was broken too. One side the legs had collapsed so feels like you are falling out of bed.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470767091~“Trip to footy”~Great hotel! Small and compact and very close to Etihad and Casino! The bathroom is very tiny so would not be good if you were a very large person! The price is a little high considering the size of the rooms!~5~3~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_470403442~“Don't find yourself in a shoe box room if you love space to move around”~This hotel was the worst I had ever stayed in. Nothing like what I saw on the internet. Some of the staff were however friendly and helpful. I just wish the person who took my reservation had told me about the shoe box room and how small it was. I just noticed in the email after my booking that it was called a shoe box room. I called the hotel and asked what it was. I couldn't change it after as I was going to pay for the cancellation. My room was not cleaned on one of the days. I got back to a dirty room and no clean towels. I was told that they forgot to clean it. This room didn't have good air circulation so any amount of rubbish made it unpleasant. At least now I know what this hotel is like. Thank you.~1~1~4~1~1~1~1~nan
