review_478610777~“Amazing holiday”~I enjoyed this holiday from start to finish, the staff were amazing, nothing was a problem at any time of the day or night. The room was large and luxurious, the restaurants available was so hard to pick which one and never disappointed, the amenities were superb. A treatment or massage is a must at the spa, I had two, while the first was ok the second visit was amazing. So it depends on what therapist you get.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_478368319~“Just another guest”~Inexperienced staff at the time of my check in which took longer than expected,  I expected an explanation about the room etc as is normal in most 5 star hotels but Crown I guess thought of us as just another guest !!' a do it yourself approach' Breakfast was below par Juices are from concentrate and they appears to aim for the masses.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_477701205~“Luxury stay ”~We had a wonderful stay at crown towers. The service was amazing and the room was beautiful. We ordered room service and everything was tasty. We even had a city view. It's hard to stay anywhere else in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477626906~“Opulence in Melbourne”~This is definitely one of the most opulent hotels in Australia, certainly in Melbourne. We stayed here for a memorable 3 nights.  Pros: *Clean and modern room *Spacious room and bathroom  *Quick room service and willing to go above and beyond  *Brekky at the Conservatory is fantastic - good variety of food and a great view of the Yarra and the city  *Friendly staff *Very quiet, given the larger number of guests staying at the hotel  Cons: *In room dining options are somewhat limited *No complimentary water bottles in the room - many five star hotels offer this *Crib for a baby is at an additional charge - again most five star hotels offer this complimentary Overall, a fantastic stay and is definitely the cream of the crop for the Crown hotel group.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477313615~“Crown Towers - Disappointing ”~Stayed at Crown Towers last night in a deluxe Villa. Room was fine, little worn, windows filthy but somewhat impressed. Remotes for curtains and blind hardly worked, remote for TV in bath didn't work. Booking mentioned fresh flowers being in the room... never saw them.  Air con is noisey and kept me from sleeping for some time. However still satisfied with the room.  Crystal club is a joke. Pay top dollar to access this area, service was a joke. Went for pre dinner drinks and food, felt judged by staff that we weren't meant to be in there. Questioned my room number and name multiple times.  Never got offered any food and never explained if it was self serve or needed to be ordered from a menu....Still don't know.  Drinks were offered after sometime of waiting though.  Returned for breakfast. Ordered the pancakes for my self, whilst my family staying with my decided to help them selfs to the from buffet. I ordered an orange juice as well. Pancakes came around 40 mins later after asking three times for them... (other family members were well and truely finished there meals) I'm now home and still waiting for that orange juice. What a waste of money that was getting the access to the club.  Went for dinner to the merrywell. Food amazing, service horrible. Sat down, waiting around 20 mins for them to just set the table. Waiter seems like he just wanted to kill him self. Looked so unhappy and disinterested.  Finally our order was taken, food came quick with the drinks then never saw the waiter again... plates sat piled on the table with chicken bones, we were hoping for more drinks and dessert... waiter clearly didn't want that happening. We went looking for him and asked if we could order more drinks. He replied with he's sad looking face "yeah". Walked over to the table and asked " what drink you's want?" Few moments later he returned with the drinks, and placed two down on the table. Third one he couldn't place down due to all the plates piling on the table... he picks just ONE plate up, puts the drink down and walks away.... ah what about the rest of the plates mate??  We quickly had our drinks and proceed back inside to pay... he was just standing there watching us, I was looking at him expecting him to ask how our meal was and if we're ready to setting the bill... nothing. I had to tell him I want to pay the bill. He doesn't say anything presses a few buttons on the computer screen then hands me the eftpos machine... Going back to the hotel experience, we pre-paid 2 playtime vouchers. They were not provided to us during check in. I called butler services and explained that I pre-paid for them but haven't received the cards. Around 10 mins later the butler knocks on the door and hands me a deck of playing cards... ah what??  Again reexplained my request and he just gives me a blank look and tells me that's not what he got called for and hands me to playing cards.... I further had to explain my self and then he said he will get someone from crystal club to work it out as he has no idea what I'm talking about. 10 or so mins later finally I get the cards handed to me.  Overall for the amount of money spent over $1200 for one night I'm pretty disappointed with the experience. Don't see myself coming back anytime soon.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476989241~“sadly, not a 5-star hotel in my opinion...”~After many stays at the amazing Langham Hotel in Melbourne, I decided to try a new '5 star' hotel, closest to the Crown complex, to keep my teenage sons occupied for a period of 5 days during the school holidays. I decided on the Crown Towers for its location, it's bedding configuration and it's recommendation. First an outline of what I liked about this hotel. The check-in process was easy and pleasant. Even though there was some confusion about room allocation, this was quickly resolved by Cindi at the front desk with an apology and a bottle of champagne. The rooms were beautiful; exactly as they are depicted on the internet. Spacious with two comfortable queen size beds perfectly dressed. Our room view was a bonus, looking out onto the river and various Melbourne landmarks, which especially looked amazing at night. The bathrooms were luxurious with a big shower, marble finishes and a bathtub with a TV to boot! My disappointment certainly does not lie with the actual room we stayed in but rather with the level of customer service I would expect from a 5 star hotel. I expect friendly staff at each turn of the corridor, I expect housekeeping to be of a high and consistent standard, I expect staff communication a must, and I expect acknowledgement of special occasions. Regrettably, this is not what I encountered at the Towers. Three of us were staying in the room, yet every day I asked housekeeping for another towel, another toothbrush, etc etc....and each day the standard of housekeeping varied considerably. There was only one day out of the four that housekeeping was at a 5 star level and I made sure to commend that staff member upon checkout. The attitude of the staff members surprised me as pleasantries were few and far between. Maybe the direction of the moon had a part to play?!! Some were friendly, some were pleasantly vocal and some just kept walking with absolutely no recognition of their patrons. I experienced one of the valet/porter gentlemen enter the building before me, forgetting his manners of opening the door for myself and those behind me. Call me old-fashioned, but isn't this a 'given' at a 5-star hotel? I waited at concierge for at least 10 minutes whilst the staff member was on the telephone. A simple smile to acknowledge he wouldn't be long would have made all the difference. Such attention to detail is what rates a hotel above the rest. And no daily complimentary water in the rooms? Unheard of in my world of travel! Even though I can choose to continue with a list of disappointments about this hotel, I will summarise by saying, the Crown Towers is beautiful, but in my opinion, too big and too busy to offer a personal and intimate experience to its regular customers. If you appreciate some luxury and exceptional customer service is important to you, then you are taking a chance booking this hotel. Maybe you will be lucky enough to encounter staff such as Cindi at the front desk...maybe you will not! I think I will continue to stay at the trusted Langham, where everything and everyone is important and everything is done with a huge smile. I am sorry Crown Towers, I really wanted to like you.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_476731533~“Over priced for what it is”~Nice room but for in excess of $600 a night, it's really not up to scratch. Dirty light fittings and barely functional taps in the bathroom. Friendly staff and still a nice room but not worth the cash.~3~1~3~3~4~3~5~nan
review_476725498~“Amazing views of Melbourne”~We stayed at the Crown Towers for a friends 21st birthday. For the price you pay, you get every dollars worth. Pool is very nice. Views are spectacular. Very welcoming staff members willing to help you with everything.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476678088~“Thanks for the stay”~A special thank you to the staff at Crown Towers for providing complimentary wine & chocolates for my partners birthday. It was a very nice gesture and made our stay even more memorable. First stay at this hotel and we stayed in a Deluxe king room. The room was great and very clean as you would expect. Everyone was great to deal with and any issues were sorted ASAP. The pool and steam room are recommended as well.  Breakfast in the conservatory was good with a great range of food eg Asian & European cuisines. We were lucky to get a discount for breakfast which made it affordable for us otherwise it may be expensive for some.   We brought along our own car and self parked in the multilevel Crown-Metropol car park next door at a cost of $20 overnight.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476637080~“Romantic night away”~A great night away. Check in was smooth considering it was school holidays. Just a shame we couldn't get a late check out when asking at reception. Room was clean, bed was very comfortable, would have been nicer to be higher up but the view was still good. Room amenities was a nice surprise. Bathroom was beautiful and would definitely stay at Towers again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476249845~“Deluxe Staycation”~My partner and I stayed over Easter as a break from the grind after an extremely busy start to the year. We did all the things you looked forward to as a kid but very rarely get to do as an adult. Lazed around in giant fluffy robes, shuffled to the pool and sauna occasionally, ordered club sandwiches for dinner, watched TV in the bath. If you need a good rest in a lush room with blackout blinds on remote control and a pool area that easily transports you to any exotic destination, Crown Towers is the place. Even if you only live 5 kilometres down the road.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476249647~“What's not to like!”~Beautiful rooms, great location and good value if you can find a good deal (not sure I would pay full price to stay with so many other amazing choices in the cbd). Pool and gym area are great with a large shallow section for kids One con - the line on a Friday arvo for checkin was ridiculous with more than one person commenting and only 2 people checking people in ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476115077~“Location Location Location”~The view overlooking the City from the south bank of the Yarra is spectacular day or night. The room, a suite, was lovely and very comfortable/luxury. My nieces LOVED the TV In the bath. Pool is fantastic and we spent a lot of time enjoying it. On the downside $55 for parking when I was already paying $830 for a room, irritated me. And $110 for a rollaway bed! Breakfast at the conservatory, where the choice is extensive, was not a relaxing affair but rather quite chaotic with a rude front of house person who was clearly buckling under the stress. But once we were seated and finally got a coffee we enjoyed the food and the lovely morning view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475987379~“Again great”~Booked via FHR. Upgrade, lounge and airport transfer. Best hotel in Melbourne currently. Professionally managed and well maintained. Great location for heading in the city or taking a walk. Casino experience o.k.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475971925~“20th Anniversary for Locals & Loved It!”~Decided to treat ourselves to a night at Crown for our 20th and loved every minute. Went for a Studio Room which are located on levels 8 and above; we ended up on Level 24. It's a great room, nicely fitted out with a beautiful bathroom and a very comfy bed. We had lunch at Conservatory which was fantastic (breakfast was included in our room rate & was a buffet breakfast at Conservatory which was top drawer). If you live locally and want to treat yourself my suggestion is find the right occasion and go for it. It definitely made it feel like a special occasion and something I'm sure we'll remember.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475698400~“Friendly and Relaxing Birthday Treat”~Professional and friendly valet-parking welcome. Surprised by queue at check-in. Room not ready at 2pm. 14th floor, double room with two very comfortable queen beds and city view. Clean and spacious marble bathroom. Had to ring for baggage as it took so long coming to the room, and then again to ask for dressing gowns (only one in room) but birthday gift of champagne from the hotel was very welcome! The pool area and steam room look lovely although there were not enough beds and, not surprising in school holidays I suppose, a lot of very noisy children, even in the steam room! When we returned to the pool early morning, it was peaceful and serene and a beautiful start to the day, hard to believe it was the same place. We didn't use the gym but it looked well-equipped.The Conservatory breakfast was really good, plenty of choice and quality food (including Asian). We tried a couple of restaurants in the complex. Gradi, delicious Italian (lunch) and Koko, amazing Japanese (dinner). The food was truly exquisite in Koko. Tables for two had incredible views of the cityscape. Hotel checkout was another queue but very efficient and friendly and they offered to pay our minibar bill to make up for the delayed check-in. Over all, despite a few minor niggles we had a good time and a thoroughly pleasant stay in this well-located hotel.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_475427997~“This really is a beautiful and grand hotel with wonderful service”~We stayed in a premium room on level 21 overlooking the city for five nights. We were a family of four and the room easily had enough space for all of us and our luggage. We had two queen size beds and a beautiful view over the river and city. Watching Foxtel in the bath was a treat.  We loved the pool and gym area on level 3. The entire hotel is luxurious and all the staff we dealt with were fantastic.  Most days we spoke to Preston who was the Concierge and he is not only great for Crown but for the entire tourism industry in Melbourne and Victoria. Everything he recommended for a family we loved.  I miss not having chocolates on my pillow at home each night! A tip for breakfast is a small coffee shop (forgotten the name sorry) that is behind Criniti's which has coffee/hot chocolate plus a home made bacon and egg muffin for $6.50.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475425866~“Relaxing weekend.”~Booked our room and 2 days before arrival we where offered a great upgrade for only $50, very happy with the upgrade, the room had a view over the river and city, central to everything. Loved it and thoroughly recommend.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_475398858~“A Great Staycation”~What a great trip. We spent 2 nights in a double bed room overlooking the Yarra. 'We' comprised my wife and me plus three children under 7. Despite the chances we survived the close proximity as the rooms are very spacious. Equally the rooms are absolutely luxurious with amazing finishes across all aspects.  We spent a lot of time in Crown Towers' amazing pool and had an absolute ball. The staff were very accepting of families whilst still paying attention to couples.  We ate at Kokos which was grossly disappointing. We had a drink at the 'Waiting Room' which was okay I suppose (the staff were great) although for all the other 5 star aspects of Towers, this place feels more like a tacky cafe than a lobby bar. We also met friends for a few drinks at the Nobu bar - again pretty ordinary with staff seemingly interested in other things.  We had breakfast at the Conservatory. The food was okay and typical of a buffet breakfast but $130 for 3 kids and two adults is a little rich.  Crown really do need to create a great bar experience, that option is really lacking. You either have the train station waiting room, the bar right next to a million poker machines or Nobu. Club 23 was not open on the nights we were there, perhaps this is their answer.  All in all though a great stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474847800~“Glamorous but showing it's age”~First time staying at Crown Towers, and it fairness I was comparing it to its younger, more hip counterparts Metropol and Promenade. It's the pricier and more top end original. In theory anyway.  The glamour, opulence and service is on point. It's stunning.  However, our rooms looked a tad worse for wear - the furnishings could do with a spruce up and a bit of spackle and paint wouldn't hurt either.  The pool is nice but pales compared to the infinity pools of the other two hotels. Also, no bar open during the week was a disappointment.  We had a fabulous few days on a girls weekend so I'm definitely not complaining. But next time I would choose Metropol or Promenade.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474846628~“Sandy”~What can I say about this place but wow awesome. We stayed there for our anniversary .From check in we had an enjoyable time. The room was very nice.

review_474418004~“Great five star hotel in the perfect location - great family stay”~Perfect stay from the moment we arrived until we had to ( unfortunately) leave to the airport.  Valet service upon arrival, quick check in. Big Room for whole family of 4 with 2 queen size bed and nice view to Southbank. Their indoor pool is jus "wow" - huge like a ballroom with patios and plenty of deck hairs. Huge professional gym. Outstanding service and truly a five star experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474414147~“Everything you'd expect from 5 star and more”~Modern and luxurious rooms, beautiful and spacious bathrooms, fantastic food available more or less 24/7, and the entertainment aspect of staying in the casino is always a huge bonus.

review_474041268~“Glitzy, expensive but lives up to expectation”~I have wanted to stay here for quite a while but have avoided it due to how expensive the hotel is. On this occasion I could combine business with pleasure so it made sense. I must say that despite being eye wateringly expensive, the service, selection, entertainment and variety really make up for it. It's like a little piece of high end Vegas in Melbourne. I really like the selection of restaurants from cheap eats food court to high end "anything you need".  I had two different rooms - a standard room which was larger than most, felt plush, had a great layout and stunning views. When my partner arrived a few days later, we upgraded to a suite which was huge and fabulous....but to be honest my standard room was more than enough. I cannot impress upon people enough to go for the club lounge upgrade. Its ridiculously good - free breakfast, free evening snack and drinks (yes unlimited free drinks including great wines, spirits and cocktails). The indoor pool is pretty awesome too....as is the gym Ok....in summary this is a pretty awesome experience...albeit it pretty darned expensive (did I say that already). If I wanted to be picky (and there isnt much to be negative about), unless you are paying for premium rooms (which I did)...the checkin experience is pretty average - ie stand in line for quite a while for the privilege of checking in.~5~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474020269~“Impressive All Round”~My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Crown Towers on a gifted rare night away from the kids. From start to finish we were thoroughly impressed by the attention to detail and fantastic customer service received. We had a Deluxe King room on the 17th floor, which had fantastic views of the city and felt beautifully luxurious. It was also exceptionally clean and well laid out, including the walk in robe and spa like spacious bathroom. As our stay was a Deluxe Package we also received valet parking and breakfast in the Conservatory. This is the third Crown Hotel we have stayed in, having previously stayed at Crown Promenade and Crown Metropol. Each have been great with different feels to them. I would certainly say that Crown Towers is the epitome of a five star hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_473734460~“Beautiful Crown”~This was to be a special trip for my Mom, who is 85. We're so glad we chose Crown Towers, for the beautiful rooms and public areas set the 'tone' right for a great holiday.  We were both exhausted from the overnight flight, & front desk did the right thing in giving us an early check-in. I know sometimes it's hard to offer an early check-in, especially when the hotel is full, but I told them about my Mom & the right thing was done. We had a high floor city view which was breathtaking. Gorgeous in the day, gorgeous at night.  Here, Housekeeping reigns as our room was serviced daily. Mom commented that the room was very clean. Spotless actually. We had twin beds & they were huge, plus big plush pillows. The room even had a niche where you can sit & literally look 23 floors down. We saw fireworks, the Crown fire columns that blew balls of fire into the sky at the strike of every hour. There were buses, taxis and uber cabs you can call so getting around was not difficult. We caught a Skybus when we arrived, stopping at Southern Cross station followed by a free shuttle bus all the way to Crown.  On the bus, Crown seems to be an institution, like the way Raffles Hotel is in Singapore, and highly respected. But Crown is still in its prime, youthful with some over-the-top presentation (loved it, who wants a boring hotel?) in some areas and understated luxury in others. The restaurants are great, with a nice cafe with yummy cakes. As for Melbourne, I'm slightly partial to this sophisticated city as I studied at Monash 25 years ago. The city is still beautiful; I especially love the organic shops for tea, skincare and supplements. Mekong still serves great pho. And I love Myers that has a dedicated floor for plus size ladies.  But we couldn't spend the whole day out could we?  It's back to Crown, oozing luxury, to relax.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473727835~“Great place for our special celebration”~My wife and I booked our stay for our special silver wedding anniversary. We had a super time and the staff were fantastic. We had a studio apartment upgrade which was nice but the exceptional view was marred by the dirty windows inside and out (inside washed with dirty cloth and smeared). Would recommend you call down tovalet parking to get your car out as we decided to get the car to quickly see our child play netball and the car took 15mins to arrive. Still saw her win which was great. All in all a great place to stay as it is central to most of the city and some good restuarants/entertainment. Will definitely stay again.

As we were staying four nights and on a busy schedule one would expect the rooms to be cleaned before 1pm.

review_472796793~“Just Amazing!”~I stayed at Crown Towers from April 3 until April 5, a two night stay that was fantastic. My Deluxe King Room was situated on level 10 with a breath-taking view of the CBD and Yarra River. Right from checkin to checkout the customer service was fantastic. Room service/in room dining was delicious, it was also a nice touch to have a Turn Down Service every evening, where the house keeper would enter the room with fresh towels, put out slippers, fill ice bucket with ice, prepare the bed for sleeping and to top it off leaving two chocolates on the pillow. The Pool/Gym area of Crown Towers is so great, a massive indoor pool, gym and tennis courts on the roof. Will be definitely staying again soon.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_471760849~“What, no loo roll or pepper!”~Here on an overnight business trip so just needed to be in and out. Check in fine, room a standard business room. Buffet breakfast pretty basic for the price i.e. no salad items and everything frie. I cam back to my table with some eggs and asked for some ground pepper. the waiter disappeared and came back 10 minutes later just as I had finished. my plate was empty in front of and he proudly put down the pepper grinder on the table. I pointed out that I had now finished my breakfast and he said he had to assemble the pepper grinder...what sort of restaurant has to go and assemble pepper grinders. any way I was now against the clock and thought I would quickly visit the restroom before a long trip ahead. sadly at 8 am in the morning the public gents toilet had not yet been serviced so neither of the two cubicles had toilet paper despite each cubicle having the facility for two rolls. I did go to reception and tell them this and they got straight on the phone with a mumble apology. It got three stars as its a decent business hotel but its prices would lead you to expect more. It trades on its location and obviously its priority is to attract Casino customers who may not care much about the quality of hotel room. Probably won't stay again if I can find decent reasonably priced alternative.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan

review_471247620~“ZGreat weekend destination”~Recently styed at Crown Towers for a weekend, the hotel deserves its 5 star rating, nice rooms, good service and exceptional location for visiting the Melbourne city district. Pricing is not cheap but it is what one would expect for one of Australia's only 2 Forbes 5 star hotels. Location wise it is a short walk to some of Melbourne's best restaurants and shopping - so much to do and no need to use a car or transport~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471242363~“Outstanding”~We booked a romantic weekend away for our anniversary & received a complimentary room upgrade to a suite which was a really lovely touch. The staff were very attentive and knowledgeable along with the facilities, pool & spa made our weekend very special.  Definitely a very positive experience.  Will be coming back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471241114~“F1”~We went for a few business meetings followed by attending the F1 motor racing The Crown Towers is an easy location to get to everywhere we needed to in Melbourne and the service of all the staff was great.~5~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_470832569~“Amazing”~We were blown away with our stay and the service from all staff throughout our stay with the Crown. First impressions are always important, and i wish i could remember the lovely ladies name who checked us in as her service, knowledge and the time she spent with my husband and I going through what the hotel had to offer was outstanding. She took time to show us a couple of other room options if we had interest in upgrading, which we did, and it's because of this upgrade and the beautiful view we had of the city that we will be returning to the Crown Towere March of every year. Room stunning, staff outstanding, overall the stay was faultless. Lastly what beautiful restaurants, we ate at the Rockpool twice in a row and i will count the days until we will again. Thank you for everything.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_470758903~“Super Hotel in Melbourne”~We spent last night at Crown Towers and must say we had a great stay. The twin room was excellent and very well appointed, with comfortable, large double beds, sumptuous towels and all the add-ons the come with a top notch five star hotel.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_468446516~“Pure luxury”~We stayed at the deluxe villa for my husbands birthday and could not ask for more. We were really impressed with the room and service. We found it to be a very good value for money with crystal club access and valet parking included in our room rate. The crystal club was a highlight of our stay as we enjoyed the afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks with canapés on the day. The breakfast at the club was pretty good. We really liked the pool area and I think that's the best indoor pool I've ever been to in a hotel. We've stayed at the Promenade couple of times before but Towers take it to the another level. We will definitely stay here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468143125~“It is what it is cracked up to be...”~Located right in the heart of Melbourne with trams and trains everywhere it is easy to get to where you need to be. The rooms are massive and spotless with great views over the City skyline, The service is friendly and in an nice way over the top, checkout, valet, check in was all seamless. Surprisingly the actual room prices are very competitive for Melbourne it is just the add ons that are expensive - valet, parking and room service. Great stay.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_467452273~“Hard to fault ”~Great guest experience with comfortable bed and quality fixtures and furnishings. The rooms are adequate in size with good size bathrooms and cleaned to a high standard. There are also lots of food options nearby at affordable prices.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467426359~“BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION”~I have stayed at CROWN TOWERS before, and it would have to be my favourite Hotel in Melbourne. My Room was not ready on arrival as I was 30 minutes early. I was offered a Smoking Room immediately, but declined. After an hour or so, I was given a room on the 11th Floor - and as always Clean, Neat, Slippers, Gowns, great amenities. However, most of my Birthday was held at the CASINO, and it was appalling, it has gone so down-hill, dress standard non existent, squashed in people and machines! The Interstate VIP room is practically 90% smoking; and OLD machines. I totally recommend the Accommodation, and the accommodation Staff were excellent. By-pass the CASINO.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467090348~“Luxury at the city's doorstep.”~My partner and I have stayed at crown towers twice this year. You may find the price daunting at first, but the moment that you check your self in to this hotel you will realise that the price is well worth it. The rooms are spacious, clean and pure luxury, with your own soaking bath with a Tv, seperate toilet and shower, beautiful view of the City plus you also have the option to have a smoking room.The hotel has access to great food and has great facilities ( I suggest going for a swim or spar at the indoor pool)and is right in the heart of Melbourne. I would suggest to everyone that they should experience this place at least once.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467084084~“Little slice of luxury in Melbourne”~Enjoyed a wonderful 2 night stay at this hotel and found the service friendly and attentive. Indulged in a duo massage in the spa centre which was divine and visited the large pool next door - a very lazy enjoyable day! The buffet breakfast had a large selection of hot/cold food which was quite pleasant also, but on the Monday (public holiday in Melbourne) it was very busy around 10am and a queue to get in, so recommend you get there earlier rather than later (breakfast finishes at 10.30am). Overall a very great relaxing stay and the place still looks impressive. Enjoyed the view over the river and city from the 26th floor.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467073418~“Anniversary”~Wow what a great view from the 10 floor - awesome light display - as well as a beautiful night walk along Southgate plenty of restaurants and cafes as well as a flutter on the pokies  melbourne is a great place to visit -market - library - sport precinct and many beautiful gardens and old buildings not a place to pass up~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_466198291~“That Special Feeling”~I love going to Melbourne, whether for an event, or just to get away I feel there is always something to do. The greatest complement to the travel is to stay in a great hotel. Crown Towers is that hotel. You are made to feel special, and like you are the only person that matters in a bustling entertainment complex. Even when Melbourne decides to turn on its typical, fickle weather, entertainment options are aplenty within Crown.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466151667~“Beautiful as always”~We just stayed the one night for our wedding anniversary celebrations and the staff were so lovely on check in. We even received complimentary champagne and chocolates from the staff to help us celebrate. The room was beautiful and clean and we had a lovely view. Unfortunately it was a fleeting visit this time but very pleasant and comfortable nonetheless.  The room was quiet. The pillows were so comfortable. Fantastic.  Thanks again Crown.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466148014~“excellent service and quality”~highly recommend,great to relax and enjoy high end quality without immense cost .Luxury is better than expected would definitely go again.Recommend you to try if you are considering a getaway we should have stayed 2 nights to enjoy full benefits. ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466124281~“Can't fault the service and food”~Stayed here for a work conference. Very large room with its own walk in robe. Comfortable bed. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I had, although one person to show guests to tables was insufficient. A queue formed every day. Also the guy on eggs was very stressed, slow and got the order wrong 3 out of 4 times. I think a bigger egg station is required.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465996130~“Amazing intro to Villa Life!”~Booked a suite at Crown for our engagement and couldn't have had a better experience. Were lucky enough to get upgraded to a Villa which was AMAZING, & had already included Crystal Club access in our original booking, which is highly recommended. Staff were amazing and we simply did not want to leave~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465895429~“Family first.”~We arrived from the airport before check-in time, but were allowed access to our room, whilst the connecting one was prepared. Our children were so excited by the TV at the foot of the bath that they piled into the bath fully clothed to watch it. We dragged them away and down to the fabulous pool, where we enjoyed the rest of the afternoon. The breakfast buffet was also beyond their wildest dreams! A chocolate fountain provided bowls of 'chocolate soup' for breakfast with a smattering of fresh, juicy strawberries.  All together a great weekend was had and Crown was a perfect choice. We'll be back. It was worth watching for the special price as the time of our stay approached, because ultimately two rooms were cheaper than the one we had initially booked.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465832701~“Nice service and huge room”~The room is huge and the bed is very comfortable and big enough, and everything is nice, but the room haven't slippers, need to call front desk to request. And hotel 's Chinese restaurant "silks" is very good services, and delicious. Below the hotel is casino and many luxury shops. If u want find some cheaper food, the hotels mall have a very big foodcourt have a lot of choice.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465696593~“Top Gun Boys Weekend Away ”~My 5th stay at the Crown Towers Melbourne, arrived Friday for some early morning meetings then checked in. Just love the attention to detail the team always seem to deliver. From parking, restaurants, bars, fitness, pool and steam room. Crown Towers Melbourne has to be my number one pick to stay away from home.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465685816~“Holiday in Melbourne ”~Room view Outstanding.  As shown in pictures of advertisement two loungers and TV but surely a wide 90+ degrees view of city. ( can never be 360!! ) Amazing.  Technologically advanced with automation plus Good furnishing choices in the room.  However upon first room choice there was lot of cigarette smoke in passage to room as well as in the bedroom. It was a non smoking floor!! They claim someone has smoked in without their knowledge.  I suggested to look up their videos of passage identify and find the culprit. But they did not seem to be very serious about it.  As an easy option we did few room changes wasted close to an hour and in the process missed on good dinner as restaurants were closed they do a bit early.  It is best location by the river and CBD district of Melbourne.  Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465254937~“Excellent property - bravo Crown!”~Best location, casino, liveliness, overall experience! A pinch away from restaurants, bars, entertainment, shopping and over to the CBD side of Melbourne! Will definitely repeat if we go back to Melbourne  ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_465139836~“Extremely luxurious stay”~Being at Crown Towers feels like a holiday. Everything is close by and extremely high quality. There is fabulous shopping, restaurants and experiences at your doorstep. Upon check-in we would have liked to be explained to about where and when breakfast would be (in the Conservatory). We had to contact room service to request this information however overall an amazing stay as always.~5~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan

review_464184518~“Crown is THE BEST HOTEL in Melbourne ”~Crown Towers is without a doubt the best hotel in Melbourne.  Although we have been lucky enough to stay several times, it's always an amazing experience. The staff are all fabulous, the rooms beautiful and clean, with stunning views of the bay or the city.  If you are lucky enough to have Crystal Club included with your room you are in for a extra special treat. The service in The Crystal Club is wonderful and the staff spoil you completely.  We can't thank Eunice and Aree enough for their special care and attention during this stay (and all our past visits). We have returned home feeling very special and very, very pampered. So many of the staff deserve special mention from Ruben and Rick when you Valet park your car to all the staff in the Crystal Club including Abbey, Shaun and Hannah to name just a few.  Crown Towers is Definitely the best of hotels in Melbourne and going back is like going home.. would not choose to stay anywhere else~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_463945049~“Crown Towers - my second home”~Crown Towers offers a true 5+ star experience. From the moment you valet your car, you are welcomed with a friendly smile and directed to check-in. Rooms are spacious and well appointed and the quietest I have stayed in. The beds are extremely comfortable and plenty of pillows to choose from. Highly recommend the Crystal Club package and experiencing the highest quality service and attention. Staff are friendly and extremely professional. Food is a delight and food requests outside of the menu are met when able.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463665832~“Amazing Experience”~My husband & I stayed at Crown Towers for our anniversary last night from the time we arrived we were treated with an outstanding amazing of courtesy and thought. On arrival we were generously upgraded with champagne and chocolate sent to our room. The reception staff were so thoughtful and caring about our anniversary treating our special day with so much attention it honestly was a humbling experience. The executive room we were placed in was singularly the most beautiful room we have stayed in with every little thing catered for including something every mother of three could wish for with a private luxurious bathroom that contained a TV over the bath where I could relax in a hot soaking bath and watch a program uninterrupted with a choice of mood lighting. The food we had delivered from room service arrived piping hot fresh and delicious. On departure I realised I had left my phone somewhere the immediate attention the staff payed to the task of finding the phone was extraordinary. Our stay at Crown Towers was nothing short of amazing and we look forward to being able to stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463573711~“Comfortable and Clean”~I stayed here on business for one night. The staff were friendly and the hotel had a good feel to it.  The room was spacious and clean. When I checked in (earlier than check-in time) the only room available was a smoking room. I took this as I needed to work straight away, rather than wait for a non-smoking room.  I was pleasantly surprised that the room didn't smell of smoke at all. When you got out of the lift the hallway had a hint of cigarette smoke but the room itself had no cigarette smell at all, which was great.  I would definitely recommend staying here on either business or pleasure.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463319821~“A Gem - Absolutely Terrific”~As experienced travelers, we are always excited when we find a special hotel or resort. This is definitely one. This was one of the nicest, if not the nicest, rooms we have ever stayed in. It was gorgeous. We could not have been more pleased. The sheets and towels were top class, and the amenities matched. The property is conveniently located for you to see and get to all the main attractions in Melbourne. The food here was superb, particularly at Rosetta, which was a magnificent meal with service to match. Without question we will return here if we return to Melbourne. we wished we were able to stay longer.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_463062365~“Lovely Hotel, very quite, clean, yet near everything”~I have stayed here quite a few times now & it is my choice to stay when I am travelling to Melbourne. It is luxurious, spotlessly clean, great service & fantastic amenities. Take advantage of the gym on the 27th floor, it is one of the best hotel gyms. The spa pool & sauna in the change rooms is fantastic. The hotel is really quite, you can't here people walking down the hallways, it is a really nice, peaceful hotel. The staff & friendly without being obstrusive & they welcome you when you have stayed there a few times.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_462596785~“Service Not Up to the 5 Star Standard”~My wife and I stayed at the Crown Towers for a special occasion. We usually stay at either the Metropol or the Langham but we though that we would try Crown Towers for a change (plus we were booked into Rosetta for dinner). On arrival the 'Bell Boy' first asked if we were at the right hotel (why I do not know) and then made fun of my suit pack. Very strange behavior for a five star hotel! I pre-ordered champagne on arrival (which wasn't in our room when we got there) and when it turned up the server said 'with compliments' - which I found confusing/amusing given that I had paid for it! Finally, when we returned from dinner we were surprised that there had been no turn down service. Crown Towers 'looks' the goods but overall the service we experienced was not consistent with a five star hotel.~2~3~5~4~4~4~2~nan
review_462575552~“Great Service💯”~Crown Towers Hotel is a very compact and comfortable one with a great service.  Located by the Yarra river it provides a great view,whereaes you can find many bars to chill.

review_462561614~“Luxury personified”~Words cannot describe: take the opulence of Dubai with the glitz of Vegas and Crown Towers is that blend. Wonderful hotel but the real kicker is the multiple entertainment options to dining choices to gaming to clubbing, all in the same venue. It's a must see for anyone looking to experience first world luxury wonders.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_462298748~“Quiet refuge in a big city”~Spent three nights at this large hotel in Melbourne. Location is probably the best perk. Easy access to shopping, restaurants and sight seeing from the hotel. Although the hotel is large, our room was huge, quiet, clean and had all the amenities you would want on a long trip. Breakfast buffet offered food for all cultures and palates..amazing. You won't go away hungry.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462091238~“5 Stars!”~We regularly go and stay at crown towers when wanting to go Melbourne. On many occasions we have had our room upgraded for free and get free wine or chocolates in our room. The rooms are very clean and very nice. The beds are to die for and if you didnt have things to do you could sleep there all day long. The staff are friendly and very willing to help with any questions you have and just overall top off the awesome experience that crown towers has to offer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_460850863~“Never disappoints!”~Stayed here numerous times over the years. Our recent stay was only 4 nights but still a very enjoyable experience. Even over the years this hotel hasn't slipped, still as good as when it first opened.  Friendly, helpful, accommodating and very welcoming staff, not to mention the high class rooms and facilities makes this one of the best hotels we have stayed at.  We hope to be back again soon!!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460614170~“Something keeps drawing me back here.”~I have been fortunate enough to have visited the Crown Towers before. It left me with a really soft spot for the place.  The place is truly luxurious. With the beautifully decorated rooms, foyer and restaurants, to the multiple choices of luxury fashion and jewellery brands at the base of the hotel, what more could you want? I was also lucky enough to do a site tour of the place, to see the options that are available. What a tour it was! This place is amazing and made for anyone, of any budget.  Firstly we stayed in a Deluxe King suite which for the price and it being one of the lower range rooms, was still stunning and spacious. As you will see from my pics we also had an amazing view of Melbourne, which made you want to get out and explore.  The bathrooms are my favourite part of the room, not only are they roomy but so luxurious. The fittings, lighting and amenities makes you want to spend time in there. (The TV in the mirror of the bathtub helps too). All levels of the hotels rooms and suites are stunning. Beautifully decorated with tasteful luxurious pieces.  Once you also go up the scale you will find more space and also more amenities at your finger tips.  For the high rollers, this hotel will treat you like royalty with so many things on offer, I would not have enough time here to describe them all. The chairmans villa, is something that dreams are made of and one to aspire to. Things such as butlers, access to the Crystal Club Lounge, private gaming floors are all available if desired.  You also have the option of the Crystal Club Lounge, for a private dedicated check in service and a place to enjoy breakfast, a drink with friends all in a stunning atmosphere. Another benefit of this hotel is your walking distance to the city.  While also having some world famous choices of restaurants to eat at on site. Places such as Nobu, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal and Rockpool will have your tastebuds excited in anticipation.  The casino itself is what you would expect of a casino, though I will say I felt a lot more welcomed and included in this one, even as an amateur gambler.  If you are a fitness freak or just like relaxing, the 25 metre heated indoor pool is a sight to behold. You can also have a game of tennis on one of the two tennis courts. You also have a rooftop garden area with amazing views of the city.  The gym itself is one of the best equipped gyms I have found in a hotel in a long time. You just need your room key and motivation they will supply the towel and water.  If you are going to Melbourne this is the hotel to spoil yourself at. You will not be disappointed by the pure pleasure. The staff are eager to assist you and ensure that your visit won't be forgotten.  Why not take a joy flight in one of their new helicopters to really finish the trip.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460290583~“By far the best hotel in Australia.”~To be honest I wish I could give Crown Towers a 10 star rating. The service and hospitality they offer is simply amazing. You are made to feel like a million bucks each and every day of your stay, with helpful staff at every corner and many fabulous 5-star restaurants to choose from. My partner has a nut allergy and at both the Conservatory and Rosetta he was personally told of the items on the menu which he could and couldn't have without even having to ask. We stayed in the executive suite, which had a beautiful view of Melbourne CBD and was just all-round gorgeous as expected. Our towels and sheets were changed each day. Room service came within 15 minutes at peak time. Bell-desk held our luggage before check-in and after check-out for no extra cost so we could enjoy the city without carrying our bags. Overall, the best hotel my partner and I have ever stayed at and we highly recommend!!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
