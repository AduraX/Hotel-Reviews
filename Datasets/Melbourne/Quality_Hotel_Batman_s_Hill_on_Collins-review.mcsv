review_479041959~“Fabulous Location, Trams outside the door, supermarket across the road”~My three friends and I had a two bedroom apartment which had four single beds. The apartment is just what we wanted and given we got a superb deal, we were more than happy with this 3.5-star property. Our apartment had a kitchen that had a fridge, microwave, toaster and jug. There was a two-seater couch in the dining/lounge room and also a table and four chairs. Trams are right outside the door, Southern Cross Station is straight across the road which has a decent sized supermarket.  The staff were great, very accommodating and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for location to all the attractions in Melbourne, decent beds, restaurants and bars within walking distance or a very short ride on the tram.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_477026353~“good room, good entrance hall, good staff, good food. piano with occasional professionals playing. great price.”~stayed at a lot of hotels. this one has quality in its name for a reason. rooms come equipped with things like ironing boards, kettle, ac and tv. . sound insulation is good for guests, and its located close to shops and station, without being in a noisy night time area. Highly recommend~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476978126~“Great Location”~The hotel is a stones throw from southern cross station but it is just an average hotel. Nothing special but what more do you need in Melbourne but a bed and a hot shower as most people won't be spending there time in there rooms anyways.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan
review_476293371~“Excellent Hotel, Fantistic Location and Lovely Staff”~Booked a seven day Package Deal last October 2016 with Virgin Airlines Frequent Flyer for Easter 2017 and so pleased we did. This Hotel is ideally located, across road from Southern Cross Railway Station, taxi service, trams and supermarkets. Upon arrival greeted by very riendly staff at reception (spanish accent). Very pleased with speedy check-in and Premium Room, with King Size bed and a very spacious room throughout. The bathroom had separate shower and large spa bath, my husband is 6ft tall and loved it. We asked for extra towels and 3 extra pillows for comfortability when sitting up with  bad arthritis. All requests were done with ease. Tea and Coffee supplied, iron and ironing  board in this room. All floors have a guest laundry with coin operated washing machine  and dryer. $3 for washing and $2 for the Dryer. (Bring gold coins only) I brought my own washing powder but Woolwoths Supermarket is inside Southern Cross Railway Station so very handy for everything and a newsagent.  We paid in advance at reception for breakfast over Easter, had five dollars discount per person, cooked breakfast and continental all available every day. So glad we did, saves walking to find breakfast. Jason (Food and Beverage Manager) and Alan (Chef on Duty)  set up everything just perfect and were attentive and both very helpful with local information, as well as with attention to detail fantastic. Jason put  the fruit medley into individual bowls and it was more appealing and delicious. The  breakfast was very substantial and Alan, the Chef On Duty supplied us with toasted hot  cross buns on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. There were also small Easter Eggs  available to guests. A very nice touch and thank you! The only criticism and I am being a little picky is the white bathroom and floor could do with a good scrub. I am a fastidious person, but some bleach on the floor tiles in bathroom in and around the bath, shower and toilet and good clean carpet in the room would make all the difference. A bathroom cabinet could be fitted in this bathroom, plenty of room as as the small granite shelf is a bit tedious. I like to hide all my stuff away. Bathroom a bit sparse on furnishing. On the whole a fantastic stay, quiet rooms, location of hotel and your excellent, friendly staff will definitely bring us back in a heart beat.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_471555438~“Used this hotel for the F1”~We booked as we were going to the F1 and this hotel was in an ideal location. Just across the road was the free tram on race days straight to the circuit very well organised. For the rest of our time in Melbourne we were able to get around and about very easily from this position. However we had a 2 bedroom apartment which was very tired and after 5 nights of all our windows overlooking a concrete wall it was lovely to move on to Cairns for a sea view~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470525171~“Great Location, Rude Staff”~Can't find a better location for the formula one Grand Prix. Southern Cross station tram stop is literally across the road and the free tram takes you direct to gates 1 and 2. So you'd think I'd stay there again wouldn't you? No. I'd stay at Vibe which is nearby or somewhere else which might have better staff. On check in, I was told that my credit card had expired since I booked the rooms and they needed $750 now. I wasn't prepared for it and asked why I wasn't told that the payment had failed- I thought I had paid on booking and the card was current for months thereafter. The receptionist blamed the fact that I had booked through a 3rd party (even though they had my details) and the manager brought himself into the conversation to tell me that I had to pay for the room- I wasn't asking for it for free (or discounted) I was asking why I hadn't been made aware earlier. Thanks Mr Manager for your input, all it did was make a rude situation ruder. Next day we went out and left the power key in the slot. Got back and it was gone. Reception told me that the cleaner had taken it away to save power. I replied with "well he could have taken it out and left it on the table". What I should have said was I paid for the room and if I want to keep the aircon running when I pop out for a period of time, I should be able to. (Lucky for me I wasn't charging something.) I also should have suggested they stop blaming their customers for everything they do that diminishes the customer experience.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470240003~“Good location, service below expectations ”~The location of the hotel is super. Within 15 mins walking you are either at the nightlife on south bank or shopping in CBD.  The Hotel has its own small carpark which is a bonus (it will charge you per day).  On arrival, we were early, our room was not ready. We were told that latest 2pm it was going to be yet it was not ready till 3pm. Not nice as our son was waiting to get the keys of the room. He joined us after getting the keys.  We wanted to have dinner at the hotel to see our food order given to a different (wrong) customer. Rather than correcting it immediately when the chef saw it happening, the staff started arguing for 5 minutes with each other. We left the restaurant and went for dinner elsewhere.  When we came back around 7pm to the hotel, we found out that someone had been smoking in our non smoking 2 bedroom apartment. Very unpleasant and it should have been corrected by the cleaning staff yet nothing was done. The reception staff on nightshift duty was very polite and arranged two small simple rooms (only ones available) so that we at least could sleep and arranged for a change to the booked room the next day. This was well organized and we appreciated the support.  All above mentioned issues could have been easily avoided. That is what has led to this overall rating. Hope this helps the hotel to improve.  Our two bedroom apartment was ok. Beds are ok, TV's have plenty of channels and the living room is fine. Both rooms can be separated by sliding doors to create enough privacy.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469549723~“Misleading”~Having been recommended to use hotel by a friend I had no hesitating in booking ..How wrong was I ,!!  The triple room I booked was a cupboard overlooked by a mass concrete wall .. Surely health and safety issues here ..No room for cases no space for three people ..Sink had to be positioned in room to facilitate toilet and shower ..Just a disgrace ! In future I'll ask what are the dimensions of the room ..When you travel long distances you deserve to relax in a room that's fit for purpose ..Shame on you Quality Hotels !~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469197112~“Great stay bar the front office staff”~The hotel was in a fabulous position if you need to be in the south end of the city (aka Southern Cross station). We were in walking distance from the Skybus terminal, Etihad Stadium and Southern Cross station. There were also a number of tram stops out the front of the hotel which made getting around easier.The room was spacious enough and the beds were comfortable. Shower pressure wasn't the best but still tolerable. Small kitchenette with a full fridge which I give bonus points for. The only complaint I would have is the dreary front office staff. The woman who checked us in was very slow in doing so and just didn't look like she cared much for being there. It's a shame because I always see Front Office staff setting the tone for your stay.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_469024118~“Roadtrip”~Perfect location to visit the city center whether walking or catching a tramway in the free zone. We are a family composed of 3 people and had the benefiy of a kind of juniotr suite that was perfect for us~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468355524~“Very good position”~Nice hotel directly in front the southern Cross Train Station where you can find trains and the shuttle bus to the airport. The hotel it's 5 min from the river and from the best shopping area of the city. The tram stop it's just in front the hotel. My room was very clean and big. Toilet was really big.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_467114477~“hotels in melbourne”~this is the best hotel to stay when you come to the formula 1. it is right at southern cross station. right at the pick up and drop off for the tram to albert park. you can get a tram to anywhere from outside the front door, the staff are amazing  nothing is a problem and the apartments a great for families~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467015487~“Melbourne trip”~Rooms looking at Streets could be Noisy due to Tram. Air Con is Noisy. No laundry service. but washing machine and dryer. Hotel location is good to take trams (free in the city center) and start visits. Free internet is slow and not reliable. Other internet offers are too expensive.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_466706373~“Reasonable stay”~This is my first trip to Melbourne. I booked this hotel in a rush as I have a convention to attend at MCEC and the rest of the hotels nearby were sold out. Location Approximately 10-minute walk to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. It is quite a scenic walk! The Southern Cross Station where you can catch the SkyBus to International/Domestic airports is just across the road. Room I booked the premiere room, but was given an upgrade to the premiere spa room (that comes with a jacuzzi in the bathroom). Prior to my arrival, I wrote to the hotel to request for an early check-in as my flight arrived into MEL at 9am. I was told that is subject to availability, but was pleasantly surprised that I could check-in the moment I checked in. THANK YOU!  Though my room was facing the main road, I thought it was peaceful and not too noisy.  WIFI Good for day-to-day email and chat (e.g. iMessage, Whatsapp). Data-heavy activities such as loading videos was a challenge. The videos hardly load. Breakfast My room does not come with breakfast, but I paid for the continental breakfast. Average spread but good enough to start the day. A big shout-out to Grace who recommended me to take the SkyBus to the airport as opposed to taking a cab. It was indeed faster and hassle-free; saved my time and money. THANKS, GRACE! I will definitely stay in this hotel again if I come back to Melbourne.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465987747~“Close to station but noisy traffic noise”~This hotel is reasonably priced and clean. The staff reasonable and attentive at check in. But the street noise overnight is not ideal. The room was comfortable but dated interior. Overall if you come in by late train or need ready access to early train,the location could not be better. Earplugs could help.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465199657~“All right for one night”~We only needed a room for one night and we chose this hotel due to its proximity to the southern cross station for the car rental companies and skybus to the airport. We used our British Airways air miles to book a double room. We were given an economy double room which was small, basic and compact. Fortunately free wifi in the room was available. Access to this wing is through a short flights of stairs before getting to the lifts.  We had some problems using our mobile phone and when we tried to use the hotel telephone in the room, we could not get through. On reaching the reception to ask the staff for assistance, we found there was a long queue of guests either checking-in or out. This was further delayed by an episode of a drunken guest accidentally breaking the coffee table. In the end we decided to forego speaking to the staff. The best thing about the hotel for us was the location. Staff at reception was not particularly friendly although one of them did change our room from twin beds to double bed. The economy room was all right for one night but any longer, we would suggest getting the premium room which may cost only a bit more.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_464696984~“Pretty average hotel”~Matchbox rooms and beds the size of an ironing table, not bad if you're only 5ft tall or something. The size of twin beds is what you get in a hostel dorm or something. Location not too bad though. No natural light. Claustrophobic people are advised to stay away.~2~nan~nan~1~2~nan~2~nan
review_464165279~“DISSAPOINTED”~We stayed the night before in a great room for four people. We had one extra stay the next night for five of us.We were put in an a room with three single bed's and no door on our huge opening into the next room.which was a double bed.No door into the ensuit'e off the double room, and then the toilet lead into the shower.What a disgrace. 2 chairs among five people and no table.Nowhere to wash your tea cup unless you used the hand basin in the ensuit'e. yuck.~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_464158705~“Great front office, poor food and beverage”~Travelling for business it was my first stay. I received a complimentary upgrade - thank you to the Front Office Manager Simon. The suite was great. Front office staff were professional and an asset to your hotel. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for food and beverage. I had breakfast included and after trying once never had again. Poor quality and no signs out on buffet. No healthy options except old soft fruit salad. I asked for a latte and got ' self serve coffee only' rudely explained to me by the female attendant. I was taken aback from this comment and the tone of voice used. The quality of room service was appalling. If only the food and beverage service, quality and professionalism was to the same standard of the front office team. I would return but not use the food and beverage facilities again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463963572~“Great stay!!”~I was put up in this hotel by my employer whilst I did some training in Melbourne. I read some reviews on TripAdvisor before I went and was a little worried. Some of the reviews were less than complimentary. Wow! I worried for nothing. The hotel was fantastic. An awesome location within walking distance to where I was training, friendly staff, clean and well serviced rooms. The room or suite that I had, contained a small kitchenette, king size COMFORTABLE bed and a small but serviceable bathroom. As someone who doesn't stay in Melbourne much, I was very impressed. The only down side was that no-one told me that breakfast was included. Would recommend for short or long stays. I was there for 6 nights and would go back there.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_461900559~“Good location, average quality.”~Customer service is good. Came on business trip & only stayed 2 nights.  +ve  1. Location 2. Downstairs bar/lobby environment with piano playing after work hours near the bar 3. Small hotel so don't have to wait long for lifts and to get from your room to out the front entrance 4. Been across the street from Southern Cross STN & main roads, it's relatively quiet at night (stayed on 5th floor in the premium rooms) 5. Practical access to power points and USB/HDMI port connecting to in room TV 6. Lots of towels provided -ve  In Room furnishings & facilities are outdated, basic and in general poor conditions.  Examples: My king sized bed (made of 2 single beds joint which is common practice) had significant deterioration in mattress quality as one side was unusable due to a very uncomfortable dip in the middle from heavy use.  The bathroom facilities were adequate but very small. No laundry bags and/or dry clean options at least not in my room when I checked in & there was no hotel info booklet in room etc.   I had a small balcony which I assume are associated with premium rooms, however there's not much separation between each room's balconies and it's very conceivable for other people in other rooms to access your balcony without any effort which brings me to security. The rear sliding door has only one single click lock which I'm not sure is very secure in today's standard. The curtains in my room were bent and would not fully extend down to floor (which affords privacy to your balcony).  For my stay, I smelled people near my room smoking on their balconies although I specifically requested non smoking room. The carpet and furniture inside are more in line with motel expectations - old and lots of wear & tear. Air-con unit in room was situated above front door but is very loud when running in cooling mode with fans on. Sounds almost like some of the bathroom fans. One of the light bulb was missing by the bedside (coincidentally on the side I was forced to sleep on due dip in bed...).~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461622612~“Cannot beat this location”~For the business or leisure traveler the location is outstanding. Bus from the airport almost to the door. Train station across the road ready to whisk you away to Flemington for the races and the Convention and Exhibition Centre just down the road. Clean rooms and friendly staff. All = great value, which is why we keep coming back~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_461563043~“Very central for Southern Cross station access to airport and trains, and DFO shopping.”~Cheap room, but discovered it was an "economy room". It was just like a box with a cubicle toilet/shore area. Clean and quiet, but not really enough room for two occupants and with no space for suitcases. Staff did assist with carrying suitcase on stairs, but in the "economy room" section you'd need to be able to cope with a flight of stairs to get to the lift, whether going or coming from the room.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_461409676~“Unbeatable location, friendly staff”~The location of the hotel is unbeatable, which is on the opposite side of a train station, which itself is right next to the terminus of the airport Skybus. The hotel is within the free tram zone area and is close to various tram stops. Check in was a breeze, although the reception was a bit hard to find on first arrival (one level up from street level). Very friendly staff. I stayed in a economy twin room, which is situated in the adjacent building that was next to the main building. There was no direct lift access from street / entrance to my hotel room, I need to ride two separate lifts each time. No problem for me at all. The room is small but adequate. The room has very small (and high up) windows that overlook the backyard. Again no problem for me at all, especially considering the price. The air conditioner is individual and is quite difficult to use. The selection in the breakfast buffet is quite limited. But again very friendly staff.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_453730626~“Batman hill”~I found the accommodation very good here . I stayed Jan 19-21. I had. Premiere room 3301 . Very clean and comfortable room and the food was great too . Close to everything and trams right outside the door , and Sky bus across the road .My only disappointment was asking a girl at the reception if she could please print out my checkin for my flight back home . I wish I had got her name but I didn't . She told me I would have to email it to reception and then she would print it out . I was getting quite frustrated because I couldn't get my browser to work on my iPhone . I explained this to her but all she could say was I had to email it to her . After still trying to get my browser to work I decided to give up on it . I saw another young guy at the Desk named Simon , and explained my predicament with browser and he said , that's ok I can do it all for you on my PC and print it out . So relieved I was . Now why couldn't the girl have offered to do this for me ?? Simon was a lovely young man , very polite and obliging ..But that other girl wasn't interested in helping me at all . Simon may remember this and know who the girl was.I may point out I am a senior citizen .Thanks Simon !!~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_452550751~“Excellent location for city access ”~Location is excellent with train station and supermarket across the road and tram stop (free zone no ticket required) at the doorstep.  Parking underneath or around the corner. Easy to drive to from CityLink roads.  Staff polite and professional  Stayed in an economy room. Definitely are economy size and fittings older but for the price you couldn't do better. Access to economy room required x2 stairs and X1 elevator or x1 stairs and x2 elevators so if you have a pram or mobility issues check location of room within hotel before booking. Looked like premium rooms were x1 elevator to access. Economy bathrooms very compact, not suitable if you have mobility issues.  I was very pleased with this hotel and will stay again.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Bit disappointed not the smallest room Ive stayed in but close!~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~5~nan
