review_478715284~“Girls' Night!!”~We had a little hiccup on arrival with regards to an early check in but once we were allocated our room we were more than happy and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was very spacious and accommodated 4 teen girls and 3 mums very well. We all had our own space to relax and enjoy.~4~4~5~5~5~4~3~nan
review_478685249~“Weekend in Melbourne”~Great location, good service. Very enjoyable. Great weather for Melbourne. Lots of great restaurants close by and only a short walk to the shops. Lots of night life and only a short walk to the casino and boardwalk.~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_478368635~“great hotel”~Stay at the Adina very regularly on business. Always found this to be a great hotel and excellent value for money. Very friendly staff, recently refurbished rooms that are perfectly clean and a nice little bar downstairs (Queen Street rescue)~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478356316~“Great location”~Very friendly staff. Nice location and close to where we needed to head out that night. The bed and pillows were a bit uncomfortable but for one night it was ok. The man at the desk was helful and professional~4~5~5~3~3~4~5~nan
review_476912083~“Perfect stay.”~Excellent central location for exploring the city on foot. Friendly, helpful and efficient staff. Slight glitch on check in, but quickly resolved and very adequately compensated for with significant upgrade in accommodation.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476654093~“Great place for families”~Stayed with my family of 5 (3 adult children). Spacious, clean and well appointed apartment. Beds very comfortable! Enjoyed the indoor pool. Would have liked a few more weights in the gym. Would stay again.~4~4~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476319296~“Great place”~Stayed here for three nights in a 2 bed apartment. Great room and fixtures. Plenty of living space and each bedroom had its own ensuite. Staff very helpful. In walking distance to everything. Husband and I checked out on the Sunday and my son and partner had booked a one bedroom room for the next night. They were given early check in, so they just had to move their stuff to the new room in the morning. Handy for them as they didn't have to get the hotel to store their gear. Will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475401305~“Week away with friends, great location”~Group of 4 girls on a shopping week in Melbourne. Found this little gem. 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 4 beds. Kitchen, living and dining. All one block from Bourke Street Mall. Easy walk to Victoria Markets and the City Circle tram stop for exploring. Staff were great and helpful. Harry on front reception was particularly delightful! Good value for money too. Undergoing reno at the moment, will be lovely once completed, but still very good right now.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_475168858~“Great location”~An amazing location in the heart of the city. It has a smallish lobby, friendly staff and is clean.  My room was moderate in size. Good view and nice bath amenities.  Overall it feels a bit dated, but the location and staff make up for any faults.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475127223~“Great location ”~Spent 2 nights here on a recent football trip to Melbourne. The location is excellent, only a few minutes walk to Hardware Lane and Bourke Street mall. The first night we had a noisey neighbour so the Manager was kind enough to move us to another room on another level. The staff at reception were very nice and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474855384~“Clean, Large and Cosy Apartment”~We stayed in the 3 bedroom apartment on the highest floor for 3 nights. This is a 2 storey apartment, with a room on the first floor and 2 rooms on the second floor. It also comes with 3 bathrooms, 2 attached with the rooms and the other is outside.  There is a large kitchen, dining area, living room, washing area and a study table on the first floor. There is another study table on the second floor.  The apartment is conveniently located and is 5 to 8 minutes walking distance from major shopping streets. For those who drive, the apartment has its own car park and overnight charges are quite reasonable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474812191~“Extremely spacious”~We were surprised at the size of our 3 bedroom apartment. Our stay was more enjoyable due to the amount of space we had. This has moved to the top of our list when staying Melbourne with the kids. Highly recommend as pharmacy, convenience store, dinner options and a bottle shop are near by!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474572540~“Weekend in our own city”~My husband and I really enjoyed our three night stay at the Adina Apartment Hotel in Queen Street Melbourne. It is a lovely part of the CBD and within walking distance to all of the main tourist attractions. We loved our one bedroom apartment with had a self contained kitchen. The staff are very helpful and professional. We also loved the QSR café attached to the hotel. We will definitely return to this place. Thanks Jenny and Dean~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474561719~“Excellent location and apartments. Excellent customer service”~We stayed at Adina Apartments in Melbourne for a conference. Since my family was coming I booked an apartment. I reserved a double room and was surprised with a three bedroom and they had added a cot for our 5th person. Staff was pleasant and helpful. I felt safe. Apartment well located, spacious, clean and comfortable.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474366383~“Great location, easy to get to and quite comfortable”~The Adina Apartments are located in a very convenient location to get to central Melbourne, Chinatown, Etihad stadium and pretty much anywhere serviced by a tram.  The accommodation itself is quite comfortable and reasonably priced. If I was fishing for a flaw it would have been that the in room food menu was not current which lead to some confusion when ordering food, but thats it really.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474296416~“Not good enough”~Location was ok. Room was tiny with no balcony. Could only wind open the window about an inch to try and get some fresh air. Everything was clean but only average quality compared to what you'd expect for the price. Much needed renovations are underway.~2~2~4~3~1~4~2~nan
review_473948505~“Well laid out hotel”~Stayed here as was working in city all weekend. Well placed to Hardware Lane restaurants and public transport. Nice high room so no street noise which was great. Room had all the amenities you would expect and staff were very helpful.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473941689~“Great stay”~Very central - great location. We were in walking distance of everything. The central air conditioning not the greatest. Our room got a little hot and open window needed, but it's clean and newly renovated.~4~4~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_473562053~“Great value of money”~Spacious apartment at a prime location! Everything is within walking distance and easy to catch the free tram. Service is good and we were allowed to check in at 10:30am so everyone can fresh up after an overnight flight. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473484936~“Hotel review”~The Adina apartment hotel Melbourne is a contemporary & well kept hotel & is definitely value for money. So if you're looking for a decent hotel in Melbourne that's not too pricey & is central, the Adina is your hotel!~5~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_473038952~“Unexpected costs!”~I stayed in a two bedroom apartment with two friends for five days. The apartment was very well appointed with comfy beds, lovely bathrooms, kitchen and laundry cupboard. The staff on checking were friendly kind and helpful as were the girls who tidied during the day. On checking we were surprised to have a bill with an extra fifty dollars to pay. We thought it was all paid for on checking apart from minibar costs. But when we viewed the account the first night had somehow been underpaid! Obviously a mistake on someone's part but not ours. We queried it and argued for some time but the staff person did not compromise at all. We will not go there again!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473035178~“Convenient as always”~Staying at the Queen St Adina is always a pleasure. Central between both ends of the cbd for visiting my clients and close to convenience stores for whatever I need at night. I always stay here and as a result I usually get an upgrade to a better room if they are available.~4~4~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_472779998~“We had personal possessions taken from our room”~We had items taken from our room. We were re-compensated for two items. Having found more items were taken we were advised "We trust our staff" and "We are not responsible for what goes missing". Awful service by their male manager and when I asked to email central Adina management to take the matter further, I was given a bogus email address that did not work. Such an awful experience and completely untrustworthy staff and management. ~1~1~4~3~3~3~1~nan
review_472517368~“Comfort ”~I booked the hotel via Qantas website as it was close tony meeting place - I was put in an suite 2 level penthouse- small flat kitchen laundry all 3 to 4 star - will need a refit in next few years - view from level 21 is nice~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471252518~“Excellent Service”~My office booked a small room which I wasn't happy with. As a repeat customer they upgraded my promptly without fuss or drama. The Manager was amazing and Id be sure to r return to the Adina (Queen St) next time Im in Melbourne~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470720469~“Needs a Good Clean & Staff Training”~Firstly I'd like to say we have stayed for seven nights at the Adina on Queen Street quite a few times and find the location perfect and the apartments themselves very comfortable. However, unfortunately this time on arrival I found an ugly large ball of hair and fibre on the floor and as I like to see if in fact our rooms are cleaned I left it where I found it, I was horrified to see that on the day of check out it was still laying there in an obvious place on the bedroom carpet. Answer is they never in our seven days stay vacuumed our floors. They also never once changed our sheets and the dust on the furniture just mounted day by day. Another observation was just how hard it was to get a lift to our floor, the reason was made obvious one day when the lift doors opened and the cleaning staff with their trolley were inside and made no attempt to make room for us. A hotel manager happened past and saw and asked the staff to vacate the lift as it was for guests only, a service lift was opposite. Unfortunately we saw that this request was ignored on other occasions. Finally on day of departure our experience with the Adina didn't improve, upon checkout we could not have encountered a more unsuitable person for the front desk, her people/guest skills were dismal and we were made to feel as though our checking out was an imposition for her.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470705286~“review”~excellent location, handy to trams and restaurants. very nice room clean and comfortable. very pleasant and helpful staff. I would definitely return. Only one very minor fault was the television only had one sport channel and it was hard to find.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470172521~“4 night stay”~Excellent location just a short walk from the tram stop. Ultra smooth check in. Friendly reception staff. Clean gift and spacious room. Even when having a big sleep in and leaving the room late, room service always done, fantastic. Great location for trams and buses to get anywhere. Will definitely use this hotel again for my next visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470007686~“Great experience - very central location”~Chose this hotel as our final stay of our 3 weeks tour through Vic and SA. We were NOT disappointed as they surprised us with a nice upgrade and the location was simply perfect. Close to shopping, dining and walking distance to the river. Room was big enough to spread out and get packed and organised before leaving this beautiful country. We will definitely chose Adina next time we are in Melbourne. Great job - Thank you~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_469554814~“Fine”~Just as I've titled this review - we found this place to be 'fine'. We stayed in a one bedroom corner apartment which was a little dated (I wasn't a fan of the black feature wall). Facilities were good, kitchen had everything you need for a short stay.  Apartment was clean and quite spacious. Location was good - we came to see a concert at Etihad which we walked to and from. Close to good shopping and restaurants.  Staff were ok. We arrived very early and asked to store luggage. I asked when the earliest possible check in time was. I was flatly told 'check in is at 2pm'. I understand 2pm is the guaranteed check in time, but usually hotels are accommodating of an earlier check in if they have an available room. This lady wasn't willing to check.  I would probably try something different next time I'm in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469494277~“Great, easy to use, would stayy again”~My room was tiny but clean and modern. Room highlights include the welcome chocolate, the housekeeping, a window that can be opened and plenty of adjustable lighting. Low lights were the television that was hard to turn on and use, the difficulty getting the shower water to heat (at least 15 mins) and nowhere to eat the great room service meals. (Had to drag side tables around the room) Very good staff at reception and the restaurant. Appreciated being able to park on site at a reasonable rate.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_469317046~“Good location”~Well equipped apartment in a good location. Modern bathrooms and kitchen. Stayed in a 2 bed apartment for 4 nights. Queen street good location near the restaurants on hardware lane. Queen street rescue cafe next door very good for breakfast. Good free wifi.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469063302~“Great Location, Good Service, Not too Clean...”~The hotel is in a great location, staff was friendly, check in and out was very quick but the room wasn't that clean. There was spider webs behind the curtains and windows, very disappointing for the price that we paid. I would go back for the location, size of the room but I hope they keep the rooms clean next time.~4~3~5~4~4~2~4~nan
review_469040420~“Comfortable and convenient”~We stayed at Adina at the beginning of the month. My partner accidentally booked the wrong date (a week later) but the manager on duty was kind enough to let us check in without penalty. Room is cosy, clean and comfortable. Free wifi is a bonus. Just moment before checking out, the smoke alarm went off. I was shocked and I called the reception. The staff came but could not fix it. I only noticed the whole Queen Street buildings had the alarm set off when we walked out. I do recommend the hotel as it is close to Southern Cross Station. However, you may prefer other hotels near Chinatown~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469037621~“Great Apartments and Perfect Location”~6 of us stayed here for a 3 night girls weekend away in a 3 bedroom apartment. It was a huge apartment with fantastic amenities all self contained. The location was perfect for getting around and accessing all the shopping centres. Highly recommend and would definately return.~5~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_469030469~“Renovations in progress”~I would try to ensure the booking you make is for a renovated room. I don't know how many rooms have been renovated so far. Initially checked into an old room with an a/c that didn't work. Huge difference between the two. If we were not moved this review would be negatives considering the room temperature was 27 degrees and the only solution was a pedestal fan.  After some logical reasoning somehow they were able to find this room for us so I'm glad we had a good outcome of this experience. However it could just have easily gone the other way if there was actually no other rooms available.~3~3~5~5~3~5~5~nan
review_469019876~“Good stay”~Had a good stay. We were in an east facing penthouse apartment with three adults. The rollout bed provided was in the living room which doesn't have blackout curtains. Given the room faced east the person sleeping on the rollout bed couldn't sleep past dawn. Would definitely request a room facing any other direction!!~4~4~3~4~3~4~4~nan
review_469006068~“perfect location for visiting melbourne”~it was our first time at the Adina Queen street. It is closed of central downtown interests. Hotel proposes main services available. Staff is both discrete, servable and efficient. Room is quiet and comfortable.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_468996286~“Good location, nice room, well equipped”~We stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms with a balcony. Overall a nice, spacious apartment, with well equipped kitchen, and 10 min walk to most places. Only issue, as some other recent reviews have stated, is that the air conditioning didn't work. Turning it on on the lowest setting (16*C) had no effect, so we sweltered in the 30 degree heat. Hopefully they fix this soon... or at least inform guests that it's broken.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468986310~“Great hotel and great location”~We stayed for a girls weekend in a two bedroom apartment. It was perfect for our needs with two bathrooms, heaps of living room and a great location. We found the apartment immaculate and the beds very comfortable. The staff we met were very friendly and provided excellent service. I would definitely recommend the Adina and we are looking forward to staying here again~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468980848~“Great location, but needs refurb.”~We stayed at the Adina Queen St over the weekend. Have previously stayed there a few years ago, great location but very much due for a refurb. Rooms are tidy but dated. I notice they have signs in reception saying a refurbishment will be started soon. Staff on check in were good but not great!~3~3~4~4~2~3~3~nan
review_468868390~“Lots of space and style”~There is a lot to like at this location and they plan to improve further. Lots of elevators, super location, its hard to think of anything lacking. Great views in all directions, Melbourne has lots going on, you can walk to the south bank. Trains trams and buses are all close at hand. I have stayed at some very cramped rooms and this was a treat.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468706043~“Good city option”~We've been favouring the Crown Metropol over other city alternatives for the past couple of years and using their Sky High package but the cost now also seems to be sky high. This time, we were meeting friends for a Thursday lunch at Caterina's and seeing "Kinky Boots" later that night so we decided to revisit Adina. We hadn't stayed here since it was the Medina Grand and the spruce-up has improved the look of the place considerably. Work is still ongoing but we didn't hear any work noise until just before we checked out at 10am. Even then, that noise was barely audible. In fact, Apartment 91 on the 15th floor was very quiet with very little street noise and no noise from other rooms. Check in and out was quick and efficient. Our apartment wasn't ready but that was to be expected at 11.30am and our bags were stored for us. A real bonus is the self-parking in the building for only $21. We were quoted $105 by Wilson and $79 by Secure-a-spot for parking nearby and $40 by Secure-a-spot for parking in the building so the Adina deal was cheap. You enter the car park from Merlin Lane just up from the corner of Queen and Little Bourke and there were plenty of spaces on the 4th floor. A lift takes you down to the lobby to check in. There is no requirement to book a space. Tip - take it slowly. The driveway is very narrow and not wide enough for two-way traffic in many places. Exit and entry from the carpark is unlimited each day during your stay.  At our request, the 2-bedroom apartment was set up with king beds and we both slept very soundly. As other reviewers have mentioned, the air-conditioning can be a bit noisy but neither of us felt the need to turn it off. Both bedrooms had a TV, more wardrobe space than many hotels and good-sized, well-appointed bathrooms. There was a European laundry off the bathroom in the 2nd bedroom with a washer and a dryer. The dining area adjoining the kitchenette had a table and 4 chairs and the lounge area had 2 arm chairs and a rather uncomfortable settee opposite a third TV. A desk and chair formed the office section next to the door which led out to a small balcony which was decorated by a cigarette butt at one end and a Crown Lager bottle full of cigarette butts at the other. However, there was no cigarette smell in the apartment. The balcony looks over the city to the North across Little Bourke Street and there are no nearby high-rise buildings. The kitchenette has a large fridge, dishwasher, oven and cook-top and is pretty well set up for longer stays. There were at least 5 of each item of crockery and cutlery. The apartment was very clean overall but splash marks of some sort of liquid were pretty obvious on the interior wall next to the entry door and the cigarette butts on the balcony were also indicative of a careless clean-up. Nevertheless, it was a comfortable stay and, at $359, was good value relative to many other much smaller city hotel rooms. The location is also very central. We'll stay there again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
