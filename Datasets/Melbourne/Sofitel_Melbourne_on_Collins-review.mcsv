review_478370691~“Brilliant view, well appointed room”~We enjoyed an overnight stay is a very well appointed room with a stunning view. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was excellent. We had a smooth check in and check out and the hotel was perfectly situated for our need to be in the city. We are very much looking forward to staying again.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476333849~“Convenient location and exceptional service”~I stayed at the Sofitel on Collins for a brief stay in Melbourne to see The Book of Mormon. I found the hotel conveniently located within short walking distance to the Princess Theatre, as well as a multitude of popular restaurants, boutique shops on Collins Street and Federation Square. The staff at the hotel are courteous, helpful, and go out of their way to provide exceptional service. Check-in and check-out were a breeze.  The room (a Classic Room with City View) was luxurious, spacious and well appointed with all the amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel. I was particularly pleased to have a choice of pillows from the Pillow Menu, and was pleasantly surprised to have a walk in shower rather than a shower over bathtub. The view from the 42nd floor of the MCG, Rod Laver Arena and Hisense Arena was a great bonus.  Being able to secure a room at a discounted rate makes the Sofitel on Collins an unbeatable option in my opinion. This will be at the top of the list for my next stay in Melbourne.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478132417~“Not luxurious”~Disappointed with this hotel, not luxurious in any way. Pretty old fashioned, needs an update. Staff are disinterested, and we were all but ignored! Bed was comfy, but everything else was lacking. Location was good.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_478082191~“Relaxing getaway”~Everything thought of by the sofitel - total luxury, kindness and comfort. We only live a few suburbs away but it's like really forgetting about life for a while. We take a club room experience so we can indulge in the lounge with all its special features - canapes, lovely coffee and wines. Its always quiet in there - most people are out and about in Melbourne. Thankyou sofitel for a lovely weekend extravagance.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477833249~“Service was above and beyond the call of duty!”~This was our first time in Melbourne, though not our first stay at a Sofitel. Though we've always received good service while staying at one of their hotels, The Sofitel Melbourne on Collins exceeded all of our expectations. The staff is so friendly and beyond helpful.  Check-in was a breeze, the room was huge and had a spectacular view. But the people who deserve the most praise are the conceirge staff. Beyond managing to get us reservations at the hottest restaurants, they knew Melbourne like the back of their hands and were a wealth of information on what to do and what to avoid.  At one point, I couldn't manage to tie my bowtie. Embarrassed, I headed down to the lobby to ask for help. When the concierge said he didn't know how to tie it, I thought the tie was a bust. However, the concierge didn't stop calling nearby men's clothing stores until he found someone who could tie it for me. In seconds, he whisked me off to Armani and my tie was fixed in a snap. That kind of service only comes from the highest quality hotel. In short, this staff will stop at nothing to make their guests happy. Even if it's down to the smallest detail, they are there and ready to serve with a smile!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_477699961~“Worth the visit ”~We used our free night with our Accor plus card . Which I might add - I've never had a problem using my free night ever!!!!. Like all Sofitels - you are welcomed with the aroma and 5 star service. You must try the massage chairs in the gym, they are amazing. Very happy with half price meals, free internet, complimentary drinks on arrival and late checkout. Get yourself an Accor membership. They are great!.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477628982~“Outdated, noisy and poor customer service. Great location however.”~My wife and I stayed at the Sofitel for the first time on Wednesday night (April 19), and after staying at most other 5 star hotels in Melbourne this would be at the very bottom of the list. Yes the location is great however the place is so outdated, its right out of the 90's. The bathroom are small the shower is over the bath (really??, 5 star??) and is very outdated. The beds are comfortable, the view very nice but they are the only positives. Apart from being extremely outdated the other major gripe I have is at 7am in the room next door to us contractors began working, I understand work needs to be done on rooms (and every room at this place needs work in being updated) but if you want start work at 7am don't book the adjoining rooms. I called reception to complain and they apologised and had the work stop, but it was too late, we were already awake. When sitting in the lobby waiting for our friends I heard the duty manager tell the front desk staff that we had complained and if they could refer us to her but there would be nothing they would offer us. We ended up being in a rush and whilst the duty manager did apologise to us no compensation was offered which I thought was pretty disappointing. I am sure if we complained and carried on like many do we would have been offered something but I didn't have the energy and quite frankly you should not need to carry on to receive good customer service. In summary, outdated, small rooms, poor customer service but in a great location. I would stay at every other 5 star hotel in Melbourne (and some 4 - 4 1/2 star) before I ever stay here again.~1~nan~nan~4~nan~4~1~nan
review_477616822~“Staff faultless, maybe time for some refresh work”~Has become a bit of a favorite for a night in town (doing the whole tourist-in-my-own-city vibe). Staff here are faultless, to a tee. Front desk, concierge, restaurants, bar. They all undertake their tasks quickly, efficiently, and with a smile.  Rooms are well furnished and the bedding is fabulous. Rooms, and perhaps particularly bathrooms could do with a bit of an update. Shower over the bath for example - standing in the narrow bath, ones feet are somewhat squashed again the sides of the bath. How about a stand alone shower? Lighting in rooms is good, but many switches, particularly bedside ones aren't labeled. There was a bit of water damage on the ceiling of our room (bubbling/discolored paint). Breakfast buffet is great - love the little juices and health "shots". None of the issues mentioned are major problems, but in a tight 5-star market, they can be enough to make one choose a different Hotel. Don't loose your edge Sofitel - I like you and want to come back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477333653~“Beautiful staff, great location and views but bathroom may need some upgrade”~The hotel occupies higher levels of the building so you will get a good view of the city or the Yarra river whichever floors you stay.  We were on level 43 but the room had a moldy smell throughout the room and bathroom. We didn't want to make a fuss by making a complaint but we were staying for four nights and didn't feel comfortable with the smell. The staff at the reception was very kind and offered us a different room on level 39 and we stayed there for our remaining nights.  The hotel is beautifully designed with impressive atrium and foyer. Staff are very attentive and helpful in every way. The location is excellent for theatre and international designer brands. You don't get the noise and craziness from overly crowded shops and takeaway food chains but it is within easy access to hustle and bustle of the main shopping district and Lane way cafes. Bathroom shower pressure was good and there are plenty of lightings keep the room pleasantly bright. Negatives  The bed mattress was too soft for my back. Although the second room didn't have the moldy smell the bathroom is outdated especially the bathtub.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477316630~“Very Comfortable ”~Sofitel is a luxury hotel and very comfortable with plenty of space in the room. Only issue I have is that they hang a notice about re-using towels to aid the environment but every time I left the room, my towels were changed - even ones that weren't used and ones hanging on the towel hook! This happened four times for a 2 night stay. Either housekeeping are not aware of the policy or Sofitel/Accor do not follow the policy for their luxury brand (in which case don't hang the sign - on recycled paper)!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477288147~“Great views and Club Sofitel staff are lovely.”~Overall we had a good stay. Stayed at plenty of Sofitel hotels and typically love the experience.  The staff in Club Sofitel we're lovely and made us feel very welcome.  The little touch of chocolates at Easter was appreciated.  Was disappointed that our room wasn't available until 4pm, even after Sofitel called 3 days prior and asked what time to expect us - and we told them we'd arrive at 2pm. We also received a txt message an hour prior to checking in (1pm) to say our room was ready and confirming parking/location/arrival.  We also requested a single bed (which was also confirmed on phone) for our toddler. This was also not ready upon arrival and wasn't provided until after 5pm - this affected our holiday, as we planned for her to have an afternoon nap around 2pm.  The rooms are nice, but they are very dated and not in great condition. (chipped surfaces & cracked table stops etc.) We liked the electronic lighting setup - so easy to use.  The iron in our room was also broken, although we didn't report this to staff. The room could have been cleaner, but that might have been the dated fit-out. The floor didn't look like it had been properly vacuumed.  Room was nice and quiet and bed was seriously comfy, as you'd expect from Sofitel.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_477287595~“More than what I expected ”~I was feeling a little skeptical after reading the reviews on this hotel, but after checking in, I realized that some people are just too hard to please.  I called ahead, as I had come in early, to check if there was a room available and the staff member on the phone was really helpful and strived to make sure I was well informed.  When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted by a very friendly staff member who was welcoming and accommodating. I have an issue with heights and I was supposed to be on the 47th floor, however this was changed so I wouldn't feel uncomfortable walking out of my room. I was given a room on the 36th floor, which was perfect.  The room itself was spacious and clean. The bed was a dream to sleep on and the views was great. I liked how the bars of soap were big and lasted more than half a shower. The bathroom was well appointed, the only issue I had with the entire stay was that the shower was in the bathtub, which wasn't that bad.  The hotel was in a great part of town with a tram stop right out the front. It was easy to walk around too if you didn't want to catch a tram. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The negative reviews about it being dated is really trivial considering you're there for the comfort and the service. In fact, I found the furnishings to be classic and what a 5 star hotel should be like, which is warm and welcoming, not sterile and cold.  I look forward to returning soon.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477016137~“Lovely Easter Break”~We had booked a Prestige Suite for Easter and we weren't disappointed. Our suite was situated on the 48th floor. The 180 degree views were breathtaking! As we entered our suite there was a personally written card and a bottle of Champagne from Guest Relations Manager, Terence Murphy. Our suite was spacious and clean. The shower over the bath did not bother us. I have to say that the staff were outstanding, so attentive in every part of the hotel, whether it be Room Service, Housekeeping, the Club Lounge and the Atrium Bar. We were always approached with a smile and they were all very welcoming and I loved that. Outstanding Customer Service! My only criticism would be that we ordered fried or poached eggs and it took half an hour and in the meantime your pot of tea or coffee has gone cold while you are waiting, as the staff bring it to you straight away. Also, the bed was worn out so much so, that you sunk down on one side. I just want to say a big 'Thank You' again to Mr. Terence Murphy for meeting our needs to ensure we had a great stay! We will be back. Thank you Sofitel.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476761703~“PERFECT ”~Stayed here for 8 nights. Stunning views from the 46th floor. Perfect location, walking distance to the MCG and public transport at your door.

review_476613882~“Excellent from beginning to end.”~We spent 3 nights at the Sofitel Melbourne on Collins and it was perfect! We were kindly upgraded to a corner suite on the 47th floor with incredible views from every window. We had purchased Club Sofitel membership which is well worth it if you are going to be spending time at the hotel or nearby. Breakfast, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, canapes and drinks and even desserts later - hard to leave the hotel! The room was excellent - the bed is very comfortable and there is a pillow 'menu' - I was quite happy with the one on the bed, but there are others to choose from. The evening turn down service is a nice touch with lovely lavender spray if you wish to help sleep. It is all about the senses - everything smells good (soap, shampoo etc), feels good ( bed, pillow, slippers) looks good (clean and in good condition) and tastes good too! The service is excellent from the reception to club sofitel and the valet. Its location is great - right near the MCG and Rod Laver Arena, the Yarra and a short walk into the centre of the city. I can highly recommend this hotel and we will be returning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476342891~“Excellent room and staff”~We stayed in a wonderful corner room on the 47th floor. The views over Melbourne were brilliant and the service was excellent from everyone we encountered. This included meeting a prior request and also promptly bringing peppermint teabags when they weren't replaced after the first night.   We didn't eat at the hotel (except for drinks and snacks at the bar, which were good) as breakfast was expensive and there are great cheap options just downstairs in Collins Place. My only complaint is that having to pay for basic wifi access (even as an Accor member) is a joke - made me very glad I wasn't visiting from overseas. We had free wifi at the Munich Sofitel; it's time Australia provided equally basic service for free. Nonetheless, it was a delightful stay and I would love to return - if I can get another good deal.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476325912~“Get the little bits right!”~Great place, staff friendly, service attentive, but nothing different from what you expect in any hotel of this type.

review_476083777~“Beautiful views and peaceful”~Stayed in a Superior room overlooking the bay. Stunning views towards the Southwest of the city and out to the water. The king size bed was incredibly comfortable for my partner and I. Too often I'm disappointed with "king size" beds that are two king singles with a mattress topper, but this was a proper king size bed. The shower was excellent, though a walk in shower would be nicer than the shower over bath.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476070056~“Good choice”~Hotel staff are very professional and friendly, shout out to Sam who went above and beyond to help us, lovely guy! Recommended an amazing place to eat which we ended up going to almost every night of our stay We had a free bottle of wine and chocolates delivered which was a nice surprise! Daily free water delivered nightly with the turn down service and you can get free wifi if you are a member, bonus! We were on floor 47 and had amazing views of the city. Probably the biggest let down is the noise from floor 35 bar, we heard it in our room so I can't imagine how noisy it is closer to here considering we were on one of the top floors. Overall the hotel is amazing, you don't see many people around, the staff are amazing and there is plenty of coffee and food options downstairs on the lower ground level. (Juice place has amazing healthy breakfast options such as yogurts and fruit, well priced and you can store in your room fridge! Some amazing bakery items and there is a movie theatre and it's right downstairs! Tram stop is right outside and there is another about a five minute walk from the hotel.  The Hotel sells Myki Cards and have Tram maps which is really helpful as well.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_474042925~“1980s Internet Time Warp”~The 1980s Sofitel exudes a graceful, glitzy aura befitting its heyday-of-disco-design. Unfortunately, the internet service is mired in an ineffectual time warp of the same 1980s Eastern bloc era. It doesn't really matter because both systems are no longer in vogue; even post-Soviet internet systems have improved and disco has certainly moved on to better things. It is unfortunate that the experience of the stunning views and handsome, classic modernist design is quickly forgotten following day after day of frustration from simply attempting to get an internet connection; which should be a simple endeavour in this day and age, but not at the Sofitel where the 1980s live on, right down to the internet network. Seriously, I have not experienced such a hackneyed, ineffectual system since the days of the dial-up modem. Even more of an outrage is that the going rate for the service is a hefty 29 rubles... I mean 29 dollars a day. Sofitel, you had me won over completely with the 1980s glitz and glamour and then lost it all with the Eastern-bloc internet. It is way past time for an internet upgrade. I suggest you attend to the needs of the masses soon, before you have a full-scale revolt on your hands. Even though the Sofitel is a magnificent, modernist 80s classic, I just can't see myself returning for a stay until the outdated internet system is sent back to the gulag from whence it originated.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473974613~“Surprised us with how good it was”~From check in to check out, we were made to feel valued and welcome. The restaurant and bar were warm and casual and the service was excellent. We stayed on the 38th floor with excellent city views. Wifi was fast, ubiquitous and stable. Fitness centre had a rower which is uncommon as wel as massage chairs. Will definitely stay at a Sofitel property again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473939547~“Great property right in the thick of it!”~I gather that the Sofitel has been around for a while but they have done a good job of maintaining the property and it doesn't show its age at all. One of the tallest, if not the tallest, buildings in this amazing city the location is ideal as a launching point for walking the different downtown neighborhoods, eating in some of the great foodie restaurants of for attending theatre. The beds are really comfortable, the curtains black out and there a nice views from most of the rooms. What more could you need?~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan

review_473064076~“Nice weekend, but nothing special”~Stayed at the Sofitel for a weekend with my partner while in town for a wedding. My partner had stayed previously and wanted to stay again due to the impeccable service he received, which unfortunately we missed out on this time. Reception staff could work on their customer service skills, porters and staff out the front of the building were great. We had a nice room with amazing views over the city and out to the ocean. We enjoyed breakfast in the executive lounge which also had nice views, breakfast was okay but wouldn't pay for it. This hotel has a grand feeling in the lobby and common areas but that feeling is lacking in the rooms. Great location, we easily walked all over the city. I don't think this hotel is worth the cost and definitely don't get treated as well as other Accor hotels despite having status.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472595925~“Iconic Hotel, Breathtaking View, Service & Memorable Experience”~Been staying here for decades, originally under the famed 'Regent' brand then since Accor's premier brand 'Sofitel' took over. That saw international Hotelier GM - Clive Scott, a local with huge creds takeover and that he has; having run successful hotels in Asian capital cities he knows his stuff and insists on a standard you won't find anywhere else in Australia. His attention to detail makes the Sofitel on Collins - Melbourne experience a perfect one. He is supported by Terrence Murphy, Guests Services Director who is a legend in the city, including the finest, race goers, sports enthusiasts, fashionista's and those seeking out Melb's best entertainment. Forgot to book a place to eat, don't quite know where to head for dinner - Terrance will guide you toward your favorite dish than get you into an already booked out eatery - how does he do this everytime.  Then there is the Sofitel's Director of Sales - Shirley Lin. WoW, WoW, WoW! This lady will pre-empt your next need and recommend it before you thought of it. Her forte is stage and screen and if you ever wanted to do an opening night show or event she's the one. The Hotel's superb rooms, restaurants and bars let us slip into a great mood, enjoying the stay and was a great springboard out into Melbourne which is a fabulous city to explore and get amongst.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_471987700~“Relaxing Luxury Night Away”~We booked a club Sofitel room to enjoy a relaxing night away and were delighted with our choice and the accommodation and service. We arrived just before 12pm and had our car valet parked and checked in smoothly. We were invited to enjoy the Club Lounge from 12pm and were delighted to find we had been upgraded to a suite. We thoroughly enjoyed the time at Sofitel, we intended to have a relaxing time and the club lounge facilitated that. The room was wonderful and comfortable. The only hiccups was that the club lounge did not have our name registered and we had to show our welcome letter each time we went there. When checking out the Accor Loyalty club points were not deducted from my account and later in the day an apology and correct invoice was received. Accor should ensure the claim process for reward points is understood by staff , methinks. Overall a great stay and I look forward to returning for another visit.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan

We had booked this hotel months in advance as we were coming from Tas. especially for the Barry Gibb concert to be held at the end of April '17. This concert was unfortunately cancelled in Dec '16. We immediately contacted Sofitel to enquire if we could change our accommodation (NOT cancel) to a later date (we booked through Wotif with a no cancellation policy) Sofitel were unhelpful, lacked compassion and were extremely rude, basically telling us to either use it or lose it.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_471397538~“Mixed feelings”~Sofitel on Collins was a luxurious hotel with a grand lobby and very well equipped room (iron and ironing board, umbrella, coffee/tea making facilities, international electrical adapter, hair dryer), all the facilities you would expect to see in a 5 star hotel. The gym was fully equipped with the top of the range spinner bikes, treadmills, weights and resistance machines.There is no swimming pool. However, it is a shame that such a hotel charges for almost everything else that would be complimentary at most other places. There is no complimentary bottled water (unbranded water is charged at $7 per 500ml bottle). Internet access is chargeable unless you join them as an Accor member. If you book under a third party website, you will NOT be given free internet access even if you are a pre-existing Accor member. Room service has an extra $7 "tray fee" in addition to the basic prices. The TV has no movie channels, although they do provide additional movies at a fee per 24 hours.  While I was staying there during the F1 weekend, I woke up in absolute darkness and none of the light switches worked. There was no note outside the door and the phones did not work either. Thankfully it was morning so I could open the wooden panels that act as curtains to get some natural light in. I had to physically go to the lobby and find out from the staff that there was a hotel wide power cut. The only announcement they made was to ask guests not to use the lift unnecessarily, difficult when the hotel starts at level 35 of a building. There was never any apology or explanation issued to guests. Very poor form and unacceptable in a 5 star establishment. Most hotels would have a backup generator that supplies at least one light inside each hotel room, what would have happened if the power cut occurred at night? Having said that, I have never been in another hotel which has had a power cut. The location is a 15 minute walk away from most attractions but this is reduced to a 5 minute walk if you take advantage of the free tram. There are several restaurants within walking distance and an excellent range of cafes at the basement of the building that opens in the morning but closes by the early evening as it caters mainly to the office breakfast and lunch crowd. Sofitel has lovely views from the rooms and the restaurants and Club lounge, but it feels somewhat miserly with all the additional charges and service is mixed with some very good staff and others being unhelpful.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_471291568~“Old Fashioned Fabulous”~Fabulous beds, spacious bedrooms, good food and service. Handy location to central business/shopping district. Staff are very attentive at every level. Good conference facilities available. The bar is a good meeting place.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_470768968~“Not as good as normal...”~Normally I rate this hotel highly, the service is generally good and there are no issues. This time I was disappointed. The club lounge had the patchiest service ever over the two days I was there, there was good service and then no service - literally nothing in between. The room I was put in was a wheelchair accessible room and while spacious, it was annoying with the bathroom shower and also the total lack of a full length mirror. I did ask about the possibility of moving rooms but due to the Grand Prix being on, there were no available rooms. They were little annoyances all round and unfortunately I have prebooked to stay again this week...so crossing my fingers it gets better, otherwise back to The Como I go...~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470707663~“Sofitel Luxury”~So happy to spend our anniversary at the Sofitel Melbourne. Outstanding hotel to base yourself to enjoy the wonders of Melbourne. Relax in the wonderful bed - it's like sleeping on a cloud. Dinner at No. 35, enjoying the view while fine dining. No better way to relax with a loved one.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470692833~“Birthday treat”~Had a lovely stay for my birthday with my hubby. Enjoyed a beautiful suite in level 50 which was amazing. The room is beautiful with lovely views and facilities..although bathroom is a little cramped. Service was good although a bit slow for afternoon tea in the Club so ended up going down to Sofis and buying our own sandwiches which was disappointing..  Evening cocktails and canapés was much better and great to enjoy the views whilst having a lovely drink..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470439625~“Let Down by Poor Service”~I'm at the end of a 3 day stay and am leaving with a bitter taste in my mouth.  In terms of comfort and location Sofitel on Collins is great; in terms of design it's a mixed bag (lobby and Club are great, but my room was uninspired and a touch shabby.  What's turned me right off (and will send me back to the Hyatt on my next trip) was an interaction in the Club lounge yesterday afternoon. I had tea and my husband a beer (non-imported, for which he happily paid $11). I also grabbed a still water from the fridge as I left:  QUELLE HORREUR!!! This is apparently akin to filling my pockets with freebies from the bar, if the reaction of the female staff-member who demanded I replace it is anything to go by.  $480 for a night's accommodation and I'm berated and embarrassed in a public space by a representative of the hotel. Treating the Club as a free-for all is clearly inappropriate, but alienating patrons over a bottle of water is tactless and distasteful.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470206517~“Not quite perfect”~The views are amazing, and the rooms are comfortable (beds to die for), but the housekeeping leaves a little to be desired. We were there on the Grand Prix weekend, so it was pretty busy and maybe this was unusual, but the bathroom floor had about half a dozen long, black hairs over it, especially under the sink ledge.  I got the impression it had been cleaned in a hurry.  The lobby had some really gorgeous soft couches and my understanding is that the club is fantastic, so if you can afford it this could be a better option.  Service on check in and check out was fast, friendly and efficient.  I think for the price you could do better.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_470193767~“Another Fabulous Wedding Anniversary Stay”~Such a special experience - perhaps the best of many annual wedding anniversary celebrations. It is so worth it to upgrade to the view of the bay on the 40th floor. It is silent and serene above to look down on the busy-ness of the Fed Square screen and Flinders St Bridge trams and traffic. I had "lost" my jacket earlier in the day and asked the Concierge - Andrew Natoli- could he call the nail salon in Tivoli Place to see if they had it. We had tickets for the Kino movies below so I could not check for the jacket myself. Andrew went totally out of his way to walk three big blocks to the Salon for me! What amazing service! Thank you Andrew.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_470149500~“Beautiful, great service and just a tad "cheap".”~I was visiting Melbourne with a NatGeo Australia tour and this is their "go-to" hotel in Melbourne. My room was on the 45th floor--easily the highest floor I've ever stayed in and the view was spectacular! Beautiful room, great service, engaging and helpful concierge, and centrally located on Collins--right in the middle of everything. I couldn't have more pleased with the room. Breakfast (in a dramatic top-to-bottom glass room overlooking Melbourne) was lovely on day one. On the second morning, I decided to pick up a yogurt and maybe a piece of fruit and a cup of coffee. I made the mistake of asking the hostess if I could take a few items back to my room, instead of eating there, and she balked. No--nothing should be taken out of the breakfast room. "Food must be eaten here". Mind you, my breakfasts were included in the price of my stay. (Cheap!) Also, as lovely as the room was, there was no fresh coffee service. You're presented with a hot water kettle and instant coffee. Instant. (Cheap!)  I'm giving this hotel 4 stars because of the room, front desk, aesthetic charm and its superb central location. But a little voice in my head is still whispering: Cheap!!~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470134760~“Great views and good service”~We love Sofitels, you can't beat their comfy beds. Sofitel Melbourne also has amazing views from the rooms, gyms and restaurant. We found the staff really helpful too. I like the location, near tram stops and walking distance to central shopping malls.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469570498~“Mixed feelings”~I have mixed feelings about last night's stay at the Sofitel on Collins, so thought it best to list out the positives and negatives... Positives - lovely greeting at reception, efficient check in and out, large room on level 36, great view, clean, great location at the Paris end of Collins Street Negatives - decor in room a bit dated, no comp toothbrush (oops forgot mine, or would not have noticed), no comp bottled water (thought that was pretty standard these days), shower over bath, dinky shower head, could hear noise from bar in my room So, I might stay again... or not.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469367032~“Good Location ”~We stayed in this hotel during our 4 day trip to Melbourne. Rooms were okey, very simple but the view was a killer. We had a great view of the city. The lounge had a good selection of canapés and cocktails. Breakfast at no. 35 was good and also had a great view of the city. Walking distance to most of the tourist spots of the city. Will definitely go back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469299972~“Quiet end of Collins Street”~Great rooms, service, smooth check-in and check-out. Stayed for the Adele weekend with three friends, we all enjoyed a quick cocktail and bite to eat at no 35 before the concert. On our return we had full turn down service with water, chocolates and a delightful lavender spray. We enjoyed late room service in my upgraded suite on the 50th floor before relaxing in an amazing king bed with exquisite linen and a pillow menu of choice. Breakfast is enjoyed from the 35th floor and they serve real coffee without making it an extra charge. Our experience was amazing and because it's located slightly away from the hustle and bustle you don't hear the ding on the tram! My new favourite hotel in Melbourne. Well done.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_468692310~“It's Got A View”~And it's a pretty amazing view, so good in fact that at times it feels like The Sofitel knows it's view is great so doesn't have to try as hard in other areas. Pro's: The view is amazing and if you are from another country or interstate and it is your first time in Melbourne, then it may well be worth staying for the view. For the most part the staff try hard. Con's: As part of our package we got breakfast included but as the package stipulated it had to be in our room via room service. On both mornings we received things we did not order, but also things we did order were missing. The hot breakfast was cold and to be honest the breakfasts were pretty ordinary, considering what you are paying. Then to top it off on checkout I was charged a tray fee for breakfast for $14 ???? To their credit they quickly did remove it.  At the price this hotel is, I would expect a turndown service, there is not one. You cannot play your own hard drive or DVD's on their TV. There is no pool or Spa. The furniture is old with many chips. Unless your are a certain status you have to pay a large fee for Wifi. I have been staying at the Park Hyatt lately, but thought I would give the Sofitel another go after a couple of years away. To be honest for similar money the Park Hyatt is a much better value for money proposition, with turndown, a pool and spa and bigger rooms. Although the Sofitel will always have that view.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_468622671~“Weekend Oasis”~The Sofitel on Collins is our hotel of choice whenever we have the chance to escape to Melbourne for a weekend or minibreak. This trip did not disappoint. Checkin is always seemless, and an unexpected upgrade to a corner suite was a lovely surprise. The hotel offers exactly what we seek - a quite, luxurious space that allows you to feel tucked away from the world; super comfy rooms with amazing views that can be enjoyed for hours, in the day or nighttime, especially nice with a room service cocktail. Great food and beverage options inhouse (No. 35 has the most amazing breakfast room views across the city to the bay and an extensive buffet spread of delicious foods to select from at your leisure) and with a tram or taxis at the doorstep you have all that Melbourne offers within easy reach.  The hotel position within Collins Place means you can see a movie, have a meal or drink, shop for clothes and jewellery or have a cup of tea under the atrium and still be within the cocoon of relaxation if you really wish to hide away. And Sofi's lounge offers delicious and generous high tea options if you're up for some socialising.  This hotel is the complete package and we can't wait to return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468602790~“5 Star All The Way”~From the moment we arrived until our checkout we were given 5 Star service. Our room on the 50th floor had a magnificent view and was very luxurious and kept spotlessly clean during our stay. We enjoyed breakfast and cocktails in the lounge each day and the welcome and service was always very professional and friendly. Special thanks to Terence Murphy, Guest Relations Manager, who left a handwritten welcome card together with a bottle of sparkling wine and a bag of cookies. It was very much appreciated Terence. The Sofitel is within an easy walking distance from the City, is very luxurious and has service to match. Nobody does it better. We look forward to our next visit.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_467893151~“Fantastic Location”~Three nights in the Sofitel having just arrived from the east coast of the US. Filled the bill for jet lag recovery - clean and quiet - and central location - lots to see and do just walking. Breakfast buffet at No. 35 is superb. Hotel staff were welcoming, warm and helpful. The view from our 41st floor room was unbelievable.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467693402~“Just One Night”~One night in a beautiful corner room/suite. (We were upgraded to Room 4227). The views of Melbourne were stunning. It made me reassess my views about my city. The day we arrived was hot and humid. In the morning we awoke to a humid, cloudy morning. It made the view more interesting. The toiletries are Lanvin. French products stand for luxury and quality I believe. A bowl of fruit and a packet of delicious biscuits were brought to our room and there was a spray for the pillows. Dressing gown and slippers of course were included. This is a lovely hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467097357~“Glorious stay”~We stayed in Melbourne for the weekend to see the Book of the Mormon and stayed at the Sofitel. OMG what a beautiful hotel. The service was excellent and the atmosphere so welcoming. The staff were so friendly you felt like they knew you even though this was our first time there. The rooms were beautifully appointed and exceptionally clean. Thanks to all the staff from the concierge to the reception and the wonderful staff in the bar on the 35th floor. Our view was amazing and we just had an awesome weekend topped off with a fabulous hotel.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467078321~“No. 35 is Number One”~The seven of us - 6 adults and 1 kid - went to have a post-Christmas dinner at No. 35 in Sofitel Melbourne. We had all range of food from salmon, steak, to chips for fhe kid. They were all beautifully presented and super delicious. The salmon and the steak in particular are highly recommended. The portion was just right, and the wine collection was perfect for the food. If anything, just very slightly, we felt that we needed to exert an effort to get some service. Perhaps because the restaurant was quite full at the time we were there. The crowd was nice and not too formal. The view of Melbourne from the 35th floor was amazing - just right to entertain the whole family. Definitely one of my favourite in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467071226~“Poor service”~We travel frequently to Melbourne and thought we would try the Sofitel as it had been a number of years since we had stayed there. The room while dated was comfortable and very clean. The concern came through the way my partner was treated on arrival to check in. As I had booked the trip in my name, he was not permitted to check in despite having (a) the booking reference on email (b) the same address (c) the same credit card. He was told that the manager would need to be contacted to see what could be done. 45 minutes later the manager came and informed him that he was a security risk and therefore could not be permitted to check in. I was not due to arrive for a few more hours on my flight. The issue was the way he was treated at this time, not necessarily the outcome. It could have been handled much better. Apparently I should put his name in the "comments" section when booking. But how would I be aware to do this? The system needs to be looked at. When I came to check in (with the same girl who had dealt with my partner) I decided not to bring anything up to see how it was dealt with. There was no apology, or connection to what had happened. In fact nothing was mentioned. Unfortunately it put a significant dampener on the start of what was to be a nice weekend away. It did make it clear to us we will not be returning.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~2~nan
review_467038480~“Good but ageing and a few peeves”~You'd expect this hotel to be a lovely experience and it is. Despite a quirky design, the rooms are spacious with lovely views given the height of the building where the rooms are. They are getting a bit tired though, with scuffed furniture and interior paint work that needs updating. There must be a refurbishment due soon I would think. We enjoyed the breakfast in the restaurant with a lovely view of Melbourne. There was a good range of options but some of the food looked better than it was - we found the pastries poor quality and stale, and the waffle we had was incredibly sweet and extremely dense. The omelette service is always nice to have, but was unexceptional and poorly seasoned. The wifi charge at A$25 per day is extortionate and unbecoming and there is a sense that the hotel is looking to charge you at every chance it gets (drinks in the mini bar are sealed with Sofitel stickers to prevent you using and replacing). We had an unexplained and unjustified charge added to our bill, which seems consistent with this view (and which the hotel did correct). I also object to a credit card surcharge when paying at a 5 star hotel. They don't seriously want me to settle in cash, so don't charge me extra to use their preferred method of payment. Again, it's extortionate when the room rate is already well over A$350 per night. Overall we had a good enough experience, but the peeves (especially the wifi charge) might be enough to put me off staying again.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466777764~“Top notch on top floor”~If you need luxury and an awesome bay view, Sofitel got it. Be aware, that you pay for what you get, but if you are willing and able to do so, this is your place. Room is large and luxury Lavin amenities. I liked the window shades, room and bathroom lightning is top.  I wished the shower was a little roomier, but it was all right. The Minibar is very well equipped. One of the better one I have ever seen.  Some of the receptionists need more training with what other customer honoring program the accor group is cooperating with. Other than that, the staff is very friendly from Valet parking to room maid. But on the other side, you can expect that from a hotel in that category. Valet parking is too expensive (AU$55.00/night)~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_466637445~“excellent in every way possible”~we had the pleasure of using the club lounge for our stay this entitled us to breakfast, light lunch a light afternoon tea (macaroon's) and substantial drinks and canapes in the evening for the length of our stay. Great. great before going to shows and a late dinner booking. excellent service here. Our room on the 50th floor was a good size and with the best bed around great bathroom also. if there was one let down it was the parking it is quite expensive to park the car if you can leave it home, free transport around city cbd and docklands great idea for visitors to city~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466607711~“Lovely hotel”~If you like staying in hotels, the Sofitel is lovely. Although you pay for it. $300+ per night for a small room. $100 per head for high tea...

It always feels like a luxury home away from home. The location in central Melbourne so close to tram and train connections is a wonderful bonus. It is also an easy walk to great shopping. That is the bit my wife loves the most! I can't speak highly enough of this hotel. They always treat me so courteously. The rooms are also pretty good value for money especially if you are an Accor card holder.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_464178128~“Terrific customer service”~Terrence Murphy,the guest relations manager, went out of his way to help salvage what was almost a nightmare. My wife and we're staying at the Sofitel following a two week cruise. We had signed up for a tour to Philip island to see the penguin parade. A private tour bus was supposed to pick us up in front of the hotel for a tour which was prepaid and confirmed the prior day. We we waiting in the circular drive. The bus pulled up onto Collins st and left without us after 5 minutes without making an effort to find us or even contact us. Terrence came to our aid and called the tour operator and arranged for them to take us later that day. And he gave us taxi vouchers to use in meeting the tour. He turned a potentially disastrous experience completely around and for that we are deeply appreciative. The hotel was also very well located and we would definitely stay there again~5~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_476333849~“Convenient location and exceptional service”~I stayed at the Sofitel on Collins for a brief stay in Melbourne to see The Book of Mormon. I found the hotel conveniently located within short walking distance to the Princess Theatre, as well as a multitude of popular restaurants, boutique shops on Collins Street and Federation Square. The staff at the hotel are courteous, helpful, and go out of their way to provide exceptional service. Check-in and check-out were a breeze.  The room (a Classic Room with City View) was luxurious, spacious and well appointed with all the amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel. I was particularly pleased to have a choice of pillows from the Pillow Menu, and was pleasantly surprised to have a walk in shower rather than a shower over bathtub. The view from the 42nd floor of the MCG, Rod Laver Arena and Hisense Arena was a great bonus.  Being able to secure a room at a discounted rate makes the Sofitel on Collins an unbeatable option in my opinion. This will be at the top of the list for my next stay in Melbourne.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_477628982~“Outdated, noisy and poor customer service. Great location however.”~My wife and I stayed at the Sofitel for the first time on Wednesday night (April 19), and after staying at most other 5 star hotels in Melbourne this would be at the very bottom of the list. Yes the location is great however the place is so outdated, its right out of the 90's. The bathroom are small the shower is over the bath (really??, 5 star??) and is very outdated. The beds are comfortable, the view very nice but they are the only positives. Apart from being extremely outdated the other major gripe I have is at 7am in the room next door to us contractors began working, I understand work needs to be done on rooms (and every room at this place needs work in being updated) but if you want start work at 7am don't book the adjoining rooms. I called reception to complain and they apologised and had the work stop, but it was too late, we were already awake. When sitting in the lobby waiting for our friends I heard the duty manager tell the front desk staff that we had complained and if they could refer us to her but there would be nothing they would offer us. We ended up being in a rush and whilst the duty manager did apologise to us no compensation was offered which I thought was pretty disappointing. I am sure if we complained and carried on like many do we would have been offered something but I didn't have the energy and quite frankly you should not need to carry on to receive good customer service. In summary, outdated, small rooms, poor customer service but in a great location. I would stay at every other 5 star hotel in Melbourne (and some 4 - 4 1/2 star) before I ever stay here again.~1~nan~nan~4~nan~4~1~nan
review_477288147~“Great views and Club Sofitel staff are lovely.”~Overall we had a good stay. Stayed at plenty of Sofitel hotels and typically love the experience.  The staff in Club Sofitel we're lovely and made us feel very welcome.  The little touch of chocolates at Easter was appreciated.  Was disappointed that our room wasn't available until 4pm, even after Sofitel called 3 days prior and asked what time to expect us - and we told them we'd arrive at 2pm. We also received a txt message an hour prior to checking in (1pm) to say our room was ready and confirming parking/location/arrival.  We also requested a single bed (which was also confirmed on phone) for our toddler. This was also not ready upon arrival and wasn't provided until after 5pm - this affected our holiday, as we planned for her to have an afternoon nap around 2pm.  The rooms are nice, but they are very dated and not in great condition. (chipped surfaces & cracked table stops etc.) We liked the electronic lighting setup - so easy to use.  The iron in our room was also broken, although we didn't report this to staff. The room could have been cleaner, but that might have been the dated fit-out. The floor didn't look like it had been properly vacuumed.  Room was nice and quiet and bed was seriously comfy, as you'd expect from Sofitel.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_476083777~“Beautiful views and peaceful”~Stayed in a Superior room overlooking the bay. Stunning views towards the Southwest of the city and out to the water. The king size bed was incredibly comfortable for my partner and I. Too often I'm disappointed with "king size" beds that are two king singles with a mattress topper, but this was a proper king size bed. The shower was excellent, though a walk in shower would be nicer than the shower over bath.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476070056~“Good choice”~Hotel staff are very professional and friendly, shout out to Sam who went above and beyond to help us, lovely guy! Recommended an amazing place to eat which we ended up going to almost every night of our stay We had a free bottle of wine and chocolates delivered which was a nice surprise! Daily free water delivered nightly with the turn down service and you can get free wifi if you are a member, bonus! We were on floor 47 and had amazing views of the city. Probably the biggest let down is the noise from floor 35 bar, we heard it in our room so I can't imagine how noisy it is closer to here considering we were on one of the top floors. Overall the hotel is amazing, you don't see many people around, the staff are amazing and there is plenty of coffee and food options downstairs on the lower ground level. (Juice place has amazing healthy breakfast options such as yogurts and fruit, well priced and you can store in your room fridge! Some amazing bakery items and there is a movie theatre and it's right downstairs! Tram stop is right outside and there is another about a five minute walk from the hotel.  The Hotel sells Myki Cards and have Tram maps which is really helpful as well.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476002673~“Great location, excellent service, immaculate room”~Luxurious rooms without the obscene price point, attentive service without the snobbery, great location without the hustle and bustle. Small but perfectly formed gym. If I was a keen swimmer the review would only be 4-star as the hotel doesn't have its own pool (you need to walk to the nearby Novotel to use their pool).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475945043~“Grand”~At the Paris end of Collins St, on the steps of Parliament Station, this hotel has outstanding appeal. Excellent concierge. Parking and public transport. Bar. Restaurant. Great bedding. You won't queue for an elevator as there are plenty. The views are phenomenal. Everything about the place is great. Reasonably priced. Shared swimming pool with another hotel down the street if you're a swimmer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475084558~“Great location and excellent service”~The staff were very helpful and friendly. The rooms were lovely with great views of Melbourne. The location is easy to get to with free trams outside the door. Easy walking to shops and theatres and other attractions. Would stay there again when I return to Melbourne.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474913603~“Atrium bar =Amazing view”~We came here to have a quiet drink with a group of people and a few babies. The views from there were amazing. We turned up Without a reservation a group of 15 and the staff accommodated us without complaint! Once again check the view from the toilets! Amazing!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474848311~“Great Location”~Travel agent had requested a twin room for my self and daughter but on check in got a King said no twins available , fine as it was family, but could off been awkward if not!! The location was great the tram was just out front and would definitely stay here again the room was large. Good bathroom, bed was comfy, Great bar area had a light meal here instead of the restaurant.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474819566~“$7 charge to collect room service tray...?”~I used to really like this hotel. Hadn't stayed there in a while but thought I'd give it another go. First shock was they still charge house guests for wifi access, $5 per hour or $29 per day. whaaaat??? I haven't been charged for wifi when staying at a 5 star hotel for years! The next bit was my favourite. I had a room service dinner, placed the tray outside my door afterwards, as you do. When checking out, I noticed they charged me $7 for collecting the room service tray !! Next time I'll just throw it over the 45th floor internal balcony and they can guess which room to charge the $7.~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_474818910~“Lovely hotel with a little French style in a central location”~Reception on 1st floor with a very nice coffee house. Staff helpful and friendly  You are really made to feel welcome here. Hotel restaurant and bar on 35th floor. Great views of the city and coast. Excellent breakfast. Hotel room very good. Quite spacious. Good comfortable and large bed.Quiet. Bathroom very satisfactory. Wi fi could be a bit stronger. Conference facilities faultless. A pleasure to stay in this fine hotel.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474522542~“Car trip to Melbourne, Adelaide and central Australia.”~Our 6th stay at Sofitel on Collins, This facility has become one of our very favourite hotels in Australia. Classy reception, friendly, professional and very helpful. Once again the room was superb. We love the cushion menu and very comfortable beds and bed linen. The food served is great regardless if you eat casual or formal. We recommend the Sofitel on Collins to any one, looking for a great breakaway! Rolf~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474042925~“1980s Internet Time Warp”~The 1980s Sofitel exudes a graceful, glitzy aura befitting its heyday-of-disco-design. Unfortunately, the internet service is mired in an ineffectual time warp of the same 1980s Eastern bloc era. It doesn't really matter because both systems are no longer in vogue; even post-Soviet internet systems have improved and disco has certainly moved on to better things. It is unfortunate that the experience of the stunning views and handsome, classic modernist design is quickly forgotten following day after day of frustration from simply attempting to get an internet connection; which should be a simple endeavour in this day and age, but not at the Sofitel where the 1980s live on, right down to the internet network. Seriously, I have not experienced such a hackneyed, ineffectual system since the days of the dial-up modem. Even more of an outrage is that the going rate for the service is a hefty 29 rubles... I mean 29 dollars a day. Sofitel, you had me won over completely with the 1980s glitz and glamour and then lost it all with the Eastern-bloc internet. It is way past time for an internet upgrade. I suggest you attend to the needs of the masses soon, before you have a full-scale revolt on your hands. Even though the Sofitel is a magnificent, modernist 80s classic, I just can't see myself returning for a stay until the outdated internet system is sent back to the gulag from whence it originated.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473974613~“Surprised us with how good it was”~From check in to check out, we were made to feel valued and welcome. The restaurant and bar were warm and casual and the service was excellent. We stayed on the 38th floor with excellent city views. Wifi was fast, ubiquitous and stable. Fitness centre had a rower which is uncommon as wel as massage chairs. Will definitely stay at a Sofitel property again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473939547~“Great property right in the thick of it!”~I gather that the Sofitel has been around for a while but they have done a good job of maintaining the property and it doesn't show its age at all. One of the tallest, if not the tallest, buildings in this amazing city the location is ideal as a launching point for walking the different downtown neighborhoods, eating in some of the great foodie restaurants of for attending theatre. The beds are really comfortable, the curtains black out and there a nice views from most of the rooms. What more could you need?~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_473865941~“Stop over”~Nice place very clean and easy to get around  Beautiful beds like your in heaven  Will go again love the place  Staff very helpful and good ideas in what to do  Will go again  The breakfast out of this world lots to choose from~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473725560~“Hello Melbourne”~A visit for the opening of the AFL season. Sofitel Melbourne is convenient to MCG. Good access by tram, train or walk. Also near parks, Collins St fashion shopping and easy stroll to cafes and theatres.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473681276~“Love to stay here on Melbourne visit”~When I travel home to Australia I love to stay here on one of the upper floors and wake up to an amazing view of the skyline and rest of the city. Great location on Collins easy to walk everywhere. The rooms are great but the hotel could do with some additional amenities (larger gym, pool) for the rate. Service is generally very good but sometimes can encounter a gruff front desk person.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_473547118~“Birthday Treat”~Stayed here with my husband to celebrate my birthday & it was the most relaxed we'd been in months. We were able to enjoy a show & lots of great food! Including the late night/early morning room service. It was a nice touch of arriving to our room with a complimentary bottle of sparkling & card saying happy birthday.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473064076~“Nice weekend, but nothing special”~Stayed at the Sofitel for a weekend with my partner while in town for a wedding. My partner had stayed previously and wanted to stay again due to the impeccable service he received, which unfortunately we missed out on this time. Reception staff could work on their customer service skills, porters and staff out the front of the building were great. We had a nice room with amazing views over the city and out to the ocean. We enjoyed breakfast in the executive lounge which also had nice views, breakfast was okay but wouldn't pay for it. This hotel has a grand feeling in the lobby and common areas but that feeling is lacking in the rooms. Great location, we easily walked all over the city. I don't think this hotel is worth the cost and definitely don't get treated as well as other Accor hotels despite having status.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473060418~“Great location”~Pet hate of mine - poor wifi , inconsistent at best and not free unless you join the hotel club - that said , great base for exploring the city , beautiful views from the room , very friendly and helpful staff~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472793544~“They don't accept family with two kids”~I'm sure this a great hotel, and would have given 5 stars but I have to give 1 star as they do not allow to have my small kids in one room. I have to book two rooms and leave a room empty because they cannot have 4 people in one room. Discrimination on family with two or more kids. My kids will not sleep by themself. What if your kid got a special condition. Not happy.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472595925~“Iconic Hotel, Breathtaking View, Service & Memorable Experience”~Been staying here for decades, originally under the famed 'Regent' brand then since Accor's premier brand 'Sofitel' took over. That saw international Hotelier GM - Clive Scott, a local with huge creds takeover and that he has; having run successful hotels in Asian capital cities he knows his stuff and insists on a standard you won't find anywhere else in Australia. His attention to detail makes the Sofitel on Collins - Melbourne experience a perfect one. He is supported by Terrence Murphy, Guests Services Director who is a legend in the city, including the finest, race goers, sports enthusiasts, fashionista's and those seeking out Melb's best entertainment. Forgot to book a place to eat, don't quite know where to head for dinner - Terrance will guide you toward your favorite dish than get you into an already booked out eatery - how does he do this everytime.  Then there is the Sofitel's Director of Sales - Shirley Lin. WoW, WoW, WoW! This lady will pre-empt your next need and recommend it before you thought of it. Her forte is stage and screen and if you ever wanted to do an opening night show or event she's the one. The Hotel's superb rooms, restaurants and bars let us slip into a great mood, enjoying the stay and was a great springboard out into Melbourne which is a fabulous city to explore and get amongst.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_472283112~“Back again as an Accor member”~Last review of the hotel stated I would not be back because of credit card surcharge. Indeed, I did change my loyalty for a couple of years because of this. However, as a Platinum member of Accor returned because of the Club benefits. Glad I did as it is a great hotel. Lovely views and central location and the upgraded room and copious delicious Club food as a result of Accor status, made our return worthwhile. Beds are wonderful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472258844~“Memorable anniversary stay.”~We stayed at the Sofitel Melbourne on Collins for our 20th wedding anniversary and were upgraded to a Deluxe 50th floor suite. The suite was beautifully appointed and luxurious and the view was spectacular. We also enjoyed the Club Sofitel experience including a light luncheon, evening drinks and canapes and breakfast. We think this is the best Club in Melbourne and would highly recommend paying the extra to upgrade. We have stayed at the Sofitel on numerous occasions and we always come back because of the amazing service and beautiful rooms and views. Thanks for making our anniversary stay so memorable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472217060~“Beautiful city gem!”~I loved this property - what a grand entrance! I stayed for 1 night on a Friday night but imagine this would be perfect for a mid week stay. This area of the city gets a little quiet on the weekend. Great service. Rooms are amazing. 10/10 would stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
