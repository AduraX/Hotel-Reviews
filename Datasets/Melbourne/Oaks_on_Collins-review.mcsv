review_478414883~“Easter 2017”~Checked, no towels in room, no toiletries. Self contained into, no plugs for dishes and dishwasher had one inch of water in it from previous guests. Woken up by a fire drill, no note under the door no warning.  The toilet is less than a metre from the bed head. I will never stay here again and feel ripped off as I have stayed at other oaks and been very impressed. I'm sure the manager will trot out his standard response as he does to all negative TripAdvisor reviews, but nothing changes. Do yourself a favour and stay elsewhere!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477891554~“Disappointed”~Stayed for 4 nights over the Easter period and were given a room on the 15th floor. Was a quiet room. No housekeeping during that time, had to ask front reception for clean towels, rubbish removal and shampoo on several of the days we were there. The fridge still had previous occupants food and drinks in it and dirty with beetroot stains on the shelf. Bathroom is very small...no room or shelf for make up or a place to put your beauty case. Lights very dim which made it hard to put on makeup and bed is right outside bathroom. Tap in basin and the soap dish in the shower were both loose and broken. TV faced the bed so we couldn't see it from the couch. Bed was quite comfortable but only a double. Kitchenette was handy for breakfast. We ordered room service one night which was reasonably priced and quite tasty. Would I stay thereagain....No. disappointed for an Oaks chain.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_477824088~“Happy surprise ”~I was very nervous after reading the reviews on here but we were pleasantly surprised - rooms were lovely, staff were friendly and helpful and great location. Yes the bathrooms are small but you're only using it to have a shower! Great place and we will definitely stay here again!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477708078~“Awful”~The toilet is right next to the bed. We had no towels or floor mats for the shower. There's barely enough room for one person to fit in the "bathroom". The bed is only a double and my partners feet hang off the end of the bed.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476977142~“The small details let it down”~After arriving very tired, it was disappointing to check into a room that looked nice at first, but quickly left me shaking my head. The phone in the room was filthy (so much dust and dirt that the buttons wouldn't push properly) and when I tried to call room service, I found that the phone didn't work at all. So I used my mobile to call reception. After being onhold for 6 minutes, I hung up and called again and was told that I needed to call the restaurant directly using the hotel phone to order room service. Umm..sure except the phone doesn't work. It took 3minutes of explaining myself again and again before they would transfer me on the mobile. The person who took the room service order was confused because I was calling from mobile - so it took another 2 minutes of explaining once again that the room phone didn't work. I was told that because it was a long weekend there was no one in maintenance to come and check the phone. The room service food was probably the best thing - really yummy and reasonably priced - but whoever installed the cupboards above the kitchenette must have been a giant...I'm pretty tall (165cm) and I had to stand on tip-toes and stretch to reach a glass. When I finally lay down to sleep, I started sneezing. I turned on the light and found the picture above my bed (which was torn) was absolutely covered in dust and dirt. (See photo). Anyway - it was really disappointing because the bed was comfortable and the room would have been fine if it was clean!~3~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_476655946~“Great location ”~Lovely room and very professional service from all staff. Only disappointment is the bathroom. Need something to rest toiletries on. Otherwise, the rooms are clean comfortable with great facilities. Have stayed here twice now and will probably do so again. King size bed is a luxury.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476275250~“Small bathroom”~A fairly standard hotel in an excellent location. Don't be fooled thinking reception is inside the hotel, it's in a glass box to the right of the entrance. My main gripe is the size of the bathroom, particularly in view of the decent size of the whole room, its tiny. Half a sink with a shower base that extends into the area in front of the sink, a plastic shower curtain that physically cannot shield the 'bathroom' from water splashes and opaque glass sides that don't hide enough from the outside when the light is on. Apart from those gripes it's functional....... Oh, and the TV doesn't get free to air channels. The kitchen is reasonably well equipped and the be comfortable. Did I mention the bathroom?~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475672657~“FLEASS IN THE ROOM Absolutely horrendous ”~We stayed here over the weekend and omg what a disgusting experience.  1st of all the sink was as small as my arm 2nd when we arrived to the room we could hear mince in the ceiling when called them they claimed there was nothing and had a little laugh at us the worker that came into our room mr sanjeesh was him made us out like we are gling psycho. That noise did not stop for the 4 days we were there.  3rd and the worst part of it alll wass that we had FLEASSSSSS in the room of this disgusting hotel. If you enjoy sleeping with things jumping on you all night then this is the hotel for you.  YYYUCKKKKKK NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE TO ANY OAKS IN THE WORLD.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475140076~“Convenient Location”~This is a good, clean hotel in a convenient location. Because you are able to make your own breakfast if you wish, it can be a good $ saver. Staff on reception are pleasant and helpful. We didn't eat in the dining room but did check the bar menu which looked quite good. Disappointing in this day and age that WiFi is not free. We would stay here again.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_473475109~“Good Accommodation”~My fiancee and I stayed here for New year's eve, it was nice apartment, had everything we needed​ for our stay. The indoor pool was great and also the jacuzzi was too. The apartment has a kitchenette with satisfactory cooking facilities. The apartment was in ok condition, but it does need some maintenance to bring back up to being in good condition. Staff were very friendly, and due to the time of year, we could see that very busy but still manage to be very professional and courteous. Great location and reasonably priced, I would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471740710~“Would stay again - but in a different room.”~On the plus side - good sized room with decent amenities. Housekeeping was very good, hotel is in a convenient location. Several stores nearby for food and groceries; decent fridge and freezer and stove top along with a solid selection of kitchen wear. Both guest laundry and dry cleaning facilities available which I liked. Decent selection of TV channels, standard room service menu and the food was very nice. On the down side - breakfast is $17; nice buffet but coffee is $3 extra which is annoying. No USB charging ports which I really can't fathom in 2017. Everyone travels with mobiles, tables and laptops these days - when are hotels going to catch up to technology? Water pressure poor and hot water was minimal. Had to turn it on and wait for it to heat up, then basically turn the cold tap off completely and just shower using the hot tap. Thankfully it was a warm week in Melbourne as if it had been winter I would not have been happy! Survived the week without getting concussion and that was a bonus. How the bathroom design passed health and safety regulations is beyond me. Very narrow sink with a glass shelf right above it. I'm not a tall person but only a contortionist would find this setup practical (see photo). No idea if all bathrooms are like this, hope not as generally I enjoyed staying at Oaks on Collins and would stay again. Location, room size and amenities (room service, TV channel selection, housekeeping, inclusions) very good. Bathroom a let down.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~3~nan
review_471274349~“Nickel and dimming you to death”~First time we've ever been limited in the amount of time we could use the wifi per day in a hotel that we are paying over $300 per night. They also charge $20 per hour after check out time! We've been all over the world and this is ridiculous. The buffet was uninspired, bacon that was pretty much raw, pastries dry and the supper was tasteless and overlooked. The hotel has 5 or 6 steps to climb to get in or out so not for those with mobility issues. Th rooms were large but the bathroom was tiny and the toilet right beside the bed with only a sliding glass door to separate them. The couch did not face the tv so we sat on the bed to watch tv. It was clean enough although the carpet was not vacuumed in the 5 days we stayed there. The location is convenient but we will not stay there again.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_470409286~“Awful and expensive”~Stayed for a month for work. Broken shower, broken bathroom door (had to be fixed twice during my stay), bathroom smelt mouldy and the floor tiles were cracked and uneven, broken dishwasher that wouldn't stop beeping even when not in use and open so had to be turned off at the all, old worn stained carpet, cold food at breakfast, rooms are very noisy (street noise, rubbish trucks etc) even on Level 15. Daily issue with towels not being left even after notifying reception more than once. Washing machine smelt mouldy and cost $3 (dryer also cost $3) to use, given it cost $300 plus per night to stay you'd expect it to be free. The TV on the wall was at a ridiculous angle so not sure where you are meant to sit to watch it. I had to be ask for my room to be vacuumed as it wasn't done for days. While some of the staff at were reception were nice and helpful the others were the complete opposite. The only thing it has going for it was the location. Definitely wouldn’t stay here again.~1~nan~5~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_470163903~“Letting down the oaks brand”~I've stayed at a number of oaks properties for both work and leisure and have always had a pleasant experience. Oaks on Collins was a massive disappointment. The bathrooms were sparse and mouldy. We were moved from our first room after complaining about: aircon not working, blinds (to corridor) not closing and broken toilet seat. The second room, the aircon didn't work and the shower was broken. The concern from staff was superficial. Very disappointed in the quality against the price we paid.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470151025~“Very Average ”~I checked into my room, handed over my credit card, signed the forms and did all the usual hotel check in stuff. It wasn't until I went to the bank shortly after that I realized that they had taken an extra $75 out of my savings account for a deposit which I was not told about.  The dishwasher draw in my room was left open and full of dishes which left me wondering if my room had only been half cleaned. The tap to the sink needed repairing as the water sprayed out so far beyond the sink it wet me and the carpet section of the room too. The soap holder looked like it was about to fall off the wall and the dodgy moving tile which acted as the shower drain cover did not look very safe at all.  Upon check out the reception guy tried to take a further charge for the room out of my account which it declined. He said to me "there's no funds in your account" I told him "of course not you took the money out last night when I checked in, I've already paid and I'm not paying again". It finally got sorted, I left and will not be returning again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470001870~“Great Location, decent accommodation .”~I was in one of the executive studio apartment for a week of business travel. Pros-  -The location is great. Right on Collins street, 5 min walk to Southern Cross station, Woolys/Coles etc. - Neat and clean studio.  - Great breakfast buffet (part of my booking), with fresh juices and everything . Cons- - The studio apartment was small , like really small ? There was'nt much gap between one side of the bed and the bathroom entrance - which didnt have any door either. So if you have a kid , don't go for the studio. Not safe. - They offer free wifi for only 30 Min per day. That's really funny because its mostly business trip related ppl staying there .~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_469296684~“Oaks on Collins”~Stayed in a studio room with kitchen. Room was clean and tidy. The ironing board snapped in half and the water pressure in the shower was non existent, so the staff relocated us to another room. They were nice enough to move our luggage for us while we were out for the day.  Next room was also pleasant, clean and tidy, just again, the ensuites need attention. The location is quite central and close to trams.  Staff were very friendly.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469256032~“Great locations, but she needs a bit of care now!”~Oaks on Collins is a terrific all apartment hotel smack bang in the middle of Melbourne on vibrant Collins St. A tram at your doorstep ensures everything is accessible, but with Melbourne, walking is your best friend, as the city is so picturesque and easy to navigate, care of the grid pattern streets. I had an 18th floor studio which was spacious and well appointed. My only little gripe is the carpets! Oh the carpets in the hallways are very worn and as first impressions count, made me think...gosh, what else is going to be worn out..and at 4* prices. The staff were universally helpful and attentive, storing my bags prior and after my stay. There's a supermarket and liquor store two doors up and of course plenty of restaurants from which to choose. Now when the facelift takes effect, I'll definitely be back.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468736046~“Poor hotel dont do it”~So had to stay here for two days, poor hotel, small bathroom, two days of off milk, even after talikng to them still had milk that was sour. Old but sort of done up up but not well. Tv on a wall so high my neck still hurts. Meant to be an apartment but it is some weird cross between hotel room and small apartment. Worst hotel~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467362417~“You get what you pay for”~You pretty much get what you pay for here. It's not bad but I am unsure if the cleaners actually clean the mugs or refill the towels or tea and coffee.  Pro: It's cheap Good location Not a bad room for what you pay Con: Questionable cleaners Always slow check in process Shower is like a dripping tap~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467153347~“Not happy!!”~We stayed for the 3 nights . When we arrived, they told us our room wouldn't be ready till 2pm, which was fine, we arrived at 2, with the comment of "ow sorry,the rooms (cause we had two - which was another story) hadn't been fully cleane.....yet!) Near 2:30, our rooms were finally ready!! Walked in to find cook top filthy,carpets not vacummed,bathroom and kitchen floor ultra sticky!! (And that was just the one room!!) We went down,spoke to front desk people to only be asked "do you want us to clean it"!?!?!  So will we stay there again. Hell no! Other Oaks places were much better....this was very poor for the price we payed.~2~1~nan~2~nan~nan~1~nan
review_467149647~“Ordinary at best”~I was unlucky and copped a big lineup at checkin, no one's fault but not a great start. Then a long wait for an elevator. Then the carpet in the hallway is bunched up I'm starting to have a bad feeling about the location of my room as I walk in circles. I've ended up on an internal light well with a view of the neighbours doorstep. No sky. No pen? No Foxtel menu and a 35 minute wait even after I went down to collect one from reception. Eventually I found out I can watch the game so I decide to stay on with room service. No veggies, no salad? Then a call back to say they have no sticky date pudding. You're kidding me. I hope the beers cold.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467118806~“Great Location ”~We recently stayed at this hotel and were very pleased with the accommodation.

We had the buffet breakfast and it was very nice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467112458~“Bathrooms in Studio's”~I stayed in this property last week with 3 girlfriends, we had booked a studio executive. It was clean & tidy & nice, but seriously when you are with 3 friends you want a bathroom that isn't just divided by glass - this was terrible & even if there was only a couple in here this wouldn't be good! It says Max 3 adults well that 3rd adult is on the terrible rollaway that has springs poking out of it. We were moved to a better room in the end but the bathrooms still aren't great when divided by just glass.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466411721~“Good value for money”~The rooms were pleasant and comfortable. Good location close to the shopping area. Facilities in room are great if you stay for more than a couple of days. Definitely will be becoming back for another eventful night~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465495290~“Really enjoyable stay except for 1 major complaint.”~Great location & our room overlooked the beautiful stately buildings across the road in Collins St. Room was comfortable enough but the big let down was the bathroom. As soon as you slide open the door, the strong smell of mould & mildew hits you. There is mould on the bottom of the door as well as around the shower floor. There is no ventilation in there so we had to leave the bathroom door open. It needs an exhaust fan, not healthy. When we went to bed at night we made sure the door was closed to keep the smell in there. No shelving in there either for your toiletries. Apart from the bathroom situation, the room was good, buffet breakfast was excellent & reception service was good. Would stay again if bathrooms were improved on greatly.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464978096~“By the 4th room move, I knew things had gone downhill ”~I have stayed here numerous times as it's location is convenient to my office and generally the rooms are functional for a couple of days. Tonight, not so much. I arrived at 7.45pm from interstate, a little exhausted and a big week ahead. The first room I was sent to had not been cleaned. Now I don't mean a few bits of dust. We're talking unmade bed, pizza boxes and towels strewn across furniture. So I lugged my bags back downstairs and got sent to a tiny little room when I had paid for an executive room. Normally I would not be too fussed, but after the first room, I was a tad frustrated. So they take me to another room, on another floor, all seemed well. But 15 minutes after being in the room it became apparent that the aircon wasn't functioning. I called and asked someone to check it and a faulty door out, they did their best to fix it but 10 minutes after they left, the aircon stopped.  Finally, at 9.30pm, I was taken to a fourth and final room. Thank goodness, all is ok here. (I can live with cracked paint and broken doors on the cupboards) Through all of this the team we're polite and courteous, but the maintenance of this place leaves A LOT to be desired. It is old, tired and run down. Yes it is a cost effective stay, but clean rooms and aircon after a 28 degree day, is not too much to ask.  Thank you to the front desk team for their help though.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464648956~“Would not recommend; poor initial service and bad room”~We booked in for Sat 4th March via wotif.com. Upon checking in the reception guy was extremely arrogant and not welcoming nor personable. Acted like we were lucky to be staying there! Demanded my photo ID and credit card for a bond. We paid a price that was not cheaper than the daily rate either, so we didn't exactly get a bargain. However we were given a very poor room, when you walked in there was a strong sewerage odour, we then realised that the air conditioner had been left on and was dripping all over the carpet near the front door. The bathroom door was missing the handle and the shower curtain was missing. When we opened the door to the balcony it was right above the outside air-conditioning fans, approx 8, and it was very noisy. Only after we complained about the stench and requested another room were we given one, no apology or explanation was forthcoming though. When we checked out we had to wait around 15 minutes, with many other people still waiting behind us. One of the reception staff walked off, making the wait for the other people even longer. For the $200 plus we paid I would definitely shop around a bit more next time, as I know there are much better places to stay for the money, also with less arrogant customer service.~2~nan~3~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_464400485~“Friendly”~This was the first time I'd stayed at the oaks for business or pleasure but they treated me as if I was a constant guest.

review_464215267~“Location”~The rooms are small compared to some other less expensive places Ive stayed The bathroom is tiny and there were no toiletries in room.  Clean & comfortable but you are paying for location which is great ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463934006~“5 Day Stay”~Good Location within walking distance of city shopping and Southbank. Ask for a room away from the lifts. One of the lifts was out of action. Spacious room with tired kitchenette. A good bar to meet people and enjoy a drink and or a meal or bar snacks. Gym and swimming facilities available. Some components very good.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463642555~“Oaks on Collins”~I recently had a longer stay, about 10 days at the Oaks on Collins during a recent business trip. Room was nicely presented and for the most part well laid out, the bathroom was probably the let down being quite small and with a poor shower however, the bed was really comfortable. The included buffet breakfast was quite good with a lot of choices on offer. Overall despite being a 20 minute walk from the office I'd reccomend and stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463073716~“Average but good location!!”~Stayed in a studio executive apartment for 2 days in Feb, 2017 Positives: Good size room, good internet connection, decent work space, good location and good buffet breakfast. Negatives: The washroom is quite unsafe as there is hardly any space between the bed and the entrance and the entrance has got a sliding door and the trail which is really unsafe. Also the tiniest washbasin I have seen in my life. You can’t wash your face or brush your teeth without getting wet or dropping water everywhere on the floor.  I don’t think the housekeeping guys were well trained, they had a lot of communication issue.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~3~nan
review_463049778~“Very disappointed”~While the location is great, and the hotel presents well from the street, the room and breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. Room is small. It is not possible to sit on the toilet and reach around the wall is that close. Room was in a state of dis-repair. Holes in the walls from where there were shelves. Nowhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom. Only one coffee cup, no milk, no other condiments. Found chair in the shower on arrival. Room had not been cleaned/refreshed for our arrival. When it was booked, they were advised that this was our first wedding anniversary/holiday. Nothing had been done to make us feel more welcome. Not even acknowledgement of the event. When I approached them, about this, still nothing was done. The breakfast buffet was disappointing. food was over cooked and cold. food were not of high quality and chefs were very very slow to replenish. I advise going out on the street for breakfast. All in all, it is not worth the money. I recommend going somewhere else. Charging a luxury price for budget offerings.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~3~nan

review_462063351~“Overnight for work”~Room was nice very clean and tidy central to our needs. Went to use the shower and the shower head was so flimsy I went to adjust it and I thought it was going to come off the wall completely and the shelf under it was on quite a lean also. Might be a idea to secure it better.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461615149~“Serviceable at best”~Usually a Westin customer, I came down the other end of town to be closer to my appointments. Though priced much the same the oaks is most disappointing. For parking I'm just referred to a close by public car park. It has none of the luxury offered by the other hotels, not the foyer, amenities or the rooms. I'm in a room smaller than mine at home, the ensuite resembles a wardrobe and opens directly onto the one queen bed and comes complete with a plastic shower curtain. It is clean and serviceable but at $460.00 for one night it's a significant disappointment. Next time I'll bring my runners and do the extra walking. Doesn't represent value to me, actually feel I've been significantly overcharged. At $250.00 a night I've have coped it.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457210602~“Great location, good value”~I stayed at Oaks on Collins for three nights last week. This property is in the perfect location for me as it's very close to work. The room was well appointed and clean, the bathroom was tiny but as I was travelling alone this wasn't a problem. Might be an issue for couples though...  I had a special request at this property for a balcony and although the travel provider hadn't put the request through in the booking, Tyler on the front desk was able to help with this and I did get a balcony room which made all the difference to my stay.  I will definitely stay here again and certainly recommend it. Please pass on my thanks to Tyler in particular - he was excellent!!~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_456553626~“Could do better”~This hotel is perfectly located, within walking distance of everything and I would stay there again, now that I know what to do but we arrived, having dragged our cases from Southern Cross station, hauled them up the hotel steps (and I don't seem capable of travelling light!), looked around for a reception desk which was up some more steps, only to discover when we got there a really small sign saying reception closed and an arrow pointing down the steps again with the luggage to a reception in what to my unaccustomed eyes looked like 'next door'. Grrr!  Having checked in, up the steps with the luggage again to the lifts and up to our room which was well presented, clean, comfortable bed and had everything we wanted BUT NO WINDOW so no natural light. For the duration we stayed there I felt like I was living in a cave! All the questions I normally answer by looking out the window - sunscreen, umbrella, coat - forget it! Most other reviewers have mentioned the tiny bathrooms, yes I agree. The room was generous, the bathroom was effectively a cupboard with a sink so small that I had to turn sideways to spit toothpaste without banging my head on the shelf and it was definitely a one person space, and the shower sprayed water everywhere except on me.  Final gripe - we noticed the fridge wasn't keeping things very cold and asked reception to fix it, which they said they had when we checked that evening although it seemed no colder to me. Clearly their maintenance man needs better training because the milk was rancid when we went to use it despite having several days code left on it.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456346116~“Great accommodation, central location”~Stayed in mid-December for two nights, the rooms are modern decor, comfortable furnishings, the staff are professional and friendly, not the first time I have stayed at this hotel and likely will not be the last.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456336944~“Comfortable bed but average bathroom”~We arrived in Melbourne early and just needed one nights' stay. So we called Oaks to see if they had a room available and if we could check in early. They confirmed a room was already available, and as such, we would be able to check in early. However, the price given over the phone was considerably more than Booking.com, so I explained that I'd book online, and then come in and see them shortly. When we arrived, they explained we could no longer check in early unless we upgraded to the executive rooftop room. We just wanted to sleep, so we agreed. After agreeing to pay extra for this, another man came by and said we had to pay an extra $40 for early check-in. By this stage we were just tired and wanted to sleep, so we agreed a bit begrudgingly. When we questioned the additional charge, he explained that it's a rooftop room and he could easily sell it to someone else. Ahem, not if we booked it in for that night! Anyway, checked in and made our way up to our room. The room is big, but there was no hairdryer so we had to call housekeeping to get one. Carpets look a bit old and dirty, and the shower (with shower curtain) smelled like sweat. The bathroom in general wasn't great, so I used the sink in the kitchenette instead. The bed was really comfortable though! Levels 19-20 can only be accessed via stairs (from level 18). It's about a 10 minute walk from Bourke St Mall, or a stop or two on the tram (free tram zone). You get 30 minutes of free wi-fi every 24 hours.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_454446794~“Outstamdingly comfy bed”~2 nights in room 1806. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in. The room was clean and modern. The bathroom is a clever use of space but whilst we weren't bothered (very small and pokey) we can understand how some people might be. All staff are friendly, efficient and professional. We would not hesitate to stay here again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

The room itself was very large featuring comfortable king size bed, writing desk, large screen TV with a selection of Foxtel channels and kitchenette with microwave, oven, small dishwasher and decent size fridge. The room was spotless and in excellent condition, obviously recently refurbished. The bathroom is a very small space with frosted glass walls and featured a shower (with curtain) and a small sink more suited to a powder room. Again in as-new condition. The room, being internal, oddly had windows facing the hallway. Not a big deal as they had curtains but they look directly at the bed and it was creepy… Didn’t use the wifi or restaurant. The location of the property is excellent on the corner of Collins and William streets, meaning walking distance to Southbank, trams, Flinders Street Station and all the shopping and restaurants you could want.  Service was pleasant throughout and I would recommend for both a single traveler on business or as a base for a couples city visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453179386~“Overpriced and average hotel”~I go to check in and asked to swipe my card for mini bar expenses etc, get into the room and there's no mini bar, so not sure what that was about. The room I stayed in was nothing like the picture and the bathroom was so small I had to go out into the bedroom to get changed. I also had a window which backed onto another rooms balcony, so they could see into my room with the curtains open. I left my phone charger in the room on checkout and something as simple as sending it to my address took a 20 min phone call for the person on the phone to work out what to do. The towels are off white, old and there was no ice and the kettle and toaster we dirty. Overall average hotel and service, nothing like the pictures on the internet. I wouldn't stay there again.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_452981472~“Good short break”~Our allocated room was an internal room. After we settled we found the fridge did not work. we were given another room, 6 floors up and with a window overlooking Collins St. This upgrade was not a problem and effected quite quickly with a staff member to assist. Both rooms were comfortable. The bathrooms are a little quirky, but functional. They could use a bathroom shelf. The rest of the stay was uneventful and the staff at all levels were good. dining room was OK, but a bit pricey for breakfast.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_452289788~“Incompetent service!”~Paid $221 for one night, first lady we dealt with had no idea about the whole car parking situation, finally sent us underground, small car park and each space had reservation for each level in the hotel. 1 SPACE FOR EACH LEVEL! AND OUR LEVEL WAS ALREADY TAKEN. NO ATTENDANT IN THE CAR PARK TO ASSIST. Ended up parking in Flinders Lane. Get back to the hotel after our walk from the car park to find that elevators only go up to 19. Went back to reception to get assitance as to whether there are seperate elevators to our floor. LITERALLY TOOK 10 MINUTES to have the male receptionist understand that all we wanted was to get to level 19 but he gave us a run around. In the end we had to take an elevator to level 18 and walk up the stairs to get to level 19. If this was advertised, I would have just booked the Continental accross the road. Not worth the money or the time wasted! Oh and ice box in fridge was empty! Assuming they expect us to freeze our own ice, it was only until check out time that ice was ready. If you want a DIY hotel for a days work pay and to be redirected around circles then this is the place for you.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452263295~“Very bad experience. Avoid. ”~On checking in I discovered that the hotel had a much higher rate for the booking. I spent 30 minutes sorting it, eventually having to get the agent in Uk on the phone to sort it out. At the end of the conversation, it was sorted to my satisfaction and I was told they would honour the rate.  However, the next day the manager told me it was not sorted and they were still investigating.  I told him I was unhappy.  He rang me back to tell me the rate i booked at would be honoured. However, when i asked to get it in writing to avoid further confusion, he refused. This leaves me feeling bad about this hotel.  It's in a good location, it's clean and the food is Ok, but the bathrooms are tiny, the swimming pool is little larger than a jacuzzi. As for customer service, words fail me.  Avoid!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451968615~“Not recommended ”~During my stay between Thursday 29th December 2016 and Sunday 1st January 2017.  I was given room 1002 on the 10th floor on my arrival on Thursday and upon entry i noticed a damp smell. After some investigation i found it coming from the bathroom. At this time it was almost 2230 so i went to sleep. On waking after a very uncomfortable night due to the bed sagging in the middle and the joining zip of the two single beds being very uncomfy.  I noticed in the morning the smell was still there and looking more in to it i noticed broken fixture above the bathroom light switch. The soap holder in shower almost falling off. A dark mould substance around the edge of the shower. Messy finnish to the shower and a loose centre drain tile.  Also when u look through the shower towards the kitchen you can see rubbish that has fallen down the side of the kitchen which had not been cleaned in ages. After which i went to place the bedside light on to find it doesnt work and upon looking further i noticed one of the pin to wall connectors had broken. This was all mentioned in the morning to reception, who advised it be looked in to.  However upon my return from work later on, reception had no idea of any of my complaints made in the morning. Then again advised it be sorted.  Having made 2 personal face to face conplaints and 2 emails since to the hotel still no reply.  Two positives come however from your young concierge and housekeeping were very helpful with accessing elevator since my key always stopped and also with servicing the room and towls daily. Having stayed at Oaks Hotels accross Australia regularly with work, after my experience at Oaks on collins i would very much take second thoughts to returning or having my work colleagues stay as i know in the past they have had issues too.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
