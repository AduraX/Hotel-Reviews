review_463983742~“Comfort With A View”~My hubby and l often venture into the city for a weekend break. This time we chose Hilton Southwharf to stay at and we are so glad we did. Upon arriving we were greeted by Hilton staff members with a smile and welcoming attitude. Our check in was quick and hassle free as we had booked our river view room online the day prior. As an extra surprise we were offered a complimentry champagne whilst checking in which l thought was a nice touch by Hilton to make their guests feel special from the very beginning. When entering our river view room the bed instantly grabbed my attention and it looked like a big cloud that l wanted to run and jump on which l did and wow sooooo comfy. The room was spacious, clean and tidy and the bathroom was stylish with bath, large shower and separate toilet which l think is better. When opening the curtains the view was fantastic looking out onto the Yarra River and the busy riverbank through Southbank, so we just relaxed and watched the world go by for a while with river boats and helicopter joy rides. Lots to do surrounding Hilton Southwharf with DFO right next door and personally l believe it is the best DFO in Melbourne and only a 5-10 minute walk and your at Crown Casino passing an abundance of restaurants and cafes along the way. When returning from dinner we took advantage of that view and at night it's better and from 9pm-midnight on the hour everynight Crown has the "Fireballs" display from eight towers which from the Hilton is a great view. We have stayed at a lot of hotels within the same area and l must say Hilton wins overall there is no need to say anywhere else. We are looking forward to returning to Hilton Southwharf on our next visit. Happy holidays!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_478221134~“It's conviently located for convention centre usage too”~I chose to stay here because I needed the safety of getting to and from the convention centre for a business conference. This happened to be the closest.  The Hilton has a reputation of excellence worldwide, being five star and all.  The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the staff were polite and did the utmost to make me feel welcome as a guest. The food for the breakfast buffet was awesome too! A good feel and not TOO stuffy for a five star hotel. :) The convention centre is literally its neighbour!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

Big comfortable bed and the block out blinds were amazing! I want some of those at home! Rooms are quiet. Located in a great spot for a stroll along the south bank and a great choice of eateries. Also easy parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477626602~“MUST read because Hilton have outdone all. ”~My partner and I had a little "spice it up and get out of the house" weekend at the Hilton and we were both pleasantly surprised.  Firstly our stay was excellent value at only $270 for the night including two buffet breakfasts. As expected the place was exceptionally well kept and tidy. The staff were very forthcoming and courteous. The rooms were spacious, bathrooms beautiful and everything worked perfectly.  Ive stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels in Melbourne and Hilton was one of the few I wanted to write about. Sure it looks nice and they covered pretty much everything you would expect of a higher end hotel but it was the subtle differences that made our stay just completely perfect. It's very clear that the Hilton consider the entire customer experience quite meticulously and for this they definitely get two thumbs up from us.  Here are some of the minor details that while small, all contributed to complete satisfaction and a guarantee of my return business.  The elevator seemed to be operating at full steam providing almost no wait time during our entire stay. It was quick without making your stomach drop, the doors would close on ground floor and before you even realise they open at level 15.  Room service made some requested tweaks to our orders without any resistance.  Food was delivered about 5-10mins faster than they had advised over the phone. All 3 times they said half an hour eta but we were eating by about the 25th minute.  Cleaners were very non intrusive and for once respected our "do not disturb" sign.  The buffet breakfast was exceptional and extensive. I still have yet to eat at a buffet breakfast that can cook mushrooms well in bulk but they nailed everything else. Healthy DIY juicer, well cooked hot food, all the naughty dishes you can think of including baked goods, pancakes and waffles, a nice range of international dishes etc but the little detail I noticed was the croissants. They were by far the most legit croissants I have ever had at a buffet restaurant. Usually the baked goods of a buffet are catered style bulk products but these seemed like they were made at a French patisserie. They were light yet perfectly buttery, on the outside was a soft crunch shell while the inside was the softest tissue like texture. They were a big winner for me. I had to hit the gym for an hour afterwards because I knocked back 3 of them.  The complimentary products in the bathrooms were very "now" up to date skin and hair products that we would usually buy for ourselves.  The movie options were extensive The bed was ridiculously comfy to the point I had to ask which brand but am gutted because I forgot to check or ask on departure and I don't believe my bed at home will ever suffice again.  The pillows were like none I'd ever slept on before. The way they lay I assumed they wouldn't be that comfortable but wow I pretty much hugged them instead of my girl. They were great.  The glass was absolutely sound proof. So we're the walls.  Finally....my favourite little asset was the automatic absolute pitch dark black out sliding curtains. With one click of a button during the middle of the day my room would go 100% black like a dark room for photographers. Needless to say with a comfy bed and pillows, sound proof glass and walls AND those automatic black out curtains, I slept like a New born Demi-God! They are going on my Xmas wish list for sure. Best sleep ever. I think that's enough promotion because it's probably starting to sound like a paid advert. Seriously though, hands down best hotel in Melbourne for more reasons than just good old value. If you want somewhere to sleep and eat well in Melbourne. Hilton all the way. You will not regret it.  Enjoy guys.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477389566~“Comfy & welcoming”~I arrived at the Hilton after a long day of travel and I couldn't be more complimentary of the reception I received from Israel. He was friendly, courteous and very professional. I was upgraded to a King Deluxe room on the 11th level with city views - amazing at night. The room is spacious, well designed and comfy...they have the best pillows. I was travelling for work and it was a great nights' retreat. This is a great spot along the south bank...easy to walk along to the action and not far from the city. Great if you like a spot of bargain shopping. All round great stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477271641~“Easter Weekend ”~My daughter and I stayed here over Easter. Located close to Southern Cross Station, DFO and Southbank. Comfortable beds, lovely bathroom and fully equipped gym. Trouble free check in/out, friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477327556~“Location Location Location”~Great hotel situated alongside the River Yarra at Southpoint in Melbourne. Rooms were spacious and had floor to ceiling windows with a great view. The staff and amenities were excellent as you would expect with a Hilton. Food and service was top notch. The location made walking easy and there were heaps of nearby attractions, bars and restaurants plus heaps of bridges across the river into the city centre.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476764101~“Great view of the city”~The hotel is located next to DFO with restaurants nearby. It is well appointed and have very comfortable bed. Location wise it is about 10 to 15 minutes walk to the tram where you can catch to head deeper into the cbd (if you don't mind the walk then it is ok).  Parking is $24 per night at DFO with one exit and roughly $50 for valet parking with multiple exits. Need to request a parking voucher from the concierge.  We stayed in the King Deluxe City View room and it sure did have great views (Room 1504).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476623190~“Made a bad day into a great day”~After super stressful travel to arrive very late at night, and practically collapsing at the check-in desk with tiredness, the hotel staff offered me an upgraded room and late check out to "make my day a bit better"! The room was amazing, 18th floor King suite with views up and down the Yarra river, over the night lights of Melbourne. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was huge with a view. There was a full kitchen and washer-dryer in the suite - my one night stay couldn't use all these amenities, but it was impressive and very 5-star. Room service late at night was prompt and tasty and after a great sleep in the huge bed, I was able to awake very refreshed for my conference next morning. Late check out meant I could take a break from the conference, and come back and enjoy the day time views as well!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476321608~“Beautiful and Luxury”~This hotel is amazing and luxury. The staff are great, the location is heaven and the rooms were beautiful and luxury!

review_476273332~“Average ”~Sad to say I was a little let down by my recent stay at the Hilton. My partner and I stayed for 3 nights to relax and spend some time together over easter and university break. We are both uni students, so with the room rate at over $300 per night, this was a large expense for us. And staying at a "5 star" hotel, we expected a fantastic experience.  First, let me say the staff were great. All lovely and very helpful, no issues here.  However, the hotel seemed a little old and run down. Many scuff marks all down the hallways to our room. The toilet paper holder in our bathroom was loose from the wall, and our room door jammed on several occasions making it very difficult to close without being extremely noisy. Pillows seemed old and flat and not overly comfortable. View from our room was very nice however.  We knew this property did not have a pool, however the hotel could greatly benefit from having this kind of amenity. For a 3 day stay, we really missed having a pool or sauna to hang out at like we have done at other 5 star properties- makes the room rate seem quite steep when there is no pool or sauna etc included.  Overall a bit disappointed and would not be rushing back. Not quite the standar I had expected for a 5 star property.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476019384~“Great choice for Melbourne ”~This was our third stay here and the Hilton delivered as usual. Rooms are nice and clean and the view of the city and river from our room was nice.  Staff were super helpful. We are Hilton honours members and had done the online check in before we even arrived - nice and easy and great to be able to choose your room. When we arrived the room was ready too - well before the usual 3pm check in. Perfect. Love the location - close to docklands and next to the DFO mall. Perfect for us but it won't suit all. We had breakfast included in our rate and it was the usual great Hilton breakfast fare - from the usual hot choices to various types of muesli and pastries. And the staff were great - especially one young blonde woman who was responsible for seating people. She was incredibly helpful and clearly cared about her work and customers. We would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476004545~“Quick getaway ”~I love this hotel, beautiful beds the key to a good hotel! Great location for eating drinking and shopping. Room was a great size and well fitted out. Checkin and out was smooth, though we were not told the details of the executive lounge we had access too and when we called to find out was told by front desk - sorry figured you had stayed here before. Breakfast in the lounge was disappointing when we went down 45 min before it ended and with not much left told - we don't restock at this point apart from bacon and eggs - so no juice, few slices of white bread, no pastries - they only needed to go downstairs to the buffet.... maybe if the girls went downstairs to grab a few things instead of chatting in the kitchen area things would have been running more efficiently. When you pay to have access to the executive lounge it should at least be fairly well stocked for breakfast.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475992353~“Our family stay in the Hilton Melbourne”~Every detail of our stay at the Hilton Melbourne was 100 per cent. Top Hotel in an ideal location.

review_475658106~“Lacking class in practice ”~This hotel looks good, has pleasant staff but needs to make their guests feel more welcomed with the details.  To still charge for wifi in this day and age is just shabby money grabbing. Even a Quest will give it to you for free!  They offer services like pillow choices that they can't deliver on, and the breakfast buffet is just dull for a premium hotel.  Good location and service but management need to change their core attitude to guests.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475300064~“Excellent service”~I said in my previous 5* review in January 2016 that I would return and i did. The overall service remains 5* and Craig and his colleagues did a great job at ensuring that this level of service was delivered.  The location is excellent, the room spotlessly clean and the price reasonable. Above all, the Hilton has one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in! I will be rebooking again for late December 2017.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475226362~“Comfortable, good location, great staff”~I stay at a lot of Hiltons and this is a nice property. Great views from my window and a very comfortable room. Nice gym, restaurant and bar. Hotel is in the CBD a block off Flinders and it is a bit more quiet than some other areas which we appreciated. Most of the tourist attractions are walkable with the furthest, Melbourne Museum, about 45 minutes but you can also easily take the trams instead. Kudos and thanks to both the front desk team and the folks in the executive lounge for going out of their way to make our visit enjoyable. Will stay here again.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474908469~“Worst stay - spoiled our wedding anniversary ”~I booked the Hilton South Wharf so that we could spend our Anniversary in the city, go dining and shopping. Room was dirty, table was damaged, walls full of scuff marks, poor pillows on the bed and no fitted sheet.  We ordered pasta through for my 21 month son as he wasn't well and we had to end our dinner early. When the meal came, we were served Parmesan cheese in a cracked and chipped dish, it is not acceptable anywhere let alone a 5 star hotel, I was nervous for my son to eat the food if this was the standard room service would accept. We had to resort to giving him milk.  The only shining light in this hotel was Jennifer who looked after us at breakfast, she went beyond her call of duty to look after us. She gets 5 stars and the hotel, 2 pity it promised so much and left disappointed and sad our anniversary stay was spoiled by the low standards of this hotel.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474752819~“Great property ”~As a diamond member I was upgraded to the top floor 19, got a King Relaxation suite and it was awesome. I would recommend a even number room which will give you dramatic views of the Melbourne skyline. Check in was effortless, employees professional and courteous. I will definitely be back.

The hotel is in a great position, next to the DFO and a short stroll to Crown Casino. A wonderful place to stay.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474491012~“Is a good City hotel for our weekend in Melbourne City. Close to a wide range of Restuarants for us fussy eaters.”~Hilton on South Warf was the first time we have visited this luxury hotel. Has all the amenities you could desire. For our relaxing weekend away from home life, it was fantastic as close at hand a wide range of Restaurants & Cafe's to choose from. The hotel itself was perfect for a lovely buffet breakfast, room was good, staff were easy at hand to assist when required. As our booking was last minute we could only have a standard room which was disappointing in that there was no table & chairs to sit with a snack pre dinner/supper. Will stay again.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474484309~“Wedding guest”~The Hilton Melbourne South Wharf is a very impressive hotel. Amazing views, great location & great staff.  The downside to this property is the price, recently paying $280 AUD for an overnight stay as a part of a wedding group. Whilst I do believe you get what you pay for, I'm not sure there was anything exceptionally special about this hotel, besides for us, this is where the wedding party were staying & having breakfast the next day.  The breakfast booking was botched leaving 30+ guests unable to sit together as the bride had planned, as you can imagine she wasn't happy. The upside is that the staff upon checking in and out were excellent, the room was clean as expected, however the room number was broken off which I found odd for a hotel of this caliber.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474475400~“Excellent location for the meetings ”~As one of Hilton hotels, it has all the excellent service quality and rooms. We had a city view room in 10th floor which was great.

review_474407819~“Average”~Location of hotel is good, walking distance to lots of eateries and Crowne. Hotel check in took a while cos they cant find my membership record even though it was already given during reservations. Honestly all the Australian and European hotels need to learn from Asian, there are no free bottled water and not even for members. In Asian, all hotels I know of provide free bottled water and extra if you are members at times. Also there is no room slippers, how cheap are those only? The only thing that was provided free to me was internet, but when I logged in there was 2 price plans but check in staff never told me which plan am I entitled to use for free so in the end I just cannot be bothered. Most hotels have already rolled out free wifi to all guests already. Also when I checkout, I asked whether I am able to get a taxi and all I was told is there is a taxi rank outside. Took me a while to spot it, in some hotels, the concierge would have direct you or bring you there. Service here really needs improving.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_474384292~“Fabulous Weekend Spoil”~We stayed there for 3 nights for a special birthday girl weekend away. We got an upgrade to access to the Executive lounge for breakfast and evening canapé's and drinks. It has great views over the Yarra river and city which was absolutely lovely at night. It is a great chill out area and has computers and printers, tea and coffee and soft drinks for your convenience. Our interconnecting rooms had great views over the city, clean rooms, comfy beds and very quiet.....loved it.  The hotel is situated next to the DFO shopping, walking distance to the Casino, Convention Centre or a good 15 mins to city center. There is a tram station 2 mins walk away that will take you to the city center at Flinders Station. Great little cafes around the corner on the river with lots of variety to choose from. The staff were lovely and I must say that Rush who manages the Executive Lounge was such a lovely host making sure we were looked after and comfortable.  ****Definitely stay here again!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_473559856~“Our favourite in Melbourne”~There are many good hotels in Melbourne but this one has become my favourite. Right next door to DFO and the convention centre. It is also easy walking distance to southern cross rail station. Most of the staff is friendly and helpful, especially magic. The rooms were spacious and modern, and they have the best fluffy marshmallow beds. You just sink right in, like sleeping on clouds. Although we realised the next morning that one of the beds mattress was not in good condition and almost swallowed up my sister. I was sleeping on a cloud whist she was in quicksand..slowly sinking lower..and lower.. We informed magic that the bed was unacceptable and needs to be replaced before it swollows up another victim. Staff took the matter seriously and were able to move us to another room. Magic came and helped us and ensured everything was ok which we really appreciated. The next day we both slept on fluffy clouds..ahhhh.. Executive lounge was great with ample room and good wines, snacks. Card reader at the lounge door needs replacing as it is temperamental.  Check in was smooth and quick. We used express check out which was convenient although I never received my receipt. (Was able to get it from my HH account thankfully) Also, we had dinner at the restaurant one evening and although it was very late, the staff at the restaurant was still so nice, polite and cheerful. The food was wonderful too!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_473526955~“They make it so easy here”~Stayed overnight before an all day meeting. This hotel makes it all so easy. Check in is a breeze with complimentary water provided. A nice bar area to have a drink in the evening and then very easy to get into the city - we got last minute tickets to a show. The rooms are clean, well laid out and they have great pillows. There is a cafe with very good coffee if you don't feel like a huge breakfast. The only slight challenge is a lack of taxi's they can take ages to come to book ahead if you can, don't expect one to be waiting when you walk out.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_473175204~“Modern Lux with Great View of the City/Yarra River”~Two Suites for my family. An enjoyable and lovely stay with decent view. Unfortunately, we only had one night before heading off to Tasmania. Would definitely be back for another stay. One-Bedroom Suite facing the city which was amazing. Great view from morning to night; one could just sit in the living with a bottle enjoying the shadow changes with the sun strikes the buildings from different angles. Moreover the little kitchenette allows guests to host a group of 6-8 persons easily for a night of crazy boozing. That said, there is a separate restroom for hosting of groups and a shower+toilet attached to the bedroom. Huge walk-in wardrobe and a super comfortable king bed. Only issue is the triangular room. Two-Bedroom Suite faces the Docklands which is a tad disappointing since the afternoon sun is constantly shining into the living and dining. Upon entering the room one would have to walk down this corridor that separates the two bedrooms on either side; a twin bed and another with king, both rooms with attached shower. At the end of the corridor, large living and dining space to host guests and a view that is overlooking the Docklands. Though the room is more rectangular, it felt overall smaller than the One-Bedroom Suite. Had a wonderful time enjoy the bath and shower after a long red-eye flight. Lounge was great with champagne and wine from the Australian Yarra Region. Tea selection was great with nice cheese and salami. Variety could have been better but was sufficiently decent. Had breakfast at the Restaurant instead, which had a wide selection of items. Location is fairly decent. One can enjoy the long causal walk along the Yarra River to the city fridge and easily hop onto theTram within the Free Tram Zone. Alternatively, further down the river leads to the Casino and then the Botanic Gardens/Melbourne Park. Below the hotel building in the basement, there is outlet shopping! If you'd like to be in the city centre, there are other choices but I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here at Hilton South Wharf.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472516963~“A lovely night away”~Stayed overnight with my young daughter (first girls trip!) First impressions of the room were ok but not a wow factor.  But my opinion did improve - the bed was one of the comfiest I slept in, the black out blinds were great (no light what so ever) the bathroom was 5 star, and the complimentary plunger coffee was another big thumbs up.  I would definitely stay in again but I wouldn't pay the full price.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472299636~“Good stay good food but noisy night”~This was my second stay here and probably my last due to the impending change of brand forthcoming. I received an upgrade to a city view which is an absolutely stunning view and the room was clean and comfortable. The issue with my stay was loud banging, talking and noise in the hallway around 1pm on our first night. A quick look through the peep hole revealed that it was staff making the noise which I find to be unacceptable. We were placed directly across from a room that required staff access and can only assume that staff were using this room to gather and chat. The door was allowed to bang loudly and laughing/chatting could be heard in the hallway. A call to the front desk saw things quieten down relatively quickly. The next day we asked to change rooms and were accommodated but a bit disappointed that we did not receive any real explanation or apology.  Other than this we had a nice two-night stay. The executive lounge is comfortable and had a nice spread, even if Sydney offers far better. The breakfast down stairs is excellent and the service there is exceptional.  Overall, as a Hilton Diamond member I am sad to see this property leave the portfolio but look forward to staying at the well located DoubleTree in the CBD.~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_472255508~“Fantastic service”~The rooms are comfortable and the location is good but it is definitely the staff that makes this place worth staying at. They gave us early check in as we had a wedding to attend and also extended our check out the next morning til midday. And then when my friend was unwell they extended that check out further and never made us feel like we needed to rush out. As others have mentioned, the blackout blinds are great for a sleep in. Room service is prompt and reasonably priced compared to other hotels in Melbourne. I will be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_471797091~“Great location great sleep ”~Always love our stay here, great view of the city/Yarra or even the bay. Close to good bars, DFO and not far to crown. Love the extra mile they go to for special occasions. We enjoyed our stay once again. Oh best thing about the hotel are the black out blinds. You will think it's the middle of the night when the sun has actually been up for hours.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471740563~“A romantic night away”~This place is certainly 5 star quality- prompt and friendly, nice and modern decor, very very clean, lovely views from our bedroom window, big and spacious bathroom, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in- it was like sleeping on a cloud! Is definitely worth it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470486513~“Sad Farewell to a Favourite Hotel”~Hilton SW is my favourite Hilton property to stay at in Australia. Nothing else compares to the style, comfort or hospitality that I have experienced when staying with Craig and his wonderful team over the years. My last stay there was nothing short of spectacular. As a Diamond Member I was upgraded to a King Yarra Suite with stunnings views and more space than I could ever need. The staff were amazing, as always. I am sad to learn that Hilton SW has been sold and will rebrand as a Pan Pacific Property in May this year. While I probably won't be making another trip to Melbourne before this happens, I'm happy to know that my last visit was the best yet. I sincerely hope that Hilton opens a new property in Melbourne very soon; until then I will need to find a new home. A big thank you to Craig and the team for a brilliant time!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470194825~“Great Location”~We had a wedding next door so it was well positioned. Check in was swift, service by all staff was great. Advice from Concierge was good, but check with Tripadviser.  Our room faced the Yarra and was really comfortable. Well designed and a pleasure to stay there. Also its next door to the DFO, so thats fun. Good hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_470207259~“Best Hilton”~Never tire of visiting Hilton South Wharf. Great location, excellent customer service and a really nice place overall.

review_469813656~“Great location, excellent staff”~Stayed for three nights in February as part of our trip to Australia and New Zealand and had an excellent time. I booked via the hotels web site, choosing a room that had a view over the Yarra river.  Check in was very quick and efficient the staff member was very professional and polite and we soon in our room, the room was spotless on arrival and kept so throughout our stay and the bed very comfortable.  Breakfast was served in the restaurant on the ground floor and had a large range of well prepared food items catering for both western and Asian diets.  The hotel is situated in a superb location along the banks of the Yarra river allowing for pleasant riverside walks and easy access to the free city tram service, which was a 7-8 mins walk away over the nearby bridge. Overall a great stay, the staff were excellent providing really helpful hints and tips on what to see and how to get to places of interest in the city. Should we return to Melbourne we would certainly stay here again and would happily recommend this hotel to both family and friends.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_469261681~“My home away from home when I am in Melbourne”~I only stay at the Hilton group for 30 years and there is no second best for me. The staff knows you as soon as you walk in. I was actually there on the opening on invitation by Michael used to be the GM in the Wharf. Christian and the group in the lounge is just amazing. Also the lovely lady from reservation Nadia I met her in person. This staff are trained properly that is the result of best customer service. The housekeeping I think needs to to be retrained or just too in a hurry they forget few items on daily basis. I arrived no face washers and no water in the room. for 3 days I have to ask them daily, shower cap etc. The room was so dusty. This is not the normal standard of Hilton I am sure the housekeeping needs attention to detail as a 5 star hotel that I love.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_469238390~“Modern, FANTASTIC location, and great view(s)!”~Very up-to-date hotel (as of 2017, March), with nice ambiance, great views (especially when facing both downtown and Yarra river. Easy access to the convention center for business, and trams for the City Circle. The room we had was spacious - with desk, king bed, HUGE bathroom with huge walk-in shower, tub, separately-enclosed toilet area, and lots of storage. Outstanding motorized shade to cover the window for total-darkness even during the day. WONDERFUL!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469009629~“Wonderful Stay at Hilton South Wharf”~We recently stayed at the Hilton South Wharf for 3 nights and were extremely impressed with the level of customer service from all the staff at this hotel. It made our visit to Melbourne more enjoyable, from the full breakfast through to dinner and late night drinks before bed. The location of the hotel is ideal if you are visiting to attend a conference next door at the MCEC (Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre) or on a family shopping spree with the DFO (Discount Factory Outlet stores) located around the corner. It is only a short walk to the many fine restaurants and entertainment venues including the Crown Casino. The true measure of the hotel is how visitors are treated and I can't say enough about the staff except to thank them all for making our stay such a great experience!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_468410914~“Best executive lounge”~The executive lounge is very large, comfortable, and has great views. Rooms are modern and well done. Great place to explore Melbourne from. The free city tram is one block away. And a large number of restaurants nearby.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468390161~“Great location! Good experience!”~The room was brilliant! Had everything we needed, 10/10 bed comfort, beautiful view, clean!

review_468199660~“How a Hilton should be!”~Stayed for three nights at the South Wharf Hilton and from start to finish it was a seamless experience. The hotel itself is close enough to the CBD, but far enough away to get a decent sleep (if you sleep in though, one of the many helicopter pads along the river is directly opposite but the glass does a decent job blocking the sound). We were proactively greeted by the bellboys and concierge who took care of our bags. Check-in was straightforward - we took care of this through the Hilton Honors app and simply needed to collect our room keys on arrival. We headed to our corner room on the 13th floor facing the city, and the view was impressive. The room itself was of decent size, bed was excellent and the bathroom with separate shower and bath were a nice touch. The iron worked without a problem, and the TV had a good selection of channels. I would specifically comment that the floor to ceiling blinds blacked out every bit of light coming in so it was the best nights of sleep we had while in Australia! As Hilton Honors Gold members we also appreciated the Executive Lounge offering which was substantial compared with other properties we have stayed in - we took advantage of the gratis continental breakfast, and the evening wine and canapé session was a great way to start our evening before heading out on the town. If you aren't already a member it's worth signing up as even the entry level gives you free wi-fi. Speaking of which, the internet access was seamlessly fast and the safe passed the Macbook/Laptop test with ease. Always good to know a hotel meets the requirements of the modern traveller! Overall I have given this hotel an Excellent rating as the hard and soft products were exactly that. It may be a bit more pricey than other hotels in the area but we will return when we are back in the city - it is more than worth the premium.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_468190022~“Well presented and impressive hotel”~My wife and I were immensely impressed with the hotel, management & staff from the time of arrival to departure.

review_467980348~“Amazing Hilton South Wharf”~This is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Everything about the Hilton is amazing. The location, the staff, the rooms, the views, the service throughout, the food/breakfast, bar. We do not have a single complaint. Excellent value for money. We will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Melbourne and wanting that something really special. The DFO at the doorstep is the icing on the cake to any lady that likes to shop. A short walk to the Crown and free city circle tram. Absolutely amazing hotel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467715344~“Amazing”~While this hotel may be a bit more pricey than most, it is definitely worth the extra money. The hotel rooms are amazing & the bed is extremely comfy. There's also great room service & a great restaurant. The staff were all wonderful & happy to help with anything at all, even if it wasnt regarding the hotel itself.  If you're looking for somewhere in the city area, I definitely reccomned you stay here.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467474420~“Very personalised”~This hotel certainly lives up to expectations and more. We stayed during a long weekend, so it was particularly busy but the hotel was still highly efficient with its level of service.  Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted and asked if we needed any help with our luggage. Despite being somewhat busy for a high-end hotel, we were served promptly and with the level of formality and politeness expected. The room was of high quality with a large toilet and beautiful views of the river and city freeway below us. The view really puts you in perspective of where you truly are, which is a huge plus for a city hotel. There is nothing worse than a hotel that makes you feel like you're just in a generic concrete jungle. What was truly amazing was the blinds, which 99.99% shuts out the sun. With the curtains down, you won't be able to tell if it's day or night even with the lights off.  We were extremely impressed with the service. From the in-room dining staff to the concierge. The level of service was above expectation and mine are usually quite high for a 5 star hotel. We called room service on quite a few occasions and every one of those occasions, we were brought up what we needed in 10 minutes. No request was denied. Staff went above and beyond to meet requests.  Hilton South Wharf is undoubtedly one of the best in Australia for service and luxury. It represents great value for money and suits any need, business, or leisure. There's no other place I'd stay at in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467451558~“A central venue”~If you want to be near DFO and awesome venues to eat this is the hotel for you. Breakfast is exceptional and well priced - ask for pre paid, its cheaper. The rooms are great no matter which type or level you choose. The staff are always friendly and always have my special requests prepared. Parking is 2 fold- valet $50 per night ouch and 24$ self park opposite. Not the most easiest hotels to get to but worth the trip.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467436668~“Book a room with a city view.”~You'll get a different view of Melbourne way day this end of the city, but it's worth the trek for the fabulous shopping, great cafes and restaurants and easy walk or transport to whatever you need during your stay in Melbourne. Whatever you do, book a room with a city view as you'll never tire of looking out of the window.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467274625~“Difficult to get twin beds on excecutive floor”~A very nice hotel with a nice excecutive lounge with a big balcony, but why is it almost impossible at most Hilton Hotels to get twin beds on the excecutive floors. The only place that have managed to get them is at the Hilton at Copenhagen Airport and the Hilton in Kuala Lupur. We had a nice dinner in the restaurant. My wife had mussels and I oysters an then for main course lamb shanks. The food was really tasty.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467244381~“Nice but expensive hotel”~Best hotel in Melbourne. Very clean, comfortable bed. Staff are friendly and efficient. It is within walking distance from the Sky Bus station (10 minutes without luggage). I wouldn't go anywhere in Melbourne.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467449364~“The Hilton Ruined our Wedding”~I am appalled by the service received by the Hilton Sth Wharf. On arrival to our suite we found that our luggage was placed in another room by error. When booking the accommodation we were specific to state 3 female adults only to find only 1 KS bed available in our room. When we reported this to reception they offered us additional blankets and towels for someone to take the couch Then we receive complimentary bottle of Champaign congratulating Mr & Mrs McGurgan. How could you get this SO WRONG. Its Ms McGuigan and I was marrying Mr Dunstan the next day. We went back down to reception to complain about the air con. We were told it takes 20mins for the thermostat to kick in. This continued throughout the stay with only excuses and no service. Sadly the day of getting ready for the wedding the temperature in our room was reading 28 degrees and our makeup was melting off our faces. We were told by reception they would finally get maintenance to come up and look at it. They never did show and we had to get dressed in the hallway. I cried from frustration. Sunday after the wedding I get a call from someone asking for extra money for the honey moon suite which we had on the night of the 11th March. She said we booked in. This was definitely not the case, we never returned. We cancelled this room a week prior in writing. I am not happy I am actually disgusted in the service or lack of.~1~1~4~1~1~4~1~nan
review_467094370~“Overlooking the Yarra river traffic, winding through Melbourne.”~I've stayed here a few times to rest in a comfy room between Melbourne appointments. Joining the honors program has only made it better. It's great to be able to catch up on emails from a desk with a view, enjoy a hot bath and a good night's sleep. From check in to check out the staff have been friendly and professional, including service in the 4th floor lounge. Shops, restaurants, bars, the Convention Centre and Casino are nearby but It's a bit of a walk into the city. Not that I mind, as it's a grand stroll along the riverbank to spend a day downtown.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467127368~“Long Stay in Melbourne”~The Hilton South Wharf is located in a very nice area and is in walking distance of a lot of things. The hotel lobby is very nice but the rooms seem a little dated. The front desk staff was very helpful but the room cleaning staff was mediocre at best. It is a very expensive place to stay.~3~2~4~3~3~2~4~nan
review_467128919~“Weekend Getaway”~Great location for shopping, access to Melbourne City and sporting/entertainment facilities - we chose to stay here for the Justin Bieber concert as it is easy to get to Docklands from here. Plenty to do and see, Executive Lounge was okay, think the normal buffet is better value for money - overall a fantastic weekend and my daughter and I plan to return every year and stay at Hilton South Wharf, we love the rooms 9in particular the size of the bathrooms) and the beds are amazing... like sleeping on a cloud~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_466203089~“Very disappointed”~Overpriced room, for the poor quality. The room and fittings was worn out and beaten around. Only positive was that it wasn't booked for a special occasion, just a business stay. Won't be recommending this again. Booked a number of colleagues into this hotel for a stay during a convention. Very poor for the cost of the rooms. Cleaning standards are terrible - entry foyer was obviously cleaned with a dirty rag, curtains off the rails during the stay, worn out furniture and carpets. When I pointed out my dissatisfaction to the staff I was greeted with mild interest only and a wish for a better time next time. Special hint - there won't be a next time. That stay is now classified as a last time.~3~2~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan

This year my boyfriend and I stayed in this King Bed Relaxation Suite, the views were stunning and love how spacious the bathroom is! The bed was so soft, we felt like we were sleeping in the clouds! Staffs were friendly, attentive and very professional! And I really enjoy the executive lounge experience, it was divine! I would recommend anyone to pay extra to get access to the executive lounge, totally worth the money!  Thanks to the wonderful receptionist for arranging complimentary birthday dessert! Really appreciate that :)~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464965077~“Few small improvements but overall decent hotel”~I stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights from 28 Feb to 3 March.  Due to a delayed flight from Perth I arrived at the hotel at almost 1am. The young girl at the front desk was really lovely and accommodating. I was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite on the top floor which was lovely.  The room was lovely and spacious with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Lovely view across to Port Phillip Bay.  Decor was lovely however I'd say in a few years it will be due for an update...carpet was very worn and several marks on walls. Minor gripes though. The kitchenette area had everything you could need for a few days and mini bar waa fully stocked. They've thought of everything you might need over a stay.  Bathrooms lovely, modern and clean. Another small gripe...the sink is tiny and the shelf above it just out over the sink...watch your head when brushing your teeth! I did however step on 2 shards of glass in the bathroom which cut my foot and hand (minor cuts) so would recommend that the staff vacuum rooms and bathrooms thoroughly! Staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. I rang downstairs for room service each night and was always greeted by a friendly polite voice on the other end. All my meals (caeser salad, fish and salad, butter chicken for dinners, eggs toast fruit muesli yoghurt and bacon for breakfasts) was lovely, large portions and delivered on time. On one occasion I received a call from downstairs to say my meal would be 5 minutes late.  Side note: I was staying at the hotel with a number of my colleagues (I would say the hotel would have been at capacity due to a number of conferences, including ours, happening at the convention center below) had numerous issues with room service not arriving / orders being wrong, so maybe I was lucky here! Room was serviced daily. Mini bar always re srocked.  Great location and just a short walk to the main city centre. Convenience store located downstairs at the DFO and plenty of shopping and dining options nearby on South Wharf.  All in all a good stay, would recommend especially if you are attending a conference. If you are after the hustle and bustle of the city / want to be a bit closer to the centre / have small children Id suggest looking for accommodation in the main Centre of the CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464421126~“2 BEDROOMS SUITES / APARTMENTS ARE EXCELLENT”~Stayed for 4 nights recently and enjoyed it. Basically there suites / apartments have 2 double bedrooms with 2 bathrooms plus dining & sitting rooms so it is very comfortable for 2 persons ( or even 2 couples ).

review_464417254~“Mixed bag”~We are currently staying at this hotel, and had booked for two nights. We are regulars with the chain and maintain "diamond" level membership with them. This is the first time we have stayed at this particular property. When in Melbourne we usually stay at the Crown but thought we would give this a go and get a different kind of view from another part of the river.  It's been a mixed bag. Upon check in we were met by Josh. He was the "Duty Manager". After standing in line for about ten minutes he barely lifted his head to call us over. Pretty simply he was quite abrupt, and indicated our room wasn't ready but offered no advice as to what we might do in the meantime, or indicated that the hotel would call us to advise our room was ready - we had to ask. Might sound minor but his "welcome" or lack thereof was not something I have experienced before at a Hilton. I would describe his overall demeanour as cold and distracted.  We checked into the relaxation suite and the view from the room did not disappoint, nor did the size. As expected we have plenty of space and the room itself is well appointed and maintained. The products etc are all of a high standard. A word of warning - when the sun hits the windows the heat radiates off the glass like it's an oven. Even with the air conditioning on the lowest setting the room was nowhere near as cool as what we would like - I think this is further exacerbated by the fact that the sensor for the room temp is on the wall directly infront of an Air con vent so the system thinks the room is cooler than it is.  We had breakfast downstairs at dock37 and were really impressed - the variety was great and the service was very good. We opted for the hot breakfast there vs the continental breakfast in the executive lounge.  The executive lounge is huge - it does feel a little "conference centre like" and could do with a make over I think. Some more comfortable couch like chairs would be a good start. Food and drink options for canapé service was top notch.  Overall we would visit this property again, but it wouldn't be our first choice in Melbourne for luxury, maybe for a business visit.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464413423~“Very convenient to International Convention Centre”~I stayed for 2 nights while attending a conference at the adjacent ICC. It is very convenient for that purpose but you can probably do better if that is not your situation, given the high room rate. The hotel is reasonably new and quite well appointed. The front desk staff were friendly, professional and efficient. The toiletries were high quality but there were a few amenities missing eg vanity set (cotton buds, cotton pads etc) and slippers. Also, the bathrobes had seen much better days...very ragged and most unappealing! Why do so few hotels have power points next to bed side tables? Overall, a good option if you are attending a conference at the ICC. Otherwise, you can do better elsewhere. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464357025~“Great experience in well located lovely hotel”~We travelled to Melbourne with some friends from the UK and booked a suite. The view over the Yarra and the city was awesome.

review_463753121~“Great location, great hotel!”~I stayed here for two nights during a business trip to Melbourne. The Hilton is located very well for both the business centre and the main city and only a 10 minute taxi drive to Southern Cross railway station where the Airport Skybus Terminus is located.  The rooms are well appointed, very quiet and comfortable. I ate at the in house Italian restaurant and had room service on one evening....all was excellent in terms of quality and menu options. Breakfast was also really good and includes a coffee upgrade which is necessary as the standard filter coffee was cold and bitter! This however was the only sour note in an otherwise excellent facility.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_463983742~“Comfort With A View”~My hubby and l often venture into the city for a weekend break. This time we chose Hilton Southwharf to stay at and we are so glad we did. Upon arriving we were greeted by Hilton staff members with a smile and welcoming attitude. Our check in was quick and hassle free as we had booked our river view room online the day prior. As an extra surprise we were offered a complimentry champagne whilst checking in which l thought was a nice touch by Hilton to make their guests feel special from the very beginning. When entering our river view room the bed instantly grabbed my attention and it looked like a big cloud that l wanted to run and jump on which l did and wow sooooo comfy. The room was spacious, clean and tidy and the bathroom was stylish with bath, large shower and separate toilet which l think is better. When opening the curtains the view was fantastic looking out onto the Yarra River and the busy riverbank through Southbank, so we just relaxed and watched the world go by for a while with river boats and helicopter joy rides. Lots to do surrounding Hilton Southwharf with DFO right next door and personally l believe it is the best DFO in Melbourne and only a 5-10 minute walk and your at Crown Casino passing an abundance of restaurants and cafes along the way. When returning from dinner we took advantage of that view and at night it's better and from 9pm-midnight on the hour everynight Crown has the "Fireballs" display from eight towers which from the Hilton is a great view. We have stayed at a lot of hotels within the same area and l must say Hilton wins overall there is no need to say anywhere else. We are looking forward to returning to Hilton Southwharf on our next visit. Happy holidays!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_479048162~“Don't bother with executive suites”~We decided to book an upgraded room with access to the executive lounge but it really was not worth it. Our room was as small as any other hotel room and the executive lounge was very disappointing. For afternoon tea they served, what appeared to be some sort of scone with jam and cream, and some rather stale almond biscuits. The pre dinner canapes were no better; party pies, a few little cold tartlets and something fried. We decided not to bother going to the restaurant because if that was the standard of food on offer we would rather go to Subway. Not a quality experience.~4~nan~3~3~3~4~3~nan
review_478745201~“Thankyou for amazing service ”~I stayed at the hotel for a night last week to attend a black tie function nearby. We thought the hotel was great (loved the bathrooms, great view) and fantastic value. But I wanted to leave this review to say thank you to the fantastic staff who went above and beyond to resolve a problem for me. After attending the function I left a pouch of diamond jewellery and watches in the safe. I realised after landing back in Sydney the following day and called them in a complete panic. Not only was the jewellery there, they were extremely professional in how they dealt with it and organised for it to be returned to me. Thank-you to Adi in particular for being so fabulous; I'm extremely grateful to you and Hilton for all your help.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478670904~“First class location, luxury, service”~Stayed 4 nights, superb room with really decent desk and work chair plus proper work lighting making it easy to work in the room. Floor to ceiling windows with view over Yarra River. Fabulous bed - of particular note was its height which meant it was super easy to get in and out of with a slightly dodgy back. Very luxurious bathroom with separate (full size) bath and shower and toilet. Helpful reception staff, walk straight through to the Convention Centre from first floor which is brilliant and avoids getting caught in the rain.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_478221134~“It's conviently located for convention centre usage too”~I chose to stay here because I needed the safety of getting to and from the convention centre for a business conference. This happened to be the closest.  The Hilton has a reputation of excellence worldwide, being five star and all.  The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the staff were polite and did the utmost to make me feel welcome as a guest. The food for the breakfast buffet was awesome too! A good feel and not TOO stuffy for a five star hotel. :) The convention centre is literally its neighbour!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

Big comfortable bed and the block out blinds were amazing! I want some of those at home! Rooms are quiet. Located in a great spot for a stroll along the south bank and a great choice of eateries. Also easy parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477626602~“MUST read because Hilton have outdone all. ”~My partner and I had a little "spice it up and get out of the house" weekend at the Hilton and we were both pleasantly surprised.  Firstly our stay was excellent value at only $270 for the night including two buffet breakfasts. As expected the place was exceptionally well kept and tidy. The staff were very forthcoming and courteous. The rooms were spacious, bathrooms beautiful and everything worked perfectly.  Ive stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels in Melbourne and Hilton was one of the few I wanted to write about. Sure it looks nice and they covered pretty much everything you would expect of a higher end hotel but it was the subtle differences that made our stay just completely perfect. It's very clear that the Hilton consider the entire customer experience quite meticulously and for this they definitely get two thumbs up from us.  Here are some of the minor details that while small, all contributed to complete satisfaction and a guarantee of my return business.  The elevator seemed to be operating at full steam providing almost no wait time during our entire stay. It was quick without making your stomach drop, the doors would close on ground floor and before you even realise they open at level 15.  Room service made some requested tweaks to our orders without any resistance.  Food was delivered about 5-10mins faster than they had advised over the phone. All 3 times they said half an hour eta but we were eating by about the 25th minute.  Cleaners were very non intrusive and for once respected our "do not disturb" sign.  The buffet breakfast was exceptional and extensive. I still have yet to eat at a buffet breakfast that can cook mushrooms well in bulk but they nailed everything else. Healthy DIY juicer, well cooked hot food, all the naughty dishes you can think of including baked goods, pancakes and waffles, a nice range of international dishes etc but the little detail I noticed was the croissants. They were by far the most legit croissants I have ever had at a buffet restaurant. Usually the baked goods of a buffet are catered style bulk products but these seemed like they were made at a French patisserie. They were light yet perfectly buttery, on the outside was a soft crunch shell while the inside was the softest tissue like texture. They were a big winner for me. I had to hit the gym for an hour afterwards because I knocked back 3 of them.  The complimentary products in the bathrooms were very "now" up to date skin and hair products that we would usually buy for ourselves.  The movie options were extensive The bed was ridiculously comfy to the point I had to ask which brand but am gutted because I forgot to check or ask on departure and I don't believe my bed at home will ever suffice again.  The pillows were like none I'd ever slept on before. The way they lay I assumed they wouldn't be that comfortable but wow I pretty much hugged them instead of my girl. They were great.  The glass was absolutely sound proof. So we're the walls.  Finally....my favourite little asset was the automatic absolute pitch dark black out sliding curtains. With one click of a button during the middle of the day my room would go 100% black like a dark room for photographers. Needless to say with a comfy bed and pillows, sound proof glass and walls AND those automatic black out curtains, I slept like a New born Demi-God! They are going on my Xmas wish list for sure. Best sleep ever. I think that's enough promotion because it's probably starting to sound like a paid advert. Seriously though, hands down best hotel in Melbourne for more reasons than just good old value. If you want somewhere to sleep and eat well in Melbourne. Hilton all the way. You will not regret it.  Enjoy guys.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477389566~“Comfy & welcoming”~I arrived at the Hilton after a long day of travel and I couldn't be more complimentary of the reception I received from Israel. He was friendly, courteous and very professional. I was upgraded to a King Deluxe room on the 11th level with city views - amazing at night. The room is spacious, well designed and comfy...they have the best pillows. I was travelling for work and it was a great nights' retreat. This is a great spot along the south bank...easy to walk along to the action and not far from the city. Great if you like a spot of bargain shopping. All round great stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477271641~“Easter Weekend ”~My daughter and I stayed here over Easter. Located close to Southern Cross Station, DFO and Southbank. Comfortable beds, lovely bathroom and fully equipped gym. Trouble free check in/out, friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477327556~“Location Location Location”~Great hotel situated alongside the River Yarra at Southpoint in Melbourne. Rooms were spacious and had floor to ceiling windows with a great view. The staff and amenities were excellent as you would expect with a Hilton. Food and service was top notch. The location made walking easy and there were heaps of nearby attractions, bars and restaurants plus heaps of bridges across the river into the city centre.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476764101~“Great view of the city”~The hotel is located next to DFO with restaurants nearby. It is well appointed and have very comfortable bed. Location wise it is about 10 to 15 minutes walk to the tram where you can catch to head deeper into the cbd (if you don't mind the walk then it is ok).  Parking is $24 per night at DFO with one exit and roughly $50 for valet parking with multiple exits. Need to request a parking voucher from the concierge.  We stayed in the King Deluxe City View room and it sure did have great views (Room 1504).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476623190~“Made a bad day into a great day”~After super stressful travel to arrive very late at night, and practically collapsing at the check-in desk with tiredness, the hotel staff offered me an upgraded room and late check out to "make my day a bit better"! The room was amazing, 18th floor King suite with views up and down the Yarra river, over the night lights of Melbourne. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was huge with a view. There was a full kitchen and washer-dryer in the suite - my one night stay couldn't use all these amenities, but it was impressive and very 5-star. Room service late at night was prompt and tasty and after a great sleep in the huge bed, I was able to awake very refreshed for my conference next morning. Late check out meant I could take a break from the conference, and come back and enjoy the day time views as well!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476321608~“Beautiful and Luxury”~This hotel is amazing and luxury. The staff are great, the location is heaven and the rooms were beautiful and luxury!

review_476273332~“Average ”~Sad to say I was a little let down by my recent stay at the Hilton. My partner and I stayed for 3 nights to relax and spend some time together over easter and university break. We are both uni students, so with the room rate at over $300 per night, this was a large expense for us. And staying at a "5 star" hotel, we expected a fantastic experience.  First, let me say the staff were great. All lovely and very helpful, no issues here.  However, the hotel seemed a little old and run down. Many scuff marks all down the hallways to our room. The toilet paper holder in our bathroom was loose from the wall, and our room door jammed on several occasions making it very difficult to close without being extremely noisy. Pillows seemed old and flat and not overly comfortable. View from our room was very nice however.  We knew this property did not have a pool, however the hotel could greatly benefit from having this kind of amenity. For a 3 day stay, we really missed having a pool or sauna to hang out at like we have done at other 5 star properties- makes the room rate seem quite steep when there is no pool or sauna etc included.  Overall a bit disappointed and would not be rushing back. Not quite the standar I had expected for a 5 star property.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476019384~“Great choice for Melbourne ”~This was our third stay here and the Hilton delivered as usual. Rooms are nice and clean and the view of the city and river from our room was nice.  Staff were super helpful. We are Hilton honours members and had done the online check in before we even arrived - nice and easy and great to be able to choose your room. When we arrived the room was ready too - well before the usual 3pm check in. Perfect. Love the location - close to docklands and next to the DFO mall. Perfect for us but it won't suit all. We had breakfast included in our rate and it was the usual great Hilton breakfast fare - from the usual hot choices to various types of muesli and pastries. And the staff were great - especially one young blonde woman who was responsible for seating people. She was incredibly helpful and clearly cared about her work and customers. We would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476004545~“Quick getaway ”~I love this hotel, beautiful beds the key to a good hotel! Great location for eating drinking and shopping. Room was a great size and well fitted out. Checkin and out was smooth, though we were not told the details of the executive lounge we had access too and when we called to find out was told by front desk - sorry figured you had stayed here before. Breakfast in the lounge was disappointing when we went down 45 min before it ended and with not much left told - we don't restock at this point apart from bacon and eggs - so no juice, few slices of white bread, no pastries - they only needed to go downstairs to the buffet.... maybe if the girls went downstairs to grab a few things instead of chatting in the kitchen area things would have been running more efficiently. When you pay to have access to the executive lounge it should at least be fairly well stocked for breakfast.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475992353~“Our family stay in the Hilton Melbourne”~Every detail of our stay at the Hilton Melbourne was 100 per cent. Top Hotel in an ideal location. We have 12 year old daughter and sixteen year old son. This is the perfect family hotel . Everything was above our expectations.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475658106~“Lacking class in practice ”~This hotel looks good, has pleasant staff but needs to make their guests feel more welcomed with the details.  To still charge for wifi in this day and age is just shabby money grabbing. Even a Quest will give it to you for free!  They offer services like pillow choices that they can't deliver on, and the breakfast buffet is just dull for a premium hotel.  Good location and service but management need to change their core attitude to guests.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475300064~“Excellent service”~I said in my previous 5* review in January 2016 that I would return and i did. The overall service remains 5* and Craig and his colleagues did a great job at ensuring that this level of service was delivered.  The location is excellent, the room spotlessly clean and the price reasonable. Above all, the Hilton has one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in! I will be rebooking again for late December 2017.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475226362~“Comfortable, good location, great staff”~I stay at a lot of Hiltons and this is a nice property. Great views from my window and a very comfortable room. Nice gym, restaurant and bar. Hotel is in the CBD a block off Flinders and it is a bit more quiet than some other areas which we appreciated. Most of the tourist attractions are walkable with the furthest, Melbourne Museum, about 45 minutes but you can also easily take the trams instead. Kudos and thanks to both the front desk team and the folks in the executive lounge for going out of their way to make our visit enjoyable. Will stay here again.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474908469~“Worst stay - spoiled our wedding anniversary ”~I booked the Hilton South Wharf so that we could spend our Anniversary in the city, go dining and shopping. Room was dirty, table was damaged, walls full of scuff marks, poor pillows on the bed and no fitted sheet.  We ordered pasta through for my 21 month son as he wasn't well and we had to end our dinner early. When the meal came, we were served Parmesan cheese in a cracked and chipped dish, it is not acceptable anywhere let alone a 5 star hotel, I was nervous for my son to eat the food if this was the standard room service would accept. We had to resort to giving him milk.  The only shining light in this hotel was Jennifer who looked after us at breakfast, she went beyond her call of duty to look after us. She gets 5 stars and the hotel, 2 pity it promised so much and left disappointed and sad our anniversary stay was spoiled by the low standards of this hotel.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474752819~“Great property ”~As a diamond member I was upgraded to the top floor 19, got a King Relaxation suite and it was awesome. I would recommend a even number room which will give you dramatic views of the Melbourne skyline. Check in was effortless, employees professional and courteous. I will definitely be back. Great location to the Crown center with endless dining selections and a great walk along the Yarra river.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Not what we expected when we had booked a double room. Anyway, the beds and pillows were so so comfortable and had a beautiful nights sleep. The hotel is in a great position, next to the DFO and a short stroll to Crown Casino. A wonderful place to stay.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474491012~“Is a good City hotel for our weekend in Melbourne City. Close to a wide range of Restuarants for us fussy eaters.”~Hilton on South Warf was the first time we have visited this luxury hotel. Has all the amenities you could desire. For our relaxing weekend away from home life, it was fantastic as close at hand a wide range of Restaurants & Cafe's to choose from. The hotel itself was perfect for a lovely buffet breakfast, room was good, staff were easy at hand to assist when required. As our booking was last minute we could only have a standard room which was disappointing in that there was no table & chairs to sit with a snack pre dinner/supper. Will stay again.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474484309~“Wedding guest”~The Hilton Melbourne South Wharf is a very impressive hotel. Amazing views, great location & great staff.  The downside to this property is the price, recently paying $280 AUD for an overnight stay as a part of a wedding group. Whilst I do believe you get what you pay for, I'm not sure there was anything exceptionally special about this hotel, besides for us, this is where the wedding party were staying & having breakfast the next day.  The breakfast booking was botched leaving 30+ guests unable to sit together as the bride had planned, as you can imagine she wasn't happy. The upside is that the staff upon checking in and out were excellent, the room was clean as expected, however the room number was broken off which I found odd for a hotel of this caliber.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474475400~“Excellent location for the meetings ”~As one of Hilton hotels, it has all the excellent service quality and rooms. We had a city view room in 10th floor which was great.

review_474407819~“Average”~Location of hotel is good, walking distance to lots of eateries and Crowne. Hotel check in took a while cos they cant find my membership record even though it was already given during reservations. Honestly all the Australian and European hotels need to learn from Asian, there are no free bottled water and not even for members. In Asian, all hotels I know of provide free bottled water and extra if you are members at times. Also there is no room slippers, how cheap are those only? The only thing that was provided free to me was internet, but when I logged in there was 2 price plans but check in staff never told me which plan am I entitled to use for free so in the end I just cannot be bothered. Most hotels have already rolled out free wifi to all guests already. Also when I checkout, I asked whether I am able to get a taxi and all I was told is there is a taxi rank outside. Took me a while to spot it, in some hotels, the concierge would have direct you or bring you there. Service here really needs improving.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_474384292~“Fabulous Weekend Spoil”~We stayed there for 3 nights for a special birthday girl weekend away. We got an upgrade to access to the Executive lounge for breakfast and evening canapé's and drinks. It has great views over the Yarra river and city which was absolutely lovely at night. It is a great chill out area and has computers and printers, tea and coffee and soft drinks for your convenience. Our interconnecting rooms had great views over the city, clean rooms, comfy beds and very quiet.....loved it.  The hotel is situated next to the DFO shopping, walking distance to the Casino, Convention Centre or a good 15 mins to city center. There is a tram station 2 mins walk away that will take you to the city center at Flinders Station. Great little cafes around the corner on the river with lots of variety to choose from. The staff were lovely and I must say that Rush who manages the Executive Lounge was such a lovely host making sure we were looked after and comfortable.  ****Definitely stay here again!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan

I think it's time for a revamp here and there, a little paint would do wonders I suppose and maybe a change of color here and there also. Otherwise, still a nice and trusted Hilton property and just around the corned from the expo center which is very convenient. Also, within a 2 minute walk plenty of good restaurants, within a 5 to 10 minute walk plenty of even very good restaurants available.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
