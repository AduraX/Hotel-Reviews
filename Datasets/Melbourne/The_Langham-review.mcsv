review_478640806~“Birthday celebrations”~Booked a three night stay for my daughter's birthday (had mum and daughter time) From the moment I stepped out of the taxi, my mouth dropped. What a stunning hotel this is. Checked in just after noon and our room was ready. The beds would have to be the best I have ever slept in. The service of the staff (from doorman to housekeeping and all in between) were exceptional. The Hotel is central to everything. The restaurants are fantastic, their choice of foods is mind blowing. My next trip to Melbourne will definitely be staying at The Langham.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_478740183~“Luxourious and friendly”~This was my first time staying at the Langham. It is right on Southbank, close to public transport and many restaurants nearby. The bed was soft but comfortable, room was spacious. If you're parking a car, Wilsons Southgate parking is in the same building and you can Book a Bay Online much cheaper than paying for Valet parking or paying on arrival at Wilsons. I would recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478116070~“Large hotel with excellent location, wifi not working”~The Langham benefits from a perfect location, just South of the Yarra river and just five minutes walk from Federation square. The view from our room was terrific and the room itself was perfect;y comfortable.  My rating of the hotel is because the wi-fi never worked, in spite of multiple calls, multiple reboots... it kept on dropping and, when briefly connected, had extremely low download speeds, barely adequate to update a newspaper. I find that unacceptable in 2017.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478124711~“Excellent Hotel”~Stayed in an executive room at the Langham prior to embarking on a cruise from Port Melbourne. This is a lovely hotel with 1st class customer service. We had access to the Langham club which I would highly recommend. Will definitely stay here again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477868059~“Best Location”~Have stayed in a few 5 star hotels in Melbourne, The Langham in the most central - right in the middle of Southbank. A 15 min walk to Bourke Street, Docklands, Botanic Gardens & Crown. Surrounded by great places to eat from cheap & cheerful - food courts, great casual dining with interesting food combinations to very fine dining. The Langham has a lovely feel, relaxed and proper - great bar, exquisite high teas and wonderful service. All the staff seem really happy & take the time to make you feel special. Highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477813990~“Luxurious stay ”~I stayed one night at the Langham mid week. It is in a great location - Southbank and just across the river from Flinders Street Station - very central. When I arrived at 730 am to drop my bags before booking in later that day a delightful and cheerful doorman whisked the bags away - they were waiting for me when i checked into the room later that day.  I had a standard room and it is spacious. I did not feel cramped or like i was tripping over things. The decor is 'old world' style and it works. The sitting chair and foot stool is seriously comfortable. A great place to sit and sip a cool glass of something. The bed is very comfortable and the pillow choice on the bed easily met my needs.  I was in room 1621 - the view was mostly into the next building - but as i just had the one night it didn't matter. The curtains are good and offer nice blocking of light and privacy.  I enjoyed staying here and would recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477686035~“Lunch at The Langham”~What an excellent lunch we devoured at The Langham. We had a very good view of the Yarra River whilst eating lunch. The Service was excellent and the food was superb. I have a sweet tooth so enjoyed the sweets very much.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477612001~“Spectacular service but not for us. ”~My boyfriend and I stayed here on new years 2016/17. Honestly, we didn't love our stay here as the hotel wasn't suited for us. We would've done well to stay at a more modern and contemporary hotel instead of the classic old style that this hotel had to offer. In saying that, I'd still rate this hotel 4 stars as the service was impeccable and I can appreciate why others would love this place if you enjoy that style. I did enjoy the pool and the view and the bed was really comfortable!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477479369~“Faultless stay at the Langham Hotel melbourne”~Difficult to beat the location with the view of the Yarra river. very peaceful as no traffic in this largely pedestrianised area. Very comfortable room, no noise disturbance,comfortable bed and pillows. Only minor irritation as with many modern hotels...illuminated blue buttons everywhere in the bedroom (for lights etc) if you want perfect darkness you'll need to cover them just as we did!! Hope this review is seen by hotel management and developers everywhere because it is a 'modern mistake'! Concierge and reception staff are very helpful and nothing was too much trouble...well done!! Fabulous breakfast...top marks for the amazing juicers....best invention ever. Highly recommend this hotel~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477393852~“Excellent ”~Wonderful hotel, worth every penny. The staff were friendly and always there to assist. We casually mentioned it was our anniversary and they brought us a complimentary brownie! So thoughtful. We loved our room so much we got breakfast in bed and it was worth it! Bed and pillows were so comfortable. Didn't get a chance to check out any of the other facilities but we will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477308835~“Loved the Location”~We recently stayed 2 nights in a lower floor river view room which was lovely. The bed was very comfortable and the shower and amenities were great. The location was great as we could walk into the CBD or to the many restaurants and shops on South Bank. We ate one night in Melba's and while we don't usually love buffets, this one was amazing and it happened to be a lobster night which was a bonus. Great service throughout the hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477229221~“Charming 5-star stay!”~We stayed at the Langham in Melbourne for 3 nights and the hotel was very charming and comfortable. The rooms were maybe slightly outdated but not bad enough to take away from the overall wonderful experience we had during our stay. The rooms were a good size and comfortable; the location is absolutely unbeatable with easy access to the entire city; the breakfast buffet was outstanding- sooooo many choices/options for everyone! The WiFi was a bit spotty at times which would probably be our biggest complaint especially while traveling internationally and you rely on WiFi when you get back to your hotel. Otherwise, you really can't go wrong with The Langham in Melbourne!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477328304~“Great Hotel with a great location”~Was only there for a night on business so could not try out the food but have to say that the room was very nice and the staff helpful. Being right by the Yarra River is great as there are a bunch of restaurants to choose from.~5~3~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_477138827~“Beautiful Hotel”~Our stay started off great! We were greeted right out of the taxi by Francisco who knew we were checking in, but didn't know what time we would arrive. He knew my name! Educated guess I suppose. He escorted my sister and I to the check in and chatted with us about the hotel and the city for a bit. Sam in concierge was amazing and helped us get setup with dinner reservations during our stay. Wifi was terrible. This is where the hotel loses a star. Almost never worked in our room on the 12th floor. Seemed to work better in the lobby areas. This was really distressing as I needed wifi to send my husband back home in the USA text messages periodically. Also lacking was the buffet breakfast. Crowded, loud, unorganized, and overpriced. I left paying $40 AUD for 2 pancakes and a couple hashbrowns. Fruit was bitter, and the eggs are terrible. Definitely venture out of the hotel for a cheaper more satisfying breakfast. The spa could have been better. Inattentive check in. Okay massage. There was confusion on booking my appointment. I requested Sunday, and they booked me for Saturday. Luckily I called Sunday morning to confirm my appointment, and they said I didn't have one. I was able to get another time slot for a massage and then realized upon checkout that I was charged as a no show for the wrong day. Luckily this was sorted out to satisfaction and I was refunded the charge. This hotel makes a beautiful statement upon check-in, but needs to fine tune a couple things and it would be perfect. Overall great stay, and I would stay at another Langham property in the future.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477328300~“Langham is the best”~My recent stay at the Langham Melbourne once again confirmed in my mind that this is the best hotel in Melbourne. In my opinion it has a class and soul that the other 5 star hotels seem to lack. The breakfast in the Melba restaurant is a fabulous spread that caters for all tastes and cappuccinos/lattes are included at not extra cost!~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477040556~“Great location, great service and very comfortable hotel”~A perfect location for a weekend visit to Melbourne which included a visit to the art gallery and an AFL game at Etihad stadium. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and comfortable. The gym had a great view over the city and was well equipped. The only thing that didn't seem up to standard was that you could hear the plumbing from other rooms but it wasn't a huge issue. Our room overlooked the non-city side but was otherwise very pleasant.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_476680496~“The Langham Melbourne - Overnight Stay”~Wonderful old world charm and great location. The staff were friendly, courteous, professional and knowledgeable.

review_476328957~“Beautiful hotel and great location ”~The smell of the frangipanis on Entering And the beautiful Flower arrangements make it just gorgeous.  The rooms are comfortable And spacious with everything you need. Priority check out is great too. Walking distance to great restaurants, the casino and bars. The only negative is the spa that allows unsupervised children in and out of the wet areas (even after notifying staff twice). Kids jumping and diving in the pool and spa area.  More a family hotel than a relaxing spa.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476323478~“Love love love this hotel”~Have stayed here twice in the last two months and thoroughly enjoyed both visits. From the minute I stepped into the the floral oasis that is the foyer, to the beautiful rooms, my stats were fanstatic. Great access to the YARRA for a morning run, good restaurants and close to the centre of town.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476323421~“Romantic hotel with beautiful frangrance”~Stayed at The Langham for three nights and it was a wonderful stay. Located inside of the CBD with 3 minutes walk from the river and 10 minutes walk to the main train station, the hotel is awesome for people who enjoy shopping and dining out. Hotel room is more vintage style than modern and the decoration and layout were very romantic. The only downside was the shower because the shower head was fixed and the water pressure was not that great. In the meantime, do not expect too much about very welcoming service, given to the hotel's top ranking, the service is quite disappointing.   There is a Lindt chocolate coffee shop on the ground floor next door and if you are crazy for chocolate, make sure that is on your to-go list. The hotel burns ginger flower fragrance oil and it is quite relaxing. I bought 4 bottles before checked out from its souvenir shop.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_476291143~“Fantastic, Luxurious Stay”~This hotel is top notch in every repsect. We were checked in promptly and our bags taken to our room while we shopped. The room was a corner suite, quite spacious with good views across the Yarra to the city. Comfortable furnishings and a terrific bathroom. Loved how you could listen to the tv on speakers in there! The bed was the best I had slept on in a hotel. Also, latex pillows were available and were delivered to the room quickly and at no extra cost. The nightly turndown service was exceptional and they even replaced used towels at this time. Slippers by the bed was awesome!  It was also very quiet, and we were able to switch off the aircon - love that.  We had room service and the curry was huge and cheap! Good choice of snacks and mains. Beautifully served and brought up within the hour of ordering.  Parking was a bit expensive but it was valet. The bell hop people were lovely and nothing was too much trouble, even when I left something in the car. Brought to the room. Just great service. Missed the afternoon high tea but it looked yummy when we saw others having it.  Thoroughly recommend and will absolutely stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476134860~“Nice hotel but not impressed with losing money”~Nice hotel. Loved the pool area and hot tub. Had a rear view and staff were very friendly. My issue is with hotel policy to charging a security deposit. Rather than taking a pre-authorization on our credit card to cover incidentals, this hotel takes out the deposit and then refunds you. Problem is that that we lost money due to a different exchange rate applied by Visa for refunds. We lost approxmalty 7% of our security deposit because of this. Additionally, Langham gets to hold onto clients money while they stay in the hotel and benefit from interest on that money potentially. Would highly recommend a policy change by Langham to align with other high end hotels to only pre-authorize an amount, not charge a deposit.~3~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476298597~“Beautiful Hotel, Service Leaves Much to Be Desired”~The Langham hotel is rated the number one hotel in Melbourne. It's stunning - beautifully appointed, rooms are in wonderful condition, and the bed is likely one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in - truly a 5 star experience. However, the service leaves much to be desired. The staff in Melba restaurant were inattentive, food items were frequently not available, and when asked if someone could get us water we were told to "get it ourselves." Not a 5 star experience by any stretch of the imagination. The service was actually so poor that we canceled, and then later reinstated, our reservation. When we were canceling our reservation, the staff at the front never asked why, never tried to assist, never offered any apologies, and didn't actually ever help - they told me I had to call American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts (since that's where the reservation was made). One other downside, the internet was absolutely terrible the entire time, pretty much unusable. I hope the Langham takes the reviews regarding service seriously and works to remedy - the hotel has a lot of potential.~3~3~4~5~4~4~2~nan
review_475986049~“Great Five Star Hotel”~I've stayed here on my last three visits to Melbourne, if you want the best then go here as it's just fantastic. Very good size rooms with great bathrooms, extremely comfortable beds. Breakfast was great and in the evening before and after going out for a meal the bar has a great atmosphere, really polite helpful staff. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, it's a must for me every time I return to Melbourne~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_475918326~“Superb location, service”~Perfect accommodation for comfort, access to attractions and transport, for business or leisure. We were on an upper floor with a beautiful view of the river and of the fireworks display on offer 3 of the 5 nights that we stayed. Additionally, we arrived extremely late due to airline delays, and the staff was helpful and smoothed our way despite the 3:30 AM arrival! Excellent breakfast as well, and the bar was also inviting and provided a nice happy hour.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475993238~“Balcony Room”~The Langham as a whole is amazing from Valet parking, check in to check out. Buffet is to die for both breakfast and dinner. My only complaint is Balcony cannot be used when raining so if you're a smoker you will get wet or have to leave the building to find shelter and smoke.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_475858796~“Wonderful hotel”~Found this hotel to be perfect from start to finish. We checked in late after a very long flight and hot chocolate was sent to our room with compliments. We were also given bottled water every day. Despite the Melbourne temperature our room was always fresh and cool.  We tried the hotel breakfast on a couple of occasions and the variety of foods provided was extensive. There even was a chocolate fountain which although I am a chocolate fiend I found a little too early for me.  You can keep an eye on your bill via the TV service which prevented any surprises. The WiFi was free which is always a thumbs up with my partner.  The hotel is situated on the south bank next to the river yarra. Thus area has many restaurants and bars and is a lovely place to pass the time. The hotel is spacious and despite the number of guests staying it never felt too busy. The gym was well equipped, the pool on the terrace was excellent.  If I were to visit Melbourne again I would definitely stay again. It has been one of my favourite hotel stays.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475661066~“Great location, great atmosphere”~We stayed at the Langham for two nights to see a concert at the Elizabeth Murdoch Concert Hall. It was an easy walk to the venue and the city. Great location, great service, spacious rooms - fantastic trip away!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475720454~“Simply Luxurious”~There are hotels and there are hotels! This has to be without a doubt the best hotel in Australia.

review_475516023~“Great Friday”~Upon arrival at the Melbourne Langham Hotel we were ushered to the elevator and directed to the Club floor on level 24 with professional alacrity. The check-in process was equally satisfying with a superb blend of efficiency and personalised touch. Francisco and the whole Club lounge team provided an exceptional level of attentive service and everything, from the selection of food and beverages to the fresh roses in the bathroom, was presented to make the experience such a pleasant and relaxing one. The Club room was nicely presented with very comfortable furnishings and included a generous range of amenities. Overall, this attractive hotel is one of Melbourne's best and its quality appeal would definitely make guests want to return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475511213~“A superb and unforgettable stay at The Langham”~The vibe, great location to the central Town and the best breakfast in Melbourne makes The Langham awesome.  The festive cheer added great value to the ambiance and activity in and around the hotel. There was never a dull moment. Great outdoor activities near the hotel itself like the Casino. I will return to this grand Hotel soon.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475454459~“Exceptional service by one staff member in particular.”~The Langham’s beautiful old world feel has that elegance and charm that always makes it special. The pool and spa area with the view over Southbank are incredible and we’re always welcomed. This time however was made even better than any previous stays by Sumati Kamonmit. His incredible enthusiasm and service when we checked in added so much to our visit and he is an amazing asset to the hotel. Thanks as before for a wonderful stay.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_475447043~“Loved the Langham in Melbourne”~Great location, lovely staff and overall a very pleasant stay at The Langham in Melbourne.

review_475196448~“Great location perfect for a break.”~My wife and I booked a quick getaway to Melbourne to enjoy the great restaurants, bars, and shopping in Southbank and the CBD. The Langham proved a great choice. The hotel has a sophisticated old world charm. We didn’t want a ‘business’ hotel for our holiday and the Langham ticked the box on this. The other great thing about the hotel is its location – right on Southbank, and opposite a footbridge to the CBD. Everything is within walking distance. We were surprised to get a room with river views as we thought we’d booked a non-river view room. Recommended.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475166113~“Concierge shortcomings”~When you stay in a hotel in a city you don't know, you need the Concierge. Well, the guy we used, Ben, was useless. Lazy. We asked him to help us find boutique style hotels for a trip down the Great Ocean Road. He said, try the internet! He was irritatingly useless.  When we arrived we told him we needed to hire a car from Avis to be delivered to the hotel on the 3rd April. We gave him the time we needed the car. He acknowledged and understood everything (or so he said). We never received any written confirmation from him as one normally would from a Concierge. We were busy every day at a conference and when the day came to leave there was no car. Furthermore, there was no Ben and apparently Avis had been emailing him DAILY to get our new card details as we are President Club members. Avis never received a reply from him and cancelled the car!! We had to leave by a certain time as we had a long drive and we were furious to say the least. The Customer Relations gentleman by the name of Jonathan McLaughlin intervened when I approached him and told him the story. He gave us a taxi voucher to go to Avis to get a car. I tried to discuss this as well with the Langham General Manager but he was nowhere to be found.  We stay at The Langham in London and this would not be acceptable there. Ben needs to catch a wake-up call and in fact your whole Concierge department is not good which is a big let down for The Langham. No maps offered. Couldn't find any maps of surrounding areas. Restaurant knowledge very poor.  We were absolutely stressed and angry when we left the hotel with Ben nowhere to be found to face his lack of expertise and his laziness. Thank you Jonathan McLaughlin - you are a true gentleman.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~2~nan
review_474844800~“Always and exceptional stay”~We stay at The Langham three or four times a year and our stay is always exceptional. The staff couldn't be more welcoming, right from the doorman (we love Laurie), to the checkout! We have stayed in a River Room, a corner room and a Suite. All rooms are presented beautifully and there is always a little extra something special if you're going in for a special occasion like a Birthday or anniversary. The Club Lounge is a lovely oasis and the staff can never do enough for you. The breakfast isn't as wonderful as Melba's but it is more than adequate. Afternoon tea is always lovely and we often eat enough canapés in the evening that we don't need to go out for dinner. While all staff are wonderful, I always look forward to seeing Laurie for his 'welcome home' greeting, Sumati for giving me a rose, Francisco and Soudie for looking after us in the lounge and the numerous other staff who go out of their way to help. See you again soon Langham!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474762258~“Polished service that elevates accommodation to an experience”~We took the mother in law here for a stay as an 80th birthday treat and she was blown away by the experience. From the arrival, which felt like a real experience, to the decor, the comfort of the room and the attentiveness of the staff. It's a beautiful place with lovely staff. I reckon this will get us in the good books for quite some time.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_474873704~“My personal favourite”~I love taking a moment out to pause and enjoy - The Langham allows this. It is an amazing time to breath and enjoy! I stayed with my mum as a special family moment. Always love this place and the Melba as well.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474614151~“Great location but the Langham has seen better days”~The public areas of the hotel still look OK but the rooms are really showing their age, especially the bathrooms which are really dated. Our room was an executive terrace (booked via AMEX FHR - no upgrade available) and the rate varied from $500 - $700 + during our stay. At this price point the hotel represents very poor value compared to other properties in Melbourne (e.g. Crown Towers, Park Hyatt) primarily because the room is too small, the decor is dated and the bathroom is not at all luxurious. For example, the bathroom is small and cramped with a shallow bathtub. The terrace was large and very well furnished with a stunning view. This was definitely the best part of the room although somewhat diminished by the noisy air-conditioning unit/s. The club lounge was just ok - lovely view and reasonably friendly staff but very ordinary food and beverage offerings. There are 2 sections to the lounge, one to the right which is smaller and more pleasant, and one to the left which is dimly lit and reminiscent of a corporate staff room.  Location is fantastic for exploring Melbourne on foot but would not stay again unless there was a major refurbishment.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_474451463~“Great hotel, fabulous location”~Picking a hotel online half a world away can be tricky. But when we picked the Langham we hit a home run. Great hotel, super staff, incredible location on the south bank of the Yarra River. Surrounded with great restaurants and bars. Ideally suited across a footbridge from Founder Street station, trams, back Alley art and cafes. 100% recommend.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474428300~“On the bucket list ”~Staying at this hotel has been on my bucket list for awhile and it was great. Upon arrival the foyer reception area looks so beautiful. Check-in was a bit slow but the female managers dressed in pink suits were very nice and friendly and apologized for the delay.  The room was amazing. A nice view of river even though I didn't don't pay extra for a river view. And it was very clean.  I went up to the pool and they had a bar there. The only issue I had was with the service at the pool area and the lack of lounge chairs in this area. There were many people and not a lot of chairs compared to other places I've stayed.  Back to the room, it had perfect black out curtains when I woke in morning. I went to breakfast in Melba's and the service and breakfast was exceptional. Fresh fruit and Bircher muesli....my favorites. Plus they freshly cook your eggs. I got a yummy omelette. I also had to dip a couple of marshmallow in the decadent chocolate fountain....well it was breakfast time...lol I had self-parked in Wilson Parking next door overnight and it cost me $69. Next time I will definite opt for valet parking which was cheaper at $64.  The hotel is a great location just near river and Southbank with lots of restaurants and atmosphere.  It was a wonderful stay...staff were super friendly and room was amazing.  Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474402271~“Lunch at the Langham”~The Langham always manages to exceed expectations with the level of service and product delivered. The food and service is always of an exceptional quality and should be experienced as frequently as possible.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473952990~“Faded grand dame”~The Langham was a mixed experience: some great staff members and some terrible, some great facilities but some in much need of renovation. I have stayed in most of Melbourne's good hotels and without a renovation and re-invigoration, I will not be returning to the Langham. The staff was very mixed: from fantastic people like the doormen and guest relations staff through to some unbelievably grumpy staff at the front desk and restaurants. I really felt for some of the best people there as you could see they were visibly distressed by the attitude of their colleagues. The rooms themselves are good and very clean, with great beds and sheets, but with tired furniture and carpets. Bathrooms are similarly dated and worn but spotlessly clean and in good working order. Facilities like laundry and room service are exceptional: truly five-star and easily the best I have experienced in Melbourne. They made every effort to meet even the crazy requests I had due to my bags arriving much later than me. The restaurant and bar are alright but less good than offered by other hotels. The food is reliable if nothing special. In terms of style, it appeals much more to someone wanting a traditional, old-school hotel and I know a lot of people who I think would love the hotel. Unfortunately, for me personally, the variable staff and tired look outweigh its other features. I hope at some point it enjoys the renovation it deserves!~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan

review_473742127~“As good as last time”~Stayed here in 2014 and had some very good memories. We were not disappointed this time. We arrived around 10 p.m. after 24 hours of travel and the staff was so helpfull and informed us about how to change room the following day - we had booked a stardard room for the first night and a Club Floor Room for the next 3 nights. Also - the hotel had arranged for ticket to the Formula 1 taking place the day afte our arrival. No problem at all. We had breakfast at the Melba Restaurant on the furst morning. The food was great but we definately prefer the atmosphere in the Club Lounge even though you could not have fresh omelets etc. The view is "to die for" overlooking the river.

review_473306809~“Can't get enough”~Last January was our second time stayed in The Langham Melbourne. Everything was as perfect as our first stay back in January 2015. Breakfast was delicious, lot of choices of coffee, fruits and vegetables were plentiful. Room also clean and shiny. Service was consistently excellent. Location is close to restaurants and Flinders station, restaurants and shops. Worth of price.... no disappointment at all.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473307249~“Ambience”~Just a great resting place during the Comedy Festival with wonderful ambience and location. The room was inviting and with great views down the Yarra River. Southbank can offer Melbourne's berst vibe.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473307254~“Another relaxing and enjoyable stay”~We had a lovely time at the Langham Melbourne recently. Our room was clean, quiet and very comfortable. The bathroom is beautiful and I enjoyed relaxing in the bath after walking around the City all day. Everyone was friendly, courteous, and helpful. The beds are very comfortable and there are plenty of quality pillows. This is my favourite hotel in Melbourne and I look forward to staying at the Langham again soon.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473063538~“Superior Hotel”~The Langham is an outstanding hotel. The staff throughout the hotel are friendly, assistive, polite and professional and cannot do enough for you. I was extremely impressed with everyone there. The food at the restaurant on premises is outstanding for any meal of the day. The chef's will prepare omelets at breakfast for you. They make fresh pancakes at another breakfast station and the breakfast selection is scrumptious. The munch and dinners there are to die for . . . but don't, just live the high life and enjoy every delicious bite. You will be treated like royalty at The Langham!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_473059414~“Great hotel, friendly staff, housekeeping is very thoughtful and extreme attention to detail”~The rooms are luxurious, very convenient, very friendly service. I also was impressed with housekeeping, how they quickly figured out how I used the room and adjusted it to suit me, such as where they put the water, where they put the bath robes, got the slippers out and put them on the side of the bed that I sleep, etc.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473072902~“Wonderfull experience.”~5 Star luxury from the moment you arrive to the time you depart. Did,nt have to ask for anything. Turn down service every night with complimentary bottle of water each. Pool was very clean and gym excellent.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472621697~“Nice hotel”~We stayed in a corner room overlooking the river. Room was comfortable but the river is really dirty with a lot of debris. We were really disappointed that the city doesn't take better care of one of its major attractions. The hotel is located in a perfect area with lots of restaurants and places to walk. It's a very touristy ares with a casino nearby. We had access to the Club Lounge at the hotel which was a nice quiet area with nice service. The snacks and breakfast selections lacked but the pleasant staff helped make up for it.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_472560420~“Top Class all the Way”~If you want to stay in a place with style, The Langham has it in spades. Every aspect of our stay was excellent. There were a vast number of choices at the breakfast buffet and the staff were attentive and efficient. We would definitely stay there again.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_472560447~“Lovely stay , couldn't fault this hotel”~Lovely rooms , classy décor , reminds of hotels of years ago ( not out dated though ) , lovely foyer , off the street entrance , easy to find , walking distance to many restaurants & venues , very comfy beds , classy bathrooms with many extras ,~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472277492~“Mid-Week celebration”~Would highly recommend The Langham for those who are looking for pure luxury. Our balcony room had all one could ask for with beautiful views of the Melbourne city landscape. Wi-Fi Internet connection is poor & their in-house menu needs greater scope for the varied tastes of their customer base, (vegan). But a perfect spot to relax & enjoy the city. Also loved the complimentary ride in the Langham Pink London Cab to a dinner date in the heart of Melbourne.~5~4~5~4~5~4~5~nan
review_472277480~“Melbourne's best hotel”~We recently had a three night mini getaway to Melbourne while our daughter was in school camp. We booked the Langham for its location and apparent quality. We were not disappointed in any way. There was simply nothing we could fault with this magnificent hotel. The bed was probably the best we have ever slept in. The staff are amazing, so friendly and efficient. We dined in Melba's restaurant, the Aria Bar and in our room. We couldn't have been happier on each occasion. An overall 11/10 experience for us. Can't wait to go back again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472277473~“Langham Melbourne Review”~My stay at the Langham was for a business seminar at the Tennis Centre. The check welcome was prompt and friendly. The room was ready, clean and very comfortable. Staff offered to help with bags. I used the gym and the sauna - the gym was very good by hotel standards as was the sauna. The in-room breakfast I had was on time and had complimentary juice. It is a fine hotel, get service and suits my needs of quality, homilness (good gym and sauna) and location~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan

review_472018449~“"Exceeded Expectations"”~The Langham is well located within Southbank with a short walk along the Yarra to Crown Casino. The staff and services were exceptional from the moment of arrival right through to checkout. I loved everything about our stay, from the view of the Yarra to the complimentary water provided with the turn down service. Thank you Langham for making our anniversary so special. We will definitely stay here again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471586692~“Fancy but pricey hotel”~Service from the staff was great.  Everything except the service costs extra! $12 for a bottle of still water in the room is just ridiculous when you are already paying premium prices to stay in a hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471160498~“Loved Our Stay”~We stayed at the Langham for 5 nights. The location is perfect. We had a room with a view of the river and we enjoyed walking along the river or crossing the river and accessing the trams, when needed. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. The hotel staff was extremely professional and helpful. The rooms are immaculate and the beds and linens were terrific. The breakfast buffet was good. While some previous reviewers were unimpressed with the offerings, we found a variety of offerings and there was an omelet chef who made eggs to order. We especially enjoyed our interactions with the doorman, concierge, and front desk staff who were all friendly and accommodating. We loved The Langham.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471051710~“LOVELY LANGHAM”~Arrived 11am 4 hrs early but given key to our room What a bonus! Perfect location right on the Yarra river Fantastic views! Just the job ! Book early and rooms can be had at a very affordable price! We paid £300 for 2 nights. A bargain.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_470995564~“Cleanliness”~Hotel room was clean & lovely. Staff just beautiful, very welcoming . Breakfast, the old ordinary index! same old same old. Wish these chefs new where to buy the best sausages, instead of the crappy ones they all serve! Dining room needs attention, staff forgetful, & the only ones that seemed happy to have a job, was a Aussie girl! Tables were disgusting! You could see where someone had previously dined. They need a dahm good wipe with a clean cloth, not dirty, & spreading more germs! I even had to wipe the table clean & the cutlery. otherwise great stay, though Breaky a great disapointment, they need to address that especially with the visitors coming to stay, no impression there!~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470795764~“Five star quality”~Stayed here for a couple of nights while we were here for a wedding and we were extremely happy with our stay. Room was well presented and large, bed was comfy and most pleasing of all was the service. Every staff member was lovely and made us feel at home.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470771966~“Club lounge dissapointing”~Great hotel with immaculate rooms and cleanliness. Staff were excellent particularly in the club lounge. My disappointment came from food and cocktail offerings. Campari wasn,t available when requested but appeared on day 3. Food offerings of afternoon tea and evening canapes of high quality however dissapointing breakfast. Luke warm offerings with little variety. ie. flavoured sweetened yoghurt only, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, mushrooms with no change from day to day. Poached or fried eggs can be requested. My review is based on a comparison with Sofitel Club that offers a superior breakfast with a la carte selections cooked to order and quality canapes on an evening~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470726066~“A must stay hotel!”~What can I say! This hotel deserves 10/10. It is located in south bank and is literally a 5-10min walk to federation square and eureka tower! The hotel itself is amazing, clean and offers the best afternoon tea in Melbourne! (A must) It is linked to a number of restaurants and coffee shops. The hotel has its own restaurant which serves a fantastic continental breakfast (the best I've had) for AUD30pp. When we arrived the room wasn't ready, however we were offered the spa facilities to use to hang out or freshen up until the room became available. Throughout the stay the staff made us feel so welcome and comfortable. I would personally stay there again and recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in Melbourne! Worth the money!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470461346~“Wonderful”~We booked lunch at The Langham to celebrate our wedding anniversary and at the last moment decided to make a night of it and stay there as well. We went crazy and booked an Executive Terrace room with club access, expensive yes, but not outrageous, and it was worth it. We had lunch, very very nice and good choices, but we've realised we're not buffet eaters. After lunch we went to check in. There was a bit of a muddle about checking in, our fault not theirs. We were shown to our room but only had a couple of minutes to drop off our bags before we were taken to the Club room to be shown around. The Club staff were very friendly and welcoming and the Club room has a great view over the river and city skyline. When we went in later for our appero although it was quite busy it was easy to find a seat. They were serving a good selection of hot and cold snack and a decent selection of drinks.  The room at first was a little ho hum, but then we went out onto the terrace and oh boy that was wonderful. It was huge, and was really well furnished. 4 seater dining table, 2 large loungers, 2 3 seater sofas plus random chairs and side tables. It was fantastic. We finally came indoors at around 10:30pm and had a great nights sleep. The bed was super comfy with good quality linens. Next morning we were back in the Club room for breakfast, a good enough selection and plenty of everything. There were so many little things that made our stay at The Langham is a delight, from the staff being unfailingly pleasant and polite with a real positive attitude to the chocolate frogs hiding in jars. We've decided to go back again for my birthday, can't wait. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470468465~“The best fish and chips in the universe”~I had fish and chips in my room shortly after I arrived - it was the best I have ever tasted. Room service was impeccably carried out by the server. I also used the restaurant for lunch and breakfast. There is everything you could possibly want for breakfast. The sushi bar at lunch is another great addition.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_470214599~“Very very very nice hotel. ”~We stayed here over the F1 weekend and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel and its staff exceeded our expectations.

review_470190230~“Very luxurious hotel”~A very luxurious and classy hotel right near the Yarra River and a very close walk to the main train station.

review_469982038~“We Love The Langham”~My wife and I decided to treat ourselves to one night at the Langham in a Club King room. Since we were last there the rooms have undergone a stylish refurbishment. Everything about our stay made it memorable. The staff were superb, the room delightful and the food brilliant. Of course the Club does spoil you, but that is what we have come to expect. What made the experience more pleasurable was that we received an upgrade, with a room overlooking the Yarra. The proximity of this hotel to everything you might want or need is a real bonus. We will always return to this classy hotel when we are in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469970989~“Disappointed...”~The Langham has such a reputation, I decided to ditch my usual business travel hotel (Crown Towers) to try it. I was disappointed - here are the reasons why: - The hotel felt and looked tired. It needs a refurb. Furniture were old, the bathrooms fixtures were average. It generally had no wow to it. - Front desk service held no warmth or friendliness. Overall, there were no real issue, just that given the choice between Langham and Crown Towers, I would choose Crown Towers any day.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469561630~“Faultless stay”~We recently stayed two nights at The Langham and were wonderfully looked after by the charming staff, particularly Jamila and Laurie. Our room was extremely comfortable and very clean. Breakfast was delicious. We could not recommend it more highly. It is very conveniently placed as well so you can walk to restaurants, the station, The Botanic Gardens etc etc. A great hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469446980~“Would go back”~The whole Langham experience which I had been gifted was amazing. From check in to out the staff were lovely and the whole stay a delight. It was lovely to have the option of shower or bath without the shower being over the bath.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_469435592~“Special Visit”~Great hotel. Room exceeded expectations. Staff very friendly. Highly recommend this hotel. Close to everything including some good restaurants. Even had an umbrella in the room, slippers and dressing gown in the room.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469339827~“Thank you team Langham ”~Stayed 4 and 5 nights with 2 interconnected rooms  Big cheers. Cheers for the friendly staff, everything mostly met our standards with a high emphasis on cleanliness. Our special requests for a birthday request was also met with enthusiasm. The cleaning staff were very friendly and you can tell that they do care for each room to a high standard. The location is just a bridge over from the cbd, and amongst great restaurants alongside the riverside Yarra. Complaint. On the very first night of check in, the receptionist didn't carry out any great standard of procedure that we would expect from a grand hotel like the Langham. Such as, not giving out a receipt of payment from our visa transaction. Also, there was at least two hours after check in, until we realised that no one had given us our passports back that was used for check in, nor did any one notify us of this. It wasn't until we actually had to ring reception that they confirmed they had the passports and promptly sent it back up. But this shouldn't be the case that an important document like a passport should be ignored and nor should it be the onus of the guests to realise the staffs mistake. On the second day we finally got a copy of the information invoice without any problems from another receptionist. Everyone makes mistakes and I would hope that that staff in particular has been retrained in proper procedures for next time. Although our first night has been marred, our remaining 4 days has been nothing short of perfect. Despite the incident I would still consider the Langham again on the next visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469280827~“Luxurious and special”~I just stayed at the Langham with my partner for 2 nights to celebrate my 40th. Check in was quick and we received a complimentary upgrade from a corner room to a 1 bedroom suite. The room wasn't ready straight away so we had a drink in the bar and got a text shortly after saying the room was ready. Given the upgrade we were happy with the wait. The suites are massive and really comfortable. The bed was like a squishy cloud. Loved the double shower. Amazing views of the city and river. Complimentary birthday cake was also sent to the room, it was a really lovely and unexpected guesture. All staff, from bellhops to front desk to cleaning to restaurant and bar staff, were all so friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome.  We had the full buffet breakfast both mornings, it was as good as what any other 5 star hotel would have. No lunch required afterwards! The location is ideal. I couldn't afford to stay here normally but splashed out for my birthday and am glad I did, I will never forget our stay.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469295016~“Great location and Amazing Hotel”~From the moment we arrived at the hotel the service was amazing. The entry was welcoming, the staff could not do enough and the room was comfortable. Would go back their with my family to celebrate another birthday. Well done Langham!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468991683~“A nice travel experience”~This was according to our sources, the number one-rated hotel in Australia so we went with great expectations. The check-in process was lengthy but led us to a decent if not luxurious room that appeared fairly old in both furnishings, fixtures, and bathroom. It was also relatively small by American standards. The bed needed a newer mattress as well. That aside, the staff was attentive and met our expectations for a high-tier hotel. The breakfast buffet (our included meal) was quite generous and delicious. The remainder of the hotel was gorgeous and extremely well located on the banks of the Yarra River, yielding easy access to museums and restaurants around the central business district. We did expect more out of the room but the rest of our experience mostly compensated for this one shortcoming. Next time, I would recommend one of the limited number of suites (none of which was available for this stay).~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469024622~“Our 1st choice every time in Melbourne”~We've stayed here many times and have never had a bad experience here , the beds are so good , rooms so quiet and staff members that excel at what they do , very handy location being just across the river to Melbourne's CBD ,plenty of restaurants within strolling distance.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469024620~“Recent Stay at The Langham”~The overall experience is satisfying. Room are clean and bed is comfy. Bathroom reasonably good size. The only minor issue I have is the wardrobe which is too small after you put the ironing board, robes and safe box, there is hardly any room to hang your jacket and clothes for a few days trip.~4~4~4~5~4~5~4~nan
review_468585716~“Excellent hotel ”~Great service, good location on Southbank. When I found my room was next to the lifts, I was worried about noise, but that turned out to be unnecessary.

review_468717662~“The Langham Hotel - Melbourne”~Fantastic hotel - staff are really nice, friendly and most helpful. The rooms are very nice with extremely comfortable beds. It is in a good location at Southbank and is a short walk across the river to the CBD. Also well positioned if you are attending any of the cities major sporting events. One of my favourite hotels.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468717639~“average”~Although the furnishings are somewhat grand if dated there was nothing exceptional about The Langham. I've slept on more comfortable beds at hotels for a third of the price. There are no smoking areas with in 100 meters of the hotel. The car park is over priced & smells of decomposing food.~3~2~3~3~3~4~3~nan
review_468510546~“Well-located, top-notch accomodations and service”~We had a beautiful room, with all of the amenities one would expect from a 5-star hotel. The front desk staff was outstanding, and really took the time to make sure our experience was great (e.g., making reservations for afternoon tea for us--the representative walked down to do so when they didn't pick up their phone). Having a separate stall shower was nice--not universal in Australia. We'd definitely return to the Langham.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468443185~“Great room, great service”~On my last trip to Melbourne, the hotel really outdid themselves. I had an issue with my booking (agent than hotel), and the staff at the Langham bent over backwards to make sure I was looked after. Nothing was a problem for them - I couldn't ask for a better experience.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_468197276~“Great service and fantastic location”~The Langham is a very nice hotel and extremely convenient for all that South Bank has to offer. Great restaurants and cheap foodcourts are all around. Some of the engagement was challenging around a guest with a similar name and expectations that we had to leave early but they were quickly resolved. I would recommend a visit to the pool area as well. Very relaxing.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
