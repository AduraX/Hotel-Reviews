review_478078975~“Great location, great apartments ”~Spent 10 nights in a one bed apartment. Clean, tidy and well maintained. Gym, pool and steam room were an added bonus. To be honest, the only bad thing I have to say about it was the bar. Served good beer, wine and food but was rarely open.  I regularly came down at 8 or 9 pm to find it close despite it advertising its open 5pm til late! I caught the staff closing at 8 pm one evening. When I asked for a drink they said that would serve it but I would have to take it to my room. When I asked why they were closing so early, they said it was because they had no customers. I was a little surprised as I was sure I was, at the very least 'a customer'. Very odd!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458610879~“Excellent”~Having travelled thousands of miles over the years and stayed in great properties, I have to say that Quay Plaza is up there with them.  The position is amazing right by the Yarra river, walkways running tracks botanic gardens all close by. We walked in greeted by the lovely Helena and Cathy, who I just adored. I naturally didn't like the first room but I never do any where in the world I go for at least the 3rd. I was shown to the river view apartment, it had everything in it, sitting room, kitchen, with white goods. Bedroom bathroom corner bath, what more could a hotel guest want. Free wifi, free breakfast and fab staff. Have to mention Sarah too the manageress who kindly allowed the room change and also rushed to rescue me in the lift, that was my husbands fault. The room was cleaned every day. Breakfast was great served with a smile. Loved it. Highly recommend will definitely go back. Thank you ladies you are fab.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477867151~“Top quality customer service ”~Stayed for one night but i wish i had more time. Mum and i were treated so kindly by the staff. The hotel and rooms are clean and everything is an easy walk. Breakfast was good and a few extra hot options like pancakes would be great, but i'm being picky. I parked my rental car overnight and was only charged $30 for a day and a half. I will definitely be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477179890~“comfortable, professional and for us a great location”~We arrived from America into Melbourne in the morning and took the bus transport to the hotel. From the minute we arrived to the minute we checked out this hotel staff was very welcoming, professional and helpful to a few issues we had to deal with. My luggage got ripped from LAX to Melbourne and the head hotel engineer named Jack spent time helping me put duck tape on the corners so I could use it for the rest of my stay. He also had to replace a broken coffee unit and went through 2 of them until they found one that actually was working well. Check in was fabulous and easy and they gave us a wonderful suite. All front desk associates were friendly, helpful and generous with their time. We had prepaid for our hotel room and breakfast for the 4 days we stayed there.They even loaned me a 120-to 110 outlet charger converter for my i-phone when I discovered the one I had was not working. We found the breakfast choices of hot and cold food very good and a good selection of free newspapers to read. We enjoyed the indoor pool and amenities. The Location in Southgate was excellent for us since we went to the ballet, Botanical gardens, Rod Laver Tennis center and museums. Everything was in walking distance we never took a bus anywhere as we discovered the city. You can easily take cabs from the hotel, but my suggestion is to bring some comfortable shoes and get out and explore. We loved Melbourne and hope we can come back here someday. We would never hesitate to stay At Quay West Suites again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476279427~“Second time here, wont be the last”~Stayed here over Easter weekend with my family and we had an absolute ball. Check in staff were lovely and made you feel comfortable straight away. We booked a 3 bedroom apartment and were given 2601 which is on the top level of the Residential side of the hotel so had an amazing view of the arts centre spire, MCG and the Yarra. Multiple balconies surrounded the whole apartment and the main one had chairs on it and some fake grass making it feel very modern Decor wasn't the most modern however but that didn't affect our stay.  Kitchen/Lounge was huge and plenty of space to sit around the 2 dining tables or all on the giant couch. Very centrally located on Southbank and only a 2 minute walk to the Langham (best buffet breakfast in Melbourne) Valet parking $30 a day was reasonable considering Crown charges $55.  The included breakfast was ok but nothing to really rave about. Small variety of hot food: eggs, bacon, sausage and tomato but everything I had was good and the coffee was excellent. I liked that you could get barista coffee. Wifi worked well for the very little I used it. TV in main bedroom didn't work but all the other ones did, plenty of channels to choose from~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475436818~“top 3 night stay”~This was our 4th stay at Quay West in Melbourne. As always the staff were brilliant, very friendly & efficient. The apartment was on the 14th floor with city views. The rooms had been rejuvenated since our last stay. We had breakfast in the jarrah restaurant each morning & the food choice was great. We think Quay West is so much nicer than the big flashy hotels. We will be back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475364248~“Excellent Hospitality - saved our trip”~For an apartment style hotel that we have enjoyed staying at before, we were initially dissapointed at an unusual smell when we entered our room. We were lucky enough to be helped by excellent staff (especially Michael) who were able to change our room. By a stroke of luck and by way of hotel generosity, we found ourselves in an upgraded room, with magnificent views, and a perfect ambience. The swimming pool and gym area were excellent, the room service extremely rapid, and the hospitality of the front desk went above and beyond. Looking forward to another stay!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_474489418~“Wonderful location, property and staff exceeded all expectations”~Travelling as 2 couples, We had decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a 2 bedroom apartment. Quay West suites proved to be the ideal accommodation in every regard. Unbeatable location - easy walk to Federation Sq, Bourke St mall, Flinders Lane restaurants and the Casino. Without exception, every staff member, whether at front desk or in Jarrah restaurant, was friendly, helpful, professional and knowledgeable. Each did their utmost to make our stay so memorable and enjoyable . The apartment was very well appointed, proving to be spacious and comfortable, with fantastic views of the river towards the MCG and other sporting venues in one direction and as far as The bayside area in the distance. Very happy to highly recommend this property.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474428330~“Central, Safe and Sensational”~A friend and I spent a short weekend in Melbourne together, basing ourselves at the Quay West Suites in Southgate. Such a central location! It's what you expect from Quay West - excellent quality, good size rooms with lovely finishings, quality bathroom (ours had a full bath, marble flooring, tiles and vanity top), excellent amenities -- a pool (which is rather gorgeous), gym and steam room, plus a range of eateries which we didn't avail ourselves of, preferring to be out and about in Melbourne. This is an ideal location to base yourself in, with Flinders Street Station a few steps across the bridge, the art district literally on your doorstep, the CBD a few blocks away, and Southgate literally spitting distance. It's all at your doorstep, either places to go or places to get you where you want to go. Not the cheapest accommodation you'd be able to find, but good value for what you get.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_474409823~“Amazing place to stay ”~Stayed here with my 2 daughters for 5 nights for a dance related visit. Was very pleased when we arrived someone was there to unload our luggage onto a trolley with valet parking. Even though we arrived at 2pm our room wasn't ready which was the only small disappointment for our entire stay. After a long drive and needing to have my daughter changed and at a dance lesson by 4 it made me a little anxious.  But we were in our room by 230 and it was amazing. All staff were friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. Our room was a spacious 2 bedroom apartment with river and city views. Gallery kitchen with a nice little table and chairs to eat breakfast with views. Seperate dining room and lounge room, balcony with setting and the main bedroom had a beautiful king bed with a really big ensuite with bath. Both bedrooms had televisions and the wifi was speedy. Plenty of storage room and robes and slippers. The pool was lovely and warm which the girls loved and even though the gym was only small it was very well equipped. I have stayed in other apartments in Southbank and this is by far my favourite place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474329929~“Family stay made perfection thanks to True 5 Star Quality”~A return trip to Quay West Suites as a family for a much-needed city break this time. I was warmly greeted by staff and acknowledged as an Accor Loyalty member with a welcome letter and upgrade. Not all hotel chains are so particular about rewarding and welcoming loyal members as Accor are, so this was appreciated.  Our apartment had a stunning river view and all the space and comforts one could possibly need whilst enjoying Melbourne. The room was quiet, as requested, and combined with a seriously comfy bed and block out blinds ensured a dream sleep experience. Plenty of room and storage space in the gorgeous ensuite for everything also,  The beauty of apartment/suites stays for families, especially, is the convenience of a fully equipped kitchen. As with the rest of the suite the kitchen was immaculately clean and well equipped with dishwasher, oven, full size fridge, microwave and even coffee machine. We relaxed enjoying the superb view of the city across the Yarra and the Arts Centre Spire, before heading down for an evening meal at the Jarrah Bar before our trip to the Arts Centre. The staff are the absolute best at Quay West, professional but friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to provide assistance. Paul very kindly helped my son and I navigate the TV channels to the movies without making us feel a nuisance at all, much appreciated when my son needed some "down" TV time!  The wonderful bar man (whose name I sadly didn't get) at Jarrah helped us choose a meal for my son (who is at that awkward dining age - adult appetite not always an adult taste!) and my son was very happy with his meal indeed. My friend and I enjoyed a selection of delicious vegetarian dishes from the bar menu entrees with our pre-show drinks.The cauliflower and cheese croquettes are a must dry - bite size and delicious!  Our breakfasts were up to the Quay West very high standard; a wide selection of fresh continental, fruit, pastry and cooked breakfast options to please all. The mini fruit smoothies were a special favourite with my son, and a great option for a quick healthy breakfast. Breakfast staff were on the ball, clearing dishes promptly but never obtrusively and always with a friendly smile or greeting. If you are staying here, do make the time to experience the stunning pool on the 5th floor, complete with a relaxing spa to indulge in. It was clean and sparkling (I am fussy with my pools!) and well provided with plenty of clean towels and change rooms. All in all, it is fantastic to see Quay West retaining its reputation for 5 Star Accommodation in the heart of Melbourne without losing the personal and friendly touch of the staff who truly make it worth returning to. I do not often write a review so glowing but I cannot fault my stay at all!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_473959902~“Perfect for 2 or 3 days in Melbourne”~Fantastic service from the moment we arrived. We stayed two nights and enjoyed this boutique style accommocation. The room was so adequate and had everything you could want or need. The location is perfect! close to everything from Burke St, Lygon, Degraves , Theatres, DFO and dining along Southbank. The breakfast was fantastic, better than some 5 star hotels we have stayed at. The best bit iwas the location and breakfast. Nothing really to fault. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_473473690~“Melbourne trip”~This was my third time staying at this hotel over the last three weeks  All business trips so all work and no play. From check to check out you are made feel very welcome, you simply drive up to the front door of the hotel where your car is taken from and parked  The location is first class with easy access to all the major roads, it's also slap-bang in the middle of the city, two minutes from the train station and a ten minute walk to China town  The food from breakfast to dinner is first class, it's spotlessly clean, with a great pool and fitness area. All the rooms are well decorated and all have a fully functional kitchen. However the real gems of this hotel are the staff, from the manager to reception, the catering staff and the cleaning staff everyone has made me feel so welcome which to me is a real bonus when you have to work away from your family  I will return~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472872014~“Good location, mixed opinion..”~Stayed at the Quay West Suites for three nights on business.  Modern, large and well designed apartment space with a comfy bed. Not the cleanest unfortunately- lots of mould around the bathroom, a strange dark 'splat' drip mark on the outside of the toilet that stayed for the entire duration of my stay. Shower took a long time to warm up and had weak pressure (took a long time to even rinse shampoo out of my hair). Whilst I enjoyed the location (great 5-10min walk from the CBD, just across the bridge) the hotel was very noisy.  I had a room next to the lifts which were a bit noisy, but only being on level 6 I had the traffic noise from the busy highway opposite, and woken up by the garbage truck very early in the morning. Maybe ask for a river facing/high up room to have a quieter stay? On the plus side, breakfast was adequate and the staff were helpful. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472530306~“Quay West Delivers an Exquisite Stay”~I had never heard of QuayWest until we arrived in Melbourne, in the heart of the city, to the welcoming and helpful staff. We won’t soon forget it, as it is a beautiful hotel situated near everything you want to see and visit to experience Melbourne. Kudos to Tess and Alexandra who helped us get settled in and answered a myriad of questions with patience and kindness and always seemed happy to see us. Our 2-bedroom/2-bath apartment was absolutely stunning with an equally stunning view of the city off of a balcony that extended the entire length of the apartment accessible through the living room and each bedroom. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was eager to assist us in dining at the newest and best restaurants as well as navigating the extensive tram system and any other detail. You can’t go wrong at Quay West.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472351970~“A pleasant surprise!”~I had never stayed at a Quay West Suites before, but as a Le Club AccorHotels member, I thought I would give Quay West Suites Melbourne a try as I needed a place large enough to accommodate our group of four and wanted a place centrally located (since we were staying for six nights). We stayed in Suite 2601. Wow, this, I believe, had been a private apartment (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms) that the hotel took over. The kitchen was over-the-top amazing and large. We could see to St. Kilda from our suite and had four balconies (I did not even discover the fourth balcony until the last day!). Having an in-suite washer and dryer was a big plus as we were on a 25-day visit to Australia. Front desk staff were courteous and efficient, and the breakfast room staff were really nice, giving local advice to my mom who was visiting Australia for the first time. The pool area, albeit completely indoors, is really snazzy looking. Finally, the location on Southbank, close to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Federation Square and the National Gallery of Victoria, is ideal no matter what the weather. We received free wifi for six devices (I believe) since I am a Le Club AccorHotels member. Next time I visit Melbourne, I want to stay here!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472248406~“Exceptional stay!”~My husband and I stayed last Saturday night to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary. Our 1 br apartment was well set up and there appeared to be everything required to self-cater (but we wanted to eat out). We were delighted to find a beautiful card and bottle of sparkling wine on our arrival - such a thoughtful gesture.  The reception staff were efficient and accommodation was clean, well maintained and luxurious.  Our stay was fantastic and Quay West will be our number 1 choice for future city visits.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470708936~“Best location but tired and in need of maintenance”~We started in a 2-bedroom deluxe suite on the 16th floor and were upgraded to a 3-bedroom suite on the 21st floor because a river view for the fireworks had been requested. The first suite was tired and in need of care, plus the kitchen was hardly well equipped with a very limited view. The 21st floor was a different story entirely but there was a leak in the laundry ceiling which meant maintenance was called to stem the flow. We had a gorgeous view of the fireworks that night and a late checkout, but no free wifi!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~3~nan
review_469922137~“Last Week in Melbourne.”~Our first time at the Quay West Suites and I must say we were blown away. We were upgraded to a 3 bedroom suite on the 21st floor overlooking the Yarra River. The facilities were first class and I lost count of the number of balconies we had. Kathy the Duty Manager and her team were very friendly and looked after us extremely well. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_469429821~“First Class All The Way”~There was nothing NOT love about Quay West Apartments! A perfect location with amazing city views on the Yarra.  A perfect apartment that was stylish and comfortable with a great refurbished modern bathroom.  It was clean, practical and the best setting for a romantic weekend away.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating and nothing was ever a bother for them. From check in to our late check out we felt very special and have decided to make this wonderful place our "Annual Anniversary Get Away" :) Cant wait till next year!!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469276063~“Love the location. ”~We have stayed at Quay West numerous times over many years as we love the location.  The hotel is ideally located within walking distance to the City shops, restaurants, Flinders Street Station, Casino , MCG & Federation Square.  Check in - all went accordingly to plan. Staff were friendly.  Room - No upgrade as Platinum Accor members as the hotel was busy. Our 1 bedroom apartment was on the top floor which had a lovely view.  If the hotel wasn't so busy I would have asked to be moved as the sun was so bright we had to keep the curtains shut all the time which was annoying as we had a beautiful view.  Overall - rooms & kitchens now need a update as they are starting to show their age. Can't fault the location or facilities as all are outstanding. Probably stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467108818~“The Spot To Be!”~During my two night stay the highlights were, the location and some excellent service from the staff. On arrival the staff were very attentive and checkin was quick, considering I arrived ahead of time. Service like this makes all the difference and special mention to Helene for the friendly welcome. The rooms themselves were ok, particular the bathroom, which needed some renovation but overall the rooms were functional and spacious. I enjoyed the ability to wash a few clothes which was convenient and if you are travelling with family this would be a good option. The room had cooking facilities too but the food in Melbourne is delicious so need to cook. As mentioned the location was superb as there are lots of restaurants & bars to choose from. However there are better restaurants if you're prepared to go further a field (see other reviews). I ate breakfast at the Suites restaurant and the choices were, continental or full cooked breakfast which is fairly standard. In summary, I didn't have the best room and probably could have paid more for that experience but I enjoyed my stay in Melbourne. If you get these suites for the right price then stay here, as the location is excellent.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466852064~“great location and excellent apartment and service”~we stayed for a week in this complex. The staff were excellent -very helpful, courteous and responsive ( Paul/Sarah notably). The apartment was very quiet despite being directly behind the lift shaft though there was external noise on the Friday and Saturday nights. The apartment was well equipped and bed was very comfortable. All in all it was a great place to stay, albeit it comes at a price! Given that it was disappointing to see that free wifi is only there if you are an Accor club member - be better to put in the price.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_466533601~“Continues to impress..”~I reviewed Quay West a number of years ago but felt compelled to write another review. I stayed here with my daughter for a 5 night stay. After a 24 hour trip from the UK arriving at close to Midnight we were greeted by very friendly staff. We were immediately told that we had been upgraded to a room with a City view (which at any time of the day or night is spectacular). The suite was very clean and well maintained. Whilst we didn't eat in the room, the kitchen was well-equipped and certainly provides everything you need if you want to be more self-sufficient. The location is ideal for visiting all the various attractions Melbourne has to offer...many of which are within walking distance. Throughout our stay all the staff were very attentive and nothing was too much effort. I will definitely be returning and would highly recommend.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_464679903~“CBD Location Extraordinaire”~A great location for access to CBD, Southbank,Yarra cruises and Melbourne Park. Our stay twice in 3 years was for the Australia Open and served us well both times. Free wifi was nice the second time but the website does not make it clear unless you ask then you have to join their reward program to get the service. Nice pool, hot tub(spa) and gym. View room a must so you can see the river and other views of the city. One thing lacking was the kitchen utensils, etc. which for this class of accom. were not well thought out, supply wise.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

One of the best I have experienced Staff at our early check in were very good and we left luggage and were phoned when room was ready. Proper one bedroom suite with all necessary facilities. Cooked breakfast was somewhat limited but the range overall was good. Staff had adjusted toaster to produce good coloured toast without having to put the bread through twice.

review_461922495~“Great place to stay In Melbourne”~This was our first visit to Australia and Melbourne was our first stop. We loved the location of this place. We could walk or get the tram to everywhere that we wanted to go. We also had everything we needed in the apartment. Our original room didn't have quite the stunning view that I expected but we were able to move to a room with an incredible, full on, city view for our third night. Some of the room decor is a bit tired but overall I can really recommend this as a very good place to stay.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_461868039~“saddens me that i have to give an average review”~The only thing this hotel/suites has going for it, is its location, and the comfortable bed. When we arrived we checked in and found they had given us a room with a queen bed when I did specify king, due to being 8 months pregnant and needing the extra room. Claire Marie on the front desk was very helpful in fixing the situation and changed our room. We also received free parking which was a bonus. On arriving back to our room after dinner on the first night, we wanted to watch a movie, only to have the baggage man (very friendly by the way, only been working there a month) come up to have a look and apologise it wasn't working and would be fixed the next day by maintenance.. so we had to sit there and do nothing which was disappointing, and after paying over $300 p/n. Also you cannot watch movies in the bedroom, only in the lounge on the very uncomfortable couch. Whats the point of having a super comfy bed and tv in the bedroom if you cant even laydown to relax and watch a movie. They offer a nespresso coffee machine in the room and display all the different types of coffee pods you can use, but don't even have them all on offer, after I called up to get the weakest strength pod they said they would look but never got back to me. Also the milk wasn't replaced. Over all I wouldn't stay here again, for the price we paid we could of stayed somewhere much nicer with better service and facilities.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan

review_460173469~“No Book of Mormon”~Interestingly, this is the first hotel I've ever stayed in that doesn't have a copy of the Bible in the night stand. Ironically appropriate since I was in Melbourne to attend a performance of "The Book of Mormon". Brilliant show and so beautifully 'wrong' in every respect! Nothing wrong about the Quay West Suites. Nothing. Perfect location. Generous to a fault. Massive room with perfect, relaxing views across the Yarra Yarra River to the iconic Melbourne skyline, including 'en suite' rowing teams training under the Princes Bridge! All the staff are adorable, friendly and ridiculously helpful & accommodating. Nothing too complicated, including brilliant restaurant recommendations based on time commitments and dietary preferences (I'll review those later). If there has to be an issue: well, perhaps the 'in house' dining & bar options could be reviewed. Many of us like to dine 'post theatre' etc. The house seems to close a little early. I'll be back!

Apartments are clean and spacious (we are a family of 5) and everything is at your doorstep (shrine, gardens, southbank, casino, shopping, free city circle tram, and amazing restaurants) so it is the prefect location.

We had a one bedroom apartment on the 14th floor with amazing city views.  The apartment was super clean with lovely amenities.  Headed down for breakfast the next morning and it was the young man Malcolm's first day.  What beautiful customer service and a great sense of humour, nothing was too much h bother for this bubbly young man.  Everything was simply wonderful and would stay here again in a heart beat.  Do yourself a favour and choose this place for your next stay in Melbourne.  The location is great, walking distance to a lot of places and very comfy bed for a great night's sleep.

review_457466301~“Great rooms, great location, great service”~Quay West Suites must have a claim on being the best hotel in Melbourne. We spent just the one night.  Location - nicely tucked in behind Hamer Hall with ready access to South Bank and the Arts precinct. So, it's close to Flinders Street Station and St Kilda Road trams.  Rooms - We were on the 20th Floor in a two bedroom apartment, light-filled, airy, meticulously presented with a kitchen, sitting room, dining room, two bathrooms and a large balcony overlooking the river. We were upgraded as Accor Advantage Plus members so I am less able to speak on value generally for this.  Service - The friendly, professional and attentive service at reception at check-in and check-out (and with each coming & going) was excellent.  Food - We did not use the restaurant, bar or room service.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_457320592~“Awesome location”~Fab location. Spacious room with everything you need. Serviced daily with clean sheets and towels. Friendly staff and lovely breakfast with so much variety. Only gripe was the shower was so small. Other than that we had a fabulous stay and will definitely be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457283054~“Great location. ”~We wanted a 2 BR unit with small kitchen and this is great. It is near the river and restaurants and all CBD sights.  The main thing to know is that the washer/dryer is a tiny, combination unit. I had planned to do laundry in Melbourne but this unit is tiny and you can't dry while something else washes. I ended up hang drying a lot and washing stuff by hand.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_456820719~“Great location, value for money, attentive and cheerful staff!”~Stayed 2 nights late Jan 2017. Our room was a one bedroom suite with balcony, overlooking the Yarra River and Melbourne CBD. Room was spotless, kitchenette had everything you would want on a short stay, bed was fantastic as was the bed linen. Room service menu is quite extensive, well priced and our meals were superb. Would recommend this place over any of the major Hotel chains as you have alot more room, a balcony, and has a little less pomp and ceremony. Great value for money.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456636075~“Good 3.5 stars....well located hotel and spacious suite”~Stayed in a 1 bedroom suite for 2 nights for business. Suite was spacious with kitchen, living area, bedroom and bathroom. Rooms were large and airy. I wasn't high enough to get a view but there was also a large outdoor area. Positives - big rooms, very friendly staff, location on riverbank. Cons - sheets were a little scratchy, the bathroom needs a refresh as marks in bath, shows screen feels old and flimsy, mini bar not replenished after first night. Perfectly adequate hotel, definitely above average but not quiet enough to be hitting very good status.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_455537942~“Urine Stained Bedsheets - Horrific ”~Our experience at the Quay West Suites was definitely an experience. We had to stay during the Australian Open which meant inflated rates of 3 times the standard. We were visiting for other personal reasons and conceeded to pay over $600 each night for 1 bedroom suite.  On the 1st night of our 3 night stay we were sleeping in the bed and due to the bed being "short sheeted" on one side, I had to get out of bed to tuck the sheets back in. To my absolute horror & disguist (yes strong word "disguist" but it was gross), the matress protector had a huge (mansized) yellow (urinelike) stain on it.  I was so grossed out, that at 1.30am I had to call the Reception/Night Duty Manager to change the protector as I could not knowingly put my sheets back over that to continue sleeping. My husband was woken up and went to sit waiting on the sofa whilst we waited for it to be replaced..... However..... Following 4 visits to our room to bring 1.another badly stained protector which had to be swapped, 2.a single wrong sized protector which had to be swapped, 3.a plastic protector which I definitely refused to sleep on and 4.a queen sized wrong sized again - one. TillI finally got the right one after 30mins of revisiting our room and knocking - at which point I said I'd make the bed myself.... I burst into tears... We had an extremely important event that was happening that day and I was exhausted from being caught up in the horrific Bourke St manic driver tragedy and had to sleep it off to prepare for the event we had travelled to Melbourne especially for. My tears were bourne from frustration & fatigue, this was not acceptable of a hotel supposedly of this calibre and charging this rate. At this point my husband went to complain that his wife was making their own bed in tears. To which the Night Duty Manager remarked that he didnt know why it was such a big deal and that the porter had come to help and was refused by me...  When I heard that I couldnt believe it?  I want to say that following that night, they moved us the next day, which was an inconveniece but we appreciated it because we previously had a view of a roof and was a BAD room in the first place, so whilst it was not an upgrade in anyway, we got an improved view.  At no time did they offer to compensate us for the inconvenience or awful experience that we had that 1st night. Following up, I would have appreciated an apology of some kind and I even emailed them these images I captured that night of the protector. But alas, they havent even seen fit to respond to my email. This is extremely poor service.  Most of all... 1)how does a hotel have systems in place to retain such badly stained bed linen? 2) I can't imagine how someone would knowingly make a bed for soeone to sleep on with such a badly "urine" stained linen in the 1st place?  3)Let alone have the replacement be just as stained?  4)Let alone be so indignant to state that its not a big deal?  5)Let alone not even provide an apology for such poor service.  I will say that other then the Night Duty Manager, the other staff were extremely nice and attentive but it falls short that the hotels policy does not even provide a means of apology or retribution by means of reimbursing us even a portion, for that night - in anyway?! I cannot stress enough how you should check your sheets/protector/pillows etc if staying at Quay West Suites Melbourne. You may be sleeping on a "urine stained" protector too! Afterall its not a big deal??!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_453470257~“Comfortable and convenient ”~I often stay at Quay West Suites and it's always a pleasant experience. The self-contained suites are clean, stylish and spacious with good size bedrooms and living areas. Food is good quality and reasonably priced. The gym contains a good range of cardio equipment, and there's a really nice indoor pool for relaxing or swimming laps. Quay West is in a wonderful location on Southbank and central to a range of terrific restaurants, cafes and bars. It's only a short stroll to Flinders Street train station, Royal Botanic Gardens and various sporting arenas. Comfortable and convenient accommodation.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453192584~“Recent stay for Australian Open”~I would definately recommend Quay West Suites. Myself and my 14 year old son stayed here as we were attending the Australian Open tennis and the hotel is within walking distance. Excellent location,facilities and staff. Room was clean and spacious. Lovely views. Only downside is the restaurant is a little small at peak times like breakfast. Hotel was at compacity though and it was handled well by staff. We were offered a table in the bar area and moved into the main area when a table became available. Would definitely stay again and recommend to family and friends.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452260367~“A surprising experience”~We chose this hotel because the function were were in Melbourne to attend was held at the hotel. No looking for a taxi afterwards. We were absolutely delighted with the one bedroom suite we had booked. Although it was not one of the front rooms, it served our purpose brilliantly. Bed comfort, a must for me was excellent as was the cleanliness of the bathroom. Living room was well appointed with a setting for 4, which proved to be a boon for we had booked 2 rooms, but were able to all sit at the same table for morning tea. Very happy with the helpful staff who seemed to enjoy their job. This is an excellent place for a function the service & canapes were superb. Well recommended as it is close to the CBD. Also close proximity to all the Southbank restaurants~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451730670~“Holidays”~Will return! Special mention about Jason's level of service he made us feel very welcome and nothing was a problem to make our stay comfortable.

review_451477168~“Great views and location”~From the moment we pulled up outside we knew we had made the right choice. As soon as we opened the car door Gary was there with a baggage trolley to assist us entering for check in and arranging the valet parking. A very warm reception from Kathy who handled our check in and unexpectedly changed us to a higher floor to get a better view of the city and river upstream. Our suite was on the 14th floor and oh boy the view was absolutely amazing especially at night with all the buildings and river illuminated. Suite was very spacious with fully equipped kitchen, nicely furnished lounge with dining area, flat screen TV and balcony at the far end. The bedroom was of a good size with the best view of the city and with adjacent bathroom beautifully finished and again with the best view from a bath we have ever had. Bed was extremely comfortable and linen crisp and clean with ultra soft white towels in the bathroom. Quay West is ideally located on the Southbank with numerous good restaurants within a 5 min walk. It is also only a 10 min walk across the river into the main shopping area or along to the Crown Casino complex. The breakfast was very good with again very friendly staff and a good selection of cereals, hot food, pastries and fruit etc. Check out was as good as check in within 5 mins of ringing down to Consierge desk we had our cases collected and car waiting out front. If you want a well located hotel with exceptional service and a friendly interactive team then look no further.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_450020089~“Yet another 5 star experience - Quay west beats the rest hands down”~A special night celebrating our 19th Wedding Anniversary after what has been a difficult year for us, so was a belated anniversary - this made it all the more special that the stay was just perfect! From reservation to check in and check out, although only being one night we were dealt with efficiently, professionally and with the friendly service I have come to know Quay West Suites staff for. We had kindly been upgraded to a room with a city view which made our evening there spectacular, looking over St Paul's, Flinders St Station and the Yarra, truly magical with the Christmas lights also. Our suite was freshly presented, clean and equipped well with all we could need for our stay. the bed demands a mention - THE most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in (and we are fussy!). The room was spacious with plenty of space additionally in the mirrored robes area for our bags etc. plus a roomy en suite with spa bath and shower. I took advantage of the stunning pool and spa that are available at Quay West and enjoyed a refreshing dip and relaxing soak in the spa afterwards. We ate an early dinner at the Jarrah Bar/Restaurant which was delicious and enjoyed being able to sit outside and people watch as it was a balmy evening in Melbourne. Breakfast the next morning was great; a good selection of freshly cooked hot options such as scrambled eggs, bacon and mushrooms plus plenty of continental style cold options, pastries etc. Breakfast staff were very attentive and helpful, and the breakfast area had a nice quiet atmosphere. i shouldn't be surprised as I have stayed here before but it is still a surprise to me that Quay West manages to deliver in all key areas for a city stay and has that certain something which makes you feel appreciated as a guest - highly recommend for business, couples and family travellers. You may book for the location but you will return for the service and the quality!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_449011708~“Convenient and comfortable”~The apartments are comfortable and in a great location. It is a short walk across the bridge to the main part of the city. It is also a short walk to the restaurants down at the Crown casino. The breakfast at the hotel is average. I would walk up to one of the cafes in town next time. We had a problem with one of the rooms we booked. This was solved by moving our daughter to a room on another floor. This was a pity as you need key access to get to each floor so we had to meet in the lobby. After the move she ended up with a room with a view straight into a car park. Our view wasn't much better but we were a bit higher on the 10th floor so it didn't look quite so bad. The staff are very friendly and overall we had a comfortable stay.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_448403258~“New Year's Eve at Quay West”~This was our third New Year staying at Quay West Suites. It has an amazing location for viewing the fireworks, particularly if you have a Premium suite as we did - overlooking the Yarra from the 12th floor so the view is excellent. I could not speak more highly about the staff at Quay West. Both the reception staff and the staff in the breakfast room cannot be faulted, the seem to work incredibly long hours, but still are unfailingly helpful and all is done with a friendly smile. The reasons that we probably won't repeat the New Year's experience again are as follows: Staying in a hotel (even an apartment one), you expect certain facilities, especially for the price we were charged. The hotel has a restaurant and a bar. The bar was open for a few hours on the day we checked in (New Year's Eve), but has not been open since. We were a group of eight in four rooms and planned to meet at the bar on New Year's Day for predinner cocktails. We were very surprised to be told that it was closed as it was a public holiday. I have never known a hotel close their bar before. The restaurant was unavailable for dinner on both days of our stay - presumably for the same reasons. The second issue with the terrible breakfast, which while it was included in our exorbitantly high rates, is still paid for by us. On New Year's Day the breakfast was frantic. As previously mentioned, the staff were excellent, but simply couldn't cope with the hordes of people. Stupidly they started breakfast at 7:00am and apparantly no-one was there then. What a surprise on New Year's Day! By the time we arrived at breakfast around 9:30am, it was packed. We managed to secure a table but it was all down hill from there. The supplied food constantly ran out and the staff were run off of their feet and unable to keep it replaced. The bircher muesli was like a rock and totally inedible. The scrambled eggs looked like pebbles - also inedible. Upon ordering eggs we were told it would be at least a 20 minute wait. Some of our friends ordered poached eggs and they too came out like rocks. This morning (2nd January), we got to breakfast earlier and it was understandably much quieter. Sadly though the food had not improved. I asked for Eggs Benedict and was told that was an extra charge! No idea why as the buffet had eggs and ham. I did get some very nice poached eggs today, but again, inedible bircher muesli and a general lack of interesting food - no sausages, hash browns, pancakes, grilled tomaotes, baked beans, pastries - just the standard bacon, mushrooms, scrambled eggs. For a hotel charging 4-5 star prices we definitely only received 3 star facilities - hence my rating.~3~2~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_448178835~“Great stay in heart of South Bank”~Stayed for 3 nights for work as all the approved hotels for my company were booked out. I was really pleasantly surprised with the location and the scale of the apartment. My particular suite had great views of the city skyline and quite a large balcony - which I did use given some warm weather. I didn't use any of the facilities I can't speak for those but overall had a very pleasant experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447100815~“Spacious, lovely service and great location ”~Title says it all.. it is an excellent location and the rooms are really spacious. We were in a one bedroom apartment, and the kitchen was large, nice sized loungeroom with a balcony, and a spa bath in the ensuite. Great central cooling system. The staff were very accommodating, allowing us to leave our car in the car park for the day after checking out. The pool is gorgeous and there is a nice spa and gym. Breakfast was standard buffet breakfast but they did cook eggs to your liking on request which is a nice touch. I'd definitely recommend staying here for those coming to Melbourne and wanting something central. The only thing that was a bit inconvenient was the bathroom is through the bedroom, so when our one year old was asleep in the bedroom and we needed a shower or the toilet or to brush our teeth, we had to try and be super quiet. Not a huge issue though.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Our terms were inclusive of breakfast - very satisfactory but busy - otherwise the apartment has a well equipped kitchen, washer/dryer as is the Aus. norm. Large living room, but the apartment is now looking tired. The position is ideal for the Southbank/CBD and on that score is well worth the rating. Indoor pool, with gym. Valet parking but you don't want a car in the CBD! We are likely to return.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan

review_445479048~“Nothing fancy...”~Location great. Arrived early am from 30 hrs of international flying . No door man to help with bags . Our reservation could not be located easily by surname which was odd and after 5 mins and my 2 frantic calls to the states they found our reservation. Our 2 bedroom suite was very large, but felt like a dorm room that was " upgraded". This is not a fancy place. The beds were very comfortable and had nice linens. Both showers had mold and mildew which was not acceptable and someone tried the new grout on top trick which does not work- Its would have been a noisy night without our white noise machine given location of our room over stage door to performing arts hall.  The breakfast buffet was nice but over priced. Definitely opt for a short walk to Degraves Street for  Breakfast across the river in a cafe. A much nicer option. The washing machine in the unit was a plus. if looking for a splendid place to stay look else where. Quay West Suites is functional.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_444401836~“Location and service”~We stayed at the Quay west for seven nights last month. Very warm welcoming by a smiley staff, very quick check in. The location is the main advantage with this hotel, close to the city center, with a lot of dinning all along the river which is just at the step door. The room was a one bedroom suite located on the 8th level. it was spacious with nice furniture and a well equipped kitchen (Nespresso machine included). The balcony was really enjoyable, even though the view wasn't on the river. We really loved the spa and the pool area which has been renovated not long ago. We had a breakfast included which was convenient before heading into the city. Very good options for the breakfast, where you can also order your eggs your way. A lot of choice of hot and cold food, which was also very fresh.  Tried the room service, very tasty risotto and very fast to be delivered, worth a try. The only problem we had was a random strident noise in the hallway coming from the water meter, happening a few time during the night, managing to wake us up. The second night I had to inform the front desk of the situation, and they tried to find us another room, which was not possible as the hotel was fully booked (They offered a studio but that wasn't really what we paid for). The staff really did their best, and saying that they would send someone first thing in the morning, guess it was an unfortunate situation. Did happen again the third night, but not again for the rest of our stay.  Overall very nice hotel serviced apartment with excellent location, and good service, would recommend.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~5~nan
review_443678925~“Great welcome on arrival, love the rooms, perfect location”~These apartments were recommended by a friend after a quote from another serviced apartment was extortionate. On arrival the reception staff were very friendly, helpful and very kindly upgraded us to a room with a view.  The apartments themselves are perfect - plenty of room to move around, fully equipped kitchen with dishwasher, microwave and washing machine. everything is comfortable and a balcony to sit outside. All of this is great, but the best thing about these apartments is the location - everything is a short walk away. We did not need our car (parking is included) and we hardly used public transport - everything is within walking distance. And compared to the quote we had from the other apartments, it was $1300 cheaper for three nights (the others must have been joking!!!!!!)~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_441837701~“Not recommended ”~Would not recommend at all. Turned up with cases and I'm on walking stick, both night managers stood there and watched me struggle, didn't open door or take bags to my room!! So wrong. Room was small, now view and not clean. Rangehood fell off while I was cooking dinner and it was full of fat and oil. Tv remote didn't work properly and tv kept changing channels on its own. It was disgusting. Mould in the shower. Pool facilities nice but extremely hard to access if you on a walking stick. Reception don't answer buzzer if you ring from there. Restaurant staff for breakfast were fantastic in helping me, food was lovely. Night managers could learn a hell of a lot from them.

review_439146791~“Love the location”~Tucked away close to the Arts Centre, Crown Casino and restaurants. Take a stroll along the Yarra, walk in to the city centre and enjoy the shopping,or pop over to the Botanical Gardens.Our one bedroom apartment was extremely comfortable with large balcony opening from both the living and bedroom area. Kitchen was well equipped and included a dishwasher and washing machine, great if you are visiting for an extended stay. Did notice a bit of wear and tear throughout the apartment so probably ready for a bit of a make over in the near future. Breakfast was quite good and a fair range to select from and all local newspapers available. Sat out in the evening and enjoyed a glass of bubbles, barman was very polite and had a few tips on what to see while staying at the hotel. The hotel is tucked away and not easy to find if you are not familiar with Melbourne so look it up on the internet to get driving instructions. We were early arriving but a room was made available to us straight away and luggage arrived in a timely manner. Not the cheapest place to stay in Melbourne but if you want space in a quite location it does the job.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan

review_438147984~“Outstanding alternative to a conventional 5-star hotel, excellent location!”~Stayed here for one night in mid-November after failing to secure a reasonably priced room at the Park Hyatt (where I’d wanted to stay again after being well taken care of a couple of weeks earlier). I booked a studio room, and arrived to find I’d been upgraded to a premium room (with separate bedroom) on a high floor with clear view of the Yarra and Flinders St. Bridge. The lobby doesn’t quite exude the ambiance of a conventional 5-star hotel, but that seems like a small price for the extra floor space in the room. I had the beautiful pool to myself once in the evening, then again the next morning. The only shortcoming, perhaps, is that there is no changing area, so far as I could tell, so you need to robe up and change in your room (life could be tougher).  The buffet breakfast, included in the room rate, was a very pleasant affair. Generous check-out time of 11am, reception staff were courteous, respectful and efficient on the way out (and in). Departed well satisfied, making for the bridge, for a short walk back to the city proper and location of my appointment that morning. A very positive experience in all.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437963366~“It took a while to grow no me”~When I first arrived I thought very little of this accommodation as the room was low down, dark and fairly unappealing. The staff at reception were very welcoming besides that. At first I found the shower recess quite cramped and I felt the over sized shower head was trying to blast me out of this time what was already a small space. Better whe nI found you could tilt it to the side. I spent some more time on day two seeking out something special and found what I consider perhaps the jewel in this accommodation, the gym, pool and steam room. Make sure you get to level five, it made me feel sane after a good workout in the gym and a good stint in the steam room. Now to test out Level Ps cocktails lounge. Enjoy...it take a while sometimes...~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_437680496~“Mixed bag.......”~I would return to the Quay West for the staff and breakfasts alone but never the room. We stayed at Quay West for three nights during a business trip and found it to be a rather interesting stay. Never have I stayed anywhere my stay felt so conflicted. On one hand I could not fault the staff,far from it, they are knowledgeable, helpful, just flat out super nice friendly. The breakfast layout each morning in the dining room was fabulous as is the hotels location to Southbank and the CBD ! However, the room - Oh dire ! Our room was in a mid-renovation state. A mash up of styles was evident from the bed linen to the decor. The ceiling cornice was incomplete, missing curtain pelmet, Falling down curtain on both corners. A king bed made from two singles with a mattress topper and a bathroom that had no working extraction fan. It was just a dull and uninteresting room with no personality to speak of - with a price tag that matched many 5 star hotels we felt the room was seriously overvalued. Would I return ? I would definitely be asking if the upgrade has been completed and reconsider.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437652918~“Melbourne Cup!”~We arrived on Saturday 29th October and left 2nd November. We flew over from NZ for the Melbourne Cup. The staff are all very friendly and very helpful. The hotel is so close to everything. You just walk out the hotel doors turn left, and you have so many amazing restaurants and bars to choose from. Flinders Street train station is just a 5 min walk across the bridge. We caught the train on Melbourne cup day and it took us direct to Flemington Racecourse. We stayed in the one bedroom deluxe suite. It was very nice. The bed and pillows were so comfy. I usually get a sore back when I sleep in a different bed, but I woke up fine! They had a delonghi coffee machine with complimentary nespresso capsules. I'm not usually a big fan on these machines, but the coffee was great! The only negative thing I would probably say about the room is that the lighting was not the best, and the bathroom was a little bit on the small size. Apart from that I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_437272319~“Very Convenient”~This apartment hotel is well situated in Southbank in Melbourne with very spacious and comfortable rooms.

review_434937484~“Great property. ”~We stayed here for two night on the last weekend of the Spring racing carnival. I booked as an Accor member and received a great rate on a busy weekend. On arrival we were upgraded to an apartment on the top floor with a balcony and the valet parking was only $30 per night. The rooms were brilliant, the bed was great there is a full mini bar and breakfast was included. (I think as an Accor member). Top notch, the staff could not have been more helpful. We'll definitely be staying here again. Thank you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434189555~“Beautiful place, friendly staff and roomy apartments.”~Love these apartments and so close to everything. If you want a great restaurant just walk out of the hotel and there is plenty to choose from. The staff are lovely and rooms are gorgeous. Comfy bed which is always important. Food is great is the restaurant whether dinner or breakfast. Definately a good choice~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433501651~“Great service and wonderful hotel”~We booked a two bedroom apartment for 4 nights. When we arrived we got an upgrade at no extra cost to a 3 bedroom apartment.

review_432624277~“Always enjoy staying here”~I'm so over being disappointed in other Melbourne accommodations, so from now on we'll always get the 1 Bedroom Premium Suite River View, they are located levels 10-15 with a side view towards the River. These suites are spacious & comfortable with access to the balcony from the bedroom as well as the lounge. The kitchen looks well equipped, however we make the most of the location & eat out. The current buffet breakfast is the best we've had for quite a while. I particularly enjoyed the spinach & guava smoothie & bircher muesli with dried & fresh fruit & follow up with a custom order of poached eggs. There was an enticing looking fruit toast, but alas I couldn't eat that much. The staff have always been very friendly & helpful & the valet parking is worth using. Within 100m you have the Lindt Café, Bearbrass Grill, that's great for drinks & easy food or our favourite, the Waterfront restaurant. Easily stroll across either bridge & you're on the edge of the city centre where you can make use of the free city centre trams to get around easily. Don't miss a walk along the Southbank Promenade towards the Crown Casino to see the 8 Towers light up on the hour from 8pm on weekends or 9pm weeknights.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432571147~“Feels Like I'm Home When I Get To Quay West Southbank”~My wife and I had a short break in October last year to celebrate her birthday and stayed for a few days at the Quay West Suites at Southbank. We booked a premium city view one bedroom suite and were pleasantly surprised that for once a hotel lived up to it's own room description. Our room was on a high floor (level 23 from memory) directly facing the Yarra and Flinders St Station. The room was spacious with a separate bedroom, a spacious furnished balcony perfect for breakfast with the bedroom and lounge room both opening onto the balcony. The room had quality features with a great kitchen, a separate compartment for the clothes washer and dryer, blue ray, big screen TV, nice dining table and comfortable lounge area. Special mention for the beds and doona - the best, most comfortable combination I have ever slept on in my travels to almost 40 countries. All this and reasonably priced compared to some other high profile hotels. For example it's next door to the Langham, and not far from Crown and I guarantee you the Quay is better for service and room quality and value for money (book early is the tip to get an early bird special including breakfast). My wife and I have just returned from a slightly longer jaunt to Tasmania and Victoria and again we stayed 3 nights at Quay West for her birthday this week. This time we got very lucky and received a room upgrade to the premium 3 bedroom suite, yep the best room in the house, top floor overlooking the Yarra and Melbourne city. My wife's birthday just got made a little bit more special by the great people at Quay West. What really sets Quay West apart from the others is it just feels homey. The reception staff are friendly and if you want to have a chat or ask questions, they have time for you. If you ask something they don't know, they will find out for you. This visit the staff topped our previous stay with a little birthday cake (yum) and a bottle of bubbly - they even got the day right and I don't recall making a big deal about the exact birthdate. Nice breakfast spread each morning, and a great swimming pool. The gym is reasonable with your standard steppers, treadmills, cycles and good to see a rowing machine. Some free weights and a legpress for those so inclined. Nice sauna and steam room. I could easily live at the Quay West Southbank. Thanks from the Smiths for a fantastic stay and we look forward to our next visit.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_430716848~“40th bday”~Stayed here for 2 nights in a one bedroom apartment.  Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff are very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast buffet in the jarrah restaurant was ok. Plenty of food choices. Excellent position easy walk to city centre and casino etc. Nice quiet room. I didn't have a view though which I was a bit disappointed with as paid over $400 a night to stay here. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458610879~“Excellent”~Having travelled thousands of miles over the years and stayed in great properties, I have to say that Quay Plaza is up there with them.  The position is amazing right by the Yarra river, walkways running tracks botanic gardens all close by. We walked in greeted by the lovely Helena and Cathy, who I just adored. I naturally didn't like the first room but I never do any where in the world I go for at least the 3rd. I was shown to the river view apartment, it had everything in it, sitting room, kitchen, with white goods. Bedroom bathroom corner bath, what more could a hotel guest want. Free wifi, free breakfast and fab staff. Have to mention Sarah too the manageress who kindly allowed the room change and also rushed to rescue me in the lift, that was my husbands fault. The room was cleaned every day. Breakfast was great served with a smile. Loved it. Highly recommend will definitely go back. Thank you ladies you are fab.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_478078975~“Great location, great apartments ”~Spent 10 nights in a one bed apartment. Clean, tidy and well maintained. Gym, pool and steam room were an added bonus. To be honest, the only bad thing I have to say about it was the bar. Served good beer, wine and food but was rarely open.  I regularly came down at 8 or 9 pm to find it close despite it advertising its open 5pm til late! I caught the staff closing at 8 pm one evening. When I asked for a drink they said that would serve it but I would have to take it to my room. When I asked why they were closing so early, they said it was because they had no customers. I was a little surprised as I was sure I was, at the very least 'a customer'. Very odd!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477867151~“Top quality customer service ”~Stayed for one night but i wish i had more time. Mum and i were treated so kindly by the staff. The hotel and rooms are clean and everything is an easy walk. Breakfast was good and a few extra hot options like pancakes would be great, but i'm being picky. I parked my rental car overnight and was only charged $30 for a day and a half. I will definitely be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477179890~“comfortable, professional and for us a great location”~We arrived from America into Melbourne in the morning and took the bus transport to the hotel. From the minute we arrived to the minute we checked out this hotel staff was very welcoming, professional and helpful to a few issues we had to deal with. My luggage got ripped from LAX to Melbourne and the head hotel engineer named Jack spent time helping me put duck tape on the corners so I could use it for the rest of my stay. He also had to replace a broken coffee unit and went through 2 of them until they found one that actually was working well. Check in was fabulous and easy and they gave us a wonderful suite. All front desk associates were friendly, helpful and generous with their time. We had prepaid for our hotel room and breakfast for the 4 days we stayed there.They even loaned me a 120-to 110 outlet charger converter for my i-phone when I discovered the one I had was not working. We found the breakfast choices of hot and cold food very good and a good selection of free newspapers to read. We enjoyed the indoor pool and amenities. The Location in Southgate was excellent for us since we went to the ballet, Botanical gardens, Rod Laver Tennis center and museums. Everything was in walking distance we never took a bus anywhere as we discovered the city. You can easily take cabs from the hotel, but my suggestion is to bring some comfortable shoes and get out and explore. We loved Melbourne and hope we can come back here someday. We would never hesitate to stay At Quay West Suites again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476279427~“Second time here, wont be the last”~Stayed here over Easter weekend with my family and we had an absolute ball. Check in staff were lovely and made you feel comfortable straight away. We booked a 3 bedroom apartment and were given 2601 which is on the top level of the Residential side of the hotel so had an amazing view of the arts centre spire, MCG and the Yarra. Multiple balconies surrounded the whole apartment and the main one had chairs on it and some fake grass making it feel very modern Decor wasn't the most modern however but that didn't affect our stay.  Kitchen/Lounge was huge and plenty of space to sit around the 2 dining tables or all on the giant couch. Very centrally located on Southbank and only a 2 minute walk to the Langham (best buffet breakfast in Melbourne) Valet parking $30 a day was reasonable considering Crown charges $55.  The included breakfast was ok but nothing to really rave about. Small variety of hot food: eggs, bacon, sausage and tomato but everything I had was good and the coffee was excellent. I liked that you could get barista coffee. Wifi worked well for the very little I used it. TV in main bedroom didn't work but all the other ones did, plenty of channels to choose from~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475436818~“top 3 night stay”~This was our 4th stay at Quay West in Melbourne. As always the staff were brilliant, very friendly & efficient. The apartment was on the 14th floor with city views. The rooms had been rejuvenated since our last stay. We had breakfast in the jarrah restaurant each morning & the food choice was great. We think Quay West is so much nicer than the big flashy hotels. We will be back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475364248~“Excellent Hospitality - saved our trip”~For an apartment style hotel that we have enjoyed staying at before, we were initially dissapointed at an unusual smell when we entered our room. We were lucky enough to be helped by excellent staff (especially Michael) who were able to change our room. By a stroke of luck and by way of hotel generosity, we found ourselves in an upgraded room, with magnificent views, and a perfect ambience. The swimming pool and gym area were excellent, the room service extremely rapid, and the hospitality of the front desk went above and beyond. Looking forward to another stay!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_474489418~“Wonderful location, property and staff exceeded all expectations”~Travelling as 2 couples, We had decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a 2 bedroom apartment. Quay West suites proved to be the ideal accommodation in every regard. Unbeatable location - easy walk to Federation Sq, Bourke St mall, Flinders Lane restaurants and the Casino. Without exception, every staff member, whether at front desk or in Jarrah restaurant, was friendly, helpful, professional and knowledgeable. Each did their utmost to make our stay so memorable and enjoyable . The apartment was very well appointed, proving to be spacious and comfortable, with fantastic views of the river towards the MCG and other sporting venues in one direction and as far as The bayside area in the distance. Very happy to highly recommend this property.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474428330~“Central, Safe and Sensational”~A friend and I spent a short weekend in Melbourne together, basing ourselves at the Quay West Suites in Southgate. Such a central location! It's what you expect from Quay West - excellent quality, good size rooms with lovely finishings, quality bathroom (ours had a full bath, marble flooring, tiles and vanity top), excellent amenities -- a pool (which is rather gorgeous), gym and steam room, plus a range of eateries which we didn't avail ourselves of, preferring to be out and about in Melbourne. This is an ideal location to base yourself in, with Flinders Street Station a few steps across the bridge, the art district literally on your doorstep, the CBD a few blocks away, and Southgate literally spitting distance. It's all at your doorstep, either places to go or places to get you where you want to go. Not the cheapest accommodation you'd be able to find, but good value for what you get.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_474409823~“Amazing place to stay ”~Stayed here with my 2 daughters for 5 nights for a dance related visit. Was very pleased when we arrived someone was there to unload our luggage onto a trolley with valet parking. Even though we arrived at 2pm our room wasn't ready which was the only small disappointment for our entire stay. After a long drive and needing to have my daughter changed and at a dance lesson by 4 it made me a little anxious.  But we were in our room by 230 and it was amazing. All staff were friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. Our room was a spacious 2 bedroom apartment with river and city views. Gallery kitchen with a nice little table and chairs to eat breakfast with views. Seperate dining room and lounge room, balcony with setting and the main bedroom had a beautiful king bed with a really big ensuite with bath. Both bedrooms had televisions and the wifi was speedy. Plenty of storage room and robes and slippers. The pool was lovely and warm which the girls loved and even though the gym was only small it was very well equipped. I have stayed in other apartments in Southbank and this is by far my favourite place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474329929~“Family stay made perfection thanks to True 5 Star Quality”~A return trip to Quay West Suites as a family for a much-needed city break this time. I was warmly greeted by staff and acknowledged as an Accor Loyalty member with a welcome letter and upgrade. Not all hotel chains are so particular about rewarding and welcoming loyal members as Accor are, so this was appreciated.  Our apartment had a stunning river view and all the space and comforts one could possibly need whilst enjoying Melbourne. The room was quiet, as requested, and combined with a seriously comfy bed and block out blinds ensured a dream sleep experience. Plenty of room and storage space in the gorgeous ensuite for everything also,  The beauty of apartment/suites stays for families, especially, is the convenience of a fully equipped kitchen. As with the rest of the suite the kitchen was immaculately clean and well equipped with dishwasher, oven, full size fridge, microwave and even coffee machine. We relaxed enjoying the superb view of the city across the Yarra and the Arts Centre Spire, before heading down for an evening meal at the Jarrah Bar before our trip to the Arts Centre. The staff are the absolute best at Quay West, professional but friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to provide assistance. Paul very kindly helped my son and I navigate the TV channels to the movies without making us feel a nuisance at all, much appreciated when my son needed some "down" TV time!  The wonderful bar man (whose name I sadly didn't get) at Jarrah helped us choose a meal for my son (who is at that awkward dining age - adult appetite not always an adult taste!) and my son was very happy with his meal indeed. My friend and I enjoyed a selection of delicious vegetarian dishes from the bar menu entrees with our pre-show drinks.The cauliflower and cheese croquettes are a must dry - bite size and delicious!  Our breakfasts were up to the Quay West very high standard; a wide selection of fresh continental, fruit, pastry and cooked breakfast options to please all. The mini fruit smoothies were a special favourite with my son, and a great option for a quick healthy breakfast. Breakfast staff were on the ball, clearing dishes promptly but never obtrusively and always with a friendly smile or greeting. If you are staying here, do make the time to experience the stunning pool on the 5th floor, complete with a relaxing spa to indulge in. It was clean and sparkling (I am fussy with my pools!) and well provided with plenty of clean towels and change rooms. All in all, it is fantastic to see Quay West retaining its reputation for 5 Star Accommodation in the heart of Melbourne without losing the personal and friendly touch of the staff who truly make it worth returning to. I do not often write a review so glowing but I cannot fault my stay at all!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

The room was so adequate and had everything you could want or need. The location is perfect! close to everything from Burke St, Lygon, Degraves , Theatres, DFO and dining along Southbank.

review_473473690~“Melbourne trip”~This was my third time staying at this hotel over the last three weeks  All business trips so all work and no play. From check to check out you are made feel very welcome, you simply drive up to the front door of the hotel where your car is taken from and parked  The location is first class with easy access to all the major roads, it's also slap-bang in the middle of the city, two minutes from the train station and a ten minute walk to China town  The food from breakfast to dinner is first class, it's spotlessly clean, with a great pool and fitness area. All the rooms are well decorated and all have a fully functional kitchen. However the real gems of this hotel are the staff, from the manager to reception, the catering staff and the cleaning staff everyone has made me feel so welcome which to me is a real bonus when you have to work away from your family  I will return~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472872014~“Good location, mixed opinion..”~Stayed at the Quay West Suites for three nights on business.  Modern, large and well designed apartment space with a comfy bed. Not the cleanest unfortunately- lots of mould around the bathroom, a strange dark 'splat' drip mark on the outside of the toilet that stayed for the entire duration of my stay. Shower took a long time to warm up and had weak pressure (took a long time to even rinse shampoo out of my hair). Whilst I enjoyed the location (great 5-10min walk from the CBD, just across the bridge) the hotel was very noisy.  I had a room next to the lifts which were a bit noisy, but only being on level 6 I had the traffic noise from the busy highway opposite, and woken up by the garbage truck very early in the morning. Maybe ask for a river facing/high up room to have a quieter stay? On the plus side, breakfast was adequate and the staff were helpful. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472530306~“Quay West Delivers an Exquisite Stay”~I had never heard of QuayWest until we arrived in Melbourne, in the heart of the city, to the welcoming and helpful staff. We won’t soon forget it, as it is a beautiful hotel situated near everything you want to see and visit to experience Melbourne. Kudos to Tess and Alexandra who helped us get settled in and answered a myriad of questions with patience and kindness and always seemed happy to see us. Our 2-bedroom/2-bath apartment was absolutely stunning with an equally stunning view of the city off of a balcony that extended the entire length of the apartment accessible through the living room and each bedroom. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was eager to assist us in dining at the newest and best restaurants as well as navigating the extensive tram system and any other detail. You can’t go wrong at Quay West.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472351970~“A pleasant surprise!”~I had never stayed at a Quay West Suites before, but as a Le Club AccorHotels member, I thought I would give Quay West Suites Melbourne a try as I needed a place large enough to accommodate our group of four and wanted a place centrally located (since we were staying for six nights). We stayed in Suite 2601. Wow, this, I believe, had been a private apartment (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms) that the hotel took over. The kitchen was over-the-top amazing and large. We could see to St. Kilda from our suite and had four balconies (I did not even discover the fourth balcony until the last day!). Having an in-suite washer and dryer was a big plus as we were on a 25-day visit to Australia. Front desk staff were courteous and efficient, and the breakfast room staff were really nice, giving local advice to my mom who was visiting Australia for the first time. The pool area, albeit completely indoors, is really snazzy looking. Finally, the location on Southbank, close to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Federation Square and the National Gallery of Victoria, is ideal no matter what the weather. We received free wifi for six devices (I believe) since I am a Le Club AccorHotels member. Next time I visit Melbourne, I want to stay here!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472248406~“Exceptional stay!”~My husband and I stayed last Saturday night to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary. Our 1 br apartment was well set up and there appeared to be everything required to self-cater (but we wanted to eat out). We were delighted to find a beautiful card and bottle of sparkling wine on our arrival - such a thoughtful gesture.  The reception staff were efficient and accommodation was clean, well maintained and luxurious.  Our stay was fantastic and Quay West will be our number 1 choice for future city visits.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470708936~“Best location but tired and in need of maintenance”~We started in a 2-bedroom deluxe suite on the 16th floor and were upgraded to a 3-bedroom suite on the 21st floor because a river view for the fireworks had been requested. The first suite was tired and in need of care, plus the kitchen was hardly well equipped with a very limited view. The 21st floor was a different story entirely but there was a leak in the laundry ceiling which meant maintenance was called to stem the flow. We had a gorgeous view of the fireworks that night and a late checkout, but no free wifi!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~3~nan

review_469276063~“Love the location. ”~We have stayed at Quay West numerous times over many years as we love the location.  The hotel is ideally located within walking distance to the City shops, restaurants, Flinders Street Station, Casino , MCG & Federation Square.  Check in - all went accordingly to plan. Staff were friendly.  Room - No upgrade as Platinum Accor members as the hotel was busy. Our 1 bedroom apartment was on the top floor which had a lovely view.  If the hotel wasn't so busy I would have asked to be moved as the sun was so bright we had to keep the curtains shut all the time which was annoying as we had a beautiful view.  Overall - rooms & kitchens now need a update as they are starting to show their age. Can't fault the location or facilities as all are outstanding. Probably stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467108818~“The Spot To Be!”~During my two night stay the highlights were, the location and some excellent service from the staff. On arrival the staff were very attentive and checkin was quick, considering I arrived ahead of time. Service like this makes all the difference and special mention to Helene for the friendly welcome. The rooms themselves were ok, particular the bathroom, which needed some renovation but overall the rooms were functional and spacious. I enjoyed the ability to wash a few clothes which was convenient and if you are travelling with family this would be a good option. The room had cooking facilities too but the food in Melbourne is delicious so need to cook. As mentioned the location was superb as there are lots of restaurants & bars to choose from. However there are better restaurants if you're prepared to go further a field (see other reviews). I ate breakfast at the Suites restaurant and the choices were, continental or full cooked breakfast which is fairly standard. In summary, I didn't have the best room and probably could have paid more for that experience but I enjoyed my stay in Melbourne. If you get these suites for the right price then stay here, as the location is excellent.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466852064~“great location and excellent apartment and service”~we stayed for a week in this complex. The staff were excellent -very helpful, courteous and responsive ( Paul/Sarah notably). The apartment was very quiet despite being directly behind the lift shaft though there was external noise on the Friday and Saturday nights. The apartment was well equipped and bed was very comfortable. All in all it was a great place to stay, albeit it comes at a price! Given that it was disappointing to see that free wifi is only there if you are an Accor club member - be better to put in the price.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_466533601~“Continues to impress..”~I reviewed Quay West a number of years ago but felt compelled to write another review. I stayed here with my daughter for a 5 night stay. After a 24 hour trip from the UK arriving at close to Midnight we were greeted by very friendly staff. We were immediately told that we had been upgraded to a room with a City view (which at any time of the day or night is spectacular). The suite was very clean and well maintained. Whilst we didn't eat in the room, the kitchen was well-equipped and certainly provides everything you need if you want to be more self-sufficient. The location is ideal for visiting all the various attractions Melbourne has to offer...many of which are within walking distance. Throughout our stay all the staff were very attentive and nothing was too much effort. I will definitely be returning and would highly recommend.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465643229~“Location”~Love staying here so close to everything, Restaurants, Art Centre & Theatres, plus shopping on your doorstep too! great friendly staff, Happy to answer questions and make recommendations at any time! We were upgraded to a One Bedroom River View Suite with fantastic views.Room perhaps getting a little tired in places,specifically oven & hotplates, writing has worn off from cleaning, but overall, spacious and well set out.~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_464679903~“CBD Location Extraordinaire”~A great location for access to CBD, Southbank,Yarra cruises and Melbourne Park. Our stay twice in 3 years was for the Australia Open and served us well both times. Free wifi was nice the second time but the website does not make it clear unless you ask then you have to join their reward program to get the service. Nice pool, hot tub(spa) and gym. View room a must so you can see the river and other views of the city. One thing lacking was the kitchen utensils, etc. which for this class of accom. were not well thought out, supply wise.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_463048650~“Hot and windy Melbourne ”~Despite the weather the quay west air conditioning was excellent and still allowed sleep. One of the best I have experienced Staff at our early check in were very good and we left luggage and were phoned when room was ready. Proper one bedroom suite with all necessary facilities. Cooked breakfast was somewhat limited but the range overall was good. Staff had adjusted toaster to produce good coloured toast without having to put the bread through twice. Location is superb ,close to south bank restaurants and flinders st station. Staff were most attentive and helpful. Room was well equipped and location was ideal.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461922495~“Great place to stay In Melbourne”~This was our first visit to Australia and Melbourne was our first stop. We loved the location of this place. We could walk or get the tram to everywhere that we wanted to go. We also had everything we needed in the apartment. Our original room didn't have quite the stunning view that I expected but we were able to move to a room with an incredible, full on, city view for our third night. Some of the room decor is a bit tired but overall I can really recommend this as a very good place to stay.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_461868039~“saddens me that i have to give an average review”~The only thing this hotel/suites has going for it, is its location, and the comfortable bed. When we arrived we checked in and found they had given us a room with a queen bed when I did specify king, due to being 8 months pregnant and needing the extra room. Claire Marie on the front desk was very helpful in fixing the situation and changed our room. We also received free parking which was a bonus. On arriving back to our room after dinner on the first night, we wanted to watch a movie, only to have the baggage man (very friendly by the way, only been working there a month) come up to have a look and apologise it wasn't working and would be fixed the next day by maintenance.. so we had to sit there and do nothing which was disappointing, and after paying over $300 p/n. Also you cannot watch movies in the bedroom, only in the lounge on the very uncomfortable couch. Whats the point of having a super comfy bed and tv in the bedroom if you cant even laydown to relax and watch a movie. They offer a nespresso coffee machine in the room and display all the different types of coffee pods you can use, but don't even have them all on offer, after I called up to get the weakest strength pod they said they would look but never got back to me. Also the milk wasn't replaced. Over all I wouldn't stay here again, for the price we paid we could of stayed somewhere much nicer with better service and facilities.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_461651849~“Good location.”~Stayed at this hotel for a few nights for a conference. Not a bad spot. Good conference facilities. Rooms are very spacious but felt dated. It's in a good location with plenty of restaurants and cafes close by.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460227660~“Neat, clean, a little dated but great service”~Staff were super friendly, valet parking is cheap compared to parking under the building yourself, room was nice, super clean a little dated but overall a great stay. Location is great as well as it is only a few min walk to Flinders Street Station area.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_460173469~“No Book of Mormon”~Interestingly, this is the first hotel I've ever stayed in that doesn't have a copy of the Bible in the night stand. Ironically appropriate since I was in Melbourne to attend a performance of "The Book of Mormon". Brilliant show and so beautifully 'wrong' in every respect! Nothing wrong about the Quay West Suites. Nothing. Perfect location. Generous to a fault. Massive room with perfect, relaxing views across the Yarra Yarra River to the iconic Melbourne skyline, including 'en suite' rowing teams training under the Princes Bridge! All the staff are adorable, friendly and ridiculously helpful & accommodating. Nothing too complicated, including brilliant restaurant recommendations based on time commitments and dietary preferences (I'll review those later). If there has to be an issue: well, perhaps the 'in house' dining & bar options could be reviewed. Many of us like to dine 'post theatre' etc. The house seems to close a little early. I'll be back! Be afraid!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_459578804~“Weekend for Bruce Springsteen”~Just love Melbourne , it was our first time staying at QUAY WEST SUITES and we couldn't fault them. Staff are great, Rooms clean and comfy. we'll be back when we need to stay this side of town . Nice location surrounded by Restaurants and Bars~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_459329324~“Location Location Location”~One night stay in a suite of beautiful rooms overlooking the iconic sites of central Melbourne, all of which are virtually on the doorstep of this amazing boutique hotel. Friendly, helpful staff and top class facilities.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459027776~“Amazing ”~Stayed in Quay West suites for the weekend as a birthday surprise to see a show at Hamer Hall. The hotel is fantastic. Friendly helpful staff,free breakfast and the location is perfect right on southbank. The rooms have everything you need including washing machine and dishwasher. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel. Great little bar downstairs for pre show drinks and food. Will definitely stay again if I am back in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459020040~“Great location! Great hotel! Awesome staff!”~This is our second visit to quay west suites and we are never disappointed! Getting an upgrade to the penthouse suite was amazing !!!! Thank you to Sarah and all the staff for your wonderful service. Pool and other facilities are great. Apartments are clean and spacious (we are a family of 5) and everything is at your doorstep (shrine, gardens, southbank, casino, shopping, free city circle tram, and amazing restaurants) so it is the prefect location. My kids said they always want to stay here when we indulge in a city centre stay. Wonderful :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457954775~“Brilliant!!”~From the minute we pulled up and was greeted by Garry the very friendly valet, our stay here was superb.  Check-in went smoothly and friendly.  We had a one bedroom apartment on the 14th floor with amazing city views.  The apartment was super clean with lovely amenities.  Headed down for breakfast the next morning and it was the young man Malcolm's first day.  What beautiful customer service and a great sense of humour, nothing was too much h bother for this bubbly young man.  Everything was simply wonderful and would stay here again in a heart beat.  Do yourself a favour and choose this place for your next stay in Melbourne.  The location is great, walking distance to a lot of places and very comfy bed for a great night's sleep.  Thank you Quay West Southbank.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457730127~“Awsome”~One of the best hotels we've stayed at. Will definitely be coming back hereprice was excellent, rooms excellent, bed freakin awsome and view excellent. Close to the river with everything at a walking distance.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457466301~“Great rooms, great location, great service”~Quay West Suites must have a claim on being the best hotel in Melbourne. We spent just the one night.  Location - nicely tucked in behind Hamer Hall with ready access to South Bank and the Arts precinct. So, it's close to Flinders Street Station and St Kilda Road trams.  Rooms - We were on the 20th Floor in a two bedroom apartment, light-filled, airy, meticulously presented with a kitchen, sitting room, dining room, two bathrooms and a large balcony overlooking the river. We were upgraded as Accor Advantage Plus members so I am less able to speak on value generally for this.  Service - The friendly, professional and attentive service at reception at check-in and check-out (and with each coming & going) was excellent.  Food - We did not use the restaurant, bar or room service.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_457320592~“Awesome location”~Fab location. Spacious room with everything you need. Serviced daily with clean sheets and towels. Friendly staff and lovely breakfast with so much variety. Only gripe was the shower was so small. Other than that we had a fabulous stay and will definitely be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457283054~“Great location. ”~We wanted a 2 BR unit with small kitchen and this is great. It is near the river and restaurants and all CBD sights.  The main thing to know is that the washer/dryer is a tiny, combination unit. I had planned to do laundry in Melbourne but this unit is tiny and you can't dry while something else washes. I ended up hang drying a lot and washing stuff by hand.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_456820719~“Great location, value for money, attentive and cheerful staff!”~Stayed 2 nights late Jan 2017. Our room was a one bedroom suite with balcony, overlooking the Yarra River and Melbourne CBD. Room was spotless, kitchenette had everything you would want on a short stay, bed was fantastic as was the bed linen. Room service menu is quite extensive, well priced and our meals were superb. Would recommend this place over any of the major Hotel chains as you have alot more room, a balcony, and has a little less pomp and ceremony. Great value for money.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456636075~“Good 3.5 stars....well located hotel and spacious suite”~Stayed in a 1 bedroom suite for 2 nights for business. Suite was spacious with kitchen, living area, bedroom and bathroom. Rooms were large and airy. I wasn't high enough to get a view but there was also a large outdoor area. Positives - big rooms, very friendly staff, location on riverbank. Cons - sheets were a little scratchy, the bathroom needs a refresh as marks in bath, shows screen feels old and flimsy, mini bar not replenished after first night. Perfectly adequate hotel, definitely above average but not quiet enough to be hitting very good status.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~5~nan
