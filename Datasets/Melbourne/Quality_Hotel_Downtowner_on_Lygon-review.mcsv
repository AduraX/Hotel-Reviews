review_477576248~“Reasonable price and central location. ”~We stayed overnight when we were in town to see a show.  The room was ok but is showing its age and is rough in places. The bath for example had cracks and pitted stains and the towel hangers were coming away from the wall.  There was tea and coffee making facilities in the room and there was also complimentary wifi but it was slow and the connection was sketchy.  The bed was quite good and we could have enjoyed a peaceful lay in except for the very noisy cleaning staff who seemed to congregate outside our room (323). Add to this that one of the staff dropped a full tray of breakfast outside our door and our sleep quality was only so so.  The final annoyance was getting slugged an additional $20 in parking when we checked out. I accept that parking in the city costs but this shouldn't be added to the room costs when you're parking at the place you're staying.  It was ok here and at the price I'd stay again but it's not great quality.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476686164~“All good on Lygon St”~Book the motel through Booking.com all went smoothly no hassles there, checked in mid afternoon all went smoothly. The location of the motel suited us just fine as we wanted to stick around Lygon Street and check out the restaurants and were only staying overnight anyway. The room was clean and tidy, bed was good the only issue was the elevator wasn't working, but were only on the first floor anyway so it didn't bother us too much. The parking cost an extra 20 dollars but that's about the going rate in a lot of motels in Melbourne plenty of room to park as well. Would recommend this place to anyone and I would definitely stay there again. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473012187~“Good Hotel, great location, quiet and clean rooms”~Whenever we are in Melbourne we choose to stay at the Downtowner. This time we were on a 2 week motorcycle trip, and really appreciated the (free) undercover parking for the bikes, including an extra day's parking while we waited to board the Spirit of Tasmania. Good service, nice rooms, great location.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_472776300~“Just ok”~Our daughter booked this property to take her bubb to the museum and zoo and then was unable to go due to illness. We filled the reservation for her. Room was spacious, thoughtful little things like a toaster and plates and knives for a quick breaky, but the bed, even though KS, I was sliding down it all night due to a dippy mattress and the set up of a step into a bath to have a shower, we felt, was suicidal, an accident waiting to happen. The window did not shut tightly so the traffic noise was very loud as were the cases on wheels going past our door early and noise above. Basically, this is an old premises that could be improved with the bathroom being revamped, eliminating that stained old spa jet bath, and an adjustment to the window. But for location as to why our daughter booked this on a budget, it was good. The staff were polite and having happy hour next door was handy, but no atmosphere. Location to Lygon Street restaurants, perfect.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_472553892~“Affordable Comfort, Friendly, Helpful Staff!”~I will be back again, after discovering the Quality Downtowner Hotel on Lygon! I had a spacious, well appointed room with a view overlooking Lygon Street. It was quiet, comfortable clean and affordable, having booked a genius deal with booking.com, for a little over A$100! Lygon Street has been my favourite Melbourne hangout since the 1960s. I used to live close by and regularly go to the Nova Cinema for non Hollywood and foreign movies, for dining at one or more of the fabulous restaurants that Lygon Street is famous for, or to attend events at the almost neighbouring and historic, heritage listed Trades Hall, currrently one of the venues for the Melbourne International Comdey Festival, throughout April. Rooms were spotlessly clean, quite well appointed, with a medium sized television, wifi and tea and coffee making facilities. Generous shared balcony space outside and some terrific greenery in the car park courtyard gave options for spending private time outdoors. Room 105 was delightfully light and airy. New carpet would make it even more appealing, as the bathroom has been fabulously renovated, with a generous shower and bench space. Plenty of power outlets for charging phones and cameras and very good lighting for a hotel room, which often seem to be on the dim and romantic side, when their clients are actually more often wanting their room as temporary office space with good lighting for work and reading! A king sized bed and a generous table and chairs still left a generous sense of space. The ceilings were pretty low, but that may be because I am used to very high ones. There was plenty of car parking. As for the staff at reception and on domestic duties, they were highly obliging, friendly and delightful and went out of their way to make my stay a delight! Thankyou Downtowner; the allure of Lygon Street beckons stronger than ever, thanks to your comforts and hospitality! It may not be 5 star, but the prices for this fabulous area of Melbourne, so close to the city centre, where most things are actually walking distance, or a short and easy tram ride away, were not 5 star either! If you want value for money, with a high level of comfort, close to the city centre and in the heart of some of the best eating and attractions in Melbourne, then the Downtowner would be hard to beat! Highly recommended!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_471860034~“Good value and decent location”~- Good location near city centre with lots of restaurants and cafes nearby - Hotel is dated, but room size is good, lots of storage/closet space and kept clean - AC is cold and shower water pressure is strong - Toiletries are limited, but otherwise well equip with tea/coffee, hairdryer and microwave - Service is average. Checkin and out was fairly quick and easy, but staff was not particularly friendly - Wifi was included in package and coverage was sufficient - Rate is reasonable considering the above - Parking costs an additional $15 per day~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_471719530~“Great Spot to Stay”~Great little spot to stay close to the city and close to all the fine wining and dining along Lygon Street.

review_471496319~“To expensive for quality of rooms”~The rooms were clean and staff were great, but for the price was not worth it as the so called recently renovated room would have been in the 90's so very dated and rough around the edges. Carpet torn elevator knocked around spa did not work. Had breakfast there was very nice.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469276237~“Unexpected Visitor During the Night”~Checked in 9pm on Friday night & took a walk along Lygon St. Returned at 11pm & went to bed. At 1.30am we were woken suddenly by someone in our room. My wife's screaming woke me & I saw a woman by the door who began apologising saying she had been allocated room 206 and had been given the key. She said she would return to reception . My wife, who had been terrified by the stranger's intrusion, found it difficult to return to sleep. After a fitfull night's sleep we went to reception & asked to speak to the manager. A young man identified himself as the duty manager. My wife explained our terrifying experience. He said he understood but "it was a very busy night and it was just one of those things," and offered us a free breakfast. It was obvious we were insulted by his flippant attitude and he then asked what could he do to make it better? My wife said it was a terrifying experience so he said he would discount us one days parking and a free breakfast. When this didn't seem to satisfy us he said he would discount the entire 3 days parking and we could still have a free breakfast. We just walked away because we were so disappointed he showed no empathy. We decided not to let it ruin our weekend. On checkout Lynne, General Manager, was waiting for us. She was conciliatory, understanding & disappointed with our treatment. She refunded one night's accommodation. Although we did not take up the offer of breakfast, we were also not charged for parking. Staff incompetency in logging check-ins and room availability must be addressed. Make sure you check your room has not been double booked. Great proximity to Melbourne CBD. We may stay again.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~2~nan
review_468634167~“Over piced, over rated.”~Room I booked wasn't ready. Still being made up. The king size spa room wasn't what I expected. The spa was only for a child. To small ! I was told over the phone when booked the room parking was included in the price of the room but was charged. The parking bay are way to small to fit your car in.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_467904662~“Reasonable value for money”~Rooms are comfy and clean, Bathrooms are a bit squeezy though. Amenities provided are excellent but car parking a bit limited.

review_467643955~“Very accomodating - a little bit extra goes a long way”~The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. I had a 10am meeting nearby after flying in from Sydney that morning. I was able to park my hire car early and my room was already available for an early check in which meant I could have a quick shower and get refreshed for my meeting.  I'll be staying here again for sure. A bit of flexibility is the best marketing of all to ensure repeat customers. More hotels (and many other businesses that matter) could follow Downtowner's example. The breakfast was excellent, and be sure to ask reception about complimentary admission to Melbourne City Baths - another nice touch.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467373701~“Great location”~Great location in Lygon Street with lots of cafes , restaurants at your doorstep.  The room was clean and comfortable and VERY quiet.

review_467093087~“Very good value”~A quality control consultant living in Adelaide, I attended a meeting with the Victoria Police who put me up at this hotel. I did not know what to expect from the hotel. A trip about 20 years ago and was more than pleasantly surprised. I did't think any renovation was required, but apparently keeping up with with competition on vibrant, exiting and entertaining Lygon Street is a must. A walk down Lygon street will find one of the restaurant(of many restaurants) staff come out with some food samples to tempt you in. Part of this review is to nominate a date in 2016 to 2018, ignore the date as it was a few years before those times. The restaurant was also good and well priced. A tram runs here to Melbourne CBD, an entirely lovely experience. I have always looked for an excuse to stay at this hotel again. This trip needs to be put on your bucket list~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466455415~“Great stay!”~Great hotel, clean, comfortable and in a prime foodie location, fantastic!! Best bathrooms, they're large and accommodating and the room in general is really well appointed with a table & chairs & plenty of places to put your things, tea & coffee facilities. My only gripe would be not being made aware of a $100 room key deposit (refunded on check out) required on check in when paying cash, one exists for credit cards and is in the "fine print" but i was completely unaware of this fee and wasn't told at any stage of booking in or any emails i received before our stay. I budget carefully for weekends away and was unprepared to hand over this extra amount, i thought it was a room amount only, we did as required and got the $100 deposit back on check out but it was an added expense i would have preferred be made aware of prior to checking in, lucky i had some extra spending money and it didn't impact our stay negatively, BUT it could have, and that was my problem with not knowing in advance. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466424663~“Good all round hotel”~Just spent 4 nights here along with an extended family group of 12, in town for a wedding. The location was really good, walking distance to most of what we did over our visit. Trams handy just down the street for the longer distances. Shopping in the city, close to Queen Victoria Market, restaurants just up the road. The staff were most helpful and always happy to answer questions and give advice. The rooms are comfortable and well serviced daily.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_465447406~“very comfortable in a great location”~We only stayed one night but found the hotel very comfortable and were very pleased when they let us in earlier than regular check in. Nice having windows that looked out on to trees. Great shower and quiet at night even though it is in Lygon St, close to heaps of restaurants.Great having a toaster as well as the usual tea and coffee. Easy to catch trams into the city from Queensberry St and easy walk to beautiful Exhibition Gardens and other trams. Skybus free hotel pickup was great. Would be happy to stay there again~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464963606~“A great place to stay”~We had a king sized bed which was very comfy. The room faced the side so not the street and was relatively quiet.

review_464909229~“Fantastic location with good car parking!”~The hotel itself is a little outdated but it's clean and comfortable. We stayed in the Executive Suite and the layout of the kitchen facilities was a little unusual. The bar fridge was in the bathroom which meant it was off-limits when the WC was being used! The kettle, toaster, tea, coffee, cups and glasses etc were kept in the wardrobe which was also a little strange. Despite the weird layout, the room had everything we needed (with the exception of a bottle opener however a quick call to reception and one was promptly bought up). The car park is very convenient and reasonably priced. If I was to fault the Downtowner on one thing it would be that ashtrays are provided just outside the room doors. Over the course of our stay we had several people smoking right outside our room which was quite off-putting and meant we couldn't leave the door open for some fresh air. The location really is great. Walking distance to many of Melbourne's attractions and so many choices of eateries on Lygon Street! The pass to use at the Melbourne Baths was appreciated. I went there for a gym workout followed by a sauna and spa - I would recommend it! I will certainly consider staying at the Downtowner again when visiting Melbourne!~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_464850355~“My favourite Melbourne hotel”~I have been staying at the Downtowner on all my Melbourne trips since introduced to it by my former CEO. It is so central to all things in Melbourne.

review_464375036~“Not too bad”~Comfortable enough room. Can feel the middle join in the king beds - but not too bad. Pillows are pretty good. WiFi speed is terrible, however it is complimentary. Good size towels in the bathroom. Not sure I am happy with their idea of recycling soap in the bathrooms … Couple of issues with the bathrooms: In the rooms that face the street, it would be good if there was some sort of diffuser on the window. This is included on some of the rooms, but makes me feel a little uncomfortable that there is only a slimline venetian blind for privacy in most (maybe all) of the street-facing rooms. The showers are terrible! I have stayed in many rooms at this hotel, and the showers are all the same - the head would probably be OK if the water pressure was a LOT better. Hotel location is good for restaurants on Lygon street, which mostly seem to be reasonably priced for pretty good food. Overall not too bad.~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464187059~“Good for sightseeing and eateries”~The hotel is on Lygon Street which is well known for its many restaurants so you will not have to walk far for a meal. There are lots of different eateries with Italian being the most numerous. The hotel room was big, as was the end suite and was clean and comfortable but it had a slightly dated feel about it. As we were out sightseeing during the day and eating out in the evening we had no problem with it. The breakfast room is clean and modern and there was a good choice of cereals, fruit, juices etc. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from old Melbourne goal which is well worth a visit. Continue walking past the goal for another 10-15 minutes and you will arrive in the centre of Melbourne at Federation Square having passed through the Greek area and Chinatown en route. Alternatively you can catch the free tram #35 from close to the goal to Federation Square.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_463864068~“My Stay”~I have stayed at the Downtowner Motel six times in the past two years and yet when checking in for six days they insist that they take a $50.00 security deposit. I booked an early morning call for 5am, the call came at 6.10am.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

The staff were all friendly and the room was quiet and well maintained. The breakfast that was included with the deal was excellent with many choices of hot and cold dishes. The pool area is a lovely area to sit and have a few drinks (very relaxing) although we didn't actually go in the water it looked very inviting. Only a short walk to Swanston Street which enables you to catch trams but only 15 minutes walk to city anyway. Many restaurants in Lygon Street which again is only a block walk away.

review_460535890~“Location is good”~My workplace book this property for my regular travel. They use this hotel because of the proximity to my office. The location is excellent to access RMIT (which I do) and Lygon St. The closest tram is a reasonable walk away. The rooms are always clean, albeit dated. The noise is not great - and I dont mean from the road. The walls are THIN, the bathrooms above are noisy (imagine hearing the man in the room adjacent/above urinating each and every time) and this visit I could hear the neighbouring room enjoying they valentines day time together very clearly. The tiling on the floors outside the rooms echo each and every noise, and the sound of the nearby doors slamming shut are enough to jolt you out of sleep. Although there is a smoking area on the ground floor outside, there are weird wall mounted ashtrays around the place. It leaves a gross old cigarette smoke odour hanging around, and I have been unfortunate enough to step out of my room into recently blown out smoke (room 221 I think I was in when this happened). I have now stayed in 4 different rooms on 4 different occasions and have experienced all of the above on all of these visits. The bathrooms are roomy, however stepping up into a bath and then having steps to get out is dangerous. The amenities provided are of good quality. It would be helpful to have a full range of cutlery including a knife and fork, especially considering my room has a microwave. The beds are comfortable and there are plenty of pillows. I have found the heating and cooling, albeit loud, work very well in each room. The staff are always attentive and courteous and are a credit to the hotel. I continue to stay here because the travel company that arrange my trips book me in, it is not my choice to return due to the in room noise.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~5~nan

review_452504869~“Our pleasant stay”~The room is OK - a tad outdated, but it's on Lygon a short walk of awesome eateries! You must try the Turkish place..................(I love Istanbul) opposite the hotel.. Great food . As for the hotel, the service is good - friendly people on the desk. There's steps into the spa showers. We rated it a 3/5, but give it an extra star for having car parking $15/day and being so close to Lygon St eatery area. My only negative comment would be the car spaces are very tight.. They know about that ,and had other complaints about that issue.. All in all a pleasant stay, we would use the place again when in melbourne~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_452471282~“Good affordable accomodation”~Great location in the quieter end of Lygon street and while it is an older style motel it is well set out, clean and great value for money. Level 3 at the rear is the best and quietest part of the motel. The only negative thing I would say is the complimentary wifi is too slow and you would have to purchase the high speed internet if you need it and I think that should be supplied free to members of their club being Choice Privileges.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan

The service is good - friendly people. The rooms aren't for people who are in wheel chairs, like I heard one of the desk staff saying - as ours wasn't. There's steps into the spa showers. The spa is barely a one person spa, which is disappointing.

review_452203242~“Great value with everything we needed”~We utilised a Groupon deal to stay in the city for a show and late dinner. Despite the decor being a little dated and the air conditioning being quite loud, the room was more than adequate with a comfortable bed, and a sizeable bathroom with one person spa bath. With an excellent continental breakfast and welcome drinks included, friendly staff and relatively cheap on-site parking, the hotel met all our needs and proved to be great value, especially being only a ten minute stroll to the theatre district.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan

review_451151641~“Comfortable and convenient”~We recently stayed at the Downtowner for the second time. As usual, it did not disappoint. We stayed in the spa king room which was immaculate, spacious, quiet and very comfortable. We did not dine in at all, except room service which was nice, but perhaps slightly overpriced for what was received. All staff were pleasant and professional. The housekeeping team in particular did a marvellous job. Our room was pristine upon return each evening, despite us leaving quite late in the morning. The location alone makes this hotel an excellent choice. Close to attractions and services, we were able to walk anywhere within the CBD. We would definitely recommend this hotel to other couples and would absolutely return for our next stay in Melbourne.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
