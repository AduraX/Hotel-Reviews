review_478094383~“Ok, but nothing special.”~We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a one bedroom deluxe river room, and while the room had everything we needed, it seemed to lack that special something to make it stand out. It's location puts it at a 10 minute walk from the best of the Melbourne CBD (or hop on the free tram that runs along Flinders St) and noise is factor to take into consideration when booking. We had arranged for our daughter to stay with us on the second night of our stay at a cost of $70. It appears that this fee did not include pillows, as the sofa bed was set up using two of the pillows from the main bedroom that had been used the night before. There were no additional pillows in the room that we could find and at 10.45pm, we were too tired to bother calling reception for something that is actually pretty basic...or so we thought!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476718306~“Great stay for family”~This place is great for families, the rooms are spacious and clean with all the facilities we needed for our 10 night stay. And the staff are amazing! Especially the reception staff who were so helpful, highly recommended!! And so central to everything.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476368033~“Hotel of choice in Melbourne!”~I e been staying at the Clarion for two years and can't say enough about the hotel and staff. Very conveniently located, access to a great gym 300m up Flinders St, fabulous walking along the Yarra, great restaurants and bars within 500m and exceptionally nice hotel management staff!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475976638~“Average but convenient”~the hotel was tired, the beds uncomfortable and the people next door appeared to shower loudly at 6am for about 45 minutes then at 12 am for a little longer. The doors slam, the pool is Tiny, the pillows uncomfortable, the windows filthy which spoiled the view across the river. The room service ok food passable. The bathroom was tiny, no room for the sink which was outside the door and dead opposite the bathroom door was a mirror where, if you wished, you could watch yourself sitting on the toilet. The room was not fully serviced on the second day because of the east er break. The location was great for the neighbours tour and the aquarium but that is about all I can say in its favour. Sorry.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475512414~“An apartment, not a bedroom!”~Arrived here on a coach tour to find a complete apartment with fridge/freezer, washer/drier , full oven and hob and microwave. Good dining and lounge area as well as a decent double bedroom and bathroom. Convenient spot by the river and on the circular tram route and not far from Flinders Street Station.  Nice bar and good breakfasts. Friendly staff.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475501935~“Great Customer Service Continues”~It's always good to review places that I have reviewed in the past to see whether I am taking the business for granted or worse still I am being taken for granted as an ongoing customer.  I have just been back to the Clarion for the first time in 4 months and at reception were Anesu and Viviana. As usual they greet me with my name and they are genuinely warm and sincere people, with a sense of a humor. There is a newish girl on reception as well, whose name I can't remember, but there is no doubt she is being trained by experts in customer service. The hotel foyer is very clean, as is my room. The Clarion has spent some money over the past couple of years refurbishing rooms so they are in good shape. If possible try to get a room with a view of the Yarra River and the Crown Complex. If you have children they will love the flames that shoot out near Crown at night time. Location is excellent with free city tram stop a couple of minutes walk away in three directions. Clarion is located on busy Flinders Street. It is my experience that all bedrooms I have stayed in have double glazed windows and that noise is not an issue. A buffet breakfast in the Williams Cafe is a great way to start the day. The buffet has a variety of food options of good quality. They look after people with coeliac disease and are happy to toast some gluten free food. This accommodation is for the business person, the couple or families. From my experience children are welcome at Clarion.  I strongly recommend the Clarion as an accommodation option. It is realistically priced and the customer service is exceptional. I feel comfortable when I stay there and that is very important. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475475193~“Stay Clear - noisy and dated”~Looks good in theory but very disappointed. Had lousy sleep as the windows need to be double glazed as you are overlooking Flinders st line so beware trains are running all night,so there goes the sleep. Bathroom was rubbish and dangerous as I actually slipped in the shower and pulled the safety rail straight out of the wall - great help as I surfed the bathtub. Management were completely useless when the incident was reported. Obviously won't be going back and recommend you don't bother.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474536845~“Home away from ”~We love to stay here at one William, it is very comfortable, well positioned and great value at the same time, love the restaurant, friendly staff and parking (even for our oversize vehicle (just call to enter via flinders st exit!) a two day stay is even better as you can access the entire city from jazz clubs to restaurants and theatre with a nice walk home. I also love the pool to work out stress and strain!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473691628~“Another great visit to our favourite hotel!”~We were treated like family once again at the hotel! The spacious rooms facing the Yarra river were excellently prepared, including the usual delicious homemade biscuits on arrival, supplied by the general manager, Tony Cakmar! At reception, Anesu and Viviana recognised us and made us feel right at home. We had a great chat and they sorted out our accommodation very efficiently. Anesu also came up to sort out the DVD player, when I had a problem using it. Furthermore, Viviana helped me find the correct bus stop when I needed to go to Northlands shopping centre. A great stay indeed. We will most definately be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_472864143~“Not the best experience ”~Arrived late at night, had called & emailed to give them notice about this. The night manager was rude I felt like I was an inconvenience. If it wasn't passed 11pm I would have left. (Before you ask I don't drink so didn't arrive drunk after a big night, I went to a function straight from the airport & didn't have time to check in) Asked for a late check out got a long winded answer to essentially say it was the day managers decision & to call in the morning.  Thankfully there was a younger staff member also on duty who was bubbly, professional & very apologetic about his colleague.  Location is amazing right in the heart of everything. Room was more like a service apartment, would be great for self catering, longer stays or business travellers.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472858426~“Return guest - I always come back to the Clarion, always 5 star service”~I had a 3 night stay in the Clarion this week to farewell my cousin who was visiting Victoria. Although I stay at other hotels in Melbourne from time to time, I always end up coming back to the Clarion. I've stayed here with my family at least 6 or 7 times and the customer service is always 5 star. The staff can't do enough for you. The room and bathroom are spotless and the bed really comfy. On our last night we a beautiful room service dinner as we just didn't feel like going out. I'd recommend joining the One William Club as it gives a discount when dining in the restaurant and takes a few dollars off the car parking too. It's my "go to" hotel in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_471784940~“Weekend with bestie”~When we arrived Friday to check in and be greeted with the news that we have been upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite on the 17th floor. Well we were so excited and the river views were amazing both day and even more spectacular at night. I love staying here, this is my favourite place in Melbourne to stay. There are times when we cannot get a room and that is ok, as it is so very popular and it is very easy to understand why.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470187450~“Excellent hotel with a lovely view”~Excellent hotel that is only a short walk from the main train stations and tram stops. We were fortunate enough to have a room on a higher up floor facing the river, so we had a pretty awesome view. The staff were very pleasant and our room was ready before check in, allowing us to check in 2 hours earlier. The room was also pretty spacious with plenty of room to move around. Overall, a very good hotel and would definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_466412160~“Great stay at Clarion Suites Gateway”~I can't say anything but... I love this place. Everything from check in to check out was flawless. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly, the rooms are lovely and it's a great location. The set out of the room is perfect... spacious, clean, plenty of wardrobe space, sink and mirror not in the actual bathroom so you can get ready if someone else is using the bathroom, great full length mirror, plenty of light in room and even guest laundry facilities. I would definitely recommend staying here and look forward to staying again on my next visit to Melbourne.....~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Clarion Suites Gateway is located centrally and there is lots of things to do in the area.  The suites are beautifully decorated and nicely set up with all that you would need for a couple of nights potentially more.~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan
review_463830414~“Clean, great location and spacious”~My partner and I stayed at Clarion suites in January 2017 during our Christmas break. We were impressed with the size of he suite - large bedroom, clean bathroom, kitchen with pots and pans for cooking, spacious lounge area and a balcony. The place was modern and clean. Location was also great. Our room faced The Crown and we watched the nightly fire display from our balcony. It was within walking distance to all the main sites in Melbourne. We would defiantly stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462979138~“Very nice hotel”~Nice suite with massive outdoor patio, Shame that it was to noisy due to generators to sit out. Very nice sitting area and kitchen, washer a bonus. Conveniently positioned to be able to get to most places. Night market was really good. Breakfast very nice. Wi-Fi difficult to connect but staff helpful and sorted it out for us.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462848889~“I expected a little more from Clarion”~When we first checked in, there were short curlies, (hair) on the bathroom floor. We also found a large stain on the duvet cover. The rest of the room was very nice. You do have to pay for WiFi and for Parking. For the most expensive hotel we've paid for in Australia, we expected more. There staff was very friendly, but for the cost, you should at least get free WiFi.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~4~nan
review_462432037~“Good hotel in a good location”~My wife and I spent two nights here on our Distant Journeys Highlights of New Zealand and Australia tour.  Our room was actually a large suite! The bedroom was rather small with a single double bed plus adequate wardrobe and drawer space, plus a large TV. The large living area had a fully equipped kitchen area and a washing machine, large settee, a large dining table and chairs, a large worktable and another large TV. The relatively small bath/shower room had plenty of towels and toiletries. Breakfast was good. There were three fruit juices, plenty of fresh fruit, yoghurts, four cereals, plenty of nuts and dried fruit, various breads, pastries and muffins, and a large choice of hot food. The staff were very helpful. Conclusion – a good 4 star hotel in a convenient location in the centre of Melbourne. If we were to return to Australia we would have no hesitation in staying here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_461051984~“Great location”~We stayed at the Clarion Suites Gateway for 6 nights as part of our honeymoon.  Located next to the Yarra river opposite the south bank and crown casino. We could walk to most attractions within 10-15minutes. Our room was on the 10th floor and was a 1 bed suite which contained kitchen with washing machine, cooker, microwave and dishwasher. This is great if you want to keep breakfast costs down by buying it in yourself!  Living room was nice with big tv, whilst bedroom also had tv with comfy bed. Overall nice hotel in good location~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460797737~“Weekend stay”~Fantastic room with views over southbank and the city. Room was very spacious and modern with excellent facilities.

review_459256409~“Lovely stay but wifi isn't free ”~Stayed one night in a two bedroom suite with my girlfriends. Rooms were very spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped for a hotel. The hotel is is located in a great location, close to river side restaurants. Overall, a very pleasant stay.  My only criticism is that you need to pay for wifi, but this seems to be common occurrence for most Melbourne hotels. An opportunity for a competitive advantage perhaps?~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458648623~“Amazing Food at Williams Bar & Cafe”~We picked Williams Bar & Cafe as the spot to catch up with friends for Dinner. The food looked like a work of art on the plate & tasted even better. By far my favourite was the Nougat Ice Cream, it was to die for!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458184990~“Noisy rooms”~As soon as we walked in to the room the dominate factor was the noise. An air conditioning unit which was half the size of the balcony was the main culprit. We immediately went to reception to ask to move room but was told the hotel was full. On getting back to our room we received a phone call from Thomas, the customer service manager. He apologised for the noise and said there would be another room available for us to move to the following day on the17th floor. Later that night a message was slipped under the door saying the only other rooms available would have the same noise problem but we could move to a room with no balcony and no view. Unless you want a noisy room or something that resembles a prison cell, choose another hotel.~1~nan~2~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_456749956~“Well equipped hotel in a good location. ”~Hotel is well placed for the city centre.

Overall a good hotel that I would use again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455839696~“Hidden gem”~We just had our 10th anniversary in melbourne and chose to stay at the clarion suites melbourne.From the very first contact via phone i knew i had made a great choice. I asked for a suite high as possible overlooking the yarra and casino and thats exactly what I was given. The view from our suite was great especially with the fireballs every hour along the river beside the casino. The staff could not do enough for us. When i was informed of the maximum height of the carpark i thought i would have to park in the street but Jana from front desk made sure my car was parked in their carpark by going the extra yards and allowing me to enter the carpark via the exit gate which i thought was fantastic service. Would highly recommend the Clarion to family and friends cheers mark~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455520845~“this Accom snob was impressed!!!!”~Last minute decision to visit Melbourne which coincided with Chinese New Year saw many hotels with expensive price tags. We were there to shop, so the level of luxury was not a priority. Location on the other hand was. Situated within an easy walk to trams and trains proved invaluable as we attempted to boost the economy of the state. As my shopping companion was a "One William"? Member, we received a complimentary upgrade and discounted parking.  Our twin room became a one bedroom apartment with full kitchen and laundry facilities which facilitated the stowage of our parcels. It was clean and well presented and offered a small balcony so fresh air was available. There was a TV in the lounge room as well as the bedroom.  One remote didn't work, but we forgot to mention it to the staff, whom I'm sure would have quickly remedied the situation. Upon check in they were very personable and interested in what we were up to.  After stowing our possession in the car in the onsite parking, we left for breakfast and planned to return to the hotel in time for the 11am checkout. We however got caught up in more shopping, so a quick phone call to explain our dilemma saw us checkout remotely! I will certainly be keen to stay there again.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_453442006~“Amazing service and great location!”~My partner and I live about 1hr outside of Melbourne and wanted a one night getaway in the city. We booked this hotel last minute and it was the best stay and service we have ever had in the city. Special mention to the staff at reception who delivered some of the best customer service I have ever received. They are so friendly and willing to help you with anything you need. Our room was clean, beds comfortable, and view of the river amazing.  The location of the hotel was unrivalled with popular restaurants and nightlife within walking distance.  We will definitely be returning!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450917638~“Great Location”~Walking distance from great restaurants, great shopping and attractions. Room overlooks the Yarra River and stunning skyscrapers. Room we have is a suite which is spacious. Very clean and bright. There is a small kitchenette which we used for breakfast. Bathroom is a bit small but minor complaint .Staff are lovely and even dined in the Williams restaurant which is onsite. Only major complaint is there is a stale smell in the corridor from the left on our floor to our room which is at the end. It never cleared. But would still recommend if only for the room and location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449408319~“attending a function”~The hotel is well presented and the staff were fantastic. we were actually staying to go to a funeral. They couldn't be more helpful. They were able to find us rooms early as well so we could change before going. Couldn't recommend them highly enough and will stay there again when next in Melbourne. Location is also excellent being directly across from Crown and the precinct.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_444896296~“Excllent views and service!”~Views of Yarra river was excellent We enjoyed the gas flames every hour on the hour at night too. The food variety was much improved from our last visit and happy hour provided free snacks. The staff at reception went out of their way to help me get to an important venue for a workshop, when the booked taxi refused to stop and take me. They were calm and worked out how I could go by tram, even showing me exactly when and where to catch a tram. Thanks to Jana and Alison for all their help and professionalism in this regard. When I needed a late checkout, they were happy to extend it till 12pm too. . The location is also excellent with free tram service in the city. Staff also treat you like family and get to know your name very quickly. It really is home away from home for us!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_442064080~“Perfectly situated!”~My boyfriend and I stayed a night here as an overnight get away. He has stayed here previously, and recommended it for its situation alone. Close to the aquarium and casino, with a tram stop close by for the city circle tram.  The rooms were very clean and tidy. The view from the balcony of the apartment was spectacular! The balcony overlooked the Yarra River and Crown Promenade. The double glazed windows on the bedroom were enough to keep the noise of the trains and traffic below at bay. The pool was perfect for what I needed. The staff on arrival, departure and anytime in between were polite and welcoming. Guessing that this will be our regular haunt for Melbourne trips in the future~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441662928~“A very nice place to stay, but it is not Budget”~The clue is in the name - it provides a suite of rooms, and is therefore not a Budget Hotel, but when you are staying for more than a few days in one place, it is just ideal. The price was acceptable, the suite fantastic. The hotel put me in a room overlooking the River Yarra - very well positioned, although the sitting area was a little noisy due to the proximity of the trains. The bedroom was very well insulated and the transport did not affect my sleep. The bed was really comfortable and helped me recover from the jet lag. I'd be really happy to stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_439380337~“Excellent family friendly property!”~Had an excellent 3 night stay at the Clarion Suites Gateway, travelling with my partner and both our mothers. We stayed in an enormous 2 bedroom apartment (made up of a studio and 1 bedroom apartment with a shared lobby) featuring 4 very comfortable single beds, air conditioning, work desk, 3 TV's, 2 large bathrooms and lounge. The room also contained a very large kitchen with fridge, dishwasher and washing machine and a kitchenette in the studio. Both rooms were comfortable and presented very well. Service at reception was excellent at all contact points and the room was made up daily. The property features a bar and restaurant and also a pool. Fast wifi was also included in our package.  Clarion Suites Gateway is perfectly located for those looking for tram transport, a short walk to the Bourke and Collins street shopping precincts, Flinders street station and a 10/15 min walk to Southbank and the Crown entertainment complex.  We were all wrapped with this choice and I absolutely recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438844076~“Great location - will be back!”~Picked this out of the hundreds on offer as the price was good and location seemed to be ok. When I arrived I was happy that I did, as the location was fantastic and an easy walk across the river to restaurants at the crown complex and tram lines around the city! The apartment was spacious and balcony gave us a great view over the river and onto crown complex! The noise at night off the street was blocked well by the double glazed windows so no worries there! Parking was easy and at a reasonable cost too! We had lunch in the cafe downstairs and it was great so can't really fault anything! Will def be back to stay again! Thanks~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438799924~“Great place to stay”~We stayed here for 4 nights. The place is smart, very clean, bright and warm. The view from our room onto the river was fantastic, especially at the nightly flames from the embankment opposite, seemed as though they were glowing in sequence, a sight to see. We visited a lot of places, Cooks cottage, Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne War Memorial, The Vaults, The Gaol, Polly Woodside boat and the Lebanese restaurant opposite and not forgetting the brilliant experience of Skydeck - here you can see the whole of Melbourne and more from the 88th floor of a skyscraper, that takes 32 seconds to reach in the lift from the ground floor!!!!! The receptionist was above and beyond her reception duties. She helped us with our cases and explained clearly the hotel services and city's surroundings. Here you can get a buffet breakfast or set breakfast which we did most mornings as this helped set us up for the day before going off on our adventures. Definitely recommend this accommodation, situated in a good spot, not far from town centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

The balcony off the bedroom was useless as the air con unit took it up and was unpleasant to look at. Not happy when the cleaning staff ate our chocolates from the bowl we put in the lounge. Room service menu was better than the restaurant menu and very quick, great service there. The dining room dinner menu was very small and we only ate there once.

The kitchen is fully equipped so you'll have no trouble cooking if you want to.  Plus the staff were just beautiful.  Only downside is I actually didn't find the bed too comfortable.

review_431902726~“Great views, comfortable and central”~A great, central position, close to trams and also easy access to Yarra river walks as well as promenade and all it's fine dining.  Hotel is very well presented and staff always friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and tidy and bedding very comfortable. Double glazing in the bedroom stopped most outside noise of traffic, trams and trains.  Onsite Restaurant which we didn't use, but it smelled divine when entering the lobby.  It is an older hotel and not super modern but well maintained. Our suite had an excellent kitchen if you wanted to self cater. Even filled salt and pepper shakers which is often not the case. And thise views! What can I say? They make anything remotely negative go quickly away. We will definitely return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431380369~“Holiday ”~Excellent hotel with the most helpful staff we encountered on our recent 2-month holidays in Eastern Australia. Nothing was too much trouble. Can highly recommend. Hotel close to Melbourne amenities and is only a few steps from the Yarra river.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429003964~“Great weekend”~Stayed for weekend great part of town,apartment style rooms were very clean and modern,staff were fantastic,onsite parking for guests.Meals available in ground floor restaurant/bar.Room service was also available.We had late check out 12pm but we were able to keep our car in the carpark until 4pm so we visit more of the city without having to move the car to another carpark.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_428973150~“Great Location, great room sizes and facilities”~I stayed here as a meeting was being held at this hotel. The rooms are excellent, roomy, beds comfortable and quiet. Breakfast is good value at $21 with the staff very attentive. Plenty of room in the room to work with colleagues. Good location with walking distance to everything needed.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_427672583~“Awesome”~Great location, near shopping, free tram, dining, and tourist attractions. Our suite had kitchen, living room with comfortable couch, and great king sized bed. Most luxury we had on our trip to Australia.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_424929440~“The Only Disappointment on a Great Grand Final Day”~To be fair we got our accommodation as part of a (grossly over-priced) package in the last week of the football season to see Footscray in the Grand Final– so we expected that everyone -the AFL, the accommodation, the airlines – would rip us off (which they did – didn’t matter, Footscray won!). Our accommodation – selected from a short list of over-priced venues – was the Clarion Suites Gateway. It was OK. Don’t think it is up to its claimed 4 and a half star rating but it served its purpose. However we wouldn’t stay there again!  Perhaps our view of value is coloured by the fact that we opted for an additional night’s stay over and above the (over-priced) package – and that set us back $400+ per night per package / person ie $800 for one night for the two of us which was presumably their standard rate included in the package. You’d think that might mean you get a bit of special treatment. No. The free wi-fi turned out to be free for 30 minutes per day - anything else was $9.50 per day. Our Flinders Street room had train noises rumbling through most of the time. The room was retro fitted double glazed and they provided ear-plugs (after we asked for them) but, with additional random building noises, it was still noisy accommodation. Everything else was OK but skimpy and hardly 4.5 stars – and definitely not $800 per night. Makes you think twice before supporting a chain so quick to take advantage.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_424656659~“Excellent Central Hotel ”~Spent 3 nights here and loved it! The room was spacious, had fantastic views over the Yarra and the city, the king bed was very comfortable and the huge TV on the wall was a nice extra. All facilities were of a high standard, as was the customer service. The hotel has got the free trams right out there front, so it's a quick ride to wherever you need to get to. It's about a 5-10 minute walk into the heart of the city if you want the exercise. Late checkout (11am) was much appreciated as well. Highly recommended for your next stay in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421417193~“Weekend away”~This place is reasonably well located to flinders st station. The tram stops not far from the hotel so that's an added plus. Rooms are adequate with 2 TVs. 1 in bedroom and 1 in lounge. I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with views overlooking the river. My only real criticism is the place is cold. Even after turning the heater way up it was still nippy( and the heating is loud)No electric blankets either so had to rug up in bed. Otherwise it's an adequate, clean place.  Friendly counter staff.  You are overlooking the train station too. Bedrooms have double glazed windows but there is still some outside noise at times. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_420394285~“Excellent Location and Value”~We stayed in a 2-bedroom apartment for 4 nights on the 7th Floor. We had some train and tram noise from about 6am until 11pm but the triple glazing cut that to a minimum. The rooms were were spacious, comfortable, well equipped and serviced daily. All the staff, from reception through to the staff who serviced the rooms were very helpful and friendly and made our stay from the UK, very pleasurable. The hotel is within the city centre free travel area and so we travelled around the city on the trams for free. A great benefit.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_419010622~“Good for long stayers”~overall hotel is good. It has specious rooms with all amenities well fixed and planned. The only thing is the swimming pool as it is not for adults. 1 meter depth can annoy the people who loves swimming.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_417876677~“Great ”~Parking very tricky and restricted. Being from country I felt very cramped trying to park here. But considering its melbourne Space is very limited. Staff very helpful. Beautiful foyer. Rooms very neat and tidy. Central to cbd . Swimming pool. Breakfast was complimentary and really good. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417746134~“Excellent Melbourne Value”~Stayed just one night for a weekend getaway and all was good from start to finish. Friendly and helpful staff upon check in, room was big enough with a king size bed and 2 seater couch with a big flat screen TV. Microwave and kettle. Nice view of the Yarra and train line. Bathroom and shower fine with nice white clean fluffy towels. Bed linen sparkling clean as was the room and bathroom. And surprisingly quiet!! Breakfast good value I thought - buffet for $21.50 I think, all you can eat with a great variety and as much tea or coffee as you want and friendly staff.  The only negative is the temperature in our room was way too hot for me, even though I put our Air con on the lowest it would go it didn't seem to make too much difference. Felt very stuffy. But for just one night who cares? Was a convenient location for us and we were happy with this choice and for what we paid I thought this was excellent value.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_416925044~“Finals Footy”~We stayed over night on friday to attend the footy. Location is close to CBD, nice walking distance to Crown Casino. Warm, Friendly, Helpful Staff. Beautiful views over the Yarra. We had a room facing Flinders street & it was surprisingly quiet, no road, tram or train noise. Definitely be returning!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414460392~“Anniversary Getaway”~We spent two nights here for our anniversary and were greeted by a very friendly staff member, very helpful and happy. She advised that we could check in early which was great. The room was well appointed with separate bedroom, full sized kitchen and bathroom. There wasn't a lot of selection on the tv however they provided a DVD player so we bought a movie to watch on our second night which was handy. The hotel was very local to town and Southbank walking distance to everything.  The only thing I could say is that a few more utensils would be useful as there was no tongs to cook with but the oven, microwave and hot plate worked well. Foregoing a dishwasher for washing machine is fine but a sponge and scourer would come in handy when washing up.  I have to mention even though this is no reflection on the hotel the restaurant downstairs does lovely coffee delivered to the room. The lunch we ordered was terrible. I got the teriyaki burger and it was so fatty I really didn't enjoy it. But sometimes food is hit and miss. Certainly didn't dampen my spirits.  All in all we had a lovely time the room was comfortable and staff were helpful and friendly. Thank you for helping make our anniversary a lovely one.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412530805~“Great Service”~We recently (August) stayed in Clarion Suites on a visit to Melbourne, for 4 nights. On the first night the air conditioner did not work properly. The maintenance person attended quickly and left us with a portable heater until he could sort out the problem. It appeared that could not be done and we were moved to a very nice suite on the 17th floor the next day. No problems or fuss. I think you can judge customer service by how quickly a hotel tries to remedy bad situations.The staff and management assisted through out and were very professional. Front counter staff were always very friendly and happy to answer questions and assist with directions. Have stayed here a few times and am always happy.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_411595673~“Great place to stay”~This is a great hotel, I stay here every time I go to Melbourne. Always clean rooms, quiet and comfortable. Conveniently located, always great service by staff. Carpark is secure and very convenient.  My reason for making this review today is to express my disappointment in the choice of music being played in the restaurant during breakfast. Sure it was modern with a kicking beat, but the repetitive lyrics referring to revealing ones breasts and the expression of the singers desire to grind herself I feel is a little inappropriate for breakfast service. Thanks to the staff and management for another great stay and I hope you can take this feedback on board.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410823363~“Value for money”~Very helpful and friendly staff.  Quiet, nicely appointed and clean. The studio suite included a compact kitchen with an oven and washing machine. Bedroom is separate from the lounge, which is great for a bit more peace and quiet.  Shower entry was a bit cramped, but overall very nice.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_409266227~“Comfortable and friendly”~I stayed at the Clarion Suites for one night three weeks in a row for work purposes and it is the best I hotel I have stayed in which has been booked through work channels. The staff were friendly and helpful. I was able to leave my bag early in the morning on two occasions and was checked in early on the other. The rooms were all consistent and clean. I requested a room with a view of the river on my final stay and this was obliged. The breakfast was delicious and although not as much is offered compared to some other places the quality was better. This will definitely become my hotel of choice in Melbourne CBD when required to travel for work.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403160785~“Best Hotel in Melbourne”~This Hotel is truly the best in Melbourne CBD. We have stayed here on numerous occasions and every time is without fault. We have tried other hotels in the area to compare and have a change, but no more, they don't come close to the friendly staff with checkin and checkout. We have stayed in both studio apartment and this time one bedroom suite. Didn't have breakfast this time, as plans didn't give us time, but on other visits have had buffet breakfast and was all so tasty. Rooms faultless.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_402640514~“Wonderful stay. ”~My husband and I stayed here with one of our teenage daughters for 4 nights.  The lobby is bright and modern and check-in was efficient and friendly.  We were given apartment numbers 8041 and 8042. There was a main door from the corridor into a small lobby and then a door into each apartment which meant that when the main door was closed it was like having one large, spacious apartment. The apartments were very bright and the decor was fresh and modern. Each apartment had a balcony with views over the Yarra river. The kitchen area was compact but housed a dishwasher, microwave, fridge-freezer, oven and hob. The bathroom was large and modern with a lovely range of complimentary toiletries. A washer-dryer was situated in a cupboard within the bathroom and laundry powder was available to buy from housekeeping.  The bedroom was again spacious and bright and the bed was very comfortable. Despite the double glazing in the bedroom there was still a lot of noise from the trains and traffic and whilst this didn't prevent me from falling asleep it did stop me from getting back to sleep if I woke during the night. I admit to being a light sleeper and the noise didn't seem to bother my husband or my daughter.  Breakfast was included in our package and consisted of a hot and cold buffet. There was plenty of selection and the food was enjoyable. Room service is also offered and, although we only used it once, the food was delicious and the service was excellent.  There is a swimming pool in the building and although there isn't a gym on the premises use of a gym at the side of the river is provided to residents. My husband used it and thought it was fabulous! (Although I think it is very much a 'weight-lifters gym!)  Wi-fi is available in the apartments, although as seems to be the case in Australia it is much slower than in the UK.  We loved our stay in this accommodation. It was immaculately clean and modern, the service was superb and in terms of location it is perfect. The only downside is the noise from the trains, trams and traffic. I would however still stay here again and recommend it to other travellers.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401650456~“Wonderful stay once again”~Fantastic hotel in great location. I had a work function on early the next morning so was able to get a later check out. Had the one bedroom suite with the great views over Yarra river. Buffet breakfast was delicious and so much to choose from. Highly recommend this wonderful hotel .~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_400114686~“Great view of river. Small bathrooms.”~Hotel room was good sized, although the bathrooms were small. Our room had a beautiful view of the river. Friendly staff. Close to public transportation. Even though the hotel was downtown, it was quiet for the location.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_399455593~“Clean and tidy room. Sufficient facilities and helpful staff”~The room is quiet, spacious and comfortable. The tramstop is just nearby and you can take the tram easily. It is not situated at the crowded street so there won't be disturbing noise at night. There is a small warm pool but we hadn't got a chance to swim.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_399403301~“Excellent - bar one complaint”~Had two-nights here in a one-bedroom suite that I thought excellent. Central location and efficient and friendly reception desk. Suite offered plenty of space, kitchen was spotless and well appointed, and bedroom and bathroom were both of a reasonable size. The suites are very close to Flinders St but I was pleased that the noise from trains and trams rattling by did not intrude. My one complaint relates to wifi - you get half an hour for free but after that have to pay. It wasn't a massive amount but in this day and age wifi access should be like the TV or hot water - part of the service and included in the tariff. And that is now the case in at least 90% of the places I stay in.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_399050181~“On the Banks of the Yarra River”~We stayed here for three nights and our room was clean and well appointed with a small kitchenette. The King bed was quite comfortable and the location is excellent. We had a nice view of the Yarra River looking over Crown Casino and Southbank. The Williams Bar & Grill on the ground floor is good for breakfast. There are several very good restaurants within walking distance and many have river views. There is a transit line that runs right by the hotel and between the train and City Bus system we didn't need a car. Room rates are a good value at this Clarion Suites in the Central Business District.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_398652875~“Good location, everything you need”~Stayed here for 7 nights while attending a conference. We had the one bedroom apartment which was perfect. As it was a long stay it was nice to have somewhere to chill out and eat other than the bedroom. The staff were quite helpful. We had a long stay so we didn't receive any room services during our stay which was fine as the rate was so cheap! Location is good, just a short walk to the Casino and conference centre and tram stops literally just across the road. Would stay here again, not luxurious but a good base for a busy holiday.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_397852413~“Weekend getaway”~We stayed 2 nights in a 1 bedroom apartment with kitchenette.  Very comfortable with nice decor and fairly spacious.  The parking is somewhat expensive $27 per night and it's right next to the apartments - need to use intercom to enter and exit.  Disappointed that we had to pay $14 for buffet breakfast or $6.30 for continental breakfast for our 3 year old son.  We also had to pay for wifi.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397750127~“Great location.....”~This is our first visit to Melbourne, when we are looking for accommodation we found out that lots of hotel doesn't accept family with 2 child in one room. My child (2 and 6 years old) usually sleep together with us when we are travelling, after several correspondence and looking in the hotel compare web we choose Clarion suites gateway with 1 bedroom and 1 sofabed that suite with our arrangement. when we arrive @12.15pm we are welcome by one of hotel staff name Kelly, she is very nice to looked if there is any room available considering we are arrive after long flight from Denpasar and check in time is 2pm and she can find us one room available. the room is nice not to large but comfortable, complete with kitchen equipment (stove, plate and all cooking utensil), washing machine and large refrigerator. TV is available in bed room and in the living room, and have local Australia channel. Room cleaning is available everyday and towel is replenish every day. My overall review is i'm very satisfied with this hotel, with its price and room.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_397215182~“Central Location in city”~Bathroom was through main bedroom Breakfast was good in restaurant downstairs and waitresses were very helpful  My children said the pool was very shallow, but I guess as the pool is unattended this is probably safer~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_397188977~“Great location”~Rooms are good for a boys weekend footy trip etc. not flash but everything you require in a great location half way between MCG & Etihad. Not many eating places close by especially on weekend due to CBD location but restaurant on site does good food. Bar closes early on Sunday which was suprising. Staff are very well trained & really go out of their way to help.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_396026740~“Lee in Melbourne”~Clarion Suites Gateway, is the most appropriate name for this holiday apartments. Clean smelling and appearance. Very accommodating staff , friendly and helpful. Haven't been here before , but, I will be returning. Close to the best shopping at the DFO"s on the south bank and the Sea life aquarium for the kids. Free tram almost on the door step, or great walks, even to the National Gallery of Victoria.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_395977432~“Great place to stay”~Very good hotel - easy to get everywhere - walk to city or to the south bank in 5 mins, near trams. Staff lovely. Got free drink voucher on arrival and 15% off restaurant meals - the restaurant was very good. Also a bar for drinks which was great with happy hour and some free snacks. Room was excellent, plenty of space and they had soft loo paper! We booked sky bus back to airport via reception. We waited outside and the reception staff noticed we were there past the pick the time and so called sky bus to see what the delay was and came out to tell us - very good service. We would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_392458284~“Great! ”~Such a lovely hotel, we stayed in the one bedroom suite and it was beautiful. The corner suite looked out over the Yarra and the city. Comfortable beds and a lovely clean room. Staff were friendly and helpful. It's about a 5-10 minute walk into the city. Easy!  Would definitely go back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390933529~“We'll be back”~We'd normally stay at the two hotels next to the casino complex but with an online deal we found Clarion.  We were greeted with super friendly staff upon arrival and were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room. It was very clean and comfortable. I'm super picky with coffee but the one at the bar was delicious. Breakfast was also very nice. All staff were very friendly - an asset to your establishment.  The only downer was the shower was a little small for my 6ft3 hubby but all good for me ;)  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390533906~“Central location at an affordable price”~No, its not a 5 star Hotel, but the rooms are clean, well appointed, spacious, with nice views and a decent sized kitchen, which is great for extended business stays. Friendly attentive staff always willing to help if needed. I travel to Melb for business every three months and usually stay at 5 star hotels, but I find the rooms small, cramped and lacking natural light. Clarion Suites are spacious with plenty of natural light...with the bonus of being centrally located.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_388968536~“Very nice”~Nice room no view but exceptionally clean well appointed room and great location. Was modern and my apartment was perfect for work.

I didn't get to check out any of the facilities but will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383900147~“Outstanding Apartments”~Was pleasantly surprised checking in today - apartment has excellent appointments and, for a CBD location next to Flinders St Station - is very quiet (a decided relief compared to my last stay in Melbourne at a nearby hotel) and the staff too have been very helpful. Difficult to fault the location - close to Crown precinct, Convention Centre, Flinders St Station and has a tram stop almost on the doorstep.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383099538~“Short winter getaway”~Booked a one bedroom apartment at shot notice. Fantastic river views and very spacious. Loved the fact that bathroom could be accessed from lounge and bedroom.

Thank you to Anesu, Kelly and Eli for making our stay enjoyable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381740951~“Great except shower !”~The hotel is in great location, easy walk from Flinders St train station and Crown Casino. There is tram stop outside on Flinders street to be able to get to Docklands and around city easily. The room is spacious and clean, separate living area with full kitchen, small dining area, couch, tv.. Everything you would need. There is a separate bedroom with large comfortable bed. Can close the door from living to bedroom for quiet. Bathroom was the only negative... It is a bit small and access to the shower is a tight squeeze as the towel rail is on wall on side of shower door and I actually grazed myself trying to get into shower on sharp corner of metal towel rail... Really bad design.. Just not enough room to easily access shower. We had continental breakfast included which was really nice, eggs, bacon, cereals, fruit, breads, cakes etc Overall I would recommend this hotel but I personally wouldn't stay again unless I had a room with a different bathroom setup.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381333369~“Clean, comfortable and friendly staff.”~Having arrived at another hotel to find we had no booking (another story), I rang Clarion Suites if they had any rooms available that same night (Friday night). I told them I already had a booking with them - but it was for a few days later. I spoke to Asnun (I hope I spelt his name right) - he was very helpful and booked us a room straight away.  Upon check-in he was very helpful and even upgraded us to a 1 bedroom apartment!! The apartment had a full kitchen with dining and living area. It was very tastefully decorated. Also, it fronted Flinders street and the Yarra river, which provided great views - much to the delight of our 7yo daughter.  Will definitely look to stay here when we visiting Melbourne again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380453003~“Amazing views great location”~Fourth time we have stayed here. We were upgraded to the corner suite on Level 7 which has amazing views down to Flinders Street and the MCG and you can see over the bay and Crown Casino through the enormous windows. You won't be disappointed with the views.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_380436761~“Very Good”~The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating - I arrived an hour before check-in at 2pm and due to the fact that they were unable to check me in (not that I was expecting to be) I was given a complimentary drink while the staff found an appropriate room. The room was very clean and new, everything was in good condition and it was pleasant to stay in. When we went to check out however, two drinks from the restaurant had been added to our room charges when we hadn't even been into the restaurant. The staff were very helpful and took this off our account immediately. Would certainly stay here again!~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_377497298~“Mrs. Brown ”~Thanks again Clarion Suites Gateway. Awesome stay! 2nd time we have stayed & would not stay anywhere else! We (again) stayed in the corner suites above level 6 with fantastic views of Melbourne city. Great location. The rooms are spotlessly clean. The staff at the front desk were exceptional. Extremely professional, very friendly and very helpful. We own and run a motel so always look at attention to detail. The Clarion Suites Gateway is a winner.... Thank you.... See you next time we get some time off and venture into the city for a relaxing break!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Close to all main parts of the city with Aquarium on your doorstep and some great restaurants. Staff very helpful and attentive.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376248741~“Good suite with great location ”~Clarion was good from the start - I came off a 30hr trip from DC and they offered me a shower and place to stow my bag with no fuss, which doesn't always happen before check-in time so kudos for that. The room featured a kitchenette with washing machine which came in handy, and fridge, stove, oven, as well as a small lounge. the location is excellent - you are literally on the edge of the city so you are seconds away from the free tram which circles the city. Go up the road two seconds and you meet flinders lane with all the restaurants. It's a short walk to the main streets bourke and Swanson. Altogether a great stay at a good price.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374319925~“spacious, clean and wonderful views”~We had a two bedroom suite for 5 people and the views were amazing. the kitchen t was well stocked. We were only 1 km away from the centre of the city which was a nice walk and the free tram goes past the door. THe only downfall of the appartment was the 5th person was on the sofa bed in the main room and THERE WAS NO FREE WIFI. I cannot believe in this day and age Australian Hotels charge for WIFI. Europe, America and many other places have FREE wifi every where.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_373931092~“Gateway to Melbourne”~We recently spent a night overlooking the Yarra River in a well appointed room. From the check in staff to the end of stay this accommodation comes well recommended. Hotel is situated within easy walking distance to Crown Casino, Southbank, Degraves St, Melbourne Aquarium, Flinders and Southern Cross station and off course Melbourne's famous lane ways. Beds were very comfortable and room spotless. Will be back again~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_373908075~“Great spot, pity about the trains”~Stayed at the Clarion for two nights with wife and young son. Good rooms, great staff, nice view. Only blot was the noise from trains at Flinders, despite the double glaze windows.  Might need some work.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_373251402~“Great Location”~This is my 6th stay in 18 months and as usual it was great. The front desk staff are always very friendly, welcoming & helpful. My kids usually cant wait to get there because as a repeat guest you receive cookies in your room and my kids love them. The rooms are great but the river view are much nicer than the base accommodation rooms. We always stay in a 1 bedroom suite with the sofa bed for the kids and there is plenty of room. There is also a well equipped kitchen & washer & dryer. The hotel is within walking distance of the CBD, Crown Complex, South Bank and there is tram out the front which will allow to take a free tram to Harbour Town, Docklands and the Museum so it makes for a perfect location when visiting Melbourne.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
