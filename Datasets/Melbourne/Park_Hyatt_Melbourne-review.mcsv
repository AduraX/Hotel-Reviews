review_461906885~“Club Deluxe King”~We have just stayed in the Club Deluxe King room (1952) at the Park Hyatt and we were pleasantly surprised. We noted some previous reviews (here and online) that commented on the hotel being tired, but we couldn't agree. This was our first visit and wow what an entrance / reception. The hotel has a mix of decor (some art deco) that gave a sense of opulence. The staff were very pleasant and our room was ample in size, had great "blockout" curtains that had full coverage over the windows. The bathroom was large with walk through / around robe and separate toilet. A corner spa bath was a surprise (particularly as it had a TV built in above it) and the frameless glass shower was good in size, had wonderful water pressure and in a first for us, shower jets (2). The air-conditioning was very effective, the decor maybe a little too "woody" for our personal choice, but was in good condition and couldn't really be faulted. Throughout our 2 night stay the staff were fantastic, with nothing too hard. We were pleased that they had Nespresso coffee machines, in the room, but disappointed that they don't have milk frothers (reception offered to send up warm milk whenever we needed it as an alternative). The gym and pool are well setup, large, clean and the pool was warm, whilst the spa was very hot. The Club Lounge (benefit with this room) was spacious, had great views, but the food selections seemed a little miserly (when compared with other Club Lounges we have visited) Most of the time it was unattended so you were left to serve yourself, which is ok but not really what we expected (no barista so make your own machine coffee etc) Overall we had a great time and would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back, but not in room 1952 (housekeeping use the room next door and make a bit of noise and the views are better from the other sides of the building).~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478085905~“On the pricey side but well worth the money”~A very luxurious hotel on the edge of the city. Walking distance to the entire East side of the city and treasury gardens. This hotel takes you out of the hustle and bustle and let's you relax in style. The standard king bed rooms are plenty big and luxurious enough. Go spoil yourself!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477847510~“Family Retreat”~We stayed here as part of the epworth freemasons newborn hospital experience.

review_476748356~“Pretty Good, But Could Improve”~I have mixed emotions about this hotel. I stayed during the Easter week and did not get a suite upgrade upon check-in, but did get an upgrade to a room on the top floor with a view and fireplace, certainly large enough for my needs. The lounge was with quite an extensive array of foods and drinks and liquor, and the attending staff went above and beyond to provide great service. Most lounges are pretty sparse, but this lounge seemed to always be open and even had wraps at lunchtime - there was literally no need to ever go out to restaurants as a Globalist. This lounge was even better than the Westin in Tokyo. The bathtub has a large container of bath salts - the first in any hotel I’ve stayed at. Most places that do have salts usually have a tiny little packet that does nothing. Now for some of the downsides… As is mentioned in a number of posts, this is more like a small Grand Hyatt, in other words - one level down from the best. You may or may not see a porter - one of the front doors is left open for you to walk through the front door on your own. When you check-in, there is no particular recognition of your status as a Globalist other than to mention the upgrade; normally at any other Hyatt I hear, “I see that you are a Globalist, thank you for your loyalty." Although the welcome amenity has been discontinued, most Park Hyatts will still provide one, especially if there was any sort of a glitch with your check-in. In my case, I had to go back down to the desk to have the on-duty manager come in to unlock the door because the locks had “low voltage” needing extensive engineering for both rooms, both upon check-in and, again 3 days later, the day before checkout. Also upon check-in the room’s television sound didn’t work and again require engineering to come fix it. It is a wonder when the last time anyone was ever in the room and I was disappointed that there wasn’t any gift-recognition for running up-and-down to enter my room - as if I’d checked into a Motel 6. We came here after staying at the Park Hyatt Sydney and the differences are quite stark. As mentioned in many other posts, the staff in Sydney welcome you by name. The staff in Melbourne don’t know you from Adam. The shower has no separate wand shower head and there is no Toto toilet. Also, the restaurant’s breakfast buffet has a very limited number of blunt staff from Asia, giving the feeling of being in a Golden Corral, as opposed to being doted upon by Europeans, as in Sydney.  The next time I’m in Melbourne, for a conference next year, I am tempted to check out the Grand Hyatt or even the Westin, but maybe I’ll stay with what I know and come back here for the goodies in the lounge...~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_477112309~“Great Hotel - Average Food and Beverage”~We stayed at the Park Hyatt for the Easter Sunday experience and must say the facility is far superior. The bedding was excellent. However the Food and Beverage is the worst offering i have ever seen in a 5 star establishment. Maybe i was the last meal of the day? I would recommend anyone to stay there, however give the F&B a pass as there is far better on offer locally in the diverse Melbourne offering.~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476628603~“Quality style and elegance”~I enjoy the decor of this hotel, slightly Art Deco, lovely high ceilings, and relaxed ambience.

The staff are the Hyatts best asset, very professional and courteous with a genuine smile and happy to assist with requests.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476549514~“Luxurious, but a little dated”~Stayed here recently of the second time for one night on business. Generally this is a very high quality property (as you would expect from Park Hyatt) although I couldn't help feeling that its probably due a refurbishment in the not-too-distant future. The hotel is in a very tranquil setting not too far from Collins Street with a very appealing tree-lined driveway to the entrance. Its when you get to the lobby there is an overall 90s feel to the decor which extends to the rooms. I was upgraded to a mid-level room which was certainly large, quiet and well-appointed. However again the furnishings and decor just feels a bit dated and lacking in style compared to other PHs that I have stayed in (Paris, Seoul). Coffee table was quite badly scratched - all feeling a bit end of life. However bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom well appointed with a good size shower and a nice separate dressing room.  Used the gym (which overlooks a decent indoor pool) which was fine but could be slightly better equipped for the size. Great breakfast with very high quality buffet and a la carte options. Did not eat in the restaurant (which seemed very quiet) but had a drink at the bar which was totally dead for a Thursday night. Overall feels that the bar/dining options here are not the destination that the stop hotel in town would normally represent. Overall still a very high quality stay and (from the research I did) looks to be the best 5 star option in central Melbourne. Just not 100% up to the very high standards that this brand sets in many parts of the world.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476255436~“A luxurious CBD escape”~3 comedy shows across 2 nights seemed a good enough excuse for a romantic city getaway in the city and a return to the hotel where we spent our wedding night 11 years prior.

review_475986561~“Alienating good customers”~Booked via FHR, got upgraded, nice room and clean. But the service is poor for such a place.  - Check-in was handled very poorly, no explanation and rough  - included breakfast was a joke. Waiting 25 min in line for a buffet is substandard - during check-out the clerk didn't care about complaints  Next time crown towers again~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

It's getting a little bit worn down and could use a face-lift water pressure could be greatly improved but it still very luxurious, relaxed, huge rooms and has a great feeling to it. Fantastic lounge with great choices. The location is good not great. Breakfast is outstanding!! Looking forward to coming back in January.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475759086~“Nothing beats a Park Hyatt stay”~My wife and I always stay in Hyatt hotels when travelling, and as far as the Hyatt brands go, you are in for the best they have to offer when you stay at a Park Hyatt. Our stay at Park Hyatt in Melbourne was no different to our previous stays in other Park Hyatt hotels. Luxurious, fantastic service and quality in every aspect of our hotel stay experience. Also a good location with its proximity to the CBD.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475536010~“Nice hotel but concierge is worthless”~I have to start off by saying that we stayed at the Park Hyatt Sydney for a few days before Melbourne and had a fantastic experience. The concierge was fantastic in helping us plan daily activities, recommending restaurants, giving directions, etc. Unfortunately our experience at Park Hyatt Melbourne was just the opposite. They weren't at all familiar with the area, the only thing they could do was hand us a brochure of recommended tours but nothing that was individualized for us. It was a little disappointing as it was our first visit to Melbourne and it would have been great to have the help navigating the area and options of what to do as we did in Sydney. Overall it's a nice hotel with nice amenities but it doesn't compare to other hotels that we've stayed at in Australia.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474468489~“Dated extravagance with exceptional service”~It's rather like stepping back a few decades in this hotel thanks to the opulent but by no means modern decor, with gold and mirrors and wood panelling everywhere but the quality is still very good. It does feel like a very grand place to stay, and we chose to stay here for the last couple of nights of our honeymoon. Our room was fairly large with wood panelling throughout and carpets that looked about 50 years old but it was still a lovely room and the bathroom especially was very nice, with huge mirrors, fancy sinks, a spa bath and a TV next to the bath. With sliding doors throughout the room and a window between the bath and rest of the room this isn't the place for privacy though! We were surprised with a free bottle of bubbly and some sweets as a honeymoon gift which was a lovely touch that no other hotel we'd stayed in over our honeymoon had done. Every interaction with the staff that we had was fantastic, they were so diligent, friendly and keen to help. The only exception was when we went to breakfast on the final day when we waited a long time to be seated while countless staff members hurried past us. And then we were charged for the full breakfast even though we only had continental. This was corrected when we checked out though, and the newspapers they had added to our bill were removed too. Small oversights but corrected quickly and with no quibbles. And to make up for this, they outdid themselves when we ordered a taxi to take us to the airport. We had a stroll round the city then returned to find our taxi with our suitcases already loaded in and ready to go. A very nice touch. The location was quiet and nicer than a lot of areas of the city. The park very closeby is gorgeous and sprawling and worth a few long walks around. It only takes 5 minutes to get into the city proper.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay again but a few improvements with regards to the billing, breakfast service and new carpets would be needed to bump it up to 5* level!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474443392~“Great hotel”~Amazing rooms, great friendly service and a nice outdoor cafe/area to lounge. The cappuccino in the lounge is fantastic! Great central location. Went for a run past the Rod Laver tennis complex and down the river- 5miles. I'll be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474010068~“Would highly recommend ”~My husband and I were made to feel very welcome at Park Hyatt Melbourne; the complimentary bottle of champagne, macaroons and hand written welcome note was a lovely start to our wedding anniversary celebration. We also were given a glass of champagne at the restaurant which we enjoyed with our delicious meal and the breakfast buffet offered a large selection of equally enjoyable choices. Every staff member appeared to be happy to be at work and were extremely professional and friendly. Our room was very clean, spacious and being able to watch TV whilst soaking in the large bath was a treat. What would have topped off a very pleasing stay would have been having a massage in the day spa but unfortunately prior commitments prevented this; I guess I'll just have to come back. Thank you to Matthew Llewellyn-Jones (Guest Service Manager) for the email enquiring how he could make our up coming stay more memorable and to all of the staff who did indeed make our night at Park Hyatt Melbourne truly memorable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473934108~“Overall great stay despite a few blemishes...”~Fantastic location just a five minute walk from the Melbourne CBD. Stayed in a spacious Club King Room, which suited my requirements perfectly (a little rest and relaxation amidst a long business trip). Room service was impeccable, the gym facilities and equipment were top notch. Unfortunately, there were a few moments that were not consistent with the Park Hyatt hospitality standard, which included a refusal to accommodate a simple request for eggs and tea a few minutes before seven am at the property’s restaurant radii as I was rushing to the airport on the morning of my departure date. There were also room wifi issues that were not resolved by a condescending help desk resource when I most needed the connectivity.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_473726197~“PERFECT HOSPITALITY !!”~Felt like at home. Was automatically upgraded to a Club room. Entire staff was hospitable & courteous showing concern each time you met them. The location and ambience is just perfect for a relaxed vacation. Breakfast is very good, rooms could not be more clean, toiletries of very good quality, Wi Fi is super fast. Concierge very helpful. Hop On Hop Off stop is just a few steps. Collins street is a five minute walk. Special gratitude to Oliver & Haidi at the Front Desk.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_473316440~“Consistently excellent service”~I have stayed here on a number of occasions for business and leisure. True to its reputation, the Park Hyatt Melbourne offers large luxurious rooms with very nice appointments. I also love the fact that it is set in a quiet setting set back from the main road, affording more privacy and discretion for those who need it. The views from the windows are spending, especially from higher floors.  My only criticism is that the hotel is becoming a little dated, and despite its Park Hyatt branding, it doesn't quite live up to the extremely high standard set by other Park Hyatt hotels such as those in Sydney and Tokyo. I would love to see the hotel refurbished to match the level of newer Park Hyatt hotels.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_473291454~“Class, quality and professionalism”~We had a wedding in our home town and decided to use a hotel to get ready before and sleep the night after the long day. Being a special family event we decided to treat ourselves and fulfill a long term wish. And fulfilled it was! What a glorious hotel. Everything done to perfection. Our King Suite had everything we needed and more. The pistachio macaroons that awaited us on our return were a very nice touch.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473094847~“Short stay March 2017”~Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hyatt. We will return here in preference to any other hotel in Melbourne.

Radii Restaurant staff could not do more to make us comfortable and well fed.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473006808~“Stayed on the 19th floor”~Beautiful hotel lobby, can see several floors upon entering. Saw a lot of beautiful Murano glass on display. Staff great. Stayed on the 19th floor, so had access to the hospitality room (which was awesome for evening lite munches and drinks ...and some interesting but delicious desserts). Our room was large and overlooked the St Patrick's Cathedral next door. The room had a king bed, desk, and a small couch/chair. Bathroom was large, double sinks, nice shower, and separate tub. Also took the upgraded breakfast for $8. Breakfast provided excellent choices. A very comfortable 5 nights.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_472802080~“Park Hyatt Melbourne ”~Stayed here three times now.  Absolutely beautiful, elegant and classy hotel.  Would highly recommend to anyone.  Beautiful decor - different to all the other hotels.  You get oh so very bored with the new contemporary design everywhere else!! From the moment you walk in has a wow factor and the guest rooms compliment the whole feel of the place. It even smells nice! Marble finishes in the bathrooms are so fitting.  Day spa is just beautiful, swimming area is lovely and well well-maintained.  Location perfect - not packed in the middle of tall concrete buildings but just a stones throw out.  Definitely a five star hotel worthy of the badges on every level!  Stayed here for two nights before our wedding and were over whelmed with the level of care that all of the staff showed us. I can't complement the service of the staff and their attention to detail enough. From the moment of check in to checkout.  We will definitely be back .... again!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472077743~“Lovely luxury stay”~We had a lovely weekend break at the Park Hyatt in Melbourne. It's located at the end of the CBD area, just behind parliament, so is quiet but within easy walking distance of the restaurants and sights. The rooms are absolutely huge and extremely comfortable and the staff completely professional in the nicest possible way. The hotel has a fabulous 25 metre heated indoor pool and gym and a charming courtyard area where you can sit and enjoy a cocktail before hitting the high spots of an evening. It's a lovely spot for a self indulgent break.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_471953446~“Huge room, perfect Melbourne location”~We wanted to stay near but not in the central business district. This location was perfect: it's set back from the road, in a park-like location about three blocks from the "Paris" (upscale shop) end of the CBD. It's only a block to multiple tram lines. The hotel wasn't "tired" in the least. It was truly elegant with beautiful wood inlays, marble floors and a huge staff. Our room (a Club Deluxe) had a very large bathroom and looked out over the Cathedral--beautiful at night. The Club access was worth the additional charge: continental breakfast and near full evening meal (!) as well as drinks in a large, open space overlooking the city. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I can't think of a nicer place to stay in the central city area.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_471570145~“Best hotel stay I've had in a while!”~This hotel was a gem - a truly relaxing experience while I was visiting Melbourne for the first time. The check in staff were very friendly, however my room wasn't ready when I arrived around noon. Around 3-4pm my room was finally ready and I checked in. I was blown away at the luxuries and attention to detail. I spent a majority of my time in the room because I didn't want to leave! Any time I called the front desk, or housekeeping, they addressed me by name and were quick to respond to any request. Housekeeping was very good, the bed was very comfortable, and I used the dry cleaning services which were very efficient. Also - the air conditioning worked very well - which I found to be a rarity in Australia. I also used the spa downstairs, which they were nice enough to fit me in that afternoon. I had a great time here at the Park Hyatt, and would definitely use them again. Thank you!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

Excellent room service food-special callout for the pasta napolitano-and service. We had a wonderful view of the city from our room. The business center is great and includes a printer. I was concerned about having just an indoor pool but they have a great sun deck! Gym was not huge but didn't feel claustrophobic and had a lot of equipment. Turndown service is such a nice touch. If you don't want to pay hotel prices for food and coffee, there's a great little cafe right around the corner called Mr Tod. Two thumbs up!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469811794~“Um.... not sure how to comment about it as a Park Hyatt”~Was there for business which I did have some expectations about Park Hyatt Melbourne.  It was indeed a bit disappointing. The room itself was big, nice room but... just old. The carpet looks so old! What's the most amazing part? Their 'vintage' shower head! I wondered how many people may have hit their head while showering and washing their heads?  The room's sound proof is bad! I could hear everything next room was doing! Obviously the guest next door was checking out early and having a late night as I heard everything. It made my stay not rested well which was tough on my tight schedule.  Sorry of saying this but I guess likely not, I prefer to stay again here though.  To be fair to say, the reception girl checked me in was nice. The F&B at banquet was of good quality too. Just that, not a Park Hyatt standard to me.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469525250~“Best in town”~Always my first choice in Melbourne, this recently built hotel is generously sized yet has a boutique feel to it. Situated in a quiet location just north of the CBD, it is still only a short walk to the attraction of Chinatown, the restaurants of Little Flinders Street and the business end of town. Rooms are huge and perfectly appointed. Staff always pleasant and helpful. It is perfect for longer stays as a result. Radii restaurant is spectacular, not too busy at night, but can be quite hectic at breakfast. It seems to have a high end business clientele so I go a little later than normal for a more relaxing experience.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_468184968~“Disappointing off brand property”~We came to this hotel immediately after the Park Hyatt Sydney and the two properties could not be more different . The hotel is very dated and our immediate impression on arrival on a Saturday afternoon was that we'd come to a convention hotel - very noisy with various events , no visible bell staff and an overwhelmed, understaffed front desk . Despite having agreed an early check in, our room wasn't available until after 1530 and although it was the highest grade below a suite , it felt tired , with inadequate storage and none of the style of the five other Park Hyatt properties we've visited in the US, Europe and Asia. The housekeeping and restaurant quality and service is hit and miss and not of the quality Park Hyatt promises or we've experienced in their other hotels. The Park Hyatt brand promises "an intimate hotel experience that celebrates fine art, delicious food and wine, and truly personalized service " . This hotel definitely does not fit that description in any way . Hyatt should either renovate and upgrade this property or change it to another of their brands . in the meantime we will not be returning.~3~nan~3~nan~2~nan~3~nan

review_468212728~“GREAT HOTEL BUT FOR 4 THINGS”~PARK HYATT MELBOURNE world class except for the lack of air-conditioning water pressure and hot water also because of the preset air-conditioning it uncomfortable to sleep under the Doona as there is no top sheet if the could fix these things it would be 6 star~5~4~5~2~5~5~5~nan
review_467928179~“Old and tired, surly Front Desk staff”~You need to ramp down your expectations if you have stayed at other Park Hyatt locations. The hotel is in need of a serious renovation....soiled carpets, poor lighting, etc... I agree wholeheartedly with Vandy12's review below. The Front Desk staff are not professional. If I may correct that ....there is a distinct difference across gender lines here. The women working at the Front Desk are polite, professional and upbeat. Every male I dealt with was flustered and annoyed. Also, the towels and linens need updating as does their laundry service since the sheets and towels all looked a bit grey. Not a 5 star experience.  There are some positives at this location. The property is very clean and the housekeeping staff are superb as are the two ladies that run the Club lounge.~2~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_467660303~“A nice property with good value for the money - lots of odd quirks”~This Park Hyatt was an excellent value for the Club Deluxe King room we paid for - an approx. 600 sq ft room with large marble tub and bathroom with mostly updated amenities. The hotel itself is host to several quirks, not the least being inconsistent service. Upon checking in, as the hotel encourages on its website, we requested a room with a view of the cathedral. Upon learning none were available we were told that there was a room on the 19th floor with city views, which sounded good enough for us. When we expressed a desire to ensure the room wasn't near an elevator or staff room (as prior reviews noted these were quite noisy) the man showed us a picture of two available rooms, both on the 10th floor, neither with views. I asked him what about the 19th floor room, twice during the conversation (the first time he tried to ignore it until I pressed again and he said that it was available the first day but management had blocked it off for the weekend). I understand making a mistake, but trying to duck and hide and not admit the error was extremely off-putting. I'm a businessman myself and understand full bookings and I inquired if any rooms opened up the following day or day after with a view. He claimed that there were no such openings. Very unusual, but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief. Even if all the above is correct, here's the rub - I had planned a dream vacation to Australia for over half a year and this hotel could not assure me of a room with a view, which I would have very willingly paid much more for. As such, if you're looking to make a holiday or vacation trip magical and memorable, this hotel is not the place to do it. It can, at most, guarantee you a very nice and large room with a view of their trash facilities. I consider myself a very flexible traveler given the class of hotels I generally stay in and this hotel's ability and effort to accommodate my request was worse than what I had experienced at a very nice Hampton Inn in Atlanta, Georgia. Also, after checking in, we were told that the man at the front who had taken our luggage would follow us up to our room and deposit our luggage for us. Upon arrival to our room, we patiently waited so I could change into more comfortable shoes to tour the city. We waited... and waited... until after 45 minutes we called to inquire when our luggage would arrive. They said it was on the way, when 3 minutes later, they called us again asking our names (clearly they had no idea who we were or what luggage was to be sent to our room). This kind of "service" is pretty abominable as we are healthy people in our 30's and could have easily taken our luggage up to the room ourselves and gotten out and into the city much faster if their service staff had not bungled what should have been a relatively easy task. This was one of the worse check-ins I've experienced in some time. After that terrible first hour though, things perked up. The room is quite nice. The lounge has terrific views. The elevators are quick. Heidi at the front desk was terrific and provided exceptional service. The included continental breakfast is a bit odd with the $8 upcharge for hot foods, especially since one day we were charged the upcharge even though we never used it any time during our stay. This policy seems very prone to errors the way it is set-up and is an odd nickel-and-diming decision for a 5-star hotel. Conversely, the rooms provided us with a free water bottle every day (as opposed to most I've stayed in only providing one on the check-in day). Again, very odd decisions on how to shape a 5-star service experience. In summation, if you want a great value on a luxuriously appointed room interior I would definitely recommend this hotel. If you are looking for a 5-star service experience that will make your vacation holiday magical and memorable I would unfortunately have to recommend a different property. The Park Hyatt Melbourne probably could provide such an experience, but you will be rolling the dice and gambling, hoping you luck out.~3~nan~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467653676~“Timeless & relaxing”~Timeless hotel with a relaxed and classy feel. Great staycation at the top end of town. Close to shops and quaint cafes. It's getting to that time when the rooms need a bit of a refresh but overall great service and calming atmosphere.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan

review_467150591~“All About money not service. ”~Wont be staying here again, its all about money not service. I am a gold hyatt passport member and have stayed at the park hyatt several times, loyalty is no longer valid at this hotel. I booked a room and asked for a 1 pm checkout complimentary, it was refused and i was advised i would have to pay for half a day to get a late checkout so i cancelled the booking. Whenever i stay at grand hyatt i am happily granted late checkouts without the mention of money as you would expect being a member and a loyal guest. Service at the park hyatt does not exist.....Ill stay at grand hyatt from now where service is fantastic.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467120550~“Beautiful hotel.”~My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and didn't want to leave. It's absolutely beautiful and the staff were all wonderful and polite. Our room wasn't ready until 15 minutes after the check in time but we were offered complimentary drinks to compensate- not that it was a huge issue. It was extremely spacious and beautifully styled. Location is fairly convenient and shops/food are within walking distance.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467049402~“Stephen Mentzines”~Excellent hotel, outstanding and high quality rooms, very large by any standard and consequently lots of space and storage space. Room was completely silent the entire time of my stay.  Staff were ok, had an issue with the late check out when one of their service staff attempted to keep entering the room insisting check out was earlier. Sorted with full and appropriate apology at front desk but should never have happened.  ~4~3~4~5~5~4~4~nan

review_466410524~“Amazing”~This place is amazing. We have been meaning to stay here for ages and recently, we got the chance. The hotel is in our home town so we only stayed one night. Upon checking-in we were told we had an upgrade to a suite. Well, when we entered the double doors to the suite we found an amazing room that was so luxurious and huge. We have travelled the world and this is the best room we have stayed in. They also provided a lovely birthday gift of sparkling wine and cake. Everything about the place oozes luxury. The down side was that we only stayed one night. We'll definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_466353540~“Excellent hotel. Shame about the staff”~This is a stunning hotel with a great location and views. We had a super room. What lets this hotel down is the staff and service which are very disappointing. The alarm clock woke us at 4 am! Clearly set by another guest. When I complained at the front desk she really didn't seem that interested. The housekeeping was very poor, they took the cups away and didn't replace them. Amenities like shower gel were never replaced. Even when we phoned and asked for them they forgot! The breakfast was amazing But yet again let down by the staff. I asked for some fruit which had run out at the Buffett it never came and coffee took ages to arrive.  Such a shame as this could easily have been the perfect place if the staff actually cared.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466353380~“Luxury in City Center”~This particular Park Hyatt is well maintained and has beautiful interiors.  We opted for breakfast program and it was well worth it. There is a great spa and pool. Also, high tea in afternoons.. A full service hotel within walking distance of restaurants, buses and gardens. Although, our room didn't have much of a view we really didn't notice since we were busy all day.. Wonderful amenities in room and very nice bathrooms.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466343975~“Beautiful hotel in great location!”~My husband and I stayed in the Park Hyatt for 4 nights in March. We booked through Amex which included daily cold buffet breakfast and a room upgrade if available. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of options, including a hot bar for a bit extra if you wanted to make your own omelette or eggs. The hotel itself is located in the Central Business District (CBD) which is centrally located walking distance to several shops, restaurants, and bars. The concierge and all of the hotel employees were incredibly friendly and helpful providing directions and restaurant recommendations. On our last night we also discovered below the restaurant there is a beautiful lounge bar area where we had some delicious local wines and enjoyable a relaxing atmosphere. We would definitely recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466151973~“Great room but no-one on reception?”~Great location and great standard of design in room. Wood panelled all around and nicely laid out bathroom set up. Definitely 5 star standards. However on arrival there was no-one on reception - the area was deserted and it was only 940 pm. Not very welcoming for this standard of hotel. Good value for the price and much better and more modern rooms than other hotels around $300 mark in CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465963261~“Just so wonderfully perfect”~My second stay here and I tried Executive Lounge status. Nothing was happening up at the Lounge at 5:30pm but that all changed half an hour later. Superb array of food appeared which I cheerfully scoffed. Meanwhile back at the room everything was perfect. I wish I could be bothered to use the bath but it doesn't really matter as it's just so nice to relish pure luxury of the bathroom and dressing room. The bedroom was large with a fireplace - note to oneself, come back in winter. Breakfast at the restaurant was magnificent. Staff are delightful. I'll be back in May!

review_465954424~“Dated luxury hotel”~This is not your typical modern Park Hyatt hotel, nor is it vintage enough to be charming. The property has seen better days and could use a major facelift. While large, the layout of our room was unusual with curved walls and awkward dead spaces in the corner (room XX68). Also, the doors are not sound-proof at all so you will hear your neighbors enter and exit their rooms. Gym is okay, but not a lot of equipment. Location is quiet, near Parliament, but it is only about a 10+ minute walk to the restaurants along Flinders Lane and there is a free tram stop outside hotel and taxis.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465640967~“Short business trip”~On arrival in Melbourne greeted warmly by reception staff , check in process pretty straight forward . Room was spacious with all needed amenities for business traveller .  Breakfast takes place in ground floor bar/dining area . Selection is quite expansive although bit confusing on how they track people and whether continental or cooked breakfast guests . My breakfast was part of rate yet on checkout there was a $40 charge , although when raised it was immediately removed from bill. The club room for business meetings and drink receptions is nicely laid out and gives great views of the city .  Overall very enjoyable stay , although one negative is early closure of dining and bar around 10pm .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465468188~“Poor service ruins a great hotel”~Having previously written a glowing review about this hotel, I feel a little embarrassed to be writing a negative one this time. I feel however, that reviews are for people doing their research on a property and as such, need to read the good and the bad. One such situation is this. Here we have an employee, Jonathan who I would describe as being the exception, rather than the rule. I have just spent 18 of the last 19 nights in a Hyatt property, namely the Bellagio in Las Vegas, the Andaz in London and the Park Hyatt in Dubai. All awesome hotels with awesome service.  Jonathan didn't care that I had done this, nor that I had patronised the Park Hyatt Melbourne, many times previously. In fact, he's exactly the type of person hotel patrons need to avoid. He's what I call a corporate employee with no personal service skills. He's the guy that's going to stop you from enjoying some benefits, because he can't see that your loyalty to the brand and the Park Hyatt in particular, is benefiting long term from a customer like me. Thank you for showing me that your hotel is complacent and no longer values my business.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465030796~“Go for rooms on the higher floors”~Location is great - close to the tram stops, 10 minutes from good food and wine (City Wine), 15 mins from chinatown with a even wider selection of good eats (Punch Lane etc). I didn't try any of the F&B options in the hotel as there was so many other choices available within walking distance. Room lighting was a bit dim. I gave feedback on this and the hotel manager wrote back saying that they were already looking to upgrade the lightings in the rooms. Room was spacious and clean. Front desk service was good - i had asked for a change to a quieter room and this was handled efficiently without fuss. Ask for a room on a higher floor. I would have given 5 stars if i had the higher floor room from checkin.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464980474~“Good but could have been better”~Decided to stay here for 1 night since I heard so many of my friends saying it's such a nice place etc.. Upon checking in we were greeted by a young man whom I forgot but I think he was Indian? (Sorry if I am wrong) he advised that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a suite. That was of course amazing! He advised that our room was not ready yet and told me that he will call once it was ready. I never received a call to let me know when the room was ready so I ended up calling myself... :/ anyways once we got to the room it was very spacious, clean and big but the only problem was that it was literally right next to the lift (room 1951) and when sitting around in the living room, we could hear people talking and also the lift constantly making the ding sound. I did request for a quiet room away from the lifts but due to the hotel being full occupancy from Australian Open, I guess i had no choice so I guess I had to deal with it but it wasn't too bad.. just the constant ringing off the lift was annoying! Although, we did really appreciate the upgrade as the room was very lovely! Also, we received a bottle of champagne and macarons from the guest services team. Thank you Matthew Llewellyn-Jones for your lovely gesture! ^_^ the macarons were lovely!  The view from the 19th floor we had was also nice. We had a view of the cathedral and city so that was okay. The executive club was decent and breakfast in Radii Cafe was also nice. Lots of selections to choose from.Friendly staff and good service. Staff were always going out of their way to help. I just want to give a thanks to Mitchell the front office team leader for trying his best to assist us with a room move but due to full occupancy it couldn't be met :( oh well. The only 2 let downs I would say about this place was the room being next to the lift when the request was to be put away from the lifts and also I found a dirty spoon with my coffee cup which stopped me from enjoying a coffee in my room which was a shame..  Overall, pleasant stay and service and staff were good but those two flaws brought it down for me to give it a 3 star rating. I would still recommend this place to family and friends though.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464958087~“Wow!”~Spent 5 nights here with two girlfriends for a fun week of shopping, touring and eating. We loved every minute of our stay here; the location on the edge of the city made it perfect to come back to after a busy day. What topped it off was the wonderful pool and spa area, a place to swim laps or just relax, we used it every day. We went to see Kinky Boots one evening at Her Majesty's and were able to walk there in 5 minutes. The staff were relaxed, professional and courteous. A beautiful, silver ice bucket of ice delivered whenever needed, friendly doormen and a lovely smell and music as you walk into the lobby. Great buffet breakfast. Will be back ASAP.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
