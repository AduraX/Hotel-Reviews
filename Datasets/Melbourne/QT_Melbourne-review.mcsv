review_478459729~“30th wedding anniversary ”~Absolutely beautiful hotel right in the heart of the city. Within walking distance to sporting venues, theatres, shopping and restaurants. Amazingly friendly staff, beautiful clean rooms and the most comfortable beds ever. Would definitely recommend. And complementary champagne to celebrate our wedding anniversary.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478372689~“QT - Attention to detail”~The service and attention to detail at this hotel was impeccable. The room was a generous size, decor stunning, the bed amazing, and bathroom gorgeous. I loved the fluffy oversized bath towels and over stocked minibar. The rooftop bar didn't disappoint, and the apricot Moscow mule is definitely worth a try. Breakfast at the restaurant was delicious and the cold pressed coffee gave a freshness to the meal. Valet parking always a must in Melbourne. QT we will be back with our friends and family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478248556~“Bliss Funky rooms and roof terrace ”~Great location and surprisingly quiet. Beautiful rooms and gorgeous bedding.  Worth taking a drink or two on the terrace. Recently opened and over Easter break was very quiet. Will soon be a busy place I'm sure. Valet parking and very attentive staff.  Breakfast choices were good but some dishes a little odd and heavy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478184478~“Wow, so modern and stylish, very funky!”~My husband and I stayed at the QT on a recent Saturday night after hearing a glowing recommendation from my co-worker. I was not disappointed! Everything about this new hotel on Russell Street (the former Great Union Cinema building near Bourke St Mall) is WOW! The location is so central and the hotel is so stylish and funky, I loved it. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, I was impressed. Our room was lovely, the stylish décor is modern and quirky, the room lighting is beautiful, a lot of thought has been put into the interior decorating. And the bed!!! The bed and pillows are the BEST I have ever slept on in a hotel!!! Really really comfy. The mini bar is impressive - so many cute items to eat, drink or play with! The bathroom is beautifully modern (two basins, separate shower, separate toilet) AND you can slide a panel aside so that you can look into the bedroom while brushing your teeth, cool! And a very impressive Wahl hair dryer that does a great job! So many small touches that made a great impression. There are two bars in the hotel - the rooftop bar upstairs (too busy and too noisy at night - loud music! - for us) and the ground floor bar, which we much preferred. Our room deal included breakfast - the breakfast/dining area is quite large, we could choose one item off the breakfast menu and we both opted for the Bircher Muesli as we weren't very hungry. It was beautifully presented and flavoured, I could not eat it all. I would not hesitate to stay here again, it's lovely and perfect for couples.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_478163455~“Our new fav”~Staff are delightful and happy to help all the time. We loved the free movies and room size. Drinks on the rooftop are a must, and as a hotel guest you get first preference too. Dinner and breakfast in the restaurant was lovely. Great city location doesn't hurt either. Thanks for a great stay - will be back in June!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478127099~“Lovely experience awesome staff”~Very interesting hotel to stay in. The staff are fabulously friendly and made you feel at home. Nothing was too hard and they planned many site seeing trips. We didn't have to book anything ourselves at all including shows. What fantastic service. The rooms were totally delightful and free movies not like other hotels that gouge you for everything . The hotel is situated in the middle of the city district so you don't get views over the water . Just a city. Very central to all of the good restaurants and shopping. You won't be disappointed if you stay there~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477920713~“Don't waste your time”~The reviews said an hour wait so I phoned and they said no need to book. We were 3 ladies dressed well for my birthday drinks at 630 pm Saturday night. We were turned away. Unprofessional and base. I wouldn't recommend.  .~1~nan~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_477881342~“Wife's birthday treat”~Funky, modern, stylish hotel pretty much right in the middle of the CBD, close to everything. Casually dressed commissionaire/bellhop greeted us on arrival, wasn't sure if they were hijacking and taking our car for a joyride! Fears allayed when a very polite young man gave us a valet parking receipt!  Next day a charmingly cheerful and chatty girl in distinctly un-commissionaire like clothes greeted us warmly when departing and returning to the hotel, ticked a lot of boxes for us!! Modern room with extensive minibar and quality furnishings even from a basic king room. We had free brekky deal which is good but I have to say I rather missed a 'bloat yourself buffet'. Room reasonable price with free wifi, valet parking and brekky but may have been a tad pricy without. Liked the pristine decor which is only natural considering how new the hotel is. Rooftop bar is a great attraction and very busy after work hours with stunning city skyline views, being of the 'old fart' era, the music was a tad loud and obtrusive but then the 'youngsters ' seemed not bothered, worth a look on 11th floor. Definitely would strongly recommend this hotel and hope to return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477870688~“Nice new hotel in a great location”~Can't fault it - beautiful room, good lighting options, great bathroom. Staff at check in we very nice and courtious, however with the bar access being in the same lifts as guest access we were directed to the queue for the lifts with other people when it was clear we were the guests (and had bags with us) but that's a minor thing. Breakfast is absolutely fantastic! Would stay here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476988245~“Amazing and unique experience ”~QT Melbourne was an absolute pleasure to stay at! Amazing customer service - especially Dave who was happy to help us with absolutely anything. All staff were super friendly and the entire hotel was gorgeous. Definitely worth while. We had a big family there for a 22nd birthday and their whole team made it very special. Will be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476780464~“Fantastic establishment.”~Awesome place to crash for a short stay or more. Right in the heart of the nightlife scene, with great views from the rooms and staff that were exceptionally friendly. From the spacious hallways with beautiful ambient lighting and large wooden doors leading to each of the enchantingly decorated rooms, to the odd lift that speaks to you upon exiting, the overall look and feel of the hotel was amazing.  The stay was definitely made by the warm and welcoming hosts at the front desk (especially one very charming Donnie Darko-loving lady) and the rest of the staff, including security.  Despite receiving my room for free as part of a competition I won through a third party company, I would have gladly paid to stay and intend to if I visit Melbourne again!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476673487~“I want to live here!”~I've been to QT Canberra several times for work but managed to stay at QT Melbourne for a birthday and was blown away by pretty much everything. The rooms are warm, comfortable and the level of finish is great. I work for a design and build company so i am very picky. However the restaurant, the rooftop, everything is finished extremely well.  We had dinner and drinks on the rooftop, the services was fantastic and the food was awesome! espresso martinis are 12/10! Staff were great, very helpful David & Tess were stand outs!  Considering this was during December and the hotel was almost fully booked out they were still very very accommodating Wish i could have stayed longer, drunk espressos on the roof and enjoyed the sunset night after night! TAKE ME BACK PARADISE CITY!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476649378~“Amazing experience”~The hotel aims to provide an experience and it delivers.

review_476289492~“Amazing!”~My husband and I had a very rare night off from our toddler and decided to try out the QT Melbourne! I had heard good reviews since it opened last year and had always wanted to stay at a QT (known for their quirkiness and style). Well this did not disappoint!  From the moment we pulled up, we were greeted by two staff. Our car disappeared (to valet parking) and we were efficiently checked in by a team of very professional and well presented reception team. We were upgraded to a corner king room (thank you) and were delighted by the size and uniqueness of the room. Goodbye boring white walls, beige carpet and standard ensuites and hello concrete, steel, wood and a stand alone bath with a view! And the bed....comfiest thing I have ever slept on!! I knew it was going to be good (anything without a toddler coming in in the middle of the night is!) but it was truly amazing. The bathroom is somewhat connected to the main room with cool sliding doors, allowing privacy when you need it, but also allowing me to enjoy the new release movie (free by the way) whilst brushing my teeth or having a shower! We enjoyed a dinner out but came back to enjoy after dinner drinks at the roof top bar. QT have done a brilliant job of this spectacular space. Great vibe, great views, great staff and a fun menu. The twist on the classic G&T was my fave. After our very restful sleep, we enjoyed breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Pascale. My husband couldn't decide between the benedict and the waffles so had both! And said they were the best waffles he's had! Overall we had a fabulous time at QT Melbourne. If you don't get an opportunity to stay just pop in to see the amazing interior, enjoy a drink on the roof top or dine at Pascale. Great location too. Thanks to the staff for maintaining an excellent standard.....you should all be proud!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476266648~“A pretentious hotel, with arrogant rude and inexperienced staff”~The only thing different about this hotel, is the appalling pretentiousness and culture of arrogant service that should be an embarrassment to all involved on the weekend my family and I stayed. Management were informed, specifically and promptly about our issues and did nothing about it. Worst hotel, I've ever stayed at, anywhere.  Their website, and art and design filled hotel, comfortable light filled rooms and amazing beds, with minimal and elegant fixtures: is all nothing at all if the service and staff are pretentious, superior, and shouldn't be working in hospitality when they lack the basic skills required to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. There are better, less expensive places to stay and eat in Melbourne that represent what a great city this is, save your money, this hotel is embarrassing. Maybe it's because it's very new, but I don't think so.  The best thing about my stay was being with my family and watching the way my 14 and almost 16 year old children had more grace, charm, manners, maturity and life experience to navigate simply revolting customer service, almost every single person belonging to a kind of empowered culture of service at the hotel to behave in a way that was arrogant and totally lacking in care and seemingly they were proud to do so. There were a couple of exceptions : management was not one. Wait staff in the Pascale Restaurant were overworked and charming; room service staff were cheerful and positive. Everyone else seemed to be more concerned with their importance, and looking at themselves in the abundant reflective spaces and surfaces on offer, for the two days and nights we stayed. My advice: look for somewhere else to stay. This was a terrible experience.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476259891~“Great boutique hotel!”~Brilliant hotel in general. The food (especially the desserts) are exceptional with quick service and delicious food in general (I ordered the Birds Milk for dessert and the Waffles for breakfast).  The rooms were nice and clean with comfortable big beds but I personally was not very fond of the bathroom design as they had no doors to lock yourself in and it was a bit too small for me. The tv had a nice touch as you get free movies in the tv. Overall,this hotel is easy to get to,clean and comfortable with great food and a nice atmosphere in the bar!~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476021186~“Amazing hotel with great design but...”~Booked QT for a staycation over the Easter Break. Love to frequent boutique hotels when I travel for their unique style and this was no exception. Amazing design and very much one of my favourite in terms of the room and general facilities. Loved the little touches and atmosphere on the rooftop was great. Major disappoint...was provided with an upgrade to a higher up room on arrival which I thought was extremely lucky...turns out not. Was kept awake until 3am due to extreme noise outside. Very annoyed and definitely ruined what would've otherwise been a great experience.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475234241~“Not as expected”~Pretty average overall. Was expected more but did not live up to the hype. Quirky but not novel. Nothing innovative or new and the staff are too snobby. They make you feel like you should be privileged to stay there. Nice fit out though.~3~2~nan~nan~5~nan~1~nan
review_474606644~“The most over rated and over designed place in Melbourne ”~I saw an article in Artichoke magazine about this place and it caught my eye. It looked interesting, but like most 'now' design Places - it looks much better in a photo shoot. In reality it's just trying too hard to be something it not.  I go to Melbourne often for both business and family events. I stayed at the QT for 4 nights from Thursday to Saturday and paid a premium to get a better quality room. What a waste of time and money. My first impression when I arrived was that it was a funky hotel staffed by hipsters all dressed weirdly and had a good vibe. It was all downhill from there. For the privilege of paying $50 to have my car valet parked - and then not able to get it when I needed it - despite booking it an hour beforehand on Friday morning - it did not turn up. And as a result I was 15 minute late for my first appointment. In the end I decided to park it elsewhere for the next 3 nights.  Breakfast was included but the service at the revered 'Pasquales' on level 1. The service on every day I went there was so poor, (ages to be seated, no one to take your order, etc, etc) more like missing in action - and on the Monday it took 45 minutes for a simple omelete to arrive at my table from when it was ordered. The general vibe of the place is staff standing around looking groovy - but not flowing smoothly or working seamlessly.  I did not dare to try lunch or dinner in a place that could not serve a simple breakfast.  Apparently this place is the place to be seen on a Friday and Saturday night on the level 11 bar. So huge line ups of Melbourne's wanna be's trying to get up the level 11 terrace. Apparently guests have preferences but this was not my experience. The extra security guards where self absorbed and not managing guests well at all. A complete schmozzle both nights to get to the lift to get to my own room on level 6. I had to raise my voice to a woman to move out of the way while she pretentiously chatted on her phone. Some people are are just so self-absorbed. When I ventured up to the Terrace bar on L11 - I just saw flocks of hipsters and millennials trying so hard to be noticed. It was tragic.  My room was adequate but like most things designed to the hilt - the lighting was not quite right. Nowhere to hang your towels in the bathroom. The mini bar selection was full of unhealthy crap. The room service menu was very limited and no real healthy choices. I ended up going out for lunch and dinner just to find some decent food.  I will never go back to a unauthentic pretentious place like this. For the same amount of money in Sydney I get a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom fully serviced Meriton apartment with kitchen and laundry - 5 kms from city centre. See previous review I did about Meriton Waterloo.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474418906~“Disppointing experience”~Booked a king room and were given a disabled room Asked for a room with a desk when we checked in as we are regular corporate travelers and need a desk to work at. We were told that would be $300 extra per night for a room with a desk!! We normally stay at the Novotel with a desk included and tried this hotel twice now, staff are awesome but the remainder of the experience wasn't great Then when we checked out and the girl asked how was your stay, I told her and she said oh it shouldn't have been that much - so who knows~1~2~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_474393230~“Luxurious”~I love the QT series of hotels, they are always quirky and pay attention to the small details. The room was spacious and bed was comfortable. Great location for shopping, entertainment in the city or work meetings. Great restaurant and cafes on site for the all important Melbourne coffee fix.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474378969~“Fabulous hotel!”~What a fabulous hotel! Loved that this was not just another cookie cutter hotel. From the staff, to the interiors, our stay was memorable for so many reasons! The only downside (and these were minor and probably just glitches on the day) was breakfast took a VERY LONG time to arrive which meant a hasty checkout (we were sat in a not very busy restaurant for a good 45 minutes before our food arrived). We also wanted to utilise the app to check out (because of how long breakfast took) but we were unable to do so. When I informed the front desk during check out, they didn't really seem to care (probably because its out of their control).  But honestly, apart from those very minor incidents, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. We'll definitely be going back :)~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_473112739~“Modern hotel with a welcoming staff”~QT is a modern hotel in the middle of Melbourne CBD. The staff goes above and beyond to help you with everything. They are always there to shorten your time while you are waiting for someone. The level of service is just outstanding.  Prices in restaurants were a bit too high and the food was very oily but it applies to most dining places in Melbourne.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472764411~“Q for Quirky Quality”~From the voice over in the elavator to the charming porters dressed beautifully to the Roof top bar and great rooms, there was nothing to complain about in the QT experience.

review_472700915~“Fabulous Staff & Location”~We were greeted with a smile and great service upon arrival - this continued throughout our 4 night stay. Staff were all friendly and helpful.

review_472527632~“Great new hotel - now a favourite stay”~Now stayed twice. Great city centre location, wonderful helpful staff, great decor throughout. The rooms are very comfortable (even the smallest lead-in rooms) and the beds heavenly. Good bathroom with nice toiletries. The rooftop bar is pretty good (has indoor and outdoor areas). Only thing letting it down is the gym, which is pretty basic. Now our favourite place to stay in Melbourne - highly recommended.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_472225874~“Quirky and comfortable”~A great Melbourne hotel. Decided to upgrade to a King deluxe upon checking in. The room was comfortable with great design and attention to detail. Spacious bathroom with a modern look and fixtures. The minibar had a great selection of snacks and drinks, complete with blue and green lighting. Our room was situated on the Russel street side. Light sleepers may be bothered by traffic noise or the surrounding pubs, but this was not an issue for us.  Breakfast was included with the room so we ate at Pascale's restaurant in the hotel, which included tea or coffee, a fresh juice and one meal selection. Plenty of variety in the breakfast menu.  The staff were very friendly, attentive and efficient.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471999393~“It's all about the staff”~Although Teddy is only 2 months old & has limited experience with these things, he thoroughly enjoyed his stay. He loved Pascale's for its Uber hip vibe & nuanced menu (*Teddy doesn't sound inexperienced*) & he indulged himself with all night in room viewing of new release films (most coinciding with his own release date February 2017). See pic. He loved the mini bar & snaffled several of the toys for when he's a bit more grown up (pick up sticks, pack of cards & a small vodka). Unfortunately Teddy was turfed out of the Roof Top bar coz he was being cute ... probs a tad under aged too; this is when the staff showed their excellence, politely guiding Teddy off-premises with good grace #nobabypolicy #fairenough Teddy's giving QT Melbourne a huge rating & one day when he's older he's gonna get in touch with that woman in the lift who wanted his number. Limited experience? Teddy's night out was a *great experience* & that says it all peeps.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471323326~“Boutique industrial done right!”~Amazing rooms make you want to stay in! The rainfall shower head, mini bar options and movies on demand make this hotel perfect for a business trip or weekend away. Loved the rooftop bar and dining options at the hotel. Reception staff were welcoming and quick to get me all the info I needed including signing me up for the loyalty card which provided me with discounts at the hotel restaurants. The ONLY downfall was my room was located just across from the elevators (which talk and play music every time they open.) Aside from that, you can't fault it!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470982794~“Nice and fun experience”~QT is my first choice when I go down to Melbourne for business. I really like the vibes of this hotel and the quality of the service.  What I like: - The restaurant "Pascale". I like to enjoy my first dinner. Have a glass of wine at the bar and then enjoy the good food before going to bed :) Special mention for the service which is extremely good. - The room. Clean and the size is pretty big. - The staff. Friendly and always giving a lot of attention to the customers.  Improvements - Breakfast. I think it would be nice to have a small but good buffet rather than a traditional service for the breakfast.  - The rooftop. I was refused entry to the rooftop 3 times. 2 times because there was a private function and one time because it was full. It's very frustrating to have to go somewhere else to relax and have a drink when you are a hotel guest (and you pay 330$ for a night) and you have such a nice rooftop above your head. It's ok to host a private function but at least keep a section opened for the hotel guests.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_467098988~“Awesomely funky! I'll be back.”~Off the page experience at QT from the greeting at the door through to the room. I stayed in room 806, a corner room with a great outlook. Nothing is same old about QT Melbourne - the decor was funky, right down to the lighting detail, Pascales bar/restaurant has a drinks list that is not driven by sales reps but by someone with excellent taste, even the lift cab will make smart-alec comments to entertain you. A very different hotel with massive appeal.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467090238~“Eclectic and Different”~I stayed in the Sydney QT recently and enjoyed the carefully devised bohemian / eclectic experience, and this led me to stay at QT Melbourne (twice). I enjoyed my both stays very much. The room I had was pretty eccentric for a solo business traveller with a bath the prime feature but I enjoyed contemplating the use others might put the room design to. The staff are excellent, check in check out. The bar is excellent, perhaps not for reading business papers, with quite loud Indie Rock.But it's an Indie Rock sort of place. RAC club it is not - thank heavens. QT makes me feel young. RAC makes me feel old.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_467069584~“Good Vibe & Location Location”~Quick visit to Melbourne last week & pleased to see QT option now available in Melb. Have stayed several times at Sydney venue. The central location is as good as it gets to all CBD attractions as well as major tram stop 50m away. The interior probably not as "edgy" as Sydney but quality furnishings & super comfy bed. We had breakfast in hotel & it was excellent both mornings. Rooftop bar has big rep but we didn't get to try out as got home too late both nights. Staff at check in friendly & professional. Mixed crowd checking in / out so think it would have wide appeal~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_466939984~“Cool Hotel with great rooftop”~This is a really nice hotel, it's cool, it has some nice rooms, great pillows, a happening rooftop bar, some good food, great coffee in the lobby bar, and nice staff.  The only downside to this is that it feels like the staff is cheap at times. Drinks are on the small side if you borrow a converter you have to sign it in and out, if you take an umbrella on your walk you have to sign it in and out. At a nice place like this, they should A) make a decent sized drink and B) trust you to deliver the stuff back that you borrow. After all, this isn't a backpacker hostel and I am not a 20-year old on a year-long drinking trip looking to get out of Melbourne with a suitcase of free Umbrellas.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_466625418~“Fabulous new favourite ”~Superb hotel full of surprises and fun design features. It has a real W hotel vibe with quirky little touches everywhere. The beds are plush, soft and luxurious. The shower was heavenly. The bathroom products, delicious. Everything is so comfortable and looks amazing. It doesn't get much better then a signature QT g&t on the rooftop bar at the end of the day. Staff are efficient and friendly but not in your face. The talking lift is a cute touch; try stealing a kiss in the lift and see what reaction you get! Great hotel in a great location. You can't ask for more.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466410402~“Great rooms, great location, great venue ”~First stay for me, loved it. Will definitely be back. The rooms have an upmarket industrial feel, while the restaurant and the rooftop bar are a welcome retreat to the beginning or end of your day. QT Sydney is next on my list.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465131230~“Great location, Great Decor, Great Staff”~So if you are into old buildings that are fitted out in a retro industrial feel, then QT is a place to visit. Greeted by the lovely porter upon arrival my bags are taken to reception where you are met by warm friendly staff. The rooms are spacious and if you upgrade to the Executive King then you have even more space and a free standing bath. The bright carpets in the corridors lead to a room with a concrete ceiling and light fittings strategically placed. The wooden floors compliment the harsh appeal of the concrete and the compartmentalised bathroom is always a winner.  On my initial 2 visits I was greeted with a complimentary desert dish, but sadly on the 3rd visit there was no such gift. The roof top bar is a place to go, but be early as the outdoor area fills quickly on those warm summer nights. If you are a business professional that wishes to continue working in your room, after an already long day, QT may not be your place. The power points are in awkward locations and in the standard room there really is no place to set-up.  This is a place to visit as the location is the best and the staff is always ready to help~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464968841~“Can't wait to return here again for a cheeky city break”~Booked a date night package for dinner and room at QT Melbourne and can't wait to come back. Had a little trouble getting in to our room with the key card but one we finally got in we were in heaven. Smart, contemporary rooms, beautiful black bathroom fitout (I want these fittings in my House), quiet rooms, excellent quirky customer service, and in the restaurant I had the best steak I think I've eaten in my entire life! Will definitely be staying here again and recommend it to all my family and friends. Thank you QT!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464607323~“Feel like a rock star!”~This ultra modern and chic hotel is most certainly one of the best hotels I have stayed in (and I have stayed in a lot). Every detail has been considered and is delivered in a stylish way that make you feel like every moment is part of an experience. Our room was wonderful - funky and cool yet so cosy. The roof top bar was amazing - a great vibe in a setting that made you feel like you had transported to New York or LA. Every staff member we dealt with made our stay that extra special - they are the heart of this wonderful place. A big thanks to the crew at the front desk who sent us a lovely bottle of prosecco to mark a special celebration in our life. We felt like rock stars as soon as the big front door to the hotel was opened for us by a smiling, witty and attentive staff member until the moment we left. Totally LOVE this place!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

We had an absolutely magical experience! We were warmly welcomed as soon as we got out of our Uber and the reception area was gorgeous! Our room was absolutely delightful - spotless, cosy and full of every amenity we could dream of. We were also surprised by a bottle of prosecco from the hotel to celebrate. We visited the rooftop bar, which was excellent and visited the in-house restaurant for breakfast in the morning, which had a very boutique menu. I cannot fault our stay at Qt Melbourne. While it is a bit on the expensive side, it is worth it for the luxury you are treated to during your stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_463936385~“Trendy but welcoming”~Loved my time here. It's in a fantastic location and the service was impeccable. The design is second to none and despite being contemporary has a welcoming feel to it. The bars are busy of a weekend evening with overpriced drinks, but you're paying for very good service and the location. The food is similar, in that it's costly, but very tasty!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463927987~“Stunning new hotel”~Absolutely loved this hotel. Great location in the city. The staff were friendly and so helpful. They sent an email night before checkin and I requested if I could get an early checkin. Got a text next morning saying room was ready at 11.30am. This hotel is part of the PGR franchise, but I wouldn't say it is of any benefit. With other hotels in this reward program, you receive 2 complimentary drinks on arrival. Up to 20% off dining, that's lunch and dinner not breakfast. And you have to purchase food if you want the discount off drinks. That aside, couldn't fault the hotel. Rooms were immaculate. Great bed and toiletries supplied were lovely. As I said staff were helpful. The lady concierge was helping us find our uber driver by crossing the road to make sure he hadn't parked on the other side of the street. Restaurant and coffe shop were amazing. Make sure you check out roof top bar. What an atmosphere. Only thing there was every time we went out we couldn't get seating as most of the spots were reserved. Very frustrating. Got a seat in the end, only to be told they were closing the area in 10 minutes.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463577425~“Nice location, boutique appearance”~We stayed here in September, a few weeks after they opened. Good location, just one block away from the main drag on Swanston St. Cool rooms - the attached bathroom has a sliding opaque wall that can be opened to give the rooms a more spacious feel. They were still getting some of the bugs fixed when we were there – check-in/checkout was a problem and the beds were on wheels, which meant that they easily slid on the hardwood floors – we were informed these were going to be corrected. The hotel gym was adequate for anybody wanting to do some cardio, otherwise underwhelming for anybody wanting to do anything else. Fortunately, there were a number of gyms nearby. The lifts have some sort of sensor present such that you are greeted when entering and acknowledged when leaving. Upbeat door attendants greeting everybody entering and leaving the hotel – I thought it was the same person doing this all day long until I realized that they were simply wearing the same type of black wig to look alike. Rooms are bit on the pricey side which fall outside of my employers reimbursement, so I will only stay here if they are discounted.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_463405857~“My new Melbourne fave”~We stayed here for a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great location, close to everything from shops, restaurants, transport. Good amenities with a really comfortable bed! Even though it's in the city we heard no noise from the street or bars. Highly recommend checking out the rooftop bar and the restaurant. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463374467~“Great Hotel ”~This is so worth a visit, great rooms, great service and food is amazing. Wonderful reception you feel so amazing. From the door man to the staff in all area's. this is one of the best hotels I have been into in Melbourne~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463356704~“out of the ordinary”~This hotel is different from the rest, very cool and sophisticated.The roof top bar is amazing as is the restaurant and bar at ground level. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to another visit.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463123090~“It will make you wish you could stay longer”~The stay is an experience in its own right, not just a little bit of luxury, it has everything you can wish for, Nespresso coffee machines in the room, Bose entertainment system, umbrellas for those wet rainy days, comfy bathrobes, great rooftop bar, super friendly service, delicious breakfast that will take you away from the beaten tracks... and located in the heart of Melbourne which means travel on trams in the city center is free (no Metcard required, very handy). A hotel room with a soul and an attention to details that will make you wish you could stay longer...~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_463053009~“Sensational Place to Stay”~QT staff, location and amenity were fantastic. While slightly on the high end in price, it was certainly worth it - beautiful king room and exceptionally clean. Happy to exclusively return to QT Mel on our next trip.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462785492~“Strike a pose”~This place is a wonderland of backdrops for selfies! Love this hotel and other QT's I've stayed in. Awesome, industrial, sleek and comfortable. Rooms have all you need. Good coffee downstairs at the lounge and an awesome dinner in the restaurant. I can't fault the QT.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461841703~“Great place!”~Loved this place! Really stylish, good value for money, great restaurants and bars available on site, umbrellas to use, very cosy and comfy bed, and complimentary movies were such a bonus! Would recommend and stay again :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461444585~“Amazing hotel, beautiful rooms”~The rooms were great, the concierge and the reception is top notch. Rooftop bar is the place to be. The location is amazing, it's in the middle of CBD. The interiors and the furniture are top notch. Definitely must stay here!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461056251~“Fabulous staff”~I would have awarded 5 stars except that the room we stayed in on our first night was noisy. Because on that side a pub with a rooftop garden pumped until around 2am. Next morning the reception staff couldn't have been more accomodating and concerned. They relocated us to a room on the quiet side and sent pastries to ease our move. And then when I realised I had left a shirt in our old room, they found and returned it! The staff in the bars, restaurants, and at the kerbside were unfailingly genuine. We ate breakfast and dinners in the hotel and found the food excellent and well priced. My only quibble is the music volume in bars and restaurant made conversation difficult. But all in all a great stay and we will be back.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460820993~“Weekend away”~Was looking to surprise my wife with a weekend getaway for her birthday and had heard about the new QT opening in Melbourne. The location of the hotel is fantastic (near all the great restaurants on Flinders Lane and easy walk to Bourke Street Mall and Melbourne Central) and the rooms were brilliantly fitted out. Easily one of the best and most imaginative mini-bars around The rooftop bar was excellent as well but the best part of the hotel is unquestionably the staff. Always friendly and willing to help. We'll definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460784718~“Best place to stay in Melbourne CBD”~QT is my constant go to hotel for both business and leisure. I travel frequently for work so this hotel is a warm, inviting and exciting home away from home. Impeccable service & very friendly staff! Everywhere you look you find a source of inspiration. The comfort level of the rooms is very good. The rooftop bar a great spot to go and work in after a long day or relax with friends.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460525876~“Excellent service, great product”~Before my arrival the service was already being outstanding. All the support prior to check in, making sure I would have a warm welcome was more than I could ask for. The rooms are big and full of light and the trendy restaurant and roof top give you the opportunity to enjoy the little free time after a day of work and meetings.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460525782~“Excellent experience”~Loved everything about our stay. The staff, amazingly comfortable bed, big room, great amenities, delicious breakfast - will definitely be back. The location was really handy (we were there for the tennis) - so easy to walk to the grounds and close to great shopping as well.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460406871~“QT quite the Cutie”~This hotel has become my new go to spot in Melbourne. Good location. Cool and contemporary. Rooftop bar is awesome. Staff are really welcoming. I like the little brekky bar/cafe where you can just grab a toastie/pastry and coffee on the run. The gym is an after thought but who needs it after a great night in the rooftop bar!~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_458787700~“Focus on design”~Interesting design focus - small rooms show how good design can maximise space efficiency. More focussed though on beauty than real service - really difficult to get a taxi quickly, far easier to just get Uber. My main beef which doesn't have to be a deal breaker is the size of the desk, I was in town for business and the desk size is not really suited for a laptop and papers.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_458624050~“Lots of positive but a little bit too much no so great!”~I am currently writing this review in my QT room. This is my first time staying at the QT in Melborne, although I have stayed a number of times at the QT in Sydney. Let's start with the positive; booking and check in is a breeze and the hotel is glorious in architecture and design. Quirky fun and super Objet de curiosité!!!! Delightful. Great location and a perfect place to meet with friends. The rooms are lovely and I am staying in the entry level. Smart room design, you can open the bathroom right up with a sliding door and the rain shower is the bomb. I even washed my mop of a hair with the products provided and I am going to see if they sell them as they worked wonders.  The bed is soft but not too soft, Goldielocks would approve. Free internet, free movies and a coffee machine in every room... so nice to be able to kick start your day with a shot of coffee.  The staff are all fabulous in their dress and nature. Roof top bar is really popular with guests and the locals are definitely enjoying this newish hot spot. It is easy to get up there with your magic room key. I enjoyed the bar Pascale on level one as it was a bit quieter, they have a nicely curated wine list and the bar staff know their way around a cocktail.  So lets get to the bad..... I am currently listening to the music and people talking in the bar next door, it is BAD. I cannot believe that they did not warm me that the room would be this noisy. It is so loud I can hear it with the TV on. They also do not put ear plugs in the room (the Alex Hotel in Perth admitted their rooms were subject to the Northbridge noise and ear plugs were in each room - the Alex is now in the process of putting double glazing in all their rooms). I did ring for ear plugs which they happy provided but they were the hard square ones that are not at all comfortable. On another note I can actually hear and feel doors slamming and people moving around up stairs... not sure what den be done about this. My bar fridge is not working and reception was advised last night that it was not working, I had to remind them tonight ... there seemed to be no records of this. Again they were super lovely and said they would replace the fridge or move me. I would have gone with the move but way too tired but no the music is really bugging me... so should have said yes.  For room service tonight I ordered the minute rib eye ($38) and I am still hungry. It was nice, but not great.  So in summary, great boutique hotel but I am disappointed with my overall experience and not sure I would stay again however I defiantly would return to the Pascale and roof top bar.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_458604169~“Cool hotel in CBD Melbourne ”~Quite a nice hotel centrally located in Melbourne with nice and hip rooms which were quite big in size, the rooftop bar was quite hep, very central for shopping and dining the staff was very helpful specially the hostesses welcoming the guests in the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The only disadvantage is that they do not serve breakfast buffet~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457727943~“fun and trendy hotel in great central location”~we loved our stay here, excellent hotel perfect for a family with teenagers, close to good shopping, the museums and the best restaurants... staff were lovely and concierge Charlotte was so helpful on what to do and see, and scored us great restaurant reservations... there's also a very stylish and popular roof bar. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, we were in room 521 and found it a bit noisy at night, might be worth checking which rooms are quieter...~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457426294~“A great place to stay”~The hotel is centrally located... great for shopping, dining and exhibitions. The staff were very friendly and helpful- and looked great. The rooms are well appointed and a bit quirky.... which helped make it feel way better than the usual hotel experience.. we are regular stayers at the Sydney qt, which we love. Melbourne is a little different from the retro feel of Sydney but it didn't disappoint.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_457182623~“Melbourne style!”~Excellent hotel with a super super comfortable bed!! Stayed their for our anniversary and it was a great change from the normal Hilton/Hyatt style hotel. Highly recommend, a little pricey but definitely with it!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457007967~“Funky”~How cool is this place ? Greeted at the door by a quirky young lady and shown into the hotel which has a great vibe and creative decor . The roof top bar is a scene that sees the City office Workers flock to for a cocktail after work. It is the little value add items that really impressed me . - in house movies are free  - a little dessert sent to the room and a note congratulating us on our anniversary  - my wife was admiring a vase of red Roses in the breakfast area and a waiter took one out and gave it to her , made her feel a bit special . This is a breath of fresh air for the top end of town . Will we be back ? Hell yes we have even extended our stay for a further night .~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456784991~“QT Melbourne delivers personal experience”~My stay at QT Melbourne was fantastic - the accommodation was luxurious and well appointed. The staff at the hotel were only too willing to help in any way and made my friends and I feel very welcome! I highly recommend this hotel if you want an central location, top quality accommodation and entertainment.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456570318~“Hip Hotel in the Heart of Melbourne”~We stayed in an Executive Room on Level 8. The rooms are spacious with everything you could need for a short stay. Although we didn't eat at the QT we did pop up to the roof top bar for a drink. Great surroundings and very popular. Staff are so friendly and accommodating - we arrived early and our room was ready which is always nice. Will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_456517794~“Suberbly stylish and modern”~Only staying overnight, arrived very hot Melbourne day, awesome greeting by a stunning looking female with outgoing personality, interested in why your were there, great first impressions. Went upstairs to frequent a drink in the roof top bar. Magnificent setting, not enough umbrellas for shade though, but lovely seating and ambience awesome service excellent right throughout the Hotel, couldn't fault it.. Rooms large, comfy and definitely quirky and colourful. Loved the furnishings, bright yet tastefully decorated. My only disappointment was breakfast, menu fantastic for modern palates, yet we just wanted good ole Bacon and Eggs, and a hash brown, so we went elsewhere for that.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456482599~“QT rooftop bar and hotel”~I went to the QT rooftop bar, it's really nice, great atmosphere not over crowded, clean and very polite staff too. The hotel rooms are great too, kind of an Art Deco style with furnishings to match. Would definitely come again. Great location and central to everything.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_455574897~“Gorgeous hotel and great location”~The QT Melbourne lives up to the standard of the other QT's around Australia - beautiful designer interiors and amazing food. The hotel only opened a few months ago so everything was still in pristine condition. The room was well appointed, loved the furniture and attention to detail of the soft furnishings. No bath but the rainforest shower head had great water pressure. The mini bar was also well stocked.  The location of the hotel is also fantastic - short walk to Flinders Lane with all the amazing restaurants and a short walk to the main shopping precinct. The other highlight was the food - breakfast on level 1 was delicious. Not the usual buffet but the al carte options were plentiful and big servings. QT rooftop bar was also lovely, but service a bit hit and miss.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455281840~“Quirky and Different”~This is alright if you yourself are quirky and different!! I found it a little bit fish out of water. With outside views from the toilet, to a bigger minibar than the local 711 I wasn't quite sure what to make of this place? I do not like wooden floors in a hotel, and sure enough the rooms echoed. The rooftop party is loud enough to be heard from many rooms and it goes late. In saying all that I slept well, did not eat here, and survived my stay. Will I be booking in here again, I would say this Hotel is not for me.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454383315~“Stylish and quirky - a perfect stay”~Stylish place for a week-long visit to Melbourne. Hard to beat for an urban stay.  - superb location - large and comfy rooms - stylish decor throughout including lifts with their own personalities - speedy, good quality a la carte breakfast - small rooftop bar popular with locals. Great if you like a drink and a mingle. If you don't party anymore (like us) it's easy to give it the skip - small, modern gym that we used daily.  Staff were fantastic. We had a minor adjustment to our check in, which they were happy to make even though the hotel was busy when we visited.  Thank you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454173267~“Wonderful staff, outstanding service, extremely modern hotel and tasteful decor.”~We found every staff member to be extremely friendly and helpful but have to make special mention of two people. Jake who is the concierge/door person was always very helpful suggesting places for us to dine at and places to enjoy some nice cocktails. Unfortunately, we witnessed the aftermath of Bourke Street tragedy,it was awful seeing people all over the footpath receiving help from the police and emergency services everywhere. Upon arriving back at the hotel Jake saw us and came straight over to us to see what we had been up to. We told him what we had seen as we were right there and that it was a dreadful sight. We went up to our room and a few minutes later there was a knock upon our door. It was Jake, he had a tray with a lovely pot of tea and two teacups for us.  He said he hoped we would feel a bit better after a nice cup of tea!!! What a really lovely gesture and I am sure if we had we stayed at another hotel there would not have been this very kind and thoughtful act. Also another lovely young girl Neicha who is also at the entrance was always very bright, bubbly and friendly, and attended to all our questions and offered dining and city advice. You really couldn't fault any staff for their friendliness, attention to detail, and cooperative nature at every time we spoke to anyone. Did we mention the food was awesome !! , yes it was and the roof top bar had a great atmosphere. Again, we just wanted to highlight how wonderful all the staff were but especially the outstanding service from Jake and the hotel is extremely modern and has great facilities and a tasteful decor. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and have every intention of staying here again~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_454170832~“Funky, vampy”~What an interesting place! I think it was a bit too edgy for my parents, and it is certainly a scene on a weekend night (line through the lobby for non-guests to get up to the hotel bar, loud DJ in the restaurant, lots of young people who looked like they were on bachelorette weekends taking lots of pouty mouthed selfies, etc).  It is definitely trying to push boundaries and be quite sexy (open shower to the rest of the room/bathroom, Dominatrix-y outfits for staff, etc) so if that's your vibe, you'll love it!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453869243~“Funky hotel”~Excellent Deco. Wonderful staff. Central location. We had a wonderful time at the QT - staff was friendly and the room was in a very clean condition. Deco was modern and unique. It was centrally located so if we wanted to we could have walked to most of the nearby attractions. Probably more suitable for couples than young families.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_453817318~“Not bad”~Stayed 2 nights for business. Good: Friendly and helpful staff, smile all the times. Room is new and clean, very bright enough. Rooftop bar is the best! Free movies. Good location, only 5 mins walk to Chinatown, 10mins walk to the main shopping area in town. Bad: Very noisy at mid-night. People are yelling downstairs, hear all the trucks and cars etc. No slippers and toothbrush etc., please bring own. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453505268~“Exemplary Service ”~In Melbourne with a friend for the Australian Open and this is my first visit to QT Melbourne. It won't be my last, I love the QT concept. It does pay to be a member of the Priority Guest Rewards. At our arrival we were met with a happy smiling Jake and all staff members went above and beyond to make our stay exceptional. Pascals was delicious and I can highly recommend the crushed pretzel King George Whiting... If I have one criticism it is the very small or heavily iced cocktails at the rooftop bar but the views and ambiance probably outweigh this....~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453263158~“Just a little quirky, just a lot of fun”~It started with the smiling concierge who greeted us and arranged for our car to be parked, and it just carried on in the same vein.  Check in was smooth and professional - did I mention friendly - but not yucky friendly. The decor of the hotel and room was impressive, I am not a fan of box hotels, and this was no where in that league. Loved it, loved the decor, I said to my husband - if I had seen that sheer curtain in the shop - I would have said ugh, but it SO worked, bringing out the other golds in the room. Did I mention the bed was LUXURIOUS. I could go on - just loved it. I had heard it is expensive, but we were happy to pay the $260 a night. BUT THEN it turned into a BARGAIN. being January, they had free valet parking - $50 value, plus free alecarte breakfast . $60 value, PLUS they were happy for us to leave our car there for the matinee performance of Kinky Boots the next day -$60 value~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453159132~“Melbourne to a QT”~Having stayed at QT Gold Coast I was curious to see what the Melbourne version would dish up. I wasn't disappointed. What a clever brand this is, they have managed to maintain their trademark quirkiness but with a true Melbourne vibe. Industrial chic is on display in this former cinema complex, staff are in Melbourne's signature black and white but in stripes and berets unusual shirts, funky but still stylish.  The room design is truly clever as the rooms are not huge but feel spacious. The sliding opaque glass panels around the bathroom mean that you can open up to the rest of the room, or not, as you please. Concrete ceilings and walls are softened by warm timber floors and leather chairs. The funky is still on display with a white rabbit in the shower and a mini bar that glows neon blue. From a practical point of view I really liked the design of the table and mini couch. So often if you want to eat in room you find yourself balancing a tray on the bed. Here the TV swings around so that you can comfortably sit and eat at a proper table.  They get a big tick from me for the following; good quality shampoo etc. free movies including the latest releases, free wi-fi. This is a five star hotel that has recognised that once their guests have paid five star prices they don't want to continue to be gouged. Personally I hate staying at five star prices and then getting stung 20 dollars for a movie.  The staff are upbeat, cheerful and helpful, predominantly young they are enthusiastic and just fun. Don't stay here if you want old school stuffiness.  Location wise the hotel is perfect for anything in the cbd and is of course close to the tram for anything peripheral to the cbd. Food options abound in all directions and the shops are on the doorstep.  This is my hometown and I am so pleased to see our city captured in this way in this hotel.  The one 'off' note was breakfast. This was included in my package as was valet parking, if it hadn't been I probably wouldn't have eaten in the hotel and that may be a clue to why it is set up this way in this QT. Maybe the Rydges group are not expecting people to eat in the hotel. Unlike the amazing buffet I experienced at QT GC this is an order off the menu breakfast. No buffet not even for juice and cereal. The first morning I was early and the service was efficient and a freshly cooked breakfast a nice novelty. The second morning the restaurant was completely overwhelmed, service was at a snails pace, the staff putting in every effort but sinking badly. Yes Melbourne is wall to wall restaurants but an imaginative and delicious buffet breakfast at a five star hotel is part of the experience.  The rooftop bar is great and a more sedate option is available on the first floor.  In all this hotel will become my 'go to' hotel in my home city and I might just have to seek out some other QTs around the country.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
