review_478088089~“Great rooms ”~Great size rooms, pin board with so much information for visitors. Very comfy beds. Only small issue shower over bath difficult to get in and out. Minibar and snacks very well stocked. Coffee machine an added bonus.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477746816~“Some things never change”~I reported about the Larwill over a year ago and again stayed there for two nights. the hotel is nice enough and probably good for parents of children who are admitted to the hospital next door. Otherwise it does not really have a good location in Melbourne as everything is far away. For me it was convenient as our business meeting was close by. Reading through all the positive and negative feedback on Tripadvisor about the hotel, i am somewhat shocked that the manager responds to some customers who gave a poor rating in a very defensive manner. Not a good attitude. What disturbs me, is that the hotel takes no learnings from negative feedback. It is a nice place, something what one can expect given the very high prices that are the same as hotels in much better locations, but the staff, especially in the (breakfast0 room is as grumpy as last year, despite the high room prices, the bottle of 500 ml water on the night table still costs 4 $, and the mini bar is expensive with 1 beer for 9 $.  A restaurant in this category offers free bottles of water, 1 or two a night. Nicely, the rooms have coffee machines that work with pods. But then again, Larwill has the audacity to charge you 1 $ for 1 pod !! This is a new one for me, as even in cheap motels I have had a free bottle of water and 2 free pods per day for coffee. Bad stingy, cringy aftertaste, Larwill. keep curtains closed all day as people from offices 30 metres away gaze in your room. Summarizing: nice place, but far overpriced for its -in the middle of nowhere- location, and poor customer courtesy, ripping them off for standard amenities that are even in the cheapest hotels just part of regular service.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_476666815~“Great views - SO comfy! ”~A really modern hotel. Friendly staff. Bright and vibrant spaces. Beautifully appointed rooms. We were in room 418 which has a stunning outlook over the park and the city on the immediate horizon. It was a bit surreal being connected to the children's hospital but don't let this deter you as this is an amazing location and a hotel of such a high standard! If you know someone using the hospital then it would be ideally located. On the Easter weekend $20 from our nightly stay was donated to the hospital which I rate hugely! We're guests from Sydney and have never stayed on this side of the city before. It is so leafy, well connected to transport and hip little coffee places. Oh and the beds are devine! So comfortable!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476372031~“WONDERFUL BEDS”~Stayed for two nights, beds were so comfortable great location for visiting at the Royal Childrens Hospital. Rooms were very clean. Would definately stay again. Paid $25 a night for parking the only thing is a bit tricky getting parking card back to reception involves coming out of parking driving back into hotels driveway running card into reception not too bad if you have two of you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475946634~“Great customer service ”~Despite a very noisy pipe in the room above that kept me awake all night & the poor response on checkout - I still live staying here.  The night before I was stuck for dinner & both lovely ladies on reception were super helpful & informative, assisted with Uber eats & I had the beautiful corner room, fantastic views of the city & overlooking the park. I love the little touches at the Larwill Studios including the yoga mats in every cupboard, the funky art filled interior, quiet spaces, careful selection of reading material. My only feedback would be healthy menu options. I get so tired of junk food as snacks with palm oil, yet it's everywhere & there are so many other options including organic wine. The checkout guy the next morning questioned the noisy pipe & really I thought that was a bit rude. Kept me awake all night every time someone above turned on a tap!  This is awesome value for money & have stayed several times. Location great, awesome views, quirky & comfy, parking underneath, generous size rooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475760696~“Amazing Hotel ”~I stay here quite regularly for work - but would happily stay for pleasure too. Hotel is gorgeous, clean, comfy beds, quiet , amazingly helpful friendly staff. Highly recommend. Restaurant downstairs is nice but service can be a bit slow if you are dining in - however they do offer room service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475473864~“Another great experience in Melbourne”~I have stayed at the Larwill Studio in Parkville a short tram ride away from the CBD of Melbourne and other attractions. The staff never disappoint! Rooms are large and clean. Bikes and small cars are available for rent. A large park is nearby as is a free gym. This is my four visit and it is safe to say that the Larwill Studio is my home in Melbourne!!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475384769~“A designer's dream hotel”~The room that I booked was a corner workspace room. The almost "room to ceiling" windows which overloked the Royal Park offered a wonderful view. The design of the room was truly refreshing. Art books and non-conventional magazines provide inspiration. The dimmer allow you to have lighting appropriate for your specific task at the moment. Design details like the pin board, triangular bookshelf, clean bathroom lines, and the quirky messages, put a smile on my face. The king-size bed, fluffy pillows, and the fact that the building is beside a park, made for a truly peaceful sleep. The staff is young and were cheerful, attentive, and was always ready to help. On the down side, I took issue with the bathtub as it did not have a slip proof removable mat or surface. it can get real slick after a shower and I was always nervous stepping off of it. I was told by my guide that the hotel used to be the old children's hospital. While that idea may be scary to some, the modern design of the place makes it difficult to feel creepy at all. The Larwill is also connected to the new children's hospital and as such, expect to frequently see ill children in and around the park. It can either be depressing or, truly inspiring to see how these kids take on life with hope with the devotion of their families.  Overall, it was a wonderful experience for me.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475186326~“It's everything they say and more...”~The whole process from booking till check out is smooth. Double thumbs up!! The room is very thoughtfully done. Little touches like shampoo and soap labeling has made our stay a little bit more enchanting.  One little niggle I have is the location of the bedside power point. It's located right where one would place ones head when sleeping. Other than that, its all very good.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475071977~“Beautiful park view & lovely receptionist but...”~The hotel is a little out of the way, but next to a beautiful park. Our room had great views. It was more than a little annoying that most of the extras on the room incurred a charge. More a motel than a hotel. Sorry to say!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474610121~“Always great”~We love staying here as our daughter has leukaemia and it is so convenient for us ontheatre days as we live 2 hours away, we can get up and walk straight into the hospital.

review_474514168~“We Will Be Back”~A beautiful place to stay in Melbourne. Thoughtful attention to detail, (the only hotel I have even stayed in that had a yoga mat in the room), gorgeous views, a beautiful, soaring foyer and just all around an absolute delight.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474434037~“Gorgeous hotel, great location, lovely staff.”~We chose this hotel as it was close to the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. But it is also a handy location for access to the CBD too - tram stop right at front door, walking distance to Victoria Markets, zoo, and parklands. Clean, quiet, lots of convenience shops and eating places under the same roof. Staff efficient and friendly. Interesting decor. Great facilities, including coffee-maker.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474385794~“Hidden Gem in Parkville”~Located right next to the new Royal Children's hospital in Flemington, the larwill studio offers modern comfortable accommodation for couples. If you aren't familiar with Melbourne, it could be hard to locate (Signage directly facing traffic coming from the city would be good). You must allow $25 per day for underground parking, which was great when it's pouring rain outside! Otherwise you'll be up for a walk for cheaper off street parking. No swimming pool, but a well equipped gym down stairs. Comfy beds. Good range of tv channels to choose from. Watch mini bar prices! $4 for a bottle of water! Location is great, 10 minutes drive to Lygon street restaurants and 15 minutes to Smith street factory outlets. Definitely worth a visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473753602~“wonderfully set up for young families”~iI your taking the kids to the zoo, then this is the ideal location. very well located and easy to get to. I traveled here with my 2 young children from Country Vic. on Public Transport and it was a breeze. The twin park view room we had was as comfortable as always with the Art Series Hotels and only comment i can make is if the twins were set up similar to The Blackman with the Bathroom smaller and set in the middle of the room, dividing the sleeping areas then I couldn't fault it. With a wonderful park area right behind the hotel, it's great to kick a footy, roll down the hill or play on the rope playground. Will definitely be a repeat customer~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473748309~“The park view room was simply superb”~The park view room was simply superb. Beautiful outlook and a lovely large room with everything you could need. The staff were also great and really helpful with suggestions for great places to go in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473011670~“Larwill excellence”~I arrived in Melbourne after a good flight but late. Easy taxi from the airport to this great hotel. Friendly staff even after midnight, clean room, comfy bed, had breakfast down stairs and the food and coffee were excellent.  Great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472876443~“Fantastic stay”~When booking mentioned the stay was to celebrate after a baby shower. Once in our room we were greeted with sparkling water and a fruit platter. Beds were very comfy. 11am check out. We pulled up and received our parking pass (additional cost) which was easy to use. Our room had two beds and was very comfortable for two people. Shower over bath but that wasn't a concern for us. Would recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472034888~“Fantastic”~Easy to find and locate. Beautiful room and great view. Stylish and comfortable with a delicious cafe attached. Booking was simple and so was checking in and out.

review_471268083~“Really Cool Art Series Hotel!”~We found this cool and reasonably priced hotel in the Parkville area of Melbourne. It was very clean and modern and appealing. The bed was SO comfortable. The people there were very friendly. You do have to pay extra for parking and it is right next the children's hospital. There is a nice park next door. It's also a short walk to neat neighborhood with a number of restaurants and cafes. The receptionist recommended an Italian restaurant just a 10 minute walk away that was great. Although originally we wanted to be closer to the airport, it was an easy drive there in the morning and we were able to really experience Melbourne for one more night. Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470993104~“Nice addition to the Art Series hotels ”~The room was fabulous, great views. Large bathroom  Extensive mini bar selection.  One problem though. No meals after 9pm. Kitchen closed.  No late night room service  As a frequent patron of the Cullen (Art Series in Prahan) this came as a complete shock having returned at 9.15 pm from the office.  The staff were efficient and friendly and the little hiccup with food (I consumed a number of items from the mini bar) probably won't stop me from staying there again.  It would be nice though, if the hotel management decided to provide a limited 24 hr room service as this would be so much more convenient. Even a cheese plate (or cereal, wouldn't be the first time I had cereal for dinner )  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470983705~“I'll keep coming back”~Stayed twice within a week during March. Continues to shine in terms of staff, cleanliness and a comfortable sleep. Parking can often be found in the street, and the 55 and 59 trams were once again very useful to access the CBD (just remember to have a MYKI). This time I discovered the low cost food options in the building that connects the hotel and RCH. Smith and Stanley were outstanding in terms of food quality and service. we had a group of 13 and they couldn't be more helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_470889008~“Great location and a room, but few things lacking”~The good: Great location (walking distance to the university hospitals and institutes, extensive park system, children playgrounds etc).  Quiet and clean rooms with comfortable beds. Access to a small but very well equipped gym (bring a hotel towel, not provided at the gym). The bad: No common areas to use, no comfortable areas to lunge outside the room. One restaurant - decent food with locally sourced ingredients, but on a heavy side; not open early and no other options for early breakfast (e.g., prior to leaving for the airport).  No cafe on premises. The ugly: The advertised and reserved price applies only if paying cash! If paying by a card -there is a fee (1.5% for Visa, I believe). And the last point -which, in the big picture I realize is small, but very annoying... There is a cheap, pod-based coffee machine in the room - in the range of those free coffee options provided in essentially every typical hotel room. However, when checking out, I was charged $2 per coffee pod used! There was no indication in the room that the coffee was not free (water bottle and the snacks were labeled though..). Had i known, I would have gone to one of many nice cafes in the area, rather than paying for a bland tasting room coffee...~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~3~nan

review_469927932~“Excellent”~Cost was a little high but room was nice. I did not like that I had to pay $1 for a coffee pod lol  Check in was great & parking easy. I think everyone that stays would be happy with the quality & service~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469466234~“Larwill Studio”~Lovely spacious room and bathroom. The room was spotless. The bed very comfy. Friendly helpful staff. The artwork inspired decor is great.  Location is extremely convenient if you are accessing the Royal Children's hospital.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469385744~“Solid place to stay”~This is one of the places in Melbourne that I can be a little hit and miss with, I like the hotel but don't love the hotel but depending on where the pricing is on a given visit would determine if it was worth it. When the hotel is cheaper it is a great value stay, the staff are great the rooms are nice - albeit a little overly bright for my personal preference - and the location is fairly convenient with the tram right out the front door. It is a good place to stay for a more quiet and relaxed venue over the CBD locations. When the price is at the higher end it is certainly not worth the cost in my personal opinion and of the art series hotels is my least fave at comparable price points (as in, if I could pick them all at say $200 per night I would pick this last of them all)~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_469322038~“Superb”~Fabulous park views away from the hustle and bustle of the city but only a 15 minute trip in. Tasteful funky modern decor. Best bedding and bathroom.

review_468682136~“Fantastic”~The Larwill never lets me down. It's so quiet and the beds are so comfy. The park next door is fantastic if you want to go for a run, walk or just to sit and chill for awhile. Staff are always friendly.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468141727~“Not for me, surprised by reviews.”~Shared carpark with the hospital, shared facilities with the hospital, hotel in the middle with a children's hospital one side and larger hospital the other and yet no mention of being near the hospital on their website. A getaway that was organised and taken after a difficult time with a close one in a hospital and guess what? we didnt want to stay near another hospital!!! So not for us at this time, we got to our room, our window was facing the hospital windows so didn't stay, got charged for one night anyway which I wasn't happy with and went somewhere else for our stay. Let's be real here, it is a small room (albeit decorated beautifully), it is 10 mins out of town by car and the service is average, at almost $300/night, for the same price you could stay at Crown Towers.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~4~2~nan
review_467670333~“Fabulous place to stay, close to the city”~Situated adjoining the Children's Hospital, with a lovely park on the other side. The park has amazing children's playground areas. Only a few tram stops outside of the free city tram circuit, making for cheap public transport. ( can walk easily to free stop). The bed was amazingly comfortable. Downstairs restaurant fabulous.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467394011~“Lovely view of the city lights”~We stayed one night, it was very peaceful and relaxing. The room was very clean and had everything we needed for a one night stay. The staff were extremely helpful and polite at reception. There are parks and gardens nearby. The Vic Market is a good walk from this motel, but there is always public transport near the door.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_466943632~“Great place to stay”~Has everything we needed in an ideal location. The staff are friendly, knowledgable and helpful and our dinner and breakfast at the restaurant were very good.

review_466715886~“Beautiful view, very quiet ”~Our family of 3 stayed one night mid-week after travelling several hours to attend the RMH just down the road. The room was clean, bright and cheerful, and the bathroom quite large. The two double beds were comfy and allowed us to stay as a family. We were able to walk through the corridor to the RCH Main Street precinct, where a selection of eateries offered takeaway dinner to suit each of us and the supermarket meant we could buy cold drinks etc. Our room overlooked the parkland behind the RCH and it was beautiful, very relaxing after a long, stressful day and being from the country it was a welcome relief from the city rush. We were impressed with the noise reduction, the hotel must have been well planned as even an air ambulance landing on the RCH, visible on the landing pad from our room, was not a loud, awful noise as one would expect. Would definitely stay again, and as regular attendees at both RCH and RMH, I would recommend this hotel as a calm, convenient location for others in the same position.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466697793~“Love this place!”~Definitely recommend for your next stay in Melbourne- great location especially for kids with parks and gardens close by, and only a short walk to zoo! View from the room was awesome and the bed so comfy!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466681003~“Great location!”~We have stayed here a number of times whilst our son has been to the RCH. The location is brilliant. So easy to catch the tram opposite to head into the city for shopping and the surrounding parklands are fabulous. You can even walk to Carlton if you feel like a bit of exercise!! Clean and comfortable (in fact, I think the beds are the most comfortable I've slept on in a hotel). Thoroughly recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465833467~“Appalling!! Terrible family accommodation!!”~We stayed for our third time at The Larwill as our severely disabled daughter has been receiving regular treatment at the Royal Children's Hospital and we gave srayed purely due to the hotel's proximity to the children's hospital. Each time I have found that the hotel has poorly catered for children on account of the inappropriate, uncomfortable and course bedding supplied with my 2yo daughter's cot and the lack of appropriate food choices for children etc. At the end of one stay housekeeping had taken the blanket my younger daughter had eaten and spilled food on and then, after we had checked out, accused me of taking it! This time, I felt the need, on account of this incident, to source my own blanket on which to feed my daughter and had daily had it laundered myself! However, this most recent visit was by far our worst stay and has resulted in our decision to NEVER stay at this hotel again and to endeavour to prevent other families staying here!! As I mentioned above, my daughter is disabled and is purely PEG fed directly into her stomach as she is unable to eat or drink orally. This method of feeding frequently results in the tubing disconnecting from the stomal feeding device; this is completely unavoidable and, as no alarm alerts when this occurs, it often gies undetected for some time, particularly if this occurs at night and neither she nor I awake to detect it. This occurred last night, resulting in my daughter's feed leaking onto the bedding in her cot and the disconnection not being detected until this morning. The cot had been 'made up' with a sheet covering the rock hard portacot mattress. A course, small, orange rug and hand towel were folded next to the cot so I presume were intended to be used to go over the child in the cot. There was no pillow, nothing to soften the hard mattress and a completely unsuitable rug included for use with the cot. In order to make the it remotely comfortable for my almost 3yo disabled daughter, I placed the spare bkanket from the cupboard and one of the pillows from my bed in her cot to keep her as comfortable as possible - after all, the purpose for her trek from remote WA (our home) to Melbourne was medical treatment, so she was not feeling as well as usual!and, given my fear of her feeding pump or feed bag spilling her feed onto the hotel carpet, she was going to have to be in the cot for most, if not all, of her time we spent in the room.  As luck would have it on the day of our check out this morning, we awoke to a formula spill - a reality that I am faced with at home every day or two. I hurriedly cleaned my daughter and bedding up as best I could but couldn't wash anything as we had a plane to catch. By the time we landed in Perth I had 6 missed calls from the Larwill. I suspected I must have left something important in our room. Upon returning their calls though, I was humiliated and furious to hear that the numerous missed phone calls had been made on account of the staff at the Larwill attempting to charge my bank card for the 'damages'. I had been as meticulous as possible in my care and cleanliness of our hotel room, washing our dishes myself, cleaning up any of the mess made by the children etc. Yet here I was being made to feel as though I'd recklessly damaged our room despite the 'damage' being my disabled daughter's feed spilling on her bedding. I felt the need to justify the cause of the mess in an attempt to appeal to the compassionate side of the staff member. The hotel is located in the same complex as the Royal Children's Hospital after all; one would expect young guests to be catered for in such a hotel! The staff member's response was atrocious! Her first comment was that, as they were not part of the hospital, they shouldn't be expected to cater for children, sick or otherwise; the lady's next comment was a suhgestion that I should take bedding from the hospital to use at the Larwill (an impossibility given that my daughter is generally treated during appointments as an outpatient); and her third suggestion was that I, in future, bring my own bedding (in addition to our suitcases, my daughter's medical equipment, carton of feed, wheelchair etc). The end result was that I was to be charged $130 to replace the pillow on which the milk had spilled. Apparently washing the pillow was an impossibility and was a 'hygiene issue! The sheet and blanket that had milk spilled onto them the staff member said they'd take care of (ie wash them as they would normally). I am on a Carer's Pension and this money had been set aside for our taxi fare and dinner tonight. Thanks to the Larwill's inconsiderate and unsympathetic staff I instead paid for a $130 pillow for their hotel. This is absolutely shameful, particularly given that the hotel is located in place where sick children and their families are naturally going to stay. To any families contemplating a stay at the Larwill, my advice is DON'T!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464682560~“Lovely hotel just outside of Melbourne CBD”~The Larwill Studio is a lovely hotel just outside of Melbourne proper. It's an easy 15 minute tram ride into the city. Rooms are spacious and clean and quiet with a fun and modern feeling in keeping with the David Larwill artsy theme. We loved his art and appreciated learning more about him on the short TV feature. Staff was professional and helpful.  A comment to ownership: There seemed to be a price ticket on everything, including $4 for the bottle of water placed next to the bed. Also, when we phoned to say we would arrive at 11:30am, we were told there would be a $30 extra charge to check in before 2pm. Ultimately, we checked in early at no charge. But, this policy is very off putting. If the room is ready, let the guest check in at no charge (as you did) without saying there will be a penalty charge.  A comment to guests - the hotel is about 30 minutes walking from CBD. If you want in-town, this is not for you.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464408204~“City Edge delight”~I arrived late and hungry at The Larwill, but the chef squeezed a late order in and delivered it to my room - AND it was the most delicious chicken/pea salad I've ever had. Along with a lovely Pale Ale from the minibar, it was the perfect end to a busy travelling day. Easy parking, lovely rooms, excellent service at check in. The Larwill wins my vote.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463870446~“Simple sophistication”~Simple sophistication. That says everything.  Great view.  Very friendly staff and very accommodating.  Location is also very central to Melbourne Uni which is what I was looking for. Will definitely return, with the family this time and will be recommending it to others.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463660001~“Artsy and comfortable”~The hotel walls were adorned with vibrant, colorful paintings which made it feel like staying in a gallery. The room we stayed in was well decorated and offered a comfortable bed. The frontdesk staff were helpful and kind. The negative points were that we were assigned a first floor room which may have been right above the restaurant leading to very strong food smells coming from the kitchen in the morning. It wasn't unpleasant smells, but somewhat overwhelming. As for location, this hotel is about a 45 minute walk or 20 minute tram ride to the city center. It is not the most central hotel and is located outside of the free tram zone. If in Melbourne for tourism purposes, it might not be the best location to stay in despite the hotel's great decor and impeccable service.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463341454~“A little gem!”~This welcoming hotel was a beautiful surprise.

review_462814326~“Happily lived up to expectations!”~Although a bit surprised it was part of the Royal Children's Hospital and not actually in a street with cafes and stores, it was delightful and lovely retreat with a SERIOUSLY comfy bed! And it had a huge parkland out the back if you want to wander off for a walk. The Smith & Noble bar/restaurant had a good mix on the menu and very fast room service as well as a nice spot to have breakie too. Although we caught taxis, I wouldn't bother next time as its right on a tram spot taking you straight into the city if you want. All in all, I would definitely stay there again if I didn't want to be in the CBD as it was not where near as noisy as that can be.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462584411~“Good stay at the Larwill”~I stayed at the Larwill from 22 to 27 Feb, and had a parkland view from the 4th floor, which was lovely. Service (online queries) and recep staff (winnie and colleagues) were hospitable, and patient with questions before and during my stay. The studio is connected to the city by tram (lines 55, 59), with tram stations located a short walk from the studio. I also enjoyed the 24-hour gym (within the same complex, about 80m from the lobby) and could get groceries at the nearby small supermarket (50m from the gym).

review_461908644~“first time north of the city - and great”~Great room, light with a view over a park. Great coffee shops and decent restaurants nearby (ask the staff for tips). Shops downstairs. Outside town but close enough to be convenient. Would stay again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461795780~“Fabulous hotel”~Spacious, clean lovely room . We had one overlooking the park with wonderful views. Very good value - artworks everywhere in hotel and welcoming spacious reception. Very good restaurant attached to hotel where we ate or drank on several occasions. Great service.  Hotel staff very informative and helpful. Hotel set in enormous parkland - great for morning or evening walks Fifteen minute walk to free tram zone. Out of town to some extent - a quiet relaxed area - so good to come back to after day in the city.  One of best hotels we've stayed in .~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461601427~“Early check-in fee”~When we enquired about an early check-in (whilst holding an infant), we were advised that there are plenty of rooms free, but there is an additional $30 fee. Where is the customer service? Other than this, room was clean, nice with great artwork.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461258852~“Amazing accommodation”~We had to take a six hour drive to the RCH and stayed at the Larwill overnight, the clean, bright, modern and extremely comfortable accommodation helped make a long day a little more enjoyable. We will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461216007~“Delightful”~This hotel ticks all the boxes plus more. It was easy to check into, comfortable to be In, and conveniently located near the city and university. The staff were cheerful, always helpful and professional. The creative theme ran throughout the interior design adding to the experience the sense of delightfulness and fun for the whole family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461095023~“My stay at The Larwill Studio”~Excellent service from the friendly and helpful staff. The room was tastefully furnished and meticulously clean.

review_461093274~“Great views of Royal Park”~Excellent beds, good value. Nice art everywhere. Quite a unique boutique hotel. Being next to the park gives the area a sense of space. Good access to Melbourne city by tram. Some great cafes and restaurants in nearby Errol St. Well worth a visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461092063~“Larwill melbourne”~Tip: try to be put in a room facing Royal Park - beautiful outlook and very quiet. handy to Tullamarine Freeway and airport, but also quite close to the city. Ideal and v convenient if working or visiting the Royal Children's Hospital. Liked it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460564120~“City hotel with country views”~We came down to Melbourne to celebrate my husband's birthday. We have loved all the 'Art Series' hotels that we have stayed at in the past, so we thought we would give Larwill a visit. Lovely welcome by Jesse with a mention of an upgrade. Hard to believe downtown Melbourne is a 20 minute walk away when you are looking over parklands and no high rise. Charlotte delivered a bottle of bubbles with a happy birthday note, these special touches are what customer service is all about and my husband was thrilled with all the attention. Great size rooms, the bed was super comfortable, black out drapes, so after a wonderful sleep we walked into the CBD for breakfast. Parking is available on site, also a cafe downstairs, supermarket and other food outlets as part of the RCH. Thank you for a very memorable stay, we shall return.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_459241213~“Great hotel like all Art Series!”~Reallly enjoyed the Larwill. Service, room, facilities are very much like the Olsen. The nearby park is great for a run. The only downside? Its location. There are virtually no restaurant and facilities around the Larwill, making it difficult to choose other options then the ground floor Smith+ Singleton. When you're on a long stay, that's not ideal. If you stay for a few days only though, that's fine. Gr~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458559672~“Five star at Three star prices”~Modern, five star service and spacious, light rooms. Our room was overlooking a park, green and restful. The staff offered friendly service, carried my bags and recommended great coffee in the area. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and wifi was appreciated.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458440816~“The bar has been raised!”~Wow, simply wow! This hotel is the best of the best in Melbourne. We booked from the airport on arrival at the last moment after reviewing other comments on Trip Advisor. I can only say I'm glad we made the choice to stay at Larwill Studio's. We initially would have preferred the CBD but I can most definitely say the location was excellent for us with easy access to the Tram across the road. The room was spacious and thoughtful in every aspect. We were lucky to have a beautiful park side view. There is a quirky and personal vibe at Larwill and I felt like I was in a space that was not typical of a 'hotel' and more like a home away from home. The foyer, artwork and contemporary room layout were simply outstanding. The room was crisp and clean. The comfort of the bed was truly incredible. The amenities such as the coffee machine, microwave, larger sized bar fridge etc were welcomed. The bathroom products, Evo, are first class. (Would like a body moisturiser though!) The cafe downstairs served great coffee and quite good cuisine. My only comment was that we arrived late in the evening from an international flight and we were looking for a snack and a beverage. The cafe was closed and the closest option was a 'Servo' a 1/2 km up the road. Although the friendly staff suggested Uber Eats we really didn't want a meal. Having said that, the mini bar does have a few snack items. I liked the extra add ons that were available, such as their Smart Cars and bicycles for hire, although we didn't have time to use these. To summarise, when I'm next in Melbourne my first hotel search without a shadow of doubt, will be Larwill Studios! ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458207788~“Quirky, efficient, elegant and spacious”~Having stayed at two other Art Series Hotels, my recent stay at The Larwill was much anticipated and it essentially delivered the goods! The hotel, which is adjacent and interconnected to the Royal Children's Hospital, is convenient to the northern side of the city and elegant and spacious in feel. I loved the way check-in was expedited by a prior on-line survey. My check-in was wonderfully friendly and swift. My room was in the usual Arts Series Hotel manner quirky and individual, with a real sense of style and the idiosyncratic, the full windows and high ceilings add to the sense of space. Staff were professional and affable. However, breakfast next door was a real let down, with limited options and somewhat offhand staff. Why is there no fruit juice on offer or fresh fruit, for instance?~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_457279697~“Luxery, hip, comfort.. it has it all!”~Hotel is perfect! Very big room, with Nice view. Not in the centre, but a 25 minute walk to the center and Fitzroy. And the tram stops in front of the hotel. Taxi cost around 15dollar to the center.  Nice park next to it. Breakfast is served in restaurant next to the hotel, which is okay.  Service in hotel is good. The guy at the reception gave us good directions. rooms are clean and new. Bed is fantastic, and bathroom is big.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457052322~“Larwill hotel art series ”~Fantastic location, right next to the Children's hospital park, tram lines, Victoria markets and museum. The room was funky, practical and clean. Latest cool mags plus the attached restaurant had kid friendly and healthy meals which can be room serviced to your room.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456536495~“Comfortable and convenient”~This was an excellent place for a stopover in Melbourne. Rooms comfortable with good amenities. Staff were welcoming and accomodating. Close to city attractions and public transport. Also offering bicycles and mini vehicles for hire. Great restaurant on site.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456336722~“Too focussed on the sales”~Stayed here for the last 5 days of my trip and was the 7th hotel I'd stayed in in total all of a similar boutique standard. The positives first, friendly welcome and no problem leaving my suitcase there for a couple of days prior to arrival, room was spacious with a nice view of the park and all the staff I encountered were friendly & professional. The art work by David Larwill all around the hotel is exceptional and thoroughly interesting. The location is quite far out of central Melbourne though I knew this when booking, easy tram access to the city though and a not too long walk to some great spots in Carlton, Fitzroy and I had a fantastic brunch in a place called The Auction Rooms about a 10 minute walk into north Melbourne. The hotel is physically a part of the children's hospital so possibly not for everyone because of that. Sometimes it's the small things that add up though to a lower score, housekeeping not great (things like shoes not straightened on the floor makes you wonder how thorough the cleaning is) mini bar not restocked on last night and most importantly of all this seemingly relentless surge to make extra sales, this was the only hotel I stayed in that didn't even provide a complimentary bottle of water ($4 per bottle) and I really don't see the point in putting a cheap version of a nespresso machine in a room and then wanting to charge customers $1 per pod! The mini bar and snack pot is very well stocked with lots of delicious looking things, maybe a problem if you've kids in the room as well!  On check out found out I'd been charged for a coffee pod (that I didn't have) was removed without question but again was a shame. I think if you need to be in this particular part of Melbourne then this is a good spot but I certainly wouldn't choose to stay here again mainly based on the comparison with the other hotels I stayed in ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456052209~“Australian Open 17”~I booked due to the amazing reviews despite being a bit further from the city - best decision I've made in a long time. This hotel is exceptional! The rooms are top quality, the beds are incredibly comfortable & are super clean.  The staff were second to none & nothing seemed too much hassle. From food advice to ordering us taxis & so much other advice the service was second to none.  The art throughout the hotel & rooms just makes it that bit more unique too, it's not just "another hotel" it's a wkd earful experience & I can't wait to go back.  10/10 Larwill - you impressed to the MAX! Thanks for making my mums first trip to Melbourne extra memorable!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456031160~“nice room but unpleasant about overcharge”~Stayed there in Jan for two days. Beautiful view and nice room which match its price. However, I have realised the overcharge from my credit card for the mini bar which was not confirmed when I checked out.  Called and the first staff promised to give the refund. After about three weeks, no refund received then I called again yesterday, the second staff said we have moved a juice and a water out from the mini bar which we didn't even touch the mini bar.  I'm happy to pay for the room and the service that I received. Unpleasant experience of the overcharge, even for ten bucks. Be careful and double check your credit card if you stay here.~1~nan~3~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_455731246~“Great stay!”~My partner and I had a quick weekend away to Melbourne, and from the time we arrived to the time we left we were so impressed with the service and attention to detail at the Larwill Studio.  The staff were very friendly and efficient, and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. It's located just outside of the cbd, but getting into town was no hassle at all. Highly recommend this hotel and looking forward to staying here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455545121~“Always relaxing...”~I really appreciate the relaxing atmosphere The Larwill provides. It's like nothing I have ever experienced and I very much look forward to staying here. The beds are amazing, I love all the signature features the Larwill offers, from the "Jump on the bed" note, to the noticeboard and amazing basket selection of goodies and fridge drinks. I love the personalised notes left recently and during Australian Open time, even a tennis cookie! Well done team!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455516143~“Excellent Art Series hotel but could improve”~We've used the Art Series hotels a number of times and the Larwill is excellent but improvements could be made. The rooms are very spacious attractive and comfortable. The beds are brilliant. We actually bought one of the beds a few years back. Very clean room but...we expected a kitchenette like The Blackman has but no. The fridge was small and there's no toaster. I dont think ive ever stayed in a hotel with no toaster. We werent given the wifi code. However we got a complementary late checkout and a room with the park view. We'll stay again but know what to expect next time. Parking is excellent but make sure you leave the carpark before checking out otherwise you have to go back to the lobby to return the carpark pass.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455349435~“Lovely hotel”~Lovely spacious clean and modern apartment hotel, with lovely views of the surrounding parkland.Set up well for short or longer stays. Microwave, coffee machine, dining table. . Perfect if you want to be at this end of the city or near the children's hospital. We would definitely stay again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455342228~“Great Stay!”~It was a lovely stay. I had a parkland view, which was great to wake up to, especially in summer. The room was well-furnished (loved the mini basket with interesting food items) and well made. There is also a supermart a very short walk away within the same complex, and trams (100m from the hotel) with lines 55 and 59 running regularly to the city. I enjoyed the well-furnished gym (opened 24hours). The recep staff were great, very friendly and helpful. It's a great place to stay if you want a place close to the city but quieter and with a creative vibe.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455087453~“Good stay in Melbourne - helpful staff ”~The hotel is well done up, fresh and comfortable.  The hotel staff is very helpful and go out of the way to help you. I had to urgently use internet to compete an Online assessment and the staff was kind enough to allow me to use their desktop at night.  If you have your own car, there is a provision to park it in the premises with an extra payment per day.  Overall our stay was comfortable and relaxed.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455063459~“Attractive, contemporary but location not great for tourists”~First, the positive: What a great front desk staff: welcoming, warm, personable, solicitous with excellent ideas about Melbourne. The hotel is very modern and spacious. Our room, which overlooked a large (though somewhat pedestrian) park, was filled with light and very comfortable, especially the bed. There was a yoga mat and yoga channel (which didn't work until our last of 4 days there, though; on the up side, the front desk was quite sweetly concerned about this). There is a kettle, which is great, and a pod-coffee maker, which didn't work (and they charge for the coffee pods ...).  The downside for us: The hotel is in Parkville, not Melbourne proper. It is outside the free tram zone, and it takes about 20 minutes to get to Flinders Street station. More of a negative for us was that the hotel is located in a hospital district, and is part of (i.e. not just adjacent but connected inside to) the Royal Children's Hospital (a spectacular-looking facility, but not where everybody wants to spend their holiday). The other negative is that our room was not well-serviced; the bed was made but the bathroom and surfaces were not cleaned over two days.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~3~nan
review_454103440~“Best beds in any motel we've stayed in.”~Website is a bit confusing, so don't get caught, investigate carefully, ring them if not sure. BUT, in saying that, this place is spotless, well appointed and has THE most comfortable beds we've ever slept in, our own included.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454075171~“Mums (plus Lance) on tour ”~From the moment we checked in- we were so impressed! The superstar on the front desk had some fabulous life advice and made us feel happy & welcome.  The rooms were incredible- great size and twin room had two double beds, but didn't feel cramped. Rooms were clean with great decor. The beds themselves were AMAZING! I've never stayed somewhere with beds so soft and comfortable. The onsite restaurant had great food & even better French martinis. Thought the location was perfect- half hour walk to the city- 10 minute cab or uber, we had an event in Flemington- so was the perfect half way point.  We stayed two nights and struggled to find a fault.  We'll be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453746256~“Expensive (during the Australian open) but nice”~We stayed here for two nights. Unfortunately we visited during the Australian Open Tennis tournament (but not as tennis fans). So all hotels in Melbourne were dear. However, this one was very nice. Great art on the walls and the location near the Children's hospital was nice. (Close to tram stops too.) Very comfortable, great staff, beautiful, and highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453653194~“Beautiful”~Great spot, very very comfy beds and pillows, lovely and clean and very quiet. Very convienently situated to the royal childrens hospital which made popping back up to the room between appointments very easy. We will be back for sure!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452445590~“Great stay”~Staying at the Larwill was excellent. Rooms are well appointed, great location, friendly staff and beautiful art wherever you look. Restaurant downstairs was delicious. Will definitely be back and it is as good as other Art series hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452226025~“pretty cool”~There are a series of hotels, mostly in Melbourne but expanding to other cities in Australia called the Art Series Hotels. Each hotel is decorated with the art of an Australian artist. Several years ago we stayed at the Blackman in Melbourne and loved it . This time I was traveling with 2 art students from VCU so we decided to try the Larwill Studio which features the art of David Larwill. Larwill's work is bright, cheerful and very interesting. The hotel is located next door to the Children's Hospital of Melbourne . I was delighted to think of parents and kids being distracted by Larwill's playful creativity. The entire hotel has a light, airy and colorful air about it. The rooms are spacious- the beds incredibly comfortable. The showers were really good- this is not a small item in my book ! My room looked out over a park where people were strolling and playing. The hotel was very well situated just a short tram ride or a not very expensive cab ride to the Central Business District (or the CBD as they call it) If you were in moderate shape you could walk to the Victoria Markets which are awesome. The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. We arrived quite early and they seemed genuinely remorseful that the room was not ready (although we were not expecting to check in yet!) When we returned from our day they had already moved all our things to our rooms. There is a restaurant off the lobby that is pricey but really good and convenient for breakfast. My favorite touch: in addition to the usual mini bar items they had homemade cookies and a canvas and paint brush/paint kit in case all the art inspired you. Many of these canvases were displayed along with the Larwills in the lobby and were great fun to look at. This hotel is an especially good choice for families, the lobby is filled with toys. The staff is joyful in addition to being helpful which couldn't help but put tired families at ease. I found at both these hotels that the staff knows and loves their artists which makes it so much more interesting to stay there.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_452046325~“Magnificent stay”~Have always stayed in the city in the past, not anymore, and who knew this little gem existed? Enjoyed every moment of my stay. Perfect price to pay especially in comparison to boring city hotels/apartment, great service, very modern, very clean, has character, fantastic art and amazing room with a view of the city. Parking was a breeze. Although I didn't utilise the hotel parking. I was out during the day and street parking was free at night. There is also one hour free parking opposite the hotel if you just needed to pop in, and direct easy access to the freeway to and from airport. Public transport also just as convenient and 5 mins to city centre.  The hotel is attached to the RC hospital, therefore you had a supermarket, pharmacy, some food places including McDonald's, Boost juice as well as the hotels restaurant and cafe, oh and an IGA plus liquor store 500 metres down the road.  Didn't utilise the gym but there is a good one from what I saw with classes. There is a yoga mat in the closet and a yoga channel. There is a park outside to relax and enjoy.  I really enjoyed my stay and no doubt there will be many more to come. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_451587152~“Great Artsy feel, lots of nice small touches!”~It's a nice new concept, and even if its directly connected to the Children's Hospital the spacious lobby and great view of the park make for a really nice experience. The rooms had a nice amount of quirky touches that a lot of guests would find to be quite pleasant. Having a canvas where you could do some quick watercolor was pretty cool as well.  Food was very nice and the ambience of the restaurant was top notch. Would stay here again!~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_451393923~“Something new in Hotels!”~This hotel has been built in conjunction with the new Children's Hospital. You walk though a long foyer to the hotel rooms at the rear. It is devoted to the Australian Artist David Larwill, and his work is everywhere. The reception staff are excellent and the rooms very spacious and quite luxurious. If you have a room at the back you enjoy wonderful views over beautiful parkland. If you have Children with you there is a playground to end all playgrounds just out the back! This hotel is quite different to the norm and is like a breath of fresh air! The only possible drawback is that there is no close proximity to restaurants. But stretch your legs and go to Charlton - it is only about a mile. Il Cantuccio an Italian restaurant is worth the walk. But it is popular so it will pay to book. We were so impressed with the food there that we returned the following evening. You can reach it by bus or tram and bus, but while you are waiting you could have walked it!!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_451389131~“Hipster stay”~If you're looking for full service (bell boy, luggage sent to rooms, etc) then this is not for you. This is a no fuzz, friendly, artsy accommodation. The staff will try to assist and help you as much as they can, but since this is not a 5 star there are limitations. The room is amazing: spacious (bigger than rooms with this price in Asia), well designed, comfy beds, fun details and amnesties. This is truly what I would call value for money, I feel like every cent is well spent.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451109949~“Loved this hotel”~Stayed for an overnight visit to Melbourne with 2 adults and 2 children. Had a twin room overlooking the park - lovely outlook. Great location. The park behind the hotel was perfect for our kids. There were plenty of places to eat downstairs. The room was spacious, super clean and comfortable. I loved all of the quirky touches to the room - I loved the oversized artwork in the room and around the hotel. The hotel supply a small canvas and paint for each room (at a cost of $6) and you are welcome to do a painting there. Both of my children got one which they were thrilled about. I would absolutely stay here again - in fact both of my children asked if we can go back there again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
