review_475394108~“Great Service and a Convenient Location”~Best Western Riverside Apartments had a suite available for me for five days. I was so pleased with the attentive room attendant service and the front office personnel. The rooms were cleaned daily with special requests easily handled by a team of service people who came in and quickly did up the room. The rooms were tidy with a washer and dryer as well as a full kitchen. There was an elevator. The front office personnel were very competent and went the extra mile (I did not have a smart phone and they researched locations and made appointments without a fuss). They had a computer in the lobby but it was not functioning; however before I left they fixed the problem. I was traveling with friends with special dietary needs and having the kitchen was essential.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_471536660~“Poor shady location and bad service”~The reception is hidden in a lane and the actual apartments are a short walk from reception.  The entrance to the apartment block is a private property. This was very uncomfortable. The lift was not working. The atual apartment was decently sized. However, the property is very old. Service was poor. I had to call 4 times for early check-in. Not even once the receptionist bothered to call back and inform when the room was ready.  The apartment is next door to shady night clubs. Long walk from Southern Cross station. Definitely not recommended.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_469775050~“Not up to expectation”~People are OK nice. Location kind of hidden and taxi driver (with 20 years experience - supposedly) not able to find it. The carpet is in quite poor disgusting condition both inside and outside in the hallway. The safe does not work - we were told that they do not work anymore - why advertise still has a safe then. Otherwise our unit was just old. Would not come back or recommend at all. The good thing is that it is close to convention center and the apartment is large.~2~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_468649611~“Great customer service, good value”~Had to walk down a lane way to find reception, but once there staff were friendly and welcoming. Some of the hallways etc were a bit dated and shabby. The family room we stayed in was very spacious, 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, large living and dining area, and a kitchen. Plus an extra bed. Fabulous views!!! Comfortable beds for a great night's sleep. Rooms have obviously been refurbished, but ceilings are low, and old fashioned popcorn ceilings. Showers were small and had stained and missing grout, which was a shame in renovated bathrooms. One towel had a very odd smell, and covers on the beds were lightly marked. Great location to walk to restaurants and etihad stadium. Overall a comfortable stay, at a great price. Can't expect 5* at this price ;-) Spacious rooms for families and good staff.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466713076~“KICKED OUT BEFORE CHECKOUT”~Poor customer service  We were happy to pay for late checkout but were told just to be out of the apartment by 12:00pm. At 11:08am my friend came into the room scared and was yelling that a man was in our apartment. I walked out to see and a manager was yelling at us saying "evacuate the premises right now" when i tried to speak to him saying we were told checkout was at 12:00pm he repeated what he said. We were rushed to gather all of our stuff and continually yelled at by this man with no justification whatsoever. As we were rushed out we were unable to leave the apartment completely clean but we did our best under the pressure. When the key was returned we were given a $200 fine for a noise complaint at 8:00pm. We refused to pay this and left as we were not given the appropriate warnings. Later that day we called twice to speak to the manager and was told there was no manager on duty. We were also accused of being noisy all night when we actually left the apartment at 10:30pm that night and turned the music down way before this. The manager did not believe we left at 10:30pm and we told him to check the cameras and that we have photos on our phone to prove it. Never have i been yelled at and treated like a child like i was that morning. The manager barged into our room, scared my friend and did not give us a chance to explain that we were told we could leave at 12:00pm. I hope they never treat others like we were treated this day. For sure my friends and I will never be returning.~1~nan~3~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_466686187~“Not one of the best location or accomoodations”~Don't be fooled by the main photo. We were in an annexe which is just round the corner from here.Having been dropped off by a taxi at this main entrance we then had to drag 4 cases from Reception round to a pokey little entrance, that looked vaguely dodgy; through a key coded lift to our apartment. The entrance had a run down feel as the shop adjoining it was empty, with mail piled up and the doorway was obviously used for smoking and drinking as there was litter. The apartment itself was OK for 2 nights. The hotel did warn that it was noisy and they weren't wrong. The main room/kitchenette backs onto the main road, which is noisy from both traffic and revellers attending the nearby bar, but the bedroom is set further back, so we did have a good nights sleep. The area generally has a run down feel. Breakfast wasn't provided, so there are nearby fast food outlets or The Grain Store which was the best thing about the area. It's a reasonable location for walking to the main streets or a short walk from the hop on bus. Hotel reception staff were very helpful with storing bags before our room was ready and recommending places to eat and visit, hence we found The Grain Store.~3~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465163626~“Mixed bag, but generally a comfortable place to stay”~This was an unusual hotel. You had to take two elevators to get to the hotel floor. You'd enter the building at the hotel lobby, then walk over to the lobby of the office building to the elevator. The apartment layouts were perfect. Small bedrooms, but roomy common rooms with a dining table and living area where the TV is located. The kitchen is updated and it is stocked with the basics. The bathroom also is updated with new fixtures. Oddly, though the carpet just looks dirty most of the time. Given that the floors and bathrooms were clean, I think the carpet probably was clean, it just looked dirty. The beds were comfortable. We didn't use the kitchen except to boil water for tea because we were scared off by the warnings about the fire alarm. The free wifi was so bad I couldn't read my emails, but there was a computer in the lobby. The hallways and parking lot, where we had an assigned place for $50/night were much shabbier than the rooms. The staff was very helpful to us. We were comfortable, and the location was ideal. So it was a very mixed bag.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_463144001~“Sharon”~Great location, economical for family stay, nice size rooms for the city, check in was very slow, parking is slightly awkward in lane way, while checking in, blocking others. We enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and facilities were adequate.~4~5~5~4~4~4~3~nan
review_461050551~“Bitterly disappointing stay”~Went to the city for White Night and so was looking forward to staying in a comfortable hotel room. My opinion of it was: - tatty - carpets stained, torn, looked really awful - dirty - even if there was a view - you wouldn't be able to see it due to the filthy windows, inside and out. Bathroom was dirty - hair on the floor and dirty around toilet :( - very outdated - states its modern - it is not!!! - i know it was a big night out for Melbourne, but i didn't expect to see beer bottle and cigarette stubbs in the lift - revolting - when my sister and i came out early in the morning to see more of White Night - there was a half naked man in the foyer who was obviously staying somewhere or was a guest of someone - perhaps vetting of additional guests needs to be done. -when we went to leave, there were more cigarette butts outside the lift area. This place needs desperate attention - i won't be staying here again. The location is great but you can't sell location when there is no heart in the rooms you are selling. Very very disappointed.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_460003966~“If you like retro then stay here!”~I booked this about 3 weeks ago and then decided to read reviews the day before our stay. So glad I didn't cancel. Check in and check out was excellent. No delays there at all. The shared lifts....when you work out how to send the ones away that can't get you to your room, then you're fine. Yes, the room was dated. However, I laughed at the digital clock in the bedroom with a phone on it. Who has seen one since the early 90s? The light shade hanging off the wall light was hilarious....perhaps someone was having an outrageous fantasy met lol Yeah, ok, the carpets could do with a clean....agree. At the end of the day, it's affordable. It was clean. Bed was comfy. The service desk friendly and helpful.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_457759392~“Unprofessional staff, tired rooms, lousy view, overpriced.”~Living a little outside of Melbourne we look forward to the occasional night out in the city. So as this hotel was very close to the venue we were attending for a friends 40th birthday party we booked an apartment there. A bit confusing on arrival as although the address is in Flinders street the actual entrance is down a narrow one way lane. On their web site they say you can park your car for $35, this was confirmed on their emailed confirmation but just to make sure I called the day before and was assured I could park our car for $35. However on arrival I was told their car park was full and I was directed to park in the nearby Wilson Car Park. The apartment was a little tired and the view not very nice. Our unpleasant surprise after checking out the next morning was a parking fee of $96! Apparently I was supposed to be informed on arrival to ask reception for a ticket for the Wilson Parking facility so I would be only charged the quoted $35. I queried this by email when we arrived home but was told to take the matter up with the Car Park. They did apologize for not informing me but refused to reimburse me for their oversight. They have no customer service and no integrity....they just don't care. Find somewhere better, it won't be very hard!~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_456062675~“Riverside Apartments - what to expect!”~Stayed at the Riverside Apartments in Melbourne Recently. Old and tired. The room was very clean but somehow details like the mound of fluff in the back of the hairdryer and the mould on the grout in the shower had been overlooked. The reception area had a lot of steps, appeared dirty and mat needed replacing. Staff were nice and helpful and explained things well. Small two plate stove, above average fridge (no minibar), water jug clean but emply and no lid. Electrical equipment working, TV controls were interesting but TV worked, one in lounge and one in bed room. Bed quite old but comfortable. Highlander Lane was filthy, especially in the morning and all the trash bins live there. Not too noisy. But only one airconditioner in lounge and temperature could not be changed but was ok for me.  Breakfast in room available but not until 7am.  Quite a distance from Flinders Street Station and Southern Cross. Would be checking out what other deals there are. If you need to stay there specify you stay in main block where reception is rather than annex.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~3~nan
review_456052497~“Definitely not 4 star”~This building needs upgrading. Very rundown. Chipped paint. Stale smell in corridors. Blinds missing. Damaged walls. Wardrobe door missing. Twin beds mismatched so that they couldn't be pushed together. Unable to see river with outdoor screen blocking the view. All the windows had to be opened to freshen unit.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_455316386~“Disgusting!”~Thick Mould in shower/Deceiving location - no riverside view and not located in the walkway where photo taken/ filthy lounge and/ cushions/ dirty hairdryer full of something in the back/unsafe space. Dirty blankets/sheets. Really bad experience we arrived at 5pm and I just wanted to leave and go elsewhere. Couldn't wait to leave and we only overnighted there.~1~nan~3~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_455261042~“Worst Best Western Hotel I have stayed at.”~On arrival we were confronted with steps everywhere, and with 4 large cases made our way to the elevator "unassisted", only to find a narrow staircase with 14 more stairs. We had a nice view from the 17th floor was to the rear towards the Rialto Tower with a balcony. The Room had filthy carpet and rug.Air Conditioners old and noisy.A dangerous high step up into the bathroom.The Kitchen had all the basics,the beds were comfortable. Having stayed at various Best Western hotels around the world I feel they could do a lot better.~2~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_452390136~“Views as good as the Service!!!”~I had arrived late in the evening and the manager ( i think) Steven was very courteous and checked me with great ease. He was very knowledgeable of all the special sites around Melbourne and where to eat and what to see. The room was perfect for my stay and the view is AMAZING. The Crown Entertainment complex is a 2 min walk from this hotel and the MCC is about a 20 min walk. Location is amazing. Would definitely come back to this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_451677256~“Unclean and Poor Service”~We stayed here the first 3 nights of our Melbourne stay between Christmas and New Year and would certainly not return.  The apartment was dirty and very dated and the staff at reception were not particularly helpful, verging on rude. We arrived at aprox 7:30am, after arriving from the UK, and were told the room would be ready by 2pm, but that it should be ready by 12:30/1pm and to come back then. We arrived back after a lovely morning in the city at 1:30 to be told out room wasn't quite ready and could we come back after 2pm, which as this was the check in time we didn't think much of it. When we returned after 2pm our room still wasn't ready, but were told it would only be a few minutes and could we wait in the lobby and they would notify us that it was done. 40 minutes later I asked again when our room would be ready to be told it had been for half an hour. No one came to tell us.  When we finally got to the room it had clearly been rushed and was filthy, there were smudges and dirt all over the bathroom walls, hairs in the sink, shower and toilet. crumbs and stains on the kitchen counters. We went to the reception and showed the staff pictures my husband had taken. There was no apology or explanation as to what had gone wrong. They offered to move us to a lower grade room with no offer of a refund for the extra we paid for what was meant to be the deluxe room. Instead we asked that the room was cleaned properly, we were asked again to leave and come back in an hour. When we did return we spoke to someone different, who was very pleasant and did apologise and offered us a late check out due to the delays in preparing the room. When we did eventually get into our room again, it was better, but not what I would call spotless and little to no care had been taken preparing the room. It was dark and poorly furnished, with lots of wear and the previous occupants left over beverages in the fridge. Although a great location, there are better options in the city at this price range. The service, standard of room and service was poor and I would not return or recommend.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_451562272~“Does the job”~Very standard facilities with a generous sized room. Great location for Melbourne CBD. Waking distance to Casino, flinders and southern cross station.  Section of the hotel we stayed is very out dated.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448462648~“Disgusting apartment waste my money and got jib”~I booked this apartment 2 months before New Years. I asked for a view of river to see fire works for New Years. Even paid a extra and while we got there our view of trees and gates.. And we got charge extra in advance the service was disgusting. Especially dealing with the Chinese pregnant lady she was very rude and can't deal with customer service properly. My advice to people and travellers just be careful with this hotel.. They offer great time of course some people got a good deal and were lucky.  Some are not so lucky we had to pop out side the see the New Years fire up and close.. Thanks you western riverside for making our stay very unwelcome.. Next time I'd stay at Langham or crown towers bigger name bit more expensive but you get what you paid for.. And no rude reception when I check in there was many customers was very upset with the service.. My advice theses days are hard to earn we don't want your money to spend and be disappointed with the outcome. So spend and shop wisely because this hotel or apartment is not top rated so many complaint not only online comments but also in person...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445941951~“Great city views”~Please don't be put off by the negative reviews from some travellers. We had a fantastic stay here in a spacious 2 bed apartment with 2 balconies. On the largest balcony we brought out chairs and a table and had a couple of glasses of wine at night with the city skyscrapers surrounding us , fully illuminated and the air warm....bliss. when booking ensure you book the riverside apartments. Rooms were spacious and spotless.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442706432~“Not riverside and nothing like the photos on booking.com”~I was disappointed by this property as I was stuck around the back of a totally different building to that which the web site indicated I would be in. The room was noisy with street noise and pipes banging. The air conditioning was efficient but the lighting was very dim. The windows had one way thermal coatings but no lace pull downs so on a dark rainy day when lights inside were needed you had to draw the curtains for privacy. Parking $35 per day. I could hear the passing trains from my room on a back street, I would hate to hear the trains from teh 'river view' side.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_442528385~“The Slip is Showing”~Having stayed at the Riverside for many years I'm afraid that, like myself , age is creeping in ! It is still a good choice & fairly central but little signs of disrepair & fraying at the edges are apparent and a freshen up is required I think ? Staff are as always professional & friendly but the cleaning in my room was below par and left an ordinary impression.Will be back & hope for the old days ??~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_441688990~“Good value”~We got a room in the annex. Well, our room was a bit run down with an old carpet. If you have a dust allergy like me, you might should stay away. Hotels in Melbourne are expensive and that fact makes this one a good deal. Nice staff, great central location.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440436527~“Pleasant stay”~The welcome on arrival was very friendly. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed with everything that we needed for a one night stay. We stayed in a single bedroom apartment on the 17th floor. The location is fantastic and easy to access. Very easy and short walk to South Bank, Casino and Exhibition Center or walk or tram ride into the center of the city. Would stay here again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437351746~“Worst hotel I've ever stayed in”~I'm no snob but this is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. After 20 hrs on the run, all I wanted was a bed but no one at reception so couldn't get in. Then sent down to road to other property that is absolutely filthy, there is garbage in the "foyer" if you can call it that. The place stinks. It's extremely noisy, has no facilities, it seriously should be knocked down so they can start again. Now there are people screaming at each other in the corridor. I'm wondering if it gets rented out by the hour. Seriously do not stay here.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436906901~“Pleasant stay”~Stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment , very large and accommodated 7 sleeping and 2 bathroom, it was clean and spacious and suited our night stay in the city. Kitchen did not have enough plates and cutlery for number it should sleep, Also to note there is a flight of stairs once you enter apartment to get to kitchen and bedrooms. Location is very good opposite aquarium and tram stop outside front of building.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435965330~“Great location and large room”~I found an online special for these apartments, which made the price even more reasonable for one night's accommodation. I was welcomed in a lovely manner at reception and had to walk around the corner to find the other building containing my apartment. The only downside was catching the small lift up that smelt of curry. The apartments appear to be an old office block that has been converted and my 1 bedroom apartment was extremely roomy, with massive windows and a bathroom that worked but could probably do with a renovation. All in all I was extremely pleased with this place and am glad to have found this secret accommodation in a great part of Melbourne, close to the Yarra and Crown.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_434936577~“Good Location”~We had two apartments for two nights whilst driving from Mildura to Moe and wanted to have a look around the city.

review_400683620~“Enjoy Your Stay”~Based at the slightly rougher end of the CBD, this hotel is good value for the money, its size and location. We had a one bedroom apartment with views from the 16th floor and stayed for six days. The room was warm, comfortable and high enough to get away from the street noise below. From the hotel we could easily walk to the shopping areas of the CBD and across the river to the beautiful south bank. It was also easy to catch nearby trams to all our desired city destinations, including Victoria Market. The reception staff were very helpful and always willing with advice and directions. Minor drawbacks: the low water pressure in the shower and the house staff sometimes forgot to replaces towelling and didn't vacuum. But overall we really enjoyed our stay.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_399777001~“Good Location, good service”~I stayed here for hour nights while attending a conference. The location was good but with that came the noise of garbage trucks at all hours of the morning. Not the Best Westerns fault and I didn't complain at the time as it wasn't that huge of a deal to me but something to keep in mind, the annex apartments are on Flinders Lane so keep that in mind. The staff were nice and the rooms were pretty clean however take your own toiletries!! There are shampoo, conditioner and shower gel dispensers in the shower but the conditioner had what looked kind of like black...maybe mould in it, they also didn't work.  My apartment was the same as my work colleagues across the hall however she had new carpet where as mine was heavy duty (reminded me of school) and its amazing what a difference it made to the look of the room. It wasn't anything flash but it did the job just take your own toiletries and if you;re worried about noise ask for an apartment that is quieter or book somewhere else. Also the wifi didnt work for me. It connected but I couldnt use it.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_396080584~“Comfortable Apartment for a weekend escape.”~We had a 1 bedroom apartment in their 2nd building around the corner. It was roomy and comfortable except for the Daikin Air con which was a bit dodgy (appeared to need a good clean and service) Staff were generally friendly and helpful and the room was serviced every day of our 4 day stay.  Good location opposite the Melbourne Aquarium with a tram stop right outside. Reasonable tariff as well. Bed and pillows were pretty comfortable and we found the location fairly quiet.  Probably the only other negative to stop 5 stars was the fact that when we left our bags for safe storage when we arrived on the first day they were not that secure as other guests can access them along with their own without supervision.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
