review_477924412~“So convenient”~This seems to be an old building that has been thoroughly renovated. My room was very compact and functional..I liked that it had windows out onto a small (shabby) courtyard: no claustrophobia! Bathroom very modern, clean; bed comfortable. I also liked that there was no tacky art on bedroom walls. Such a convenient location: a stone's throw from Southern Cross Railway Station with several tramlines nearby. Best of all, very reasonable pricing.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_477890218~“Very happy with stay”~We found front desk staff polite smartly dressed and very helpful. Room was clean roomy and functional. Bathroom was spacious with only down side the shower was over the bath. Disappointed at this time in life you have to pay for wifi. Even in third world hotels there is free wifi. Overall it was good value for money and clean~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477710252~“Comfortable, well worth the money”~Stayed here for two nights in March, very impressed with the hotel for only about 100AUD a night, Spacious room, well furnished, bathroom adequate. Location is handy for Southern Cross and Flinders Street stations, just a short walk to the casino and to the river. Our room was to the side of the hotel, but there was a lot of traffic noise from the cars and trams, a pair of earplugs might be useful. No meals were included, but the hotel has a restaurant for both guests and other customers, they offered a deal of a steak and wine for 20dollars, this was great value, we had it both nights.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_476023527~“Four night stay”~Fantastic location just across Southern cross station and ten minute walk from the city centre . Room was nice and clean with everything that you might need. The cons were that wifi was not for free,had to three dollars per day and also the pipes in the bathroom were very noisy at night. Another handicap was that it was not fully wheelchair accessible.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475948568~“Beware”~Stay here Easter weekend with wife gave two single beds not a double showers were freezing said that there was maintenance being done on the hot water why over Easter weekend what a load of crap so don't stay here not very good value and front desk attendant was rude when complained about shower~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473998543~“Overpriced and disappointing - but good location”~This is not a hotel I would normally stay at, but I booked this hotel at the last minute to cater for a long layover in Melbourne. While it was one of cheapest options (excluding hostels), after experiencing the room I would say it was still very overpriced. The room was small, with no windows, and felt prison like after a few hours. The bathroom was clean and modern, however again very small and the bar soap was already wet. While the room itself appeared to be clean, the outdated decor and overall poor quality of the room made it feel dirty. The services and facilities were average, which a fee charged for luggage storage and wifi, which I found disappointing (particularly the luggage storage fee).  The location to Southern Cross Station is hard to beat and the staff were very friendly. This hotel is a good option for those who are on a budget but still want to stay in a hotel in the city centre and just want a bed for the night.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_473495247~“Good hotel close to southern cross station”~The hotel is clean and convenient and check in quick and friendly. There are a couple of different standards of room but all are quite good and spotlessly clean.  It's a short walk to the city shops and you can also use the city tram di free to the inner city attractions including the many lovely theatres Melbourne is famous for~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473324414~“over priced but location good”~This hotel was not my choice but booked for me for a family event. the front desk was very good and helpful and the rooms on checkin were clean but thats it. check out 10 am way to early and took 50 dollar deposit for what i do not know as no mini bar. room was not cleaned and for the price whould have been. charged for parking and bag storage.  location very good but suggest maybe could have got a better deal somewhere else. seems to want to be a hotel but policies like a Hostel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472121430~“Good location but charging for wifi is outdated.”~My wife and I booked this hotel because of its location and cost. Its within walking distance to the free trams, trains, and the drop off / pick up location for the airport bus. The room was super nice and came with a fridge. There is a grocery store nearby where we could buy food rather than eat at restaurants which was handy. My only complaint is that they charge for wifi. I would rather pay more per night and get free wifi in my room than have to go through the process of buying a days worth of wifi and getting logged in properly. We ended up walking to the train station and using the free wifi there because it was such a hassle.~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~3~nan
review_471552347~“Good affordable and strategic place in the CBD near the Southern Cross Station”~Location is prime, just minutes away from Southern Cross Station which houses Skybus, the bus service you would take from the airport to the city. It is also located within the city Free tram zone. So if you are spending most of your time in the city you can technically travel all day free on the trams in the Free tram zone. It's also within walking distance to attractions like Crown casino, South Wharf DFO, etc. Service is good, staff are friendly. Self-coin-laundry service is available. Place is a little old and the floor squeaky but it is clean with sufficient space. There's iron, ironing board, and hair dryer provided. There's also a small fridge in the room. Unfortunately no free wifi is provided. This is different from my travel experience in most Asian countries where free wifi is standard though the quality varies. Overall a good experience and would come back again.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_469975586~“Convenient”~Close to Southern Cross Railway Station, with a restaurant, bottle shop and convenience store right beside it, some cheap eateries just around the corner from it in Collins St, we really enjoyed our stay over night here. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the rooms and really happy with the blinds which kept out any light. I wish the pillows had been better. I'd happily stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_469201749~“Everything we needed”~My daughter and i stayed at the great southern for one night after a concert at edihad stadium. Easy walk to southern cross railway station and edihad stadium. Trams run just outside the door too, so easy access to the cbd.  The room was a nice size, wifi good and much cheaper than was advertised on their website. The bed was perfect, as was the tv and shower. The room was out the back so we had zero noise and the room was spotlessly clean. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468810440~“Afforadable inner city accomodation”~This hotel is really good if you need a cheap place to stay in the city. We came in from long flights and shuttle is walking distance to the hotel. The trams and trains are also very close and late night snacks are available just along the street. The hotel itself is very comfortable and the balcony rooms are in the centre of the hotel not looking out over the city, so pretty quiet too. We had a buffet breakfast included with quite a few options and good coffee.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468695789~“Close to everything, but dissapointing”~There was a bad (sewer like) smell coming from out toilet,  and there was not enough drainage/angle in the shower floor, and the shower door did not go to the floor, so the water from the shower, went over the bathroom floor.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_468142115~“Brief Visit”~The hotel met expectations. Clean, good location and nearby carpark. The only letdown was the WiFi. The phone signal (Vodafone) is very poor in the room so i needed to use the hotels wifi. The first night it worked fine but after buying more on the second night, i was unable to connect. I approached reception, explaixned and asked for a refund but this was refused. Was given a URL instead which also didnt work. Missed the thing i wanted to watch due to this. If the mobile signal is poor, which it is. And you have to pay for WiFi, which you do. Then the WiFi should be accessable and reliable, which it isn't. I did finally manage to connect after waking up and trying again at 04:30 the next morning!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_466676839~“Perfect location”~4 friends, 1 family room. More than enough space to spread out & be comfortable during our 2 night stay. Welcoming staff, happy to send up some extra bedding. Quick walk to the Crown Complex & Southbank. Easy access to trams into the city centre. Perfect location if you are arriving via Southern Cross Station, a very easy walk with luggage. We will definitely book back in for future city trips.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466425055~“Lovely stay and location”~Hotel is placed in a great location and very close to Eithad stadium (the reason i chose to stay there). they have a variety of rooms to select and i chose the standard spencer room, lovely room, clean and spacious, they even have USB points next to the bed easy to plug in your device for charging, great idea. had a full buffet breakfast, cost at $23 may seem a little high however plenty selections from the buffet and basically all you can eat so well worth the price. desk staff were friendly and courteous. i will be returning again when the football is on.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466063033~“Good location but tired ”~This hotel is perfect for a city centre location but is very tired. The rooms are noisy and basic, but clean. The reception staff were helpful but not overly friendly. My biggest gripe was the $2 charge per bag to store the luggage, as we were there before we could check in. Not a massive fee in the scheme of things, but I've never been charged this anywhere before!!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465950843~“Great value!”~After reading lots of negative reviews on here I was quite nervous every about our stay BUT I was pleasantly surprised!

Would definitely stay here again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465169091~“Close to CBD & transport, however very loud location”~Hotel was great, good location, friendly staff, cheap fast wifi, however rooms have no sound proofing. I was located on the 1st floor on the street, heard every tram, truck and the rude awakening of a garbage truck in the middle of the night. Room was clean, very close to all transport. Would stay here again, but would be be requesting a room away from the street.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_464987526~“great location, but otherwise nothing outstanding”~Stayed for 4 nights in one of the rooms on the 5th floor, facing Spencer St. Location of the hotel is just perfect, sits within the free tram zone, so hopping on & off the tram to get to the other end of the city was always quick & easy. The room itself had a good view of the street below & of the grand hotel across the road, but oh boy there was next to no sound proofing given those windows. Motorcycles roaring by, fire engine trucks with siren screaming, & loud trash talking pedestrians below — you hear it all, & oftentimes all through the night so good luck if you are a light sleeper. The condition of the room was OK, with a complicated all-in-one phone + alarm clock + radio combo device that I did not bother to figure out how to use, & for the whole duration of the stay I also never figured out how to switch on the do-not-disturb sign by the door (it shouldn’t be that hard!)… so I ended up having housekeeping everyday which I don’t usually need, except that the shrivelled-up dead baby lizard stayed by the leg of the table the whole time, so I wondered if there was any vacuuming done at all. The cold/hot water combination in the bathtub shower was hard to keep consistent, & either the hot or the cold water would taper off when you think you got the temperature right, so the water gets progressively colder or warmer as you’re showering. It's a shame the window could not be opened eve a little, so I was forced to use the aircon, except it kept switching off every few hours. Restaurant 1903 on the ground floor served decent food, & had very affordable lunch specials.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_464498005~“Basic but good”~I had one night in Melbourne before travelling home so booked here as was convenient to the SkyBus. Well the walk was a little longer than I thought and it was a struggle with cases but that is not the hotels fault. The reception is bright and airy and 3 staff on reception at all times I found. I arrived around 1030 and was told I could have my room straight away. That was lovely as I had just flown in from Vietnam. The room was basic but clean although I did find a pair of socks in the safe (?). I had everything I needed for a nights stay so was quite happy. I had trouble with the wifi, ($3 per 24hrs per item) so reception sorted it out. Next day left my bags for a very small fee $2, in the luggage room then used the restroom to change before going to the airport. The location is great. Convenient for trams, CBD and trains. I would stay here again if on a brief visit. My only gripe is the doorstop in the bathroom is right in front of the toilet. Twice I stubbed my toes before I learnt to be careful.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_463301713~“Why do I feel ripped off?”~The saying 'you get what you pay for' is usually true, so why do I feel ripped off paying under $100 for a room here?  Outside the room looks like an episode of prison break. I could swear the bed is bigger than the room and have no idea how they even got it in here. The bathroom mirror is thinner than my head.  Won't be staying here again, just ewww~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462617243~“Good location but that's really about it...,,”~Rooms small and basic, food at restaurant average, the internal cortyard reminds me of an American style jail complex.

review_462415630~“Old Hotel and "stolen" money of Check out”~My name Andreas Indonesia , I stay for 2night 21-23 feb 2017. Price is good (City area) if you can receive their service. I Booking family suit 4person,  1. Towel only for 2 person, when I call room service for another 2 towel, they said I must take by myself at reception in Lobby. 2. Air condition, the lowest is only 22 C, they admit the AC is bad because for OLD design. At that time the weather is hot and to get 22 C must have more than 2 hours. 3. The blanket is dirty, window is dirty. 4. The bad thing is when I check out at 11am, they charge me $10. Because the check out time is 10am. They didnt tell in advance but there is a notice in envelope key. I didnt see that note. They should be told in advance about the check out time. Salam.~2~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_462243454~“Great Location, VERY UNFRIENDLY STAFF 😠”~The hotel has a great location, close to everything and the price is good if you're on a budget. Rooms need attention tho.

review_461811425~“Bad service. Room feels like a jail cell.”~The Only good thing about it : location.

review_460850154~“Excellent location and much better than it appears on the internet!”~We stayed a week at the Great Southern Hotel. It is very centrally situated, and is on the free tram routes around the city centre. The decor is a bit bland and uninspiring, but our room at the front was very comfortable and had everything we needed - en suite with large shower, comfortable large bed, fridge and tea making facilities. We used the washing machine in the basement too, although there was also a line for hanging light washing in our shower room.  We ate in the attached restaurant several times as well, as this was convenient and the food was very good. I wish they could cheer up the decor with, say, some of the wonderful colourful aboriginal paintings you have in Australia.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_460823222~“Don't go there !”~If you want wifi you have to pay a fortune and it's not unlimited anyway ! Scandalous!  If you want to see a movie ( because you don't have internet) it's 17$!  And if you need to leave your luggage to the luggage room you have to pay as well !  The mini bar was empty and early checkout !!!  No happy at all about this hotel !~1~1~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_460545437~“Overnight stay”~Very close to everything, rooms very clean & tidy.

Perfect.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460222792~“Great hospitality”~The room was very clean and tidy and had been recently upgraded. We were appreciative of the free upgrade to executive suite.

review_460213781~“Room needs attention”~Have stayed here numerous times and reviewed three times previously as a 4. this time however our room was in dire need of some attention. Room 212. The aircon fan was so loud and rattly that we could not have it on while sleeping. The toilet appeared to have had either the top or bottom section replaced, and the two halves do not match up. This would not be a concern except the lid WON'T STAY OPEN. The only way to use the toilet was to sit on the seat whilst holding the lid and then let the lid rest on your back whilst doing "your business" repulsive for me, and extremely uncomfortable for my man. As I said we have stayed here more times than I have reviewed, in all kinds of rooms on offer. Even the unrenovated room we had once was more pleasant than this. Does not usually disappoint, but it did this time.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459819454~“Great Location”~Close to Spencer St Station makes public transport a breeze - tram stop 50m away makes getting around melb. easy.

review_459658963~“Location is worth it”~Have stayed here 3 or 4 times over the past year and while I generally don't hold it in high regard, the budget price you pay and location is worth the average hotel. Highly recommend to not stay in one of the courtyard rooms. The walls are paper thin and you can hear every door open and every conversation happening outside. Not to mention the rooms are tiny! Staff here have been hit and miss on my visits but if you just want a bed to sleep in for a shorter stay this would be the place. Location is one of the best you will get so that is a bonus.~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan~2~nan
review_459532751~“Well located, good value hotel”~Stayed here during a last minute stop in Melbourne. The hotel was great value for the price we paid and was in a great location for exploring the city. The hotel is just a couple of blocks from Southbank and the room had everything we needed. The restaurant adjoining the hotel reception area was also great value and the food was really good. Would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Melbourne in the future.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458592137~“CLOSE TO SOUTHERN CROSS STATION”~Very noisy room but proximity to Southern Cross Station made me choose this hotel. Last time I was away from the street which made a huge difference. Noisy traffic during early morning is a nuisance. Staff were friendly.~4~nan~nan~2~4~nan~4~nan
review_457475482~“Second time around and still no better”~Stayed in a family room this time which was spacious and much better than the tiny room I stayed in last time. However, lamps don't work properly, shower pressure was dismal, no hot water, loose tiles in the bathroom list goes on. Was disturbed at 1am with our neighbours knocking on walls, look to the phone to notify reception, no information!  Took a guess and tried to dial 1 for reception with no success. Couldn't find a hotel compendium in the room to find the number for reception. So I had to use my phone data to google search their phone number (as wifi was way too expensive). Tv remote doesn't work. Rooms are outdated and scummy. Blah blah blah. This is not 4 star quality. Period. I gave the great southern a second go assuming a different room type would be a better experience, didn't work out. Will not return or recommend to anyone.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456624559~“Acceptable, could be better”~I have mixed feelings about this hotel. The location is good - just across the road from the railway station and airport bus terminal. Close to trams, which are free in the centre zone and so easy access to many attractions. My room was smaller than many hotels, basic but very clean. The staff were pleasant and helpful as far as they were allowed. My room was in the "courtyard" section and there is a lift, but also a dozen steps. Staff carried my luggage for me. The courtyard area is 6 floors high, looks very stark, and the hard stone walls and floor caused a lot of echoes - guests arriving late and taking loudly, doors banging! I certainly had disturbed sleep each night. I think there are things management could do to reduce noise levels including a "Silence after 11pm" notice. There are other rooms in the main building, but they will face the main street. I also think WIFI was very expensive. $9.90 for 2 hours in your room. Computers in the foyer were $2 for 20mins and if you wanted to check-in online and print your boarding pass that was 50c. Staff said they were not allowed to do it, but other hotels have printed them for me. Many hotels now have free wifi.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~4~4~nan
review_456120763~“Overpriced and dissapointed ”~I booked the "best" room the hotel had. Most horribly designed room I have ever been in. Glass room for a bedroom? No cutlery or plates for the "kitchen" - why have a kitchen if you can't even provide a knife? The best thing was the bathroom BUT we didn't even get clean towels even though I paid extra for room service.  The chairs for the "dining" were just crap, at least expected a couch. Really disappointed and makes me never want to go to Melbourne again. Yes the location was great but I could of spent $850 somewhere nicer with a very similar location.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456100275~“Basic hotel.. nothing special”~If you are wanting to budget on a reasonable hotel, Southern cross is it! Good price and also its straight across from southern cross station! The rooms are basic nothing flash! Only thing annoyed me was, their wasn't any information about the hotel or facilities phone numbers etc, only a restraunt menu?? I would stay here again just for the price~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455794394~“All right for the price”~I was here for a night and the stay was okay - nothing exceptional. I thought it was a pretty basic hotel, but one that wasn't bad for the price, However, there were a couple of things I couldn't help but notice. There were 2 wings and my room was in the newer one and the 4th level. The elevator was really slow and old, but that really wasn't much of a concern. Strangely, the elevator was in the older wing and there was no ramp connecting the 2 wings. Instead, there were a flight of stairs that one would have to climb. This could make it difficult for the ones that have heavy baggage to carry. The room was clean with all basic amenities, but a few things needed fixing. For instance, there was no place to keep the towels anywhere close to the shower room. One would have to walk the entire stretch of the bathroom to fetch it after a shower and this makes the entire place wet. There was no complimentary wifi, which again was a little disappointing. The bed was comfortable and pretty much everything else was fine. One thing that really would go in favor of this place is the location. It was hardly a couple of 100 meters from the Southern cross station and the tram stops. Since there was hardly any interaction, couldn't comment on the service. But overall, it was not bad for the budget.~3~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_455356817~“It's OK, nothing special.”~If you are looking for a bed in a convenient CBD location and no other frills, this hotel is for you.

review_455132957~“Worst stay in Aus to date”~Tiny rooms felt like solitary confinement, noisy air conditioning, expensive parking, no free wifi which is like a room without a bed.

review_454805300~“A central bargain”~The Great Southern Hotel is located in a central part of the Melbourne CBD - an easy walk from most landmarks and main streets. My room had all I required, nothing fancy, but nothing below average either. The only downside was my room had no natural lighting, and the hallway to the rooms resembled an old prison. However, the room was up to standard and was an affordable choice. I would happily stay here again for a short stay.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454804023~“Good location not so good rooms ”~The location of this Hotel is fantastic, close to everything. Unfortunately our room was very old and run down, the air conditioning didn't work properly and the shower pressure was terrible. We would stay here again but only if we got a more modern room.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454391422~“Ok for a short stay”~This hotel suitable for a short stay, convenient located in CBD, short walk to Southern Cross Station. Rooms are adequate, clean enough although a bit more effort in that area would go a long way. Disappointed that they wanted to charge $2.00 to leave your luggage after check out - never encountered that before except at maybe a railway station? ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453850957~“Hotel was absolutely fine for me.”~After reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried but my experience staying at this hotel was great.  I arrived at about 10:15 and asked the girl at the desk straight up if I could put my bag in their luggage room (as it states check in is at 2pm) but she checked me in straight away! My room was clean and a lot bigger than I expected. The cleaners came in and changed my towels, left more soap and shampoo and made my bed each day, which I feel in unnecessary but I know a lot of people MUST have this service or the hotel is considered bad. Location is EXCELLENT. Hotel is located really close to Southern Cross Station making it so easy for first time travellers to Melbourne (like me) as the shuttle bus from the airport (SkyBus) drops you off and collects you at the station. I stayed here for the Aus Open which was only a 2.5 km walk so was able to walk to the tennis if I didn't want to be smothered on a tram!  I paid $157 a night which was one of the cheapest in the CBD (excluding the backpackers) at this time of year due to the tennis. Not sure what the other hotels in the area could have have provided for at least an extra $100 each night that the Great Southen didn't. Probably just a more comfortable bed which I really don't think is worth the extra $$$. Unless you're one of those people who expect everything to be absolutely perfect and luxurious, stay at the Great Southern!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
