review_477633205~“Love love love this place”~We stayed at Ovolo Laneways hotel over Easter while we were in Melbourne to see a musical and a comedy show. This hotel is so conveniently located to the Princess Theatre, Her Majesty's Theatre and the Comedy Theatre. It's a short walk to the Bourke Street Mall and Chinatown. Very comfortable rooms, lovely toiletries and such friendly and attentive staff. If you book online directly with the hotel you get to enjoy the complimentary Grab and Go breakfast... convenient and delicious. This was our second stay and we will definitely be back next time we are in Melbourne!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477308565~“Comfortable and quiet”~Nice place to stay. Close by to restaurants and within walking distance of Burke St Mall. Went to concert at Rod Laver Arena which is also in walking distance. Car parking easy to find and not too far away. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476653878~“Excellent service, location and staff”~Brilliant hotel in a perfect location in the heart of Melbourne.

review_474622693~“Great location, funky hotel”~Stayed here with the family in Feb 2017. We had both a Two Bedroom Suite and a Terrace Suite. Both were nice rooms but the Terrace Suite was enormous and IMO worth the price of admission. The rooms were super clean, had everything needed for a night in or a longer stay, including a barrel of chupa chups which ensured both of our kids will need a good dentist in a few years time.  From the moment we arrived well in advance of check-in time, we were treated like important customers (our first visit) and our bags were cordially accepted and were then waiting for us in our room when we actually checked in. Perhaps not a huge thing, but nevertheless a relief to not have our 3 large pelican cases full of pro camera gear sitting in the back of the car in a city car park. Parking was included and was only about 200m away. Beds were comfy. Our rooms (406 & 502) were both quiet. Breakfast on the fifth floor and next to our Terrace Suite was plentiful and fresh.  The fridge in our rooms were stocked to the brim with some nice wines, quality beers and more. Not having to pay exorbitant prices (or anything) for a late nice chocolate treat was a nice touch and as a result I think we barely touched any of the free stuff.  But it was an appreciated bonus of staying at Ovolo Laneways.  We went to see The Book of Mormon at Princess Theatre which was a 15 second walk away from the hotel lobby. You can't get a better location if you're seeing a show here. Great location, wonderful staff and wonderful idea for a hotel executed extremely well. We will be back. Thanks Ovolo Laneways for a great stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474570662~“Delightful”~What a find , to be able to wander around all the laneways. Some intriguing shops and lovely coffee venues. Great walking ambiance where one can visit the unique graffiti too. One could linger around these areas for hours.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_472864325~“Quirky boutique hotel”~Ovolo Laneways is a quirky boutique hotel, just next to Chinatown and within easy walking distance to the main areas of downtown Melbourne. Check-in was easy and staff were very helpful, particularly relating to car parking as they don't provide valet parking. Our 'room' was very well equipped with a double bedroom, bathroom and a lounge area with a kitchen and seating area. Everything was included in the cost and we were encouraged to help ourselves to beer/wine/soft drinks at happy hour and nibbles/sweets whenever we wanted, which were readily available in the hotel foyer. Breakfast was buffet-style and there was a varied choice which should accommodate all tastes. Overall, a pleasant hotel with quirky decor (where else can you find artificial grass covering seats?), but it works.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472019509~“Great again! ”~Another smooth and successful stay at the Ovolo in Little Bourke St. Check-in is easy and friendly, and although our room this time was slightly more compact - all the features and 'freebies' made it a great experience at a most reasonable price. Breakfast up on the rooftop is also a great way to finish the stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472003810~“Lovely staff, spartan facilities”~Just spent the weekend. Great location and really helpful staff, but very basic rooms and facilities that make this place far too expensive ie. no bedroom windows or extractor fan in our bathroom, so don't do number twos if ur wife is needs to put on her make up. A real pity. Also dont be fooled by the free minibar and happy hour schtick . There were only 2 beers in our fridge and the happy hour was at reception. The owners need to wake up and stop profiteering.  If ur looking for a sexy Melbourne weekend would recommend The Cullen or one from that chain - more exxy but far classier.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471803411~“Great location and a bit different”~We enjoyed our 2 night stay in a two bedroom suite. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and had everything you could want with very comfortable beds. The only thing I could say about the two bedroom suite (206) was that the sliding door on the bathroom and second bedroom gave absolutely no soundproofing at all. No secrets there. I also was very disappointed that after paying almost $900 for a 2 night stay that we were advised that we would need to pay another $15 each for breakfast. This kind of spoilt what would have been an otherwise perfect stay and after reading that breakfast was included on your website we didn't realise that booking through a broker meant that was excluded.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471739860~“Love the inclusions, wish more Australian hotels would do this!”~Great location near the theatre district, with some great restaurants and wine bars nearby. We had a 1-bed room, which was lovely set up and spacious. What makes this hotel stand out, is that there are no extra fees for things that other hotels often charge extra for. Free Wifi and breakfast (if you book through the hotel), there's a safe in the room that you can use, free mini-bar and loot bag. They have really thought of everything, including travel adapters for those travelling from overseas. Breakfast was great, although no eggs/bacon type of options available, it did have many quality items such as fresh croissants and juices. I did like the grab-and-go option, if you're in a rush you can just grab stuff, put them in provided paper bag and walk off.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471620794~“Great service”~Had an amazing time at Ovolo Laneways Melbourne with my girlfriends for a "girls night out". We had planned to meet at the Hotel and go out for dinner and drinks however when we arrived they had upgraded us to the penthouse and so impressive was this space with it's outstanding amenities, (spa on the outdoor terrace and free champagne!), that we decided we would get takeaway and have a "girls night in". It was perfect. Breakfast in the morning was great too. Staff are super accommodating and friendly, rooms are extremely comfortable, clean and fun. Very convenient part of the city. I will be back. Thanks for looking after us guys!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471067029~“Wonderful surprise”~The staff were very welcoming and helpful. The hotel has a friendly, quirky feel to it. The room was modern, super clean and very comfortable.

I highly recommend this hotel and will stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470585544~“Cool hotel in good area.”~There was nothing particularly wrong with our stay at Ovolo Laneways, we were just expecting a bit more from our experience. After coming from the Ovolo Woolloomooloo in Sydney, this location was a bit of a let down (they have a large pool, huge open lobby, etc). The lobby area is super small and hallways leading to the rooms were really dark. We were expecting a higher end experience, but our room seemed like it could have used a fresh coat of paint and as others have mentioned the bathroom/sink were quite small.  This hotel is in a very good area for easily getting around and staff was very friendly. The free minibar is also a big plus. We did not visit the lobby for happy hour as we had at the Sydney location so I can't speak on that.  If our expectations coming in would have been different I may have rated the hotel higher, it just wasn't what we thought it was going to be and for the price we expected more.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_470208378~“The small bathroom killed the experience”~The room was quite clean and roomy. Good location in the CBD, 3 blocks from Bourke Street, one block from Chinatown. Bed is soft and comfy. Free bottled water, coffee and tea in the lobby. All drinks in the room minibar are free.  Now for the downside: the bathroom is the tiniest I have ever seen, even smaller than in the hotels I've stayed in in Japan! Small for one person, impossible for 2. The sink is about as small as the bowl you rinse with in the dentist's office. Size of bathroom is baffling considering there's so much space in the room. Rooms aren't soundproof, you can hear people talking in the next room. I also like to watch TV in bed and HATED the fact that the TV faced the sofa and you couldn't watch TV in bed. Wouldn't stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469725453~“Fabulous location, great rooms and excellent staff”~Stayed here for the first time this week and it was great. Positive happy vibrant hotel with the staff to top it all off. Free mini bar in the rooms, free wifi, free breakfast when you book through their site, happy hour each night this hotel goes one better than most and at reasonable rates as well. If I had one wish it would be for the hotel to have active agreements with 4 or 5 local restaurants for room service as an option. There are some fabulous places to dine in the area but sometimes all you want is room service. You can use menulog or deliveroo but invariably I found that some restaurants through these types of service have sub standard food and very often mess up the orders.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469706981~“Great location and effortlessly cool”~Probably the best hotel experience I've had in Melbourne. Staff are friendly, approachable and helpful, without too much fuss. There are included extras like a free mini bar, coffee and candy which is a lovely touch that makes the experience even more like home when you're away from home. Relaxing, quiet and such a great location - good for work and leisure. WELL DONE Ovolo, you nailed it.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_469683167~“Good value and large comfortable rooms”~WE booked 2 studio suites which were well sized, with a large couch and platform bed, plus a lovely candy goody bag on arrival. Quiet room, good central location, great price found on booking.com. Only complaint would be small bathroom so no room for a toiletry case on the sink.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469359486~“Good location, nice staff”~The hotel is in a great location - though we used Uber much more than making use of the free tram zone to navigate around the city, the tram station is just right behind the hotel! We had a really good stay at the ovolo laneways - we made a booking in the first place because we know the brand pretty well as it first started out in Hong Kong, and their hotels are known to be quite chic in general. First time staying at the Ovolo, was quite beyond expectation - free minibar, helpful staff who recommended a lot of good places to go (like the weekend market, the restaurant rice paper scissors, etc)  We booked a one bedroom suite and it was very spacious, there was even a microwave. Two adaptors were provided in the room, there were sufficient amenities and even some "souvenirs" such as the loot bag with snacks and a tote bag to take home! If there's one thing negative I have to say about the stay, it must be the sink (and a lot of the other guests would probably agree) because it was so small! But other than that our stay had been really great, and we actually regretted for not booking ovolo in syndey and went for the hyatt regency instead..~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_468223846~“BEST WEEKEND EVER!”~We spent our 16th Wedding anniversary at Ovolo. We had looked at staying at other 'HIGH' end hotels but went with Ovolo as it was recommended by a friend. We were not disappointed - the staff were nothing short of amazing. They could not have done enough to make our stay 'PERFECT'. The locations was fabulous - walking distance to everything. I can't wait to return! On top of the fabulous service there was also all the other 'hidden' extras that other hotels don't offer. Ie breakfast / free wifi / secret loot bag /happy hour and a stocked mini bar that was all included. Thank you once again and see you soon!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_465227068~“The best and cutest little place!”~Came here for a night for my anniversary and we wish we could've stayed longer!  We had the little studio suite and it was so nice! Very modern looking and I love how almost everything is provided for you; drinks (alcohol, juice, water, milk), hair-dryer, shampoo, conditioner, body washes, disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste, tea, coffee and kettle, a little loot bag to take home when you leave or just to snack on the goodies in there during your stay, candy and more drinks down in the lobby... Ah it was just great!  The place looks nice, clean and modern. The staff were very friendly. They were also very helpful and looked very lively. Great atmosphere.  Air conditioning was great, could feel it all over the place. Lots of available power points. Free wifi was great, just gotta get the password from receptionist. Was able to play some games and watch stuff on my devices with ease. Lots of towels provided too, for hand, face and body. Robes were also provided with slippers too :) it was great. All the body washes, shampoo, conditioner etc. are free from parabens, harsh sulfates, mineral oils, synthetic colours and fragrances, animal ingredients and testing. I absolutely LOVED using these products because of these. There were bowls, plates and cutlery too, as well as a bottle opener. Can't really cook in there tho so... Yeah. Useful tho if you get take out. But I wouldn't use it if you can't clean it... Coz there's no kitchenette.  Location is great, short walk from Parliament station. Easily and quickly got to wherever we wanted to go.  The room was small (room 109) but hey, short trip to the bathroom, TV and the mini bar fridge and everything else xD we didn't need that much. Booking through Agoda meant we didnt have access to the free breakfast and stuff but the receptionist told us that if we wanted that stuff to just let them know. We didn't bother tho.  The only problem was the sink. Yes, there's not much space to wash your face or brush your teeth. Not only is the sink very small, but the shelf above it prevents you from hovering your mouth over the sink. It'd probably be easier to just brush your teeth while you shower. Haha There's no real window. But understandable considering we would've just been staring at an ugly building wall. Lol a bit of light shone through in the morning, so at least there was that much. I wasn't too fussed. The sliding door for the bathroom was very loud when moved, had to move it slowly but it wasn't much of a fuss either.  You can hear people leaving their rooms or whenever someone is stomping around. But as for anything else, it was quiet. So those who complained about neighbours either had crap timing or crap neighbours. Lol there also wasn't that much street noise, if any at all, so it was even better!  The bed was so amazingly comfortable! Not just the bed, but the pillows too! Ah, it made our sleep so comfortable and cozy. Pretty good considering it's common to have trouble sleeping in new places.  For what we paid for, it was very good. I'd definitely come back again. Our stay was very enjoyable. ~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_464472966~“Artsy Boutique Hotel @ Great value”~Great service, convenient location, creatively appointed and decorated rooms, and amazing value! If you book through their website directly you receive a whole slew of things for free - free WIFI, free minibar, free booze at happy hour, free breakfast, free snacks, the list goes on and on. Upon check in they even remembered it was my birthday and left a bottle of champagne in the mini fridge and a card on the table. Every detail is thought of - they even had travel adapter plugs in the power sockets. I loved the whimsical and artsy decor, which reflected the spirit of Melbourne perfectly. My husband and I had the studio suite, which was very spacious with a separate area for lounging. The continental breakfast had a great selection, including toast, pastries, cereal, and yogurt and fruit cups in the fridge. There is a great rooftop patio as well so you can watch the city skyline as you eat. Parking is insane in the area so it was great they had the $16 discount deal with Wilson parking a block away. Will definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464443886~“Great location but room quite spartan”~We had stayed at an Ovolo in Hong Kong and really liked it. So decided to give Melbourne one a try. Was down visiting my daughter at Uni. The location is cool - on very nice edge of CBD - walking distance to everything. Great restaurant a stone's throw away including Longrain.  Arrived after overnight flight from Hong Kong a bit early but room not ready - which is fine and understandable. When we got into room around 2 pm I found a few things I did not like. The bed raised up on platform that could have been nice, but the edge of platform was edged with a really cheap metal strip that was ill-fitted with visible screws. Like a DIY job gone wrong. Don't expect that finish in a room costing that much. Also the vinyl flooring has cheap, hospital feel and had been mopped with a product that gave bad smell.  I hated the tiny bathroom with sink the size of 1/4 of a shoebox. No storage or counter space in the bathroom.  Liked the free minibar and the goodie bag. The staff were nice. Breakfast grab and go is OK too. Surprised to see that it won some award as best boutique hotel in Melbourne. Melbourne has a lot better boutique hotels around this price point. Art Series is much better. It is not as good as HK sister hotels. CH~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464027881~“Great Location!”~The Ovolo Laneways was perfect for our family. We had a 2 bedroom suite with a sitting room , dining table and efficiency kitchen.

I would definitely stay here again when visiting Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_463334701~“Quirky”~A luxury boutique hotel in the heart of the theatre district surrounded by some of the city's best restaurants. It is also steps away from the tram line and top shopping district. The rooms are unique. We had a lovely well equipped suite with tons of room. Very comfortable and modern. Easy access to the river and running trails. Free breakfast and happy hour is available if you book directly with the hotel. So best to book directly on their website. Rooms also come with complimentary mini bar and welcome package. We were sorry to leave.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463269340~“Always go the extra mile”~I stay regularly at Ovolo for work and now wouldn't go anywhere else. I brought my 14 yr old with me for the first time and they really made her welcome. There was a card to her in the room along with some free gifts which made her feel really special. They had separated the beds. When I got stuck late at a meeting till after 10pm reception gave me grt advice so I could get her some food she loved the coloured doors and free minibar and breakfast..and clearly the free WiFi was essential to a teen who spent an entire day surfing the net while I worked!! Thank you Ovolo staff..helpful and friendly as always.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The staff were wonderful, really obliging and put a special birthday card and bottles of bubbles in the room for the girls.

review_462352670~“2 Reviews: Great Location With Amazing Penthouse Suite. Awful Double Studio”~My wife and I stayed at the Ovolo for our anniversary. I had booked a Studio Double Suite and then contacted the hotel requesting a high room with a view if possible. I got a response saying congratulation on your upcoming anniversary and we reserved the best view for you. Upon checkin, we went to our small room with a plane size bathroom, ridiculously small sink, a view of the brick building next door and a bed on a platform that just begs you to stub your toe every time you walked by. I went to reception to ask if I got the correct room and Andre at the desk quite rudely said "what, you don't know what room you booked?" I asked about switching rooms as there was no room in the bathroom for my wife to handle her contacts for her eyes. They were booked and I was told to talk to Christina the next day. In the morning, I met Allanah, I didn't connect that she emailed we had the best view from a couple of months earlier when i booked. She sent me up to the top floor to talk to Christina and told me a couple of suites were available. Christina was very nice and showed me the two suites on the top floor. Both were already clean and available. She showed me both rooms and I went with their penthouse suite with a balcony, jacuzzi, pinball machine, 2 bedrooms and bath. Being our anniversary and we were there for 2 days to end our vacation I figured I would splurge and surprise my wife. The room was amazing! Deck was awesome with great views and plenty of room to sit. The jacuzzi needed to be drained as the water didn't smell fresh, even though they sent up maintenance to put in chemicals. The bathrooms were spacious and the showers were hot with great pressure. The maid did an excellent job cleaning as the room was immaculate. We really enjoyed the upgrade but I feel I overpaid based upon reviewing what I booked and the email I received. Since i booked a package, I am not sure of the exact cost of my original room. Still I am glad I upgraded. The location was perfect, too. You could walk to most everything. The free public bus was around the corner. There were plenty of good restaurants just steps away.  Other than Andre, whom even my wife asked what is his problem when we walked by, everyone else were very nice and professional. The staff also arranged our airport transfers. If we stayed in our original room we would not have like it at all.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_461597178~“Comfortable boutique hotel in a great location.”~Located in Little Collins street, this hotel is within walking distance of most theatres and restaurants in the Melbourne CBD. We were in Melbourne for the Boxing Day cricket test and were pleased to find that the MCG was just a 15 minute walk away. Our room was spacious (read 'huge' with two double bedrooms (one with en-suite), a very large lounge/dining kitchen and a huge, comfortably furnished balcony. Breakfast is served in one of the rooms set up for this purpose. The same room is also used for happy hour drinks each evening. The staff were always helpful and polite at all times. All in all a very pleasant stay. We would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_461337937~“Great! ”~My partner went to ridiculous lengths to surprise me with a birthday present and the Ovolo staff went way above and beyond the call of duty to accomodate it, even the manager got on board. Suffice to say the decor in the room had to be changed around and they went along with the surprise and were soooo excited that it all went off without a hitch! Great location, top notch staff and lovely rooms make this a wonderful Hotel in Melbourne!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460237963~“Beware of the airplane bathroom sized sink...”~We were looking forward to staying at this property as we had stayed at the Ovolo 1888 Darling Harbour in Sydney and were very pleased with our stay there. The one positive thing that I can say about Ovolo Laneways is the convenient location. The room that we booked was the studio suite, so it was not the smallest room in the hotel. And actually, the size of the room was fine. However, we were absolutely shocked at the size of the sink when we walked in the bathroom. The sink is the size of an airplane bathroom sink. We kept bumping our heads into the wall when attempting to use the sink to brush our teeth or wash our face. There is absolutely no way to wash your face or brush your teeth without splashing water all over the floor. In addition, there is absolutely very minimal counter space available so I had to walk back and forth from the bathroom to the bedroom for any makeup or toiletry items that I needed. Looking at the floorplan on the door of the room, it does appear that higher room categories might have slightly larger sinks. However, our room already cost over $300 AUD per night, and I would expect a more functional bathroom at this price point. I should not have to pay even more money for an adequate sink size. For this reason, I would not stay at this particular Ovolo property again in the future.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_459887012~“Stylish, convenient and good value CBD hotel - be mindful of Studio rooms without windows!”~Booked a two night stay between Christmas & New Year for a Melbourne "CBD-Break". We booked a basic Studio room-type, but really could not accept the first one offered as it had no external window/view. However, at a request, the second Studio room had an excellent street front view, so much more satisfied. The rooms are simple but well-appointed and give a sense of space despite the relative size. Good large flat TV and comfortable large bed, and small but functional shower-only bathroom. Not much room around the washbasin for toiletries, but can be managed for a short-stay. We unfortunately didn't have time to really partake of the F&B benefits or the hotel facilities, but the upper-floor "cafe/breakfast area" is an interesting concept and suits a variety of purposes/visitors - a good & efficient use of the space. The reception staff were attentive and helpful, and the "discounted carparking fee agreement" with the Bourke Street facility is a huge bonus - an amazing saving! As a base for a CBD stay, the Ovolo offers low-frills-but-funky accommodation in a very good location, without the price-tag of some of the larger but more mundane competitors. It was recommended to us, our stay at the Hong Kong Ovolo operation didn't disappoint, and we would certainly recommend the Laneways hotel to anyone staying in Melbourne's CBD.  Keep up the good work.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_459873203~“Quirky Melbourne Hotel”~Amazing value for an amazing hotel. This is not a 5* fancy hotel but all the little touches make you feel so spoiled that you won't miss the fancy lobby and views that you'd find in other Melbourne hotels.  Great location, near china town. Great rooms with lovely little treats. Would highly recommend this hotel. Really good value for money, would 100% stay again when in Melbourne. Be sure to book directly with the hotel to make the most of all the freebies! This is a great hotel if you want that quirky Melbourne vibe!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_458562237~“Shiny, Happy Stay !”~Stayed twice at this lovely boutique hotel - in a Studio and then a 1 Bedroom Suite. The hotel is well located with many cafe and restaurant options all within easy walking distance. A great base for exploring Melbourne's laneways and the nearby Chinatown. The staff were always friendly and very helpful - allowing us a very late check-out on our day as we had an early evening flight, so we were able to do some last minute shopping, have a leisurely lunch and freshen up back in our room before the trip home. The self serve breakfast was a great option for us, one can choose to sit and enjoy the view on the balcony or take-away for a day of sight seeing. The all included room mini bar (still water, range of Capi sparkling mineral waters, beers, wine) and snacks were a definite bonus ! I would definitely stay here again . Make sure to book direct to ensure you benefit from their "shiny happy extras".~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457800289~“somewhat disappointed ...”~... about my room. I had a Double Studio. It was small and dark. There was no real window only glass blocks. I also had to turn on the light on the sunny day. The sink in the bathroom ist well designed but inconvenient. The rooftop is only accessible at breakfast time. The good things: good located, mini bar is for free, breakfast, happy hour, friendly staff.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~nan
review_456334562~“Super hotel with friendly staff and thoughtful extras”~We found the Ovolo Laneways the perfect hotel for our recent visit to Melbourne, and as a base for attending the Australian Open. We were very impressed with the whole experience, from the warm welcome we received on arrival through to the comfort of the room and the willingness of the staff to help wherever possible. There was a number of thoughtful little extras, such as the complimentary mini bar, the happy hour and 'pick 'n' mix' at Reception and the daily order of play for the tennis. Our highlight, though, was undoubtedly the superb breakfast, served in one of the best rooftop settings in Melbourne! We all agreed that we could have stayed there for considerably longer than the allocated breakfast time each day! All in all, the Ovolo Laneways was an ideal setting in the heart of Melbourne, and one that we would thoroughly recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456326593~“Another great Ovolo hotel”~Booked 6 days in this Melbourne hotel having already done 6 days in 1888 Sydney and once again Ovolo didn't disappoint! Of the 3 hotels I used in Melbourne including here, the Langham & the Larwill Studio (see separate reviews) Laneways was definitely the best. Had a king room on the 4th floor which was basically a suite, a separate sitting area, bedroom & bathroom. All the usual wonderful things you would expect from an Ovolo including great free wifi, the completely free mini bar (replenished daily) a welcome snack pack, top quality toiletries, very comfy bed, super friendly staff etc Breakfast is included (if yummy book direct) a small grab & go offering in one of the 5th floor suites but has toast, fruit, pastries, juice etc, good for something small to get you started and before you go to try one of Melbourne's brilliant places for Brunch Staff as you would expect are super smiley happy people and the location at the top of little bourke street is great, right in theatre land and a short walk down to Chinatown & the CBD in one direction, Carlton & Fitzroy in the other (both well worth checking out for great brunch options, funky bars etc, if you're from London then think Shoreditch) It's hard not to draw comparisons with 1888 but they do stand alone as not being carbon copies of each other, Melbourne is no doubt a little older and perhaps misses the bigger bar area that 1888 has however the rooms are bigger in Melbourne  Definitely where I would stay if I was in Melbourne (or Sydney) again and a group that I will look out for on my future travels, running a boutique hotel myself I know how much work goes into creating such a fun and friendly atmosphere and both hotels have this in spades, I highly recommend them.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456022499~“quirky boutique hotel with terrific staff we will return very soon.”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite whilst attending the AO, We stayed for 7 nights and had a spacious suite. The staff who made up our room each day were very friendly people , without being invasive, the breakfast is "grab and go", we only did that for the first morning, it is what I would call more of a backpackers style breakfast, a little bit too cosy for me personally. The free mini bar was fantastic and generous and the little bag of goodies was a nice touch, you will not be disappointed.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_455780853~“Funky hotel, brilliant service”~I stayed here for 5 nights to attend the AO finals. It's my first stay and it will definitely be my first choice next time. The location is perfect - Chinatown, Flinders Lane, Collins Street - only 5 minutes away. Plus easy 20 minute walk to Rod Laver Arena. I was not happy with my initial room allocation (tip: some rooms don't have windows) but changing was not a problem at all. Breakfast included, free minibar and wifi if you book direct. Most of all, the most helpful and friendliest staff I've encountered in a while.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455525977~“Good location”~We decided to stay at the Ovolo Laneways as we had so enjoyed our stay at Ovolo 1888 in Sydney. Laneways is good, but not as good as 1888. The only room available was a 2 bedroom suite, which was great for our needs as we had a lot of luggage that could go in the extra room. It meant that we had a largish living area and a table to sit down at to eat/work. Breakfast was on the fifth floor, and was 'grab and go' which actually worked out well. Lots of fruit/yogurts/bircher as well as pastries and bread for toasting. Also a good coffee machine. The bathroom was small, but with a good shower and products. Happy Hour in the reception was a bit squashed and awkward with not a great deal of choice. However you do get a free mini bar in your room. We took advantage of the laundry room again, which was a real bonus for us as we are traveling for 3 months!!! Lots of good things about the hotel, I would still highly recommend it - but not as good as 1888!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454818468~“The best little hotel!”~I loved my stay at Ovolo. Super friendly staff and a cool room - with included mini-bar! Loved the Apple TV - got to catch up on some viewing on my own account. The included breakfast was also fantastic- great variety of food. To top it all off, the location is sensational. Amazing restaurants from the minute you step out the door. I will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453749023~“Great stay”~Excellent accommodation and location. 1 BR apartment was beautiful and clean and the facilities and inclusions were outstanding. The flexible checkout was greatly appreciated and made our last day in Melbourne so much more relaxing and enjoyable. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Things like the breakfast variety, good coffee and being able to grab a bottle of water as you walk out the front door were convenient and a cost saving. Can't wait to visit again with my family next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452509135~“Great place to stay”~Ovolo is a funky hotel in a great location, near china town and close to a number of great restaurants and bars. The one bedroom suite was well appointed and spacious. The staff were friendly and always ready to answer questions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452507568~“Another 'F' word....fabulous!”~This hotel is more like a b and b, and all the extras are free! We enjoyed the company of others staying at the hotel while we ate breakfast, loved our goodie bag on arrival along with the free mini-bar, and the laundry facilities were great~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451804509~“Two night stay”~Booked using booking.com a few months prior. Easy with free cancellation checked the week prior to going and found it had dropped the price again yippeee. Cancelled and re booked. Anyway the hotel is well situated, parking is in Wilson parking in Bourke st about a 5 min walk to the hotel. Great reception staff, friendly and helpful. The room was on the 4th floor and it is quiet and cool, not stuffy or hot. You get free mini bar, free lollies and free coffee from reception. Also free wifi which you don't get at more up market hotels in Melbourne. Because we booked using an outside company the free happy hour and breaks was not included but you could pay an extra 15 dollars to have it as well. We didn't as we went out for dinner and also had an early lunch the next day. Overall a great place, friendly staff and a great location for theatre bookings and tram services. Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451292575~“Great concept ”~This is a great concept, you pay one price and everything is included mini bar, great breakfast selections all cold but what a choice and very delicious. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Only issue was the curtains in our room as the windows are a funny angle here d there the curtains did not close properly and I did have the street light directly out the front shine on me all nights. Otherwise would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450100003~“Service & Style”~Experience started with a welcome greeting from the supervisor Andrew. Not only was the check-in process quick and efficient, Andrew assisted with local knowledge and went over and above. The hotel room was very clean and funky, and the location of the Hotel is perfect.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_449738577~“Excellent boutique hotel!”~Lovely hotel, very comfortable bed, room and very clean. Yes, true that the bathroom hand basin was a bit small but it was perfectly manageable. Evening happy hour was great too. Staff at the desk were very helpful and offered me a light self-serve breakfast when I arrived very early in the morning. Great location, easy walk to Chinatown and other parts of the city, trams and restaurants. I recommend getting a room with a window.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_449054977~“fantastic place!”~Stayed there with friends and we had the whole top floor (three rooms) so didn't need to worry so much about noise. The only drawback was the spa - but not the hotels fault - as we were asked to perhaps leave the spa as the hotel/apartments across the road had a problem with the outside lights shining into their bedrooms. Fair call and as mentioned, not Ovolo's fault at all. Adeel was the best guy ever, discreet and would help us with anything that we needed. Lollie bar downstairs is amazing. The only drawback that we really found is that the wine they supplied in the fridge was chardonnay and they didn't have anything different.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_448781273~“Great place to stay”~We enjoyed our stay here. A really comfy bed - nice rooftop bar for the happy hour and great coffee/breakfast selection. Located in a great place in the cbd very near china town and a couple of tram stops. Rice paper scissors was a great restaurant nearby. Only small gripe is despite being on the upper floors we could hear people talking as they walked on the street below and the curtains didn't quite cover the window - wouldn't worry as had eye mask ear plugs etc. But for an expensive hotel felt this wasn't great. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448214358~“First visit”~So we just arrived from a long driver from Sydney, ADEEL greeted us with joy he was very cheerful and welcoming. My husband asked for directions to park the car he pointed the direction very accurately and provided us with a print out as well then he helped me out with my massive luggage really made me forget the long drive and feel relaxed. I feel I will enjoy my stay the rooms look amazing very clean modern and the staff was great considering we arrived very late at night  Thumbs up to ADEEL THANK YOU !!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447932925~“Perfect inner city spot”~Great location for theatre and shopping, small boutique modern hotel. Staff are friendly and v helpful, they free breakfast, wifi,snacks, minibar and movies is the way things should be. Modern streamline interior, comfy beds. We had a 2 bed room suite, the second room doesn't have a window, but it was fine for the kids, nice and dark and they slept late.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_447659899~“One word.....amazing”~Fantastic boutique hotel, great location in the laneways near Chinatown, and 1 minute walk to parliament square tram station which is also in the free tram zone The staff here are amazing super friendly, nothing is too much trouble for them, even left us a Christmas card on Christmas day The rooms were great, with good air conditioning, kitchenette, large screen TV'S a drink apple TV and great free WiFi  Great free laundry facilities which included washing powder and fabric conditioner Grab and go breakfast exceeded our expectations and was lovely, free mini bar which was restocked daily and a free happy hour which was a great chance to socialise with other guests, we loved our stay and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Melbourne  Thanks to the team at Ovolo for a great Christmas~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447641038~“Great value for money ”~Very central location, excellent room and there are so many extras including mini bar, free drinks at happy hour and other fun/great bits & pieces like lolly bags. The grab & go breakfast was delicious too - can't fault the place!!! Parking was cheap nearby (special hotel deal) so all in all it was great value for what we paid and all the inclusions which you certainly don't get anywhere else in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446369338~“Touring Australia”~Loved staying at this hotel. The room was well furnished and clean and the little things have all been thought of, and are complimentary. Good wifi, free mini bar, happy hour (which was a nice social event), laundry facilities. Breakfast was great and provided more than I was expecting, continental style but a good range.  The staff were all super friendly and helpful and provided us with lots of tips for our stay in the city. They also helped us with reservations. The location is also really central.  Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445514450~“Great location”~I stayed here with three friends for a weekend away in two bedroom apartment. This is a top location with lots of great little restaurants and bars nearby. The room was clean and well appointed and the happy hour, mini bar and lolly bar are a great addition. The room was not as big as I thought it would be and one of the rooms was separated from the rest of the apartment with large sliding doors.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan

review_445394628~“Perfect Boutique hotel in Melbourne ”~1st time in Australia, Ovolo laneways couldn't be more perfect! I'm traveling with my teenaged daughter, staying in a one bedroom suite- they separated the (comfy)beds for us, for starters! Rooms equipped w/ snacks & mini fridge, stocked; beer & wine, incl! The Wifi is quick. Free breakfast is plentiful: danish, croissants, Muffins, yogurt & fruit... happy hour is on rooftop w/ good wines & beer, popcorn & cookies. The staff are extremely helpful & actually CARE about you.... willing to go the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable. There's an Ovolo in Sydney too - wish I'd known this before booking my Syd stay- I hear that too is stellar~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444363729~“boutique of hit and miss”~stayed for a week. well located near chinatown, trams, and plenty of restaurants. that sort of makes up for the lack of room service. not much views. rooms were well laid out, bathroom had plenty of hot water, wifi was fast. the quirky minimalistic aesthetic of the rooms is beginning to wear out: one of the rooms i stayed in has a carpet so dirty i first thought it was a pattern. first room had a sewer smell and non-functioning air conditioner. in what i'm sure was a well-meaning attempt, the a/c repairman stormed my room with their own key while i was in the bathroom. was moved to another room after a few nights. understandable that they couldn't move me the first night, as it's a small place with only so many rooms. but what i don't understand why they sell a room with sewer smell and broken a/c in the first place, especially as i assume they are trying to not come across as a cheap and cheerful sort of hotel. however: knowing how difficult it is to find nice rooms in melbourne cbd (choose between stuffy old dinosaurs, douchebaggery, and 'boutiques' like this), i'm likely to consider Ovolo again.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_443437210~“Great location !”~Picked this hotel from Trip Advsior comments.  Only room available was Studio. Quite small,but well laid out. Only complaint was very small bathroom hand basin.  Enjoyed location and room extras , rooms were clean and staff were great !~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_443192490~“Fantastic”~I booked to stay at this hotel as a treat to myself after travelling aus for 3 weeks & I'm so glad I did! Firstly my room was HUGE, so big in fact I thought I'd been upgraded (I hadn't it turns out) & had all the mod cons you could possibly need or want. I loved all the freebies which gave the hotel a quirky edge & really enjoyed how breakfast was set out in an informal way so you're able to mingle with other guests. My only negative would be how bags are looked after once you check out. I had a late flight so the hotel kindly offered to hold my bags throughout the day, but I noticed these were all just left by reception in the open which wasn't the most secure. Overall though I loved my stay & thought all the staff were great & really liked how they came across more 'friend like' rather than hotel worker to guest. I'd not hesitate in recommending the hotel & would love to return one day!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443042608~“Stunning”~Amazing hotel,it's totally new style of hospitality.lovely warm decor,modern. The room feel like some kind of Scandinavian style & definitely for regular travelers this hotel will refresh and remind you of all your past trips(don't know why)!! Importantly it's the only hotel I been to they offer you more than they ask as from the mini bar to the breakfast are COMPLEMENTARY and who's don't love that word . ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442740557~“Pleasant and Central”~Stayed here twice. The rooms are clean and pleasant well laid out. The staff were great. Its very well located with lots of restaurants very close. As another reviewer there are many small nice touches which make it a cared for hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442488622~“Fabulous stay in Melbourne”~Great boutique hotel with lots of little touches that made it a fantastic place to stay. Our room was stylish and very comfortable. Loved the "loot bag" on arrival and complimentary mini-bar stocked up daily and water bottles available whenever you wanted them. Good quality toiletries. Apple TV, iPod docking station and free WiFi etc were part of the norm. We had breakfast included in the price. This was so good and such good value for money. Good quality bircher muesli, yoghurts, pastries (bad for the waistline!) and more. Nespresso coffee and teas available for breakfast and in the lobby area. And, did I mention the staff? Helpful, friendly and nothing was too much for them. Always service with a smile. This is the quality all hotels should be striving for. The hotel is also conveniently located close to the (free) tram service into the City, Docklands and St Kilda area. It is on the edge of Chinatown, close to the theatre district and within an easy walk to great eateries and shopping including the famous laneways.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_442281492~“Melbourne Visit”~It's our first time at Laneways, it did not disappoint, they could not have been nicer, the staff was great, very friendly, happy people, they were very accommodating & helpful, on our last day there we had a very late flight out of Melbourne, they extended our room stay till midday, they then stored our luggage while we did our last bit of sightseeing, on our return they put us in room 501 to sort out our luggage we were offered drinks & even a shower if we needed one, would recommend them to anyone, it was a great & relaxing stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441846052~“Delightful stay”~Just had three delightful nights at Ovolo. The location is fantastic walking distance to some great spots in Melbourne. Staff extremly friendly and helpful. We had a small issue with our room not being serviced due to a miscommunication, the hotel staff were so apologetic and certainly went out of their way to make up for it. . A really nice vide with quirky freeby drinks and nibbles. I would totally recommed a stay at Ovolo.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_441792151~“Location location location”~After staying at the ovolo Woolloomooloo I was very excited to find one in Melbourne and couldn't wait to go. I must say upon arrival to find out no room service, restaurant or bar was a bit of a shock. When entering the room I was still a little under whelmed. However the staff make this hotel, they couldn not have been more friendly or helpful, and also explained the plans for a room on the top floor currently used for happy hour and breakfast to be turned into a small eatery The location is great, bars, restaurants, theatres and shopping all day walking distance. I would start again however I think the it would be better advertised as serviced apartments then hotel.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_440985122~“Can't return soon enough!”~The Ovolo Laneways was an excellent beginning to our Australian vacation. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a wonderful location--near the free tram and close to many good restaurants. Our room was clean and nicely furnished. The amenities included free bottled water. Overall we were extremely pleased with our stay. Since nothing is perfect, I'll share my only complaint. The bathroom had the smallest sink and it's close to the wall. I shaved there once and realized why there was a mirror in the shower. However, I viewed it more as a humorous quirk than a big issue. I saw someone gave a bad review because of difficulties brushing her teeth using the small sink. To them I would say: improve your aim when spitting and lighten up. My wife and I would return to the Ovolo anytime we make it back to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_440255215~“OMG 2 - Blue door surprise!”~We were recommended to stay in this hotel from a friend in the travel business, and this recommendation did not disappoint. We managed to book a suite on the top floor that catered for 4 adults with an ensuite from the master bedroom and large terrace. Modern styling with lovely extras including a handheld Nintendo wii and large tv. "Loot bags" were provided on the bench on arrival that has delicious little treats enjoy, and the fridge was amply stocked with wines, beers and soft drinks. A selection of T2 was available to enjoy. Breakfast was included to be enjoyed on the top floor, although the selection was mainly pastries and breads.  Overall, very pricey but lots of inclusions that make it worth while. The reception staff were approachable, friendly and very helpful. Happy to recommend this hotel tl friends looking for a truly Melbourne experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440002255~“Best place!”~Sadly only 1 night & we leave this morning, but we will return! Service by reception brilliant & the young man sent us to Cumulus where we had the best breakfast. Room was great & yes the sink in the bathroom is small but who cares when everything else is great. Free mini bar fully stocked plus a goody bag plus free lollies in reception plus free brekky!!!! We are a couple of oldies who have travelled the world extensively but this place put a smile on our faces. Location is perfect within walking distance to most sights!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439866562~“Upmarket hostel”~So, I fell in love with ovolo following a stay at the 1888 in Sydney. In fact that stay made me book laneways in Melbourne, which I don't regret at all. However not all ovolo's are equal. Laneways is in a good location, just on the edge of the CBD near chinatown, easily walkable to anywhere in the CBD and tram around the corner. We stayed in a studio suite, which was large enough, and looks just like the pictures.  The air con across the building is loud and you hear street noise etc and the windows are single glazed. Also the noise between rooms can be pretty loud, comments that are made in other reviews. The breakfast is as described 'grab and good', which consists of toast, pastries and yoghurts mainly. You get the trademark freebies in the room too. Happy hour was good, offering a selection of drinks, but takes place in one of the terrace rooms. Staff were helpful and on the whole friendly, apart from one, who didn't seem to embrace the ovolo spirit at the drinks. Staff leant us myki cards which was good. This ovolo felt more like an upmarket hostel rather than an hotel, and not sure it was worth the hotel rate. The hotel is pretty small, with left bags in hallway of lobby etc. I would book ovolo again, as I said fell in love with it, but maybe not laneways.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439634864~“Nice staycation hotel - will be back”~I stopped here between a work hotel stay and a holiday. What a great boutique hotel (you may note in my feed that I like boutique hotels) and in a location that enables you to experience the joys of Melbourne CBD without enduring the volume of people. Things to love: the free minibar, the nightly drinks, the lollies at reception, the decent sized lounge in your room that you can lie on and relax Unexpected bonus: since there is no room service, they instead provide plates and cutlery so you can get anything from the surrounding restaurants (lots of them) or delivery service, and eat with some sense of decorum.  Interesting: Bathroom size - not sure I have ever experienced such a small bathroom, however everything is there and usable.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_438502391~“Fantastic Boutique Hotel”~We stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoyed our stay.  The complimentary mini bar was a nice touch, and the amenities were excellent.

review_436691178~“Free...free....free”~Never have I been to a hotel with free mini bar. It felt weird just helping yourself. Then I'm informed by the happy staff that there is a free happy hour .....what more freebies. Our hostess with the mostest Alanna did a wonderful job ensuring my beer was flowing. Made it a great start to my evening Free break next morning was to die for. For a short stay it's the best....happiest place I've been to in a long time. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436678035~“Could be very good But......”~I really like this concept. Once you're there most everything is free. Free lolly bar at reception, free soft drinks, water, juice, coffee all day, free mini bar in room, free wifi, free continental grab and go breakfast. All sounds good and in fact delivers. The hotel itself is a small, on trend, yet kitschy hotel in Little Bourke which is positioned ok but a little awkward for business. Reception is tiny but staff were friendly.  I was upgraded to the 2 bedroom suite which was spacious and had everything you'd need with that quirky, modern twist.  The bed was comfortable and inclusions great. So if my experience ended here, this would really be a 4-5 rating job. However while winding down at about 1030 from a late flight in from Brisbane, I hear a knocking at my door. As I open I see an Indian gentleman dressed in a suit whom I assume is a hotel staff member. He blurts out "we have had a complaint about the noise from your tv." No introduction. No niceties. Now I never have my tv loud and am always very conscious of my neighbours in hotels so I found this offensive. I asked him whether he thought the volume was loud, as it was on and obviously he'd be able to hear. His answer - no. I asked whether he thought the volume was unreasonable? His answer - no but put it down please. I was confused. Mind you it was only on 12. If nothing was loud or unreasonable why bother me? I repeated my questions to make sure we were on the same page and he agreed again but again told me to consider putting it down. Why? Why not call the room who complained and just say you checked and think it is reasonable. Why not tell me once he checked, which of itself I would have been fine with, that sorry to disturb but it seems fine? He just had no idea about hotel etiquette. Who was this guy anyway? He never told me and I found his demeanour quite irritating. Once back in Sydney I typed an email to the hotel ceo as a sign at reception asks you to do. We kept missing each other but I was called and emailed apologising and offering to upgrade me next time. They obviously do care because the response was quick and heart felt. But I'm just not convinced whether I'll be back. I really hate places in the upper tiers that don't have the basics of service delivery down like introducing yourself and acknowledging their errors and ruining a good evening and hence your stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436059495~“EXCEPTIONAL STANDARDS”~I stayed several nights at Ovolos Laneways and although I made bookings on a day to day basis, sometimes stumbling in during the middle of the night, the staff were exceptional. I travel and stay at 5 star hotels around the world for a living and the staff here are by far the best I have ever come across. The small boutiques style makes you feel at home and the rooms are clean and well lit and provide you with all the up to date necessities, having the open mini bar is just a bonus. Apple TV, is a great touch and the location is perfect, being in Chinatown and walking distance to all my fav local spots. I can't speak highly enough of the staff here, their attention to detail, their flair that makes you feel welcome, their humour and their pure presence makes it for an even better stay than you could imagine. Being contactable 24 hours at such a small hotel is fantastic and they will always try to accommodate your needs and if unable to will always contact you and keep you informed with the progress. Will ALWAYS stay here when I have short stays in Melbourne from now on. Thanks OVOLOS.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_434955131~“Dirty weekend away”~This is our second stay at an Ovolo property and again we are pleasantly surprised. The staff are amazing and our upgrade to a 2 bedroom apartment have us a little more space. Close to shops, dining, laneways and trams stops. It's an ideal place to stay. The quirkiness just ads to the stay. I love the lollie buffet and list of inclusions you receive!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434404006~“Great location and superb service!”~I love staying at boutique hotels over the big fancy ones and Ovolo Laneways was the first one I have stayed out at of the Ovolo range of hotels. I will now always try to stay at one in the future - Laneways was a great experience and the staff are excellent! All the free extras are fantastic - breakfast, self laundry, mini bar and happy hour. What's not to love!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_433808867~“Go to Hotel when in Melbourne”~I am definitely too busy to write reviews and esp. a second review...But here I am at the Ovolo for the umpteenth time. I Keep coming back because they are a little different, ultimately the staff make the difference. This isn't a five star vanilla brand in a large luxury building - all of which I could stay at. But it is a high value, slightly quirky boutique hotel, where all the staff seem pleasantly engaged. The rooms vary from small to penthouse - have stayed in them all, they are all good value, clean and well appointed, they are a bit minimalist meets modern but maybe I am just used to a lot more soft furnishings. I have had visitors from the US stay here and they also enjoyed it. Ok it's a gushing review, but I find it just delivers, I am a fussy business traveller.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_433441421~“Great little getaway”~My partner and I love to stay here. We've stayed 3 times this year alone! It has free wifi, mini bar, in room snacks, to go breakfast and even a happy hour! Although they do not offer room service there are hundreds of surrounding restaurants and hot spots to go to!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_432757066~“Not as Good”~Unfortunately this place has gone the way of many,'resting on its laurals'. This time it seemed a bit tired and rundown, it still has a funky feel on arriving, nice reception staff, but the room this time was small badly arranged dirty, and need a few repairs. I have to agree with other viewers about the bathroom(studio suite) ridiculously small , my husband couldn't even shave properly in it, and brushing your teeth required precision to get it in the bowl! So awkward, It was also disappointing to come back after 3 in the afternoon and still not have the room done, even though we had the sign on, I think we only just caught them before they left, head of housekeeping a bit gruff too when asking anything. I don't think we will return as other places offer more for less. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432575844~“Great place for a weekend in Melbourne ”~From the warm welcome we received on arrival through to our departure our experience at the Ovolo Laneways Melbourne was first class. This boutique hotel right in the middle of the theatre district really hit the mark with its balance of quirkiness and inclusions. We stayed in a studio suite which provided a separate 'downstairs' lounge. The inclusions like free fast wi-fi and free mini bar really add to the laid back experience. Did I mention the free pastries, coffee and lollies in the lobby? If you're looking to spend a night or weekend in Melbourne you really should consider this place!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432014973~“Great location but very little room to move”~The staff were wonderful, the location great but you couldnt get a smaller room if you tried. There were no windows and barely room to move. The bathroom was so crammed that it was almost impossible to even clean your teeth in the basin. The shower seemed to be the best option. Be careful what you book the studio rooms are far to small for comfort.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~4~5~nan
review_431690633~“An otherwise nice hotel with an annoying oddity”~This this a nice, well-located hotel that quite stylish and is good value. It just has one thing that annoys me. In the layout of some of the rooms you cannot see the TV from the bed. I would have thought this was hotel room design 101. This is only the case in some rooms though.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
