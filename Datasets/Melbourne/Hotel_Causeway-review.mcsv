review_473471823~“Just OK”~I would describe this a basic business level hotel. The furnishings in general were ok, but not great, space was ok (not too cramped). Bathroom was relatively newly renovated, but the shower in bath thing always gives the game away on age. The shower fitting above the bath was broken and spraying water everywhere. Room temperature control was ok.  The place had only 2 hrs per day of free wifi, after that it was charged.  Check in and out were not as smooth as they should have been. No queues, but slow process in general, and "system not working" grumbles from staff.  I didn't try the breakfast that was available (breakfast room right outside my room!), but at least it was on offer.  Great location, as others have said. Overall, for me, this was just ok.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469081291~“Good location but otherwise absolute rubbish”~Normally when a hotel advertises it's heritage you think of a nicely well kept facility. Hotel causeway boasts completely rundown facilities that will take you on such a nice time warp that you will appreciate what 50 years of neglect to a building can do. From the moment you walk into the facility the overcoming smell of mould will welcome you, then take a nice stroll to your apartment via a corridor where the mould is so bad that in the corners you no carpet remains (hint: it can only be from mould if it's in an area that people dont walk). Then finally when you feel like you have endured enough - you enter your apartment.... Don't do it, walk back to reception, demand your money back and check in somewhere else.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468720653~“Badly run down”~Having booked on line to take interstate visitors we were so dissapointed. Rooms were exceptionally run down Curtains hanging unable to close having lost hooks. Carpets and furniture badly stained and worn. Skirting board hanging off. I could go on but won't.  Actually rate this hotel beyond one it's just that i could not alter the rating. We did not stay after viewing the room. We had to pay an amount even though all we did was look at room and then leave.  Unsure what this amout was for other than it being underhanded. We checked out and walked through the arcade to The Novotel which was exceptionally cheaper and amazing. No comparison what so ever. The excuse we were given for the room being so sub standard was that the building is heritage listed. Well it may well be but in my eyes things can still be clean.  Our money was eventually refunded less the amout paid for us having held the key for 5 mins. All i can say is do your homework so many other cheaper wonderful hotels within walking distance. This hotel is beyond backpackers standard  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467446492~“Okay if all you want is a bed - couldn't offer an experience stay”~Described as boutique, I’d probably add shabby to their description. Fantastic location, I was there for business, so didn’t do much exploring but you definitely in the heart of it all. The room disappointed a bit and given the building and sleek side door entrance you could have expected more. Staff were nice, breakfast disappointing. In summary, if you want a central location and bed only – go for it. If you want more from your room, look elsewhere. (oh and really slow internet)~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_467056796~“Don't expect to get your room before 2 pm”~Booked in to this hotel ,travelled 4 hours by train to get there and find you can't be in your room before 2 pm . I arrive at 11 am .So I went and did some shopping had some thing to drink returned as I needed the bathroom . I was given a key to a second floor toilet , first impressions are not good hallways are oppressively hot with dark brown carpet if I hadn't already paid by credit card I think I might have left and cancelled by stay .im waiting for my trip to begin but want to freshen up .~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463779876~“Location, location - just location”~A neat tidy hotel located in the centre of Melbourne. If you want to do the full Melbourne laneways dinning, hipster thing the hotel is as central as it gets. Everything is at your doorstep. Good thing too as it doesn't have anything else to offer. Our room was adequate a comfortable bed but not much more. It did have a odd single lounge / fold out bed. The bathroom was compact with the smallest shower I have ever used (and I've been on cruise ships). They advertise having Foxtel but it's only 3 channels - not a good option given it won't be either the NRL or AFL dedicated channels nor the movie ones. I could write about the other ammenities but there aren't any. The rooms are clean in a dull corporate grey coloured scheme loved by airport hotels the world over, a bit dated but then there isn't much to keep you there. My recommendation enjoy the hipster attractions and come back just to sleep.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_457775235~“Perfect location for booklovers! ”~Well, it's tucked away in the heart of the cbd, and if you turn left out of the hotel's sliding door, you'll find the entrance to an arcade. Through the doors and on the below ground level, you'll find one bookish nirvana... a large dymocks that greedily consumes the entire floor. Upstairs is British treats from home, but that's another matter reserved for sugaholics. If you turn right out of the hotel and up over Swanston to Russell, you'll find the gorgeous Theosophical Society bookshop where you can ponder the chakra below your navel... and 7 mins along Russell towards central station, you'll find Embiggen books, a cave of adventure. There's more, but that the golden triangle for us. Now the hotel... Neat, the gym upstairs is useful, don't bother with the continental breakfast for $18, you can get coffee and a toastie for $6 if you turn left and go into the first little arcade. You're also near the impressively cheap Hari Krishna restaurant on Swanston, where you can feed 2 for $12....yes, right... Back to the hotel... Worth the stay. The only complaint we have is the fact that there are soft silly pillows with no choice of supportive firmer ones. Other than that, splendid.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454531791~“Clean, Tidy City Centre Hotel”~As we were on a package deal, our room was one of the smaller, economy, ones. The hotel has seen quite a few years of service and this shows in the decoration. Everything was clean and tidy, but getting to the stage where a major refurbishment is required. Staff were friendly and helpful, in true Aussie style. Breakfast was acceptable, but nothing special.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_449459375~“One night, midweek”~Fantastic location, so central to all things Melbourne CBD.  We stayed one night in a junior room to attend an event at Melbourne Town Hall (2 minutes walk from the hotel.)  Our room was small but clean, a little outdated but had everything we needed.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was very nice.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445990864~“Great Location but....”~This hotel is in a Fantastic location. However it needs to be as it has very little else going for it. We stayed when it was an almost booked out city with concerts and sporting events on and it was one of the last rooms in a central spot we could find.  It was extremely overpriced for what it was but I think it must have been from the demand. We paid $450 for the room but I would definitely not pay that if there were choices available.  It was not dirty, but you could not help thinking it was somehow not clean either. It just seems very tired and needs a real makeover!~3~1~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_445597208~“Nice Room, Nice Servic”~Our room was well equipped, everything worked and was in good condition.  The staff we met at this hotel were brilliant - thank you to everyone. Well done! I mistakenly thought they had charged me twice for the room (forgot I went to the cash machine!) so emailed them and got a friendly response explaining this within an hour so again great service.  Cannot fault it at all. Comfy rooms, great price, right in the middle of Melbourne~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445456126~“Dirty and tired looking”~This hotel was dirty and dingy, the bathroom was filthy with scum around the bath and the tiles were covered in mould.The shower hot water tap fell off and the toilet roll holder also fell off the wall. The walls were all scuffed and the carpet badly stained. There was no sign on the door warning guests that there were two steps up immediately on opening the door to the room and I fell heavily with a large suitcase bruising my arm. I asked the hotel staff for an incident report form and was met with a blank stare. I sent photos of the bruises on my arm along with photos of the broken tap and toilet roll holder and the dirty bathroom, to the email address provided by reception staff, and to date I have not even had an acknowledgement of the email or an apology. I am disgusted.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_443446292~“Very central but very tired”~Our overseas friends had been booked into this hotel by their travel agent and as we were spending the weekend with them, we decided to stay at the same hotel. It would not have been our choice as we have stayed many times in Melbourne. The hotel was very old fashioned but not quaint old fashioned just old and tired. The doors to our bathroom needed a good clean with detergent. The linen was all clean and the bed very comfortable. It was very central for shopping and the theatre but there is no parking and we had to carry our bags down down an arcade to the hotel entrance. It was quite busy during our stay so I assume the room we were booked in to was possibly the only one free. It was a spa suite with a very big spa bath in the bathroom with a shower over it. Staying just one night we did not have time to use the spa bath but the shower was over the bath and was very tricky getting in and out. I felt it was very over priced for the quality of the room.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_435184970~“Huge dissapointment, very dirty and run down hotel”~I joined my husband on a business trip to Melbourne and we do stay in hotels around the world frequently. Usually i don't take the time to write a review, unless it's so disappointing that you really want to prevent other travelers to do the same "mistake" or to rave about a great find, in this case it was unfortunately the first one. This was by far one of the most run-down and dirty hotel's we even stayed in. For 580 AD (3 nights), I expect at least a clean, refurbished room and free Wifi (you only get 2 hours per ROOM!! per day, that means on a business trip you will not be able to "connect" two devices at the same time. After 2 hours (stop surfing doesn't stop the 2 hours, so once you logged in after 2 h, you need to pay). But back to the room: apart from the fact that the room seemed not to be taken care of for the last years (see pictures: dirty walls, stains in carpet, big (blood?) stains in the curtain and really old, run-down furniture), it was simply not clean. I stayed in youth hostels for 20 bucks a night and rooms were better taken care of. There were hairs everywhere, a dirty carpet, dirty blanket, etc...  As we arrived very late in the night and were very tired we still decided to stay in bed and go to the reception the next morning to complain and were promised the room would be cleaned up (obviously not refurbished) but apart from the bed, nothing changed and the carpet and bathroom remained dirty, neither did the stained blanket get exchanged. Although staff was friendly, they don't really seem to care or management is bad. My husband and me both had itchy skin the next morning. Can’t say there was really something in the sheets but if you sleep in stained linen with different hair, it simply doesn’t make you feel good. Reading some of the reviews now on tripadvisor, it's clear that the hotel management knows about those serious problems with cleanliness and that rooms urgently need to be refurbished, but simply doesn't do anything about it. I saw some other rooms where the door was open and they had the same issues. I worked in the hospitality industry for years and it's so disappointing to see management neglecting to improve a bad service/take care for their property. Breakfast was included and is the most simple version of continental you could get and very basic and cheap quality (plastic cheese, cheap ham, unripe fruit). Coffee was ok though. If this would have been a cheap place/hostel we might have given a slightly better rating but for a 4 star Hotel and over 170 AUD/night we clearly expect something better.  Please, please improve your service to your guests! We felt that the value for money is really bad. But even if the room wouldn't have been expensive, you'd expect at least a clean room. Seriously hope the management will undertake some immediate and refurbish at the Causeway very soon as the location is good.~1~2~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan

review_428597904~“Old- you get what you pay for”~I have 3 simple things that I feel all hotels should have, regardless of price / star rating 1) a correctly set clock 2) constant shower pressure and temperature 3) a noiseless fridge Hotel causeway passed the first and failed miserably on the final two. This is a cheap basic hotel. Crappy old fittings, stained carpet, no free wifi, dirty sheets. I forgive these things for the price, but when the fridge is so noisy I need to unplug it, and I have a shower and it alternates between burning and freezing with no change to the taps... That is where I draw the line. In addition, dirty mirror, skrim blinds on only half of the windows ... I could go on... No won't be back. Photos attached show the stains, fittings and dirty sheets.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428003809~“Hotel Causeway Experience”~We loved the accommodation at Hotel Causeway! The room was large and clean and comfortable. The location was perfect with everything we wanted in close proximity to the Hotel or a tram ride away. Highly recommend Hotel Causeway!~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_427087503~“Outdated and old rooms with unfriendly staff”~Unfortunately the rooms were old and very much in need of renovation (old carpet, swelling from moisture on bathroom door, noisy lifts), the pictures certainly didn't match the room we got. We could have put this aside except then we had a very bad experience with staff! A cash deposit was asked for on check it and given and then on check out when we asked for the deposit back we were told in a very rude tone by the man at the front desk that it went on the credit card and no one asks for cash. When we disputed this and said that yes, one of the staff members on arrival asked for a cash deposit, the staff member ignored us. He didn't seem shocked or cared and his first reaction was to say no that we were wrong and then ignore. How could we be wrong about handing $50 cash deposit over? Surely if a guest at a hotel said this to you if you worked on a front desk, the first response would be of shock and concern. When I said again that we gave a cash deposit to a staff member (and I said the staff members name), the man at the front desk just ignored me. I said that this is terrible service and we would write a bad review, his response was 'Good, do it.'  Regardless of the mix up (or quite possibly a scam using the cash deposit) it's really disappointing to see front of staff with such a bad attitude to paying guests and I certainly won't be recommending this place. And we'll certainly be following this up with the hotel.~2~3~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_425750782~“Central location, very comfortable, friendly staff.”~The location of Hotel Causeway could not be beaten. So central to all the shopping arcades, restaurants, and entertainment. All witching easy walking distance. Positioned up a very quiet lane way, and we were on the 5th floor away from the elevator and could not hear any street noise or hotel noise. The breakfast was included in the price, and was everything we needed - three different types of bread for toast, pastries, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, and sliced meats and cheese. Fresh juice, and the usual breakfast hot drinks. More than adequate.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating - even before we checked in, they stored our luggage while we explored, and the booking staff answered and fulfilled numerous requests prior to our check in.  Security was excellent - we felt safe in the hotel at all times. Decor was a little tired, but so is the decor in my home, so who am I to judge? Room was very clean and serviced daily, and beds incredibly comfortable. The complimentary robes and slippers a nice touch.  All in all, a very pleasant and enjoyable stay, in a very competitively priced friendly hotel, in an excellent location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425713067~“Good sized rooms in a great location”~Hands down the best thing about Hotel Causeway is the location - close to Bourke Street Mall and Flinders Street but tucked away enough to avoid most of the noise and congestion. It's also close to a variety of useful tram stops for visitors and easy to get to and from the airport via Skybus from Southern Cross Station. The rooms are generally a very good size for the price. The quality of the rooms themselves can vary though, depending on location within the hotel and, I imagine, the price paid. This was our second visit to Hotel Causeway and there was a noticeable difference in the quality of this room compared to our previous room. That said, we had booked only a few weeks before and we were staying over the AFL Grand Final long weekend, when hotel prices are at a serious premium. This visit we were a bit apprehensive at having been placed right next to the breakfast room but, fortunately, the glass partition was enough to keep the noise down in the mornings. On the whole, the rooms are well-appointed and in decent condition, even if there have been some dubious design choices - such as the strange basins in the bathroom that see water go everywhere when you try to wash your face. However, little things like not being able to easily shut the bathroom door because it catches on the floor or not being able to maintain a steady temperature in the shower, while mildly annoying, are not enough to detract from the hotel's positives. Breakfast was fairly basic but satisfactory given it was included in our room rate. The staff were very friendly and helpful, as they had been on our previous visit. The hotel is happy to store baggage before check in and after check out, which is a definite bonus for those of us who arrive on early flights and depart on late flights. I would definitely recommend Hotel Causeway as a value for money option, given the overall size and standard of the rooms and its location.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

The Location is wonderful...literally within 10's of metres of a number of the laneways and arcades....accessing great cafes and restaurants, quirky shops.

review_410305746~“Good location - some weaknesses”~The Causeway is one of three properties with similar names in the Melbourne CBD - easy to confuse them (as one woman did while we were checking in) but they aren't too far apart. The rooms are a reasonable size and quiet at night. Comfortable beds, good bathrooms and clean. The staff are friendly and welcoming. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, preferring to wander off to an excellent little cafe in a nearby arcade. The hotel is over the road from David Jones and right in the middle of the main shopping precinct and near many excellent restaurants. My biggest gripe is that wifi was free only in one block of two hours then charged out - this is unacceptable today! Every property should be offering free wifi - in Romania recently even b & b's and roadside service stations offered free wifi as did every hotel in which I stayed - when will we behave like the rest of the world?~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_405945464~“Not what we expected !! ”~My partner and I stayed here for two nights in the executive spa suit.. The spa was that old and dirty we couldn't have a spa bath at all. The water was up and down took ages to get it right then bang either cold or hot again. The mini bar was dirty inside, the drinks in it were warm .The skirting boards & walls were all rotting and in terrible condition.. The elevator had a horrible shake to it especially wen it stopped, had to watch our step as we were getting in and out as there is a un even gap.. The only two things we can honestly say good about this place is it was in a great location and the bed was extra comfy..The ethnic reception lady was rude when we arrived, the two ethnic male receptionist where absolutely great very helpful and friendly could not be any happier with there service & the Australian reception lady on our last day didn't have a clue on what was where in Melbourne to assist us in finding what we were looking for.. All in all we won't be staying here again, we will be making sure next time we travel to Melbourne that the pictures shown on the hotel site are what we will be getting & paying for.. Looks are deceiving here.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_402330255~“Location Location”~The reason to choose this hotel will be because of it's location to the shopping district. If you want to walk to all the places of interest within the CBD - not just shopping - but so many other attractions and restaurants, this small hotel will suit. Be aware that there are 3 hotels in this chain, all with similar names, which can cause confusion, so if requesting a bus/taxi, be very specific about the location/address (don't just use the hotel name - it's not enough).  The rooms may not be the most up-to-date, but the one we stayed in was clean and practical. Bathroom was similar - clean, with all the key amenities, but could in future, do with a bit more modernizing. The shower within the bath could be an issue depending on your age. Some of the furniture looks tired and a bit rundown. The hallways and Reception area could also do with a facelift just to make them more visually appealing. WIfi is free for 2 continuous hours only. After that 2 hour block, you pay. Not ideal. We did not eat the breakfast, because there are plenty of eateries nearby, and these will offer more variety and no doubt be tastier than any hotel breakfast. There are some lovely arcades near the hotel on Little Collins St that are open 7 days a week, and spend your money at those. Also David Jones is just across the road, and they have a cafe there too. On a Sunday morning, there were many breakfast options in the CBD, so don't feel you need to eat a hotel breakfast.  It's quiet, despite being in the heart of the city. Trams are all minutes away, if you need public transport. In terms of location, this really can't be beaten! I have stayed in hotels in Bourke Street, where the noise has been a bit much at night, but here, we heard nothing on a Saturday night.  Despite the hotel being a little neglected looking internally, we could overlook that as we were out all day. We would stay there again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_402232813~“Great location but......”~This hotel needs some serious refurbishment. Carpets, walls, upholstery all stained. The staff are great, friendly and courteous.

review_402016715~“Nightmare on Little Collins Street.”~Pros: Fantastic location right in the heart of the CBD, Friendly staff....Unfortunately that's were it ends. Cons: Elevator door closes on you and there is a 6inch gap between floor and lift so you fall in and out of it, "continental breakfast" exists of toast, packet ham, plastic cheese, budget orange juice. (This was by far the worst breakfast I have ever eaten, we even skipped it the 2nd morning..and they have the cheek to charge $18- for it) Rooms are mouldy and chairs have "white stains" on them. Skirting boards are swollen from water damage. Shower takes 5-10mins to get to an acceptable temperature and even then gives you hot and cold blasts. Dirty cups weren't replaced and room service clearly don't vacuum as we had toe nail clippings on the floor. Air con only works on heat, the cooling didn't work. Room extremely noisey on a weekend, as the hotel is positioned right next to a noisey bar. For the price please stay somewhere else! ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401907364~“It it what it is - Great if you like foggy mirrors and dooners without covers”~We were quite excited about the location on little Collins, right near the restaurants and venues we planned to enjoy and at almost $200 a night we thought we knew what to expect - more than likely if your reading this you know we get around and like to have a good time in all shapes and price models :-) from camping under the stars to exclusive resorts. As we walked through the glass entry doors to the checkin desk we were still on a high - a few days off work, in a new city hip-hip-hooray! Alas not a dirty weekend this time around, more a party of late night catch up with mates we don’t see often enough, Trish wanted to show of her winter coat and Melbourne certainly provides the catwalk. The guy at the desk was lovely, polite, and checked us in within a few minutes. I had SPECIFICALLY chosen this hotel by selecting my criteria of "free wifi" as I also had a presentation to complete for work but I'll come back to that (I said it wasnt a romantic weekend, hence laptop allowed) We paid for a upgraded “executive room” with breakfast inclusion, adds about $40 to the price and I had asked at the desk for a view. This is a 5 story hotel and we were on the 4th floor.  We were somewhat taken by surprise when we got out of the lift, surprised like when you walk into a spider web and start flaying your arms around, you know what’s happened but you didn’t see it coming...a very shabby hallway, walls damaged and marked - dare I say it was reminiscent of the backpackers in Miami we stayed at for one night (which we had to leave due to a overdoes in the dorm but that's another story). Feeling somewhat disappointed but not beaten we slotted our card in the door and upon opening it ....well yes we were underwhelmed with our room, 1st time in ages. The first feeling was wow this room really needs a update/ refresh ....as you drop your keys and bags (see photo 2) you realise the benchtops are in worse condition than your grandmas. As you get more familiar and take off your shoes you'll note the skirting boards in your room are actually rotting (photo 3). Settle in by this stage you will know what you have signed up for and will no longer be surprised with the room ( with the room I said, we have not started on the bathroom/bed). You'll note the bathroom door is not made for wide people (photo 4) it's teeny - although what it lacks in width it certainly makes up for in height- so if your over 7ft tall you may appreciate this feature and/or even select this hotel based on being able to walk through this doorway on your tippy toes - it's as though they were afraid that if a wide person were to walk through then they would not be able to turn around in the bathroom which is around 90cm wide - but then again I am no walking measurement stick...photo 5 shows the failed romance element with the bedroom and bathroom floors meeting in a love hate type of situation where they could have stayed together but just didn't didn't because there was issues on both sides. Alas my Italian cousin Tony the tiler was certainly not involved in tiling this bathroom who's grouting is really wanting to be noticed above the tile (literally) Phhoto 6 shows grouting more as art, like finger painting rather than tile fixing. Trish really made the bathroom work for her, she accepted the bathroom was certainly not going to leaving her feeling pampered or possibly even fresh and the hotel must have been trying to assist her with that but providing a bathroom that completely fogs up and gives you that carefree vibe, aka “it doesn’t really matter because when you get out of the shower you won’t be able to see yourself thanks to the foggy mirror anyway, so just use your imagination for makeup and hair grooming or let your old friends tell you how you look when you meet them. I now have to retract my recommendation to readers over 7 ft tall who I may have inspired to book this room. Trish and I are short people at 5'4 Anyone over 5'6 will have their knees collide with the toilet wall whilst sitting on the toilet - definitely wins our "Trish and Jose Caca award for toilet leg room - just not enough! “ (Photo 6) Again the hotel has provided contingencies with the provision of the shower towels hanging infront of the toilet at the right height for you to grab onto and push should constipation occur. The blast from the past, reminiscant of a time gone by when the water flowed freely and without regard was the Leaking basin 24/7 (Why do I have to pay for your room and tell you to stop wasting water 24hrs a day?) It doesn't just hurt Trish and my sensibilities it's hurting the whole planet - our absolute biggest peeve and one we can't even see the funny side of. Again great staff on the included breakfast counter. But don't expect anything hot apart from toast, fruit, pastries and a dose up of caffeine and you'll be outa there. All future guests will also be happy to know the coverless dooner/quilt/duvet– see the last photo was free of any body fluids on our part, as stated this was not a romantic weekend, although as we pulled the covers back we could not quantify if the last guests offered us the same privilege, I offer this to you as something all future guests should take upon themselves as obviously the hotel doesn’t think covering the dooner is a hygiene issue at all. THE GOOD: The location The hard working and kind staff THE BAD: Flickering bedside lights (unless they are poltergeists and completely out of hotels control) Very noisy - 7am wake up to trucks and city noise- old school Windows that don't open and have No soundproofing whatso ever. Free wifi is only free if you log in once and for 2 HR limit eg log in for 30 seconds to look at your email and you "free wifi" is free no more- why don't you let your customers know that when they are reading "free wifi" its limited and once only login? Bathroom - We have seen better conditions at caravan parks (check out our NZ caravan park reviews Duvets with no cover – gross or is it just us expecting too much – we will never know because back to you we will never go. OVERALL - 2.5 out of 5  And that is for the hard working staff.  If we had paid under $100 per night we would have given it 3.5 but in this case you certainly don't get what you paid for. This location is full of hotels and in fact I would recommend you look at Oak on Collins for same price range but at least double the comfort.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~1~4~nan

review_386792473~“Long weekend afte USA”~the hotel was central to Melbourne shopping and eating district.The hotel was easy to find and a great place to shop from. The room was comfortable and clean .It boasted a large round spa with windows to the lane way . The shower above the spa provided hot water and decent spray. The bath room seemed small but the spa accommodated 2 adults easily. The bed was comfortable and access involved short steps at the room entrance. Booking in was easy , pleasant and the staff were polite. The price for central Melbourne was on a little higher than some but the position was great for trams , shopping, eating and general tours. The breakfast room was very tidy , quiet and well serviced and the staff there very nice. The breakfast offered was continental as part of my booking and was sufficient. Booking out was easy and they held our bags safely while we shopped for a couple of hours. Overall a good stay and enjoyed the time there.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_385972361~“Fantastic location”~Sagar from the restaurant so friendly, breakfast was continental and plenty there. Coffee machine 24/7.  Front desk staff alway happy and helpful. We had a twin room, beds small but room clean and lovely linen. Large TV and the curtains are block out.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384799415~“Prep Trip”~The hotel is in a pretty good location and generally facilities are OK. The majority of the service though is poor. The not fulfilling items that are listed on their website and no response to other items and follow up just means that its a transaction and your a number. An example is the free wifi is only for 2 hours and once started you can't stop it easily. Though they did get us a taxi. I had hoped that because of the location I'd be bringing a number there but sad to say the customer focus and understanding (overall - despite the odd highlight) means I'll need to find another. Probably head back up the hill(:~2~3~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_384154124~“Great location , Great value for money”~The room was spacious and very comfortable.Very clean and tidy with furniture in average condition.Mini bar was well stocked and affordable. Bathrobes supplied.No views on offer with his hotel. Staff were very friendly with 24 hour reception. Location couldn't have been better as everything at the doorstep. Suitable for families or business especially if you don't want to spend all your hard earned savings on accommodation!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_381024340~“Melbourne CBD”~Fantastic location right in the heart of the city. Just up from newly opened St Collins Arcade and right opposite David Jones. Older hotel but it was clean, the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great value.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_378902152~“Stayed 7 nights, 3rd time to Melbourne on holiday break.”~The breakfast room staff where excellent,always friendly and cheerful. Front counter staff variable from excellent and helpful to totally uninterested. Room was well appointed but shower very hard to regulate.Room not cleaned daily to acceptable standard,some days ok others poor.Probably the first and only time we will stay there. Really expected better.~3~nan~4~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_378856728~“Cleanliness”~The bathroom drains were odorous. The sink hung on a pipe from the wall, hence water everywhere when using it. The soap holder was in the middle of nowhere and dripped right onto the floor when you put the soap in it.~2~2~4~3~2~1~4~nan
review_377273354~“Adequate ”~If you need somewhere for one or two nights and you will be out all the day then the Hotel Causeway will do...just. Value for money it's ok. First though, to be fair, the staff were great. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed sincerely interested in making the stay a good one. Can't fault that. However, this is an older building that has been rejuvenated and for the most part well but our room was small, the small bathroom didn't have a bath only shower and the hot water was chillingly erratic (in this day-n-age there is no excuse for that!). This said the bed was comfortable, the air conditioning very good and the TV was straight-forward, all positives for us. Will visit again, in a pinch.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374440390~“Oh dear...”~Hotel Causeway has been my go-to hotel in Melbourne for the past three years. However, my last two visits have me doubting whether or not I will return. Standards have most definitely slipped. First up though, the positives. Location and price. The hotel is one laneway from Bourke St mall, and is cheaper than most other mid-range hotels in the CBD. Another positive - the beds are extremely comfortable! Sadly though, Hotel Causeway has let many things slide in the past 12 months or so. I appreciate that you don't pay top dollar for this hotel, but the point is, it used to be great, for exactly the same price, so it appears corners are definitely being cut and issues neglected. I'm not writing this review purely to have a whinge. I really hope management reads this, and similar reviews to mine, and takes action. It would be a shame to see this hotel close down, and it's (mostly) friendly staff out of work. To begin with, there is the unpleasant, stale cooking smell in reception, presumably from the restaurant next door. The lift is jerky, and when the doors open into reception, the lift floor doesn't quite line up with the floor you're about to step out onto. The doors also don't open fully. I had problems with my electronic access card on two occasions. On one occasion, it took three attempts to resolve. The first time it happened, I was told not to keep the card near a mobile phone or other device/card with an electronic component. So, from then on I was very aware of keeping the card in a separate compartment in my handbag, protected by a packet of tissues. That wasn't enough to stop it happening a second time. After a red eye flight into Melbourne, I headed back to my room mid-afternoon for a quick nap. I was woken by the sound of quiet knocking. Being half-asleep, I couldn't be sure if it was at my door, so I ignored it and stayed in bed. Next thing, the door opened. I called out "Hello?" and the person (male) apologised and left immediately. Presumably it was hotel staff or workmen, but still, it was unnerving and unexpected! Previous rooms that I've stayed in at Hotel Causeway have been sensibly designed. Not this time. The TV was so far away from my bed that I had to rearrange most of the furniture to be able to see it. Normally, I don't stay at a hotel to watch TV, but this time I was there for work and just wanted to relax in my room watching MasterChef after dinner! Breakfast was disappointing. Costs have clearly been slashed here. The fruit (especially the strawberries) is cut into such tiny pieces as to make them look pointless and unappetising, and the range and quality in general has gone downhill. The breakfast room is also very dreary, and I think it's time for some new music! My shower was like a Katy Perry song (or a Masterchef opening!) - hot then you're cold! Shower pressure was good, but getting blasted with cold then really hot water kind of ruined the experience. Overall, the place just looks worn and tired. Walls and skirting boards are scuffed, carpet and curtains are stained, cleanliness is okay but not impeccable like it used to be. The place needs a good facelift - paint, carpets, curtains, furniture, the works. All that said, Hotel Causeway is not AWFUL. It is an average mid-range option in the CBD, and in a pinch, I would stay here again. However, if they want to be a solid choice, they need to up their game.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_374170560~“Excellent Location”~Hotel causeway is very convenient to everything especially for shopping as you are in the shopping district.  Service was good Room was Clean Noise was moderate, can be noisy, but you are staying at the central of Melbourne where all the shopping is literally a street away.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_373900148~“Nice hotel in great location”~Probably the best thing about his hotel is location, you right there in the center of everything in Melbourne. At your doorstep, lovely coffee shops and breakfast places, shopping paradise is just around the corner and just a short stroll away from major theaters and entertainment district. The hotel itself provide comfortable rooms, clean and well maintained. Look on the outside it might be deceiving, with modern rooms hidden inside protecting you from hustle of the center of the city. Staff was friendly and helpful, making this hotel very welcoming and comfortable.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_373886150~“Great location”~This hotel is right in the CBD and is so handy to everything. Its decor is a bit tired and the room we had was quite noisy, but for the price and location it was good. Request for a room 4th or 5th floor which will be less noisy.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
