review_469656889~“Great Stay - again!”~We completed our major holiday of New Zealand & Australia with a three night stay at the Radisson on Flagstaff Gardens in Melbourne. We stayed there a few years ago & decided to go back again as it worked well for us last time. Our welcome was very warm & the fact we had stayed before made them very delighted that we had decided to return.  Our room was very comfortable & pleasant. We enjoyed the breakfasts again though sometimes the service was a little haphazard when we asked for something from the kitchen.  The freshly cooked eggs were delicious & the chef was very efficient. The choices of all types of food on offer were varied.  The reception staff were extremely helpful & efficient. Nothing was too much trouble & they were very professional & cheerful. Thank you once again! Hopefully we will visit again at sometime in the future.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477906379~“What about a better walk-in policy”~We traveled from Sydney to Melbourne. After checking the booking.com website,we decided to try this hotel as booking.com showed they had availability. When I showed the girl at the reception desk my phone with the rate advertised on booking.com, she quoted me a much higher walk-in rate from the hotel. She couldn't match the rate on booking.com. So what we did was booking the same room on my phone through booking.com while she was witnessing that. As soon as we had the confirmation from the website and it was in her system we could enter the room. Quite unbelievable. Otherwise it's a fine hotel with decent amenities, comfortable beds and a parking garage nearby. We were a bit unlucky that the people in the neighbouring room decided to have a party in their room at night but I won't hold that against the hotel. They should do something about their walk-in rate though as I can't believe your reception much rather pays a commission to an internet website.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_477368706~“Excellent business hotel”~I travel to melbourne every two weeks but mostly on one day trips this time it was for two days. I wanted to stay in hotel that was easily accessible & provider good street parking. I was working overnight training staff so was arriving 1am each night & wanted to also find hotel with hassle free parking. I have never stayed at this hotel or Raddison before & only choose because on edge of city but glad I did: - excellent rooms - good room service - very tasty breakfast  - very friendly proactive staff - they rally want to please I booked cheapest room but they gave me best room called "business class" which was nice. Very reasonable, friendly & relaxing hotel in the middle of melbourne~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477302781~“Great Location.”~This was a rarity for us - staying overnight at a hotel in our home city. We were catching up with some friends from interstate who had done a lot of driving so this was a good way of spending some relaxing time together. Getting to the hotel was easy, 5 min. check-in and then overnight parking available at reasonable cost only 200m away worked out perfectly. The room was fine, had everything you would need, and a comfortable although soft bed ( slept well ).  We were able to meet and have a relaxed chat in their lounge area before flagging down a taxi outside the entrance to take on a 10 min. trip to Lygon Street, and if you enjoy Italian food this is definitely the place to go. In the morning, was a bit slack after a great night out, although did check out their gym on the top floor and it has all the equipment you would require to wipe off any indulgence from the previous night. We did go to breakfast ( included in booking ) - the friendly Manager took us to a prime window table and explained efficiently where everything was so we could enjoy our morning refuelling!  Everything you would require is available and plenty to keep you going for the day. Check-out was just as easy and efficient as check-in. The hotel is in an excellent position for tourists - walking distance to the Queen Vic Market, shops, across the road from parkland and the railway station, and a few 100 metres to catch the free city loop tram- and of course walking distance to shops and restaurants, casino, etc. Would certainly do again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477003076~“Great hotel on edge of CBD”~Moderate sized hotel (9 floors) with courteous and efficient staff. Good location opposite parklands and not too far to docklands stadium and Queen Vic market. Beds excellent and very quiet rooms ensure a good nights sleep.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476651337~“Work & Play”~Half work and half Boy's Club Footy Weekend, a simple and pleasant joy all round. Arrived to an upgrade and warmly welcomed by staff. Great room, bed, lavish bathroom. Dumped our bags and off to the game. Forgot our umbrella so they comped us one at reception for the rainy walk back from docklands. My 7 year old boy, myself hoarse from screening. Provided with a nice cuppa, my son opted for chocolate. Camped in our room ordering room service. Great menus for kids and adults. Hamburger, the old reliable, well priced and tasty. He had lots of bubbles in the jacuzzi type bath but only for 15 mins as room service arrived quite quickly for a peak Saturday night. He loved his nuggets and then fell back into the 'just right' softest of pillows to watch one of the kids movies on a reliable quality Digital HD TV. He fell asleep before it ended but as the hire was 24 hours woke up early next morning and finished it off. As he slept I completed some work and then watched a Netflix iPad movie streamed from the free WiFi. Win win stay. Will go again. Everyone was great and the breakfast a real treat. They hand made waffles for my son as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476643740~“Great location, great restaurant and staff”~I was a solo traveller, keen to be in a location easily walkable to the city. Was really happy with the hotel. I walked the city from here, no need to use trams but they literally run past the hotel if you want to use them. I wasn't planning on using the hotel restaurant but ended up meeting family and dining in the restaurant one evening and one breakfast. Food was excellent and the staff were superb. Special mention to Mario the restaurant manager and I think it was Eldo too...really fabulous service. I took the Skybus $19 from MEL airport/$36 return. Easy to use and once transferred to Southern Cross station there is a hotel transfer bus included - was great as I was first stop. Returning to airport I walked to the Southern Cross station which was straightforward even with a large case and other bags - took about 20 mins. Good concierge, loads of info available for things to do. I did "I'm Free" walking tour - brilliant! As I was in my own was a great way to see the city. Loved my short 2 night trip, would definitely recommend the hotel and restaurant to all.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476283174~“Great stay”~Only spent one night but this is a great hotel to stay in visiting Melbourne. Nice modern rooms and great location for city walk.

review_472403594~“Memorable Stay”~We stayed here for 4 nights on a touring holiday so one of the requirements was parking facilities, which were on offer in a nearby multi story. The room was good ,overlooking the park opposite all nice and clean with a great bathroom and tv and mini bar tea and coffee. Staff were friendly and professional including the chambermaid. The other interesting thing was some of the guests who were taking part in the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic, some big guys and ladies. Hotel itself is a gentle stroll if you want from most places in the central district or tram stops pretty much outside. A good quality restaurant is on the ground floor available for breakfast lunch or dinner. We got a good deal for breakfast here and had a couple of dinners here as well !! All good.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472332000~“Noisy doors”~Location: convenient, central and perfect for the adjacent Victoria market (closed on Mondays). It’s a stroll away from the 35 City Circle tram (which is free and comes with running commentary of stops and districts). Check-in: fast and efficient. Reception was on the whole friendly and competent in contrast to the concierge who was polite but offhand and not very helpful. Room: ours on the fifth floor came with views over the park. Although not large, it was spotlessly clean if a little dated (we are used to the more modern European Radisson hotels), particularly in the bathroom, though the walk-in shower was roomy and practical and the toiletries were good. The expected room amenities such as flat screen, safe etc., were complemented with more unusual ones, including a useful adaptor plug.  Hotel services: the hotel boasts a gym on the top floor along with an observation deck. The ground floor is shared between the large reception complete with comfortable armchairs and the bar and restaurant. Reception will store luggage. So far... so good. Sleep: this is where things started to unravel. The bed although enormous was on the bouncier side so restless partners will cause ripples. The glazing muted all but the noisier vehicles and trams on busy William Street below. The problem was the connecting door, as well as the door into the corridor which banged loudly when left to swing shut... as did all the other doors along the corridor. We arrived shortly before 23.00 after 24 hours of long haul flights and although we tried to be quiet, we disturbed our neighbour who started coughing. Next morning, the tables were turned and we were woken by their wake up call at 5.50 which could clearly be heard through the connecting door, as could their entire conversation as they got ready to leave. We didn’t get back to sleep until they and everyone else along our corridor (judging from the constantly banging doors) did. Not exactly what you want after a protracted journey. Follow up: when we mentioned this on checking out after our single, very abridged night, the receptionist replied that had we mentioned the problem before she would have done something about it. This must be the standard excuse to all complaints. The thing is that we didn’t know the doors would be a problem. Anyway, it should be up to the hotel to ensure they don’t place guests who come in late next to those who’ve requested an early wake up call, especially if both rooms share a connecting door. Then again, we would probably have been awoken by the banging corridor doors anyway.  We probably wouldn’t stay again for this reason as well as the fact that although the location is very central, business districts tend to lack character and we’d therefore probably go for a livelier neighbourhood.  Tip: if you don’t want to be privy to your next door neighbour’s conversation, ask for a room without a connecting door.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472269864~“Stay at Radisson Flagstaff”~I rate this hotel average given my experience at many other locations globally. It is a older hotel, I feel, renovated, but still not up to mark. Also, when you arrive your luggage need to be unloaded on to the pavement as there is no portico.  Having said that the location is good as its walking distance to many places in the city and the free tram which takes you around melbourne. The staff was very good and helpful. Good breakfast. But be careful as your cloths can smell as some food (omelets etc) is cooked within the dining area (Action station). Good view of the park from the restaurant and from the rooms. Rooms were average and the restrooms/toilet was small. overall no major complaints~3~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472191762~“Brilliant”~We arrived at the hotel at 10am and were greeted by a beaming, friendly and efficient Mairisha. As our room wasn't ready she stored our bags, gave us keys to refresh ourselves and on hearing that it was our 1st visit to Melbourne suggested we could walk 5 minutes up the road and visit the market and/or take a trip on the free tourist tram (no.35). Every morning (on our 6 night stay) she greeted us personally and checked to see if there was anything that she or other staff could do. This included (a)confirming booking of trips that I'd done on line in England (b) supplying super glue to stick the sole of a sandal (c) booking the transport for us to go directly from the hotel to the airport. All the staff were helpful, courteous and efficient. Our room on the 2nd floor was spacious, with two easy chairs, an exceptionally comfortable bed and pillows (there was a pillow menu so they could be changed if required) and a gleaming modern bathroom, which had a full size bath with plenty of hot water, as well as the shower overhead. Initially I did wonder if there would be noise from the road, as the room was on one of the lower floors and fronted on to the main road but there was no disturbance at all. We had not booked breakfast, but this could be had, slightly cheaper, if you collected a card the night before. If you didn't hand the card in the next morning, you were not charged. An excellent idea. The expansive breakfast buffet was overseen by another very pleasant, efficient member of staff and the choice of dishes covered several countries. Room service was speedy and the cleaning staff kept our room immaculate. The hotel is very well placed to reach a lot of the major tourist sites, particularly if you use the free trams.You can also walk to many of the restaurants within 30 minutes of the hotel. It has a small gym and sauna on the top floor - a pity there wasn't a swimming pool. Altogether an excellent place to stay.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

The rooms are big and very clean. There is free Wi-Fi. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The hotel location is very good - close to the mall (for shopping), close to Lygon street (where all the good Italian restaurants are) and very close to the trains that take you to Albert park. Overall it is a very nice hotel and I will definitely stay in Radisson again.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_470010265~“Friendliest staff in the world!”~I traveled to Melbourne for the annual Arnold Classic Australia and stayed at the Radisson hotel for little over 2 weeks.  I travel a lot for competitions and the hardest part is finding a place to eat because my diet is very strict around competitions.  It was not hard at all at the Radisson and the restaurant staff showed me so much support and put together meals that were not even on the menu.  They also would heat up my oatmeal and eggwhites every day without a problem.  This has been by far the best hotel experience I have had! Thank you to the whole staff of the Radisson for being AWESOME!  The rooms are very comfortable, the locations is great...

review_469302662~“Excellent location right next to Queen Victoria Market in CBD. Excellent Front Desk (Mirisha)”~Radisson on Flagstaff Gardens Melbourne is located in Melbourne CBD area next to Flagstaff Gardens. It is located within 2 minutes walk from Queen Victoria market which makes for lots of options of dining and souvenir shopping. A free night at the hotel costs 44,000 Club Carlson points. Check-in was very quick. The front desk agent (her name was Mirisha) was very courteous and genuinely caring. When we mentioned that my parents had a late night flight departing Melbourne, the agent was kind enough to give us a late checkout of 6 PM. Of all the years we have stayed at hotels, the best I had gotten before was a 4 PM checkout and so we were very happy about this benefit. We did not dine in property but rather walked to nearby Queen Victoria Market for lunch and took the tram to Federation Square for dinner. Thumbs up: Excellent location in Melbourne CBD area. Only 2 minutes walk to Queen Victoria market which makes for a variety of dining and souvenir shopping options Very courteous and friendly front desk who gave us a 6 PM late checkout due to our late departing flight Thumbs down: 44,000 Club Carlson points for a free night seemed out of place for this hotel milespointstravel.com~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_463955016~“Great Hotel for the business (or pleasure) traveller”~I stayed for 3 nights at the Radisson on Flagstaff, and was thoroughly satisfied. The room was immaculately clean, the bed comfortable and the facilities for business outstanding. The free wifi internet was trouble-free, and made contact with work a breeze. The buffet breakfast was great and I had an excellent evening meal in the restaurant.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_463126213~“Great Hotel!!”~It was my first time in Melbourne and the location of the Radisson was perfect to see and feel the vibe of the city!! The hotel service was 5star! Room was excellent- clean and comfortable. We got to check in a bit early which was great because we started our experience at the Queen Vic Markets - only a short walk away. I wil defiantly be staying again. Thank you Radisson staff!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_461626652~“Great place to stay”~Booked this hotel and delighted with the quality - especially the staff - couldn't do enough to help us with whatever we wanted. The breakfast is out of this world and again exceptionally attentive staff. The hotel sits just across from Flagstaff gardens and is also on the free tram line so getting into town is easy. Will definitey come back here.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461542348~“Great Hotel”~We stayed at the Radisson for 3 nights. The staff are very kind & helpful. Our room was well appointed and very comfortable. There is a safe in the room which we always appreciate. Our reservations included breakfast which was over the top! They have everything for a hot or cold breakfast including a station for eggs / omelettes. The location is excellent for walking around Melbourne and there is a park directly across the street. We had dinner in the restaurant on of the evenings and the food was very good. You can't go wrong here!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461290206~“Love the breakfast!”~I come here regularly on business and you couldn't fault the staff's attitude! Always friendly and obliging. They have a great happy hour with free nibbles at their restaurant HQ's and the dinners there are top notch! And they have an egg station at breakfast which makes such a welcome change! (Love the Marzipan filled croissants!!)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461169400~“three night stay”~we stayed here for three nights but wish that it could have been longer, the hotel is situated across the road from a very nice park, (friendly wild possum living in a tree) this was one of the better hotels on our five week stay, the rooms are very modern with a nice large shower, its positioned close to the free tram service and within walking distance to the centre.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_461336456~“Awesome hotel, must stay here”~Great hotel all round. Best staff ever, especially during breakfast dining.
