review_479100955~“Great value, perfect location!”~We stayed here for 4 nights for a child free long weekend. The location is fantastic. Right in the centre of the city, around the corner from Bourke St Mall. Two tram stops within a block and walking distance to so many great restaurants. Just near Chinatown, close to Hardware Lane, so many options! Although the motel is busy and seems to host tour groups staff were friendly and we had no issues. For a 3 star motel it was great quality. My tip, if you can cheaply add the buffet breakfast to your room rate it's definitely worth it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469804750~“Perfect location, clean comfy rooms and super friendly staff”~I stayed here during the week with my friend for 2 nights. The price for this place was really good and we were very happy overall with our stay. We were on a road trip so were driving in and parking the car. The hotel is down a one way lane, but if you turn into the driveway of the hotel, the staff will either park your car for you ($25 a day) or turn it around for you, let you check in and take your bags to your room, then give you directions to the carpark where you can park for $15 a day/24hrs. They have a deal with the Wilson carpark at 222 Russell St, but ONLY THAT CARPARK. Do not just drive into any Wilson carpark, you must go into the one they say otherwise you will not get the discount. So if you are driving, drive into the hotel driveway first and go from there (5 min walk back from the carpark). The staff were very welcoming and friendly the entire time we were there. The room was exactly what we needed. We got a twin room, the bathroom looks very new, everything was tidy and the aircon was great. Above all, the location of this hotel is the main advantage. You are literally right in the middle of the CBD, and all the cafe's, restaurants and shopping we wanted to go to were within walking distance. Oh and also there is a Haigh's Chocolate shop in the same building... my favourite. There are a couple of cons: the mattress was lopsided and collapsed (I rolled more to one side of the bed), and during my first shower the shower head sprayed water (out the side) all over the bathroom, wetting the toilet paper, toilet, walls and floor. But I just turned the water down for my other shower. Also the walls are a little thin, I could hear the people next to us plugging things into the wall, and I could hear them in the bathroom a little bit when I was in the bathroom... We did not eat here because there are so many amazing breakfast places and restaurants within walking distance (The Hardware Societe is the best for breakfast, on Hardware St), and you are in the middle of Chinatown. I will definitely stay here again when I go back to Melbourne.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_478533427~“Location location location”~Excellent location to strolling around the city of melbourne. Next to shopping centre, malls and many restaurants.

review_478471666~“2017 Comedy Festival Winner”~Welcoming, friendly, comfortable and value for money. We stayed overnight whilst soaking in the 2017 Comedy Festival vibe. The Louden Kitchen & Grill served a wonderful, tasty and affordable dinner and provided a sumptuous buffet breakfast full of variety. Central to all the wonderful delights that Melbourne has to offer. Highly recommend and will definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_478357487~“Mercure Melbourne”~This is an excellent location (cnr Little Burke and Swanston Streets) for a visit to Melbourne - handy for theatres, bars and restaurants. Trams run regularly along Burke Street for easy transport to other areas of the city and to and from Southern Cross Station and airport shuttle. My only negative comment about this and other hotels is the bedding - doonas at this time of year are far too warm - a light cotton blanket would suffice.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_478082190~“A great place to stay in the centre of Melbourne.”~We chose to stay at the Mercure Welcome Melbourne because of it's location. It is so central to all the different areas of Melbourne, shopping, Chinatown, Theatres, easy walk to Southbank and many restaurants.  The hotel provides everything you need, friendly service, buffet breakfast, bars and easy access to either Little Bourke St or Swanson St. Where you can get on a tram and go to Docklands, St Kilda or any other area of Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_477333621~“Perfect location”~We have stayed here previously in 2013 and 2015. We visited Melbourne for Round 4 of the AFL 2017 season and found the central location perfect. As always the reception staff were friendly. As Accor members, we had free wifi and a welcome drink each.  We arrived around 7am and left our luggage at the hotel and went off for breakfast. Reception told us that they will call us when our room become available - we didn't get the call but was able to get a room before the 2pm check in time, so we were happy. We were given a room on the 10th level. It was one of the newly renovated rooms as the bathroom was spotless! We had a king sized bed and it was very comfortable. Housekeeping as always did a wonderful job, our room was always cleaned and tidy by the time we return.  The only disappointing thing was they do not honour Accor dining discount as it was Easter long weekend. However we did get our dining discount at nearby Novotel. Seems the same hotel group but they all have different rules. We are very happy with the property and will definitely stay here again for our next Melbourne trip.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_477302866~“Downtown/Chinatown location, tiny dirty rooms”~The nice lobby is a surprise off the crowded downtown streets! In contrast, the room and bathroom were not only incredibly small, but there was mold on the ceiling of our bathroom and the carpets felt very dirty. Pros: -Central downtown location with convenient trolley stops -Prime spot if you love Asian food -Comfortable bed and pillows -Shopping across the street & around the corner.  Cons: -Small, dirty rooms -Concierge hours were limited and we never saw the highly advertised “We Know Melbourne” rep there.  -Elevators went down and we had to do the 5 floors by stairs one day.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477127270~“Does the job”~Stayed here for one night after arriving in Aus from the UK so was pretty tired! The staff did their best to check me in early which was appreciated, the room was slightly outdated and a bit dingy but I was only there to sleep so it did its job, and the bathroom was really nice. All in all very welcoming and a good base in Melbourne in an excellent location.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_477042820~“Perfectly Located”~The hotel is in the middle of the vibrant Swanston Street. The location is excellent for a traveler. A tram stop is just outside the hotel. Varieties of restaurants and convenience stores are nearby and walking distance. Flinder street station is just 5 minutes walking. Victoria market and Old Melbourne Gaol can be accessed by foot. Chinatown is opposite to the hotel.  The rooms are very clean and the staffs are friendly and well behaved. Breakfast is enough to start the day. Wifi is very fast and free. Rooms are small but cosy.  The best part is location and the vibration around the hotel. We loved Melbourne and will definitely try to book this hotel again in our next trip. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_476717710~“Do not stay if you want to work or spend time in the room. Only the location saves it”~The door and reservation staff were polite, helpful and professional. The room is a disappointment (sadly I am still in it). Opening the door I find myself in a small box with a window facing the wall (on the 9th floor). The bed is large and has a lamp each side which is nice. The cupboard is large but there are no shelves to put underwear or folded clothes on at all.  The bathroom is small but well appointed. There is gaping from the manhole cover on the roof which is unsightly, and there is a continual fan noise that is irritating and cannot be turned off. The desk has an awful white plastic chair that cannot be sat on for more than 5 minutes without causing great discomfort. I know this, because I am trying to work in the room and the desk being set up with the TV on it and the awful chair makes it very difficult to work efficiently (and with the fan hum - I want to scream). I moved to this hotel from another closer to my work, however I am likely to return back to it as at least I could work in that room.~2~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan

review_475885023~“Very central ”~Mercure welcome is the place to stay if you wish to enjoy the city to most. Bang opposite the emporium mall, it is well connected to all the important streets of the central city. Chinatown, Russell street, flinders station and federal square are all walking from here. You are in the free tram zone and enjoy a free ride to lot many places around.  One can surely try this place with a few days in hand. Rooms are clean and neat bathrooms. No opulence attached to it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475420042~“Unfriendly front office staff , horrible room ”~My boyfriend and myself went there for few days in April. We bought a travel package with flight included and a double room. We arrived a little bit early to leave the luggage and have a little trip in the city meanwhile they are finished the room. But the front office lady explained to us that, if we wanted, they had a ready room, exactly the same as the one had to be our one but some level lower. We thought , why not, so we could also have a shower and if the room is the same the difference, it was not so much. But the room that we found was horrible! Incredible! Wardrobe without door, visible water pipes in the ceiling, scratches on the wall.. Luckily the bathroom was nice, tiny( the sink was pretty much on the toilet) but nice. Also disappointing was the cleaner service. Nothing to complain about the cleaning but on the timing: at 4:30pm, when I came back in the room, it wasn't done , I had to left the room to leave the lady finish the work. I know there are a lot of rooms,but maybe give to customers an idea about the cleaner time won't be so terrible. The only good think was the spot. The location is amazing. But obviously it is not enough. Definitely we won't come back.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The room was clean and comfortable, although very compact. The airconditioner was too noisy to get to sleep, so we turned it off. The buffet breakfast was great value with delicious food. The Hotel is very well located in the centre of the city, close to shops, theatres, and trams that take you everywhere. Easy walk to Southbank. Great location for attending the Comedy Festival and Food and Wine Fair. We'll be back!~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_474074246~“Expectations of a City Centre Mercure were sorely dashed!!”~It was OK - but only just OK. We were on the 7th floor which is great for views but the aroma of stale food or something similar that hit you when you exited the lift was almost stomach churning and didn't make for a pleasant experience in getting to/ from the room. The walls were paper thin! We could hear every move, every tap, every flush, every door open/ close that emanated from the adjacent rooms throughout the night but at least we had the city "cleaning" noises to awake us from the slumber we eventually fell into around 5:00am - not sure if there was any glass in the windows..... Air con was great - nice and cold but so noisy it was preferable to be too hot that nice and cool. The only thing quieter than the air con was the fridge but that was still pretty noisy in the middle of the night... so it was a case of quiet or cold drinks/ milk. Another pillow would have been great as well either to sleep on or cover my head with. I think the breakfast was good - cant remember with being so tired whilst eating it.... seriously, breakfast was OK and the staff were friendly and helpful. I'm sure there are some very nice rooms in this hotel that we should have had for the price we paid and we feel we were given the dregs and the left-overs. I'd suggest to anyone else staying to complain if there is the slightest thing amiss. Wished we'd have made a fuss to get a better room but hindsight is wonderful! Our friends that also stayed at the same time did complain and the hotel have sent them a stroppy email for doing so! You just cant win sometimes can you?~3~1~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_473994893~“Place is a pit!”~Visited this hotel for the GP weekend and I expected hotels to be over priced - accepted. Room was not clean nor was the hotel generally. The hotel could not offer us an equivalent room so we left and found another hotel. Hotel has charged us stating we breached their booking terms and conditions - this is not the case. They mis-sold the product; it was not as described; it was not to an acceptable standard nor could they offer an alternative. Rather than take issue with the young duty manager, Bethany, on the evening we decided to resolve after the event; this with the expectation that the hotel management would be understanding and reasonable. Not the case. Now they will need to deal with the credit card company. Totally unacceptable. Not even youth hostel standard!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The bedroom although not large was adequate and that and the bathroom facilities were in good shape. Breakfast was good but very busy, only downside coffee from the machine was not to our taste.

As a Accor member, also received a free drink & I appreciate the $100 discount for opting to not have a room clean each day saving the environment just a little. Used the gym which is adequate, and has a water dispenser as well as complimentary apples.  Hotel has 2 towers with Welcome being older, smaller and cheaper & the Swanston newer, larger & dearer with both hotels generally sharing the facilities, with the same staff etc. Basic hotel - nothing flash. Ate dinner in the bar, and the food was well presented, well cooked and tasty. Good variety of drinks available at the bar. Staff were friendly & helpful throughout my 3 day stay. Well located & close to Chinatown starts across the road) as well as various noodle & dumplings cafes featuring Thai, Chinese & Vietnamese cuisines.

review_473554812~“Excellent location but...”~Mercure Welcome hotel is right in the middle of Melbourne which means that buses, trams, restaurants, shopping centres are right next door. However, this also means that it is not easy to get to it by car and the garage is a couple of blocks away.

The buffet breakfast was good and cheap. They had a special on at the time we were there $20pp and they were very busy. The restaurant and front desk staff was helpful and friendly.

One day our room was never made up at all, after advising the person at reception at 6pm we were told that we would get a $10 credit on our room, big deal !!. Not even an apology On checking out i asked about the $10 credit and was told that we had to actually spend it in the bar, restaurant.

review_472520587~“easy place to stay central to all CBD action, good value and i will stay again when in melbourne”~I have stayed at this motel on a couple of occasions .It is so central making it easy to pop back to the motel room for a rest and refresh . It is located in little Collins st next to David Jones and just up from Myers and very close to China Town. What i loved was when i got there my room was ready and i was allowed to check in and get to my room . Which after travelling over 3 hours is a relief .Well done Mercure Welcome Melbourne The staff were friendly efficient and welcoming and most of all help full. The room was very clean ,comfortable and had new carpets . The bath room had been renovated and whilst small had every thing i needed including a large shower stall and it was the cleanest motel bathroom i can remember seeing in quite a while . The motel was quite overnight but in the morning the cleaner could be heard doing their job not that this was an issue if it allows people to check in before 2 pm . Loved the fact there was a taxi rank outside the motel and the trams were right out the front too. The concierge was helpful in his advice on how to get where i wanted to go . The breakfast was good value with cook to order eggs and the staff welcoming informative with what was on offer and how to order .Over all a great place to stay~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_471992768~“Handy But Expensive”~I stayed at this hostelry with my son in law for the Formula One last weekend. It is very conveniently located in the centre of the Melbourne CBD with a tram stop right outside the door in Swanston Street. Having booked the property from New Zealand the only thing I had to go by was that it was an Accor group hotel and that these are normally reasonable. Unfortunately I was disappointed on several counts. Firstly I found it to be very expensive for what it provided. This is probably because it was F1 weekend but I do not appreciate paying over the odds.  Secondly the rooms are very tiny. The first night I was by myself and all seemed ok but when my son in law arrived the room didn't even have space for a second suitcase. Thirdly the whole place needs a revamp. It is best described as tatty and tired. The shower was good though. All in all I will not stay here again unless the price is substantially less. Frankly it is a $120 per night hotel, not a $350 per night. The only thing going for it is its convenience and I am sure that there are many better places than this.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_471501828~“Tiny rooms, not well maintained, Dinghy corridors”~Booked this to stay at for F1. I question the 3.5 star rating they have!

Carpet recently replaced but bedding was sagging with marks on walls and a dinghy corridor leading to the room which honestly smelt damp! Stay away!

review_470424268~“Location is perfect, comfort not excellent, good for a very short stay”~Location wise excellent, but its very noisy, you can hear everything in the hallway, and at times adjoining rooms. I was just there for a night. So recommended for a short stay, if your willing to sacrifice some sleep. It was clean which is great, but the shower drain pools a bit. Also it was a bit stuffy, only air-conditioning and no operable windows, but it is the city. Service was good, but I did ring a head to see if they had a tooth brush and tooth paste pack, which they said they did, but when I arrived there was none, so remember to bring that yourself. If you have many appointments in the city, then its well worth the location, since you can come and go when you need to sneak in a rest, but otherwise, if you want actual sleep, maybe book the actual Mecure next door, maybe the insulation is better...~3~4~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan
