review_479096918~“Central location but quiet ”~Stayed for 3 nights with husband for the ANZAC AFL game. Have stayed in Melbourne from WA a fair few times and loved Novotel on Collins location for both footy and the shopping. Our room was so quiet it didn't feel like we were in the middle of the city! I do feel like there needs to be more lighting in the room and the window goes to the shopping centre, which is really cool green glass display, I found it hard looking though my bag among other things in the room with lack of light . Also the room service plates left in the corridors for what seemed a very long time, even when we checked in there was one outside our door still from what looks like must have been the prior occupants.  Otherwise all staff were very helpful, happy and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453930633~“Of course, the excellent location!”~I agree with all the other Tripadvisors that this hotel is truly situated in a top location. Novotel Melbourne on Collins is very central and is walking distance to shops, restaurants, transport and attractions. The room we had faced Collins street. It was quiet, clean, comfortable and conveniently located from the lift on level 10. We had two double beds and adequate space within the room. The pillow service was also a bit of a novelty. All the staff at the hotel including the management were very helpful and polite and made our stay very enjoyable. The restaurant and breakfast was also very good with an adequate selection of great food.  The indoor pool and gym were a little small, but served their purpose. Will we come to stay at this hotel again? Definitely!~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_479092437~“Not happy ”~We have stayed here a few times now and have always enjoyed our stay but this time it was a shocker. As a gold accor member they say you get an upgraded room but they down graded us to a room next to the service elevator (room 925) and the noise all night long and early in the morning was unbearable. Mentioned it to the night manager and was told they will contact us to change rooms but we never heard from them. The hotel itself is in a great location, the vallet parking staff were good. What ever you do don't accept a room ending in 25 as they are all next to the service elevator. Expected more from this place.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478665265~“Business Stay”~Easy access to CBD and surrounds. Friendly staff and amenities. Check is quick Surprisingly big hotel actually. Casual bar and eating on reception level with unique decor in the atrium. Good gym equipment  Only improvement is the outdated appointment of bathroom's.  A good overnight or few night experience.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478093243~“Family room great value”~With Melbourne hotels becoming very very expensive for families the family room at this hotel is great value. Spacious enough not to be uncomfortable this place was good for us without 2 young kids. We were comfortable. Great central location, walking distance to Melbourne central, Chinatown and many many other bars and restaurants. Would stay here again. Recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477912382~“Nice accommodation in the heart of city”~We went to Novotel on Easter long weekend. Arrived there on Thursday night at 10:30 and surprised that checked in was quick and well organized. The receptionist was helpful and friendly helped us out with he map and the way to attractions. The room was big as we had 2 double beds . Firm bed but the pillow was soft and never got a chance to use pillow menu. The light at the window was pretty as knew later we were on top of the plaza. Breakfast was wonderful as I did enjoyed so much and with the service from staffs even made the place better. The staffs ran on their feet to make sure we have got what we ordered for the coffee. The girls were lovely as I working in hospitality I know they have the best customer service. I was impressed.  Location is in the heart of the city, enjoy going by tram or short walk to Chinatown, bourke st. Mall also block arcade just next door. Plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby.  Unfortunately we stayed only 3 nights and I blamed myself should booked for 4 night.  Only complain the bathroom got no bath in it while the booking ticket said got bath and it was abit noisy from guesses walked pass but it was school holiday.  Overall we were very happy if we have a chance to go to Melbourne definitely be back. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477452926~“Ticks every box ”~The hotel is in a fabulous location right in the heart of Melbourne. Attractions well within walking distance. The room was nice and spacious. Comfy beds and lovely room temperature. Staff are very welcoming and always put the customer first. One of the highlights of this hotel was the breakfast. Food was hot and there was an excellent choice. Very tasty. The pool was an added bonus. The hotel offered excellent value for money. Thanks to you all.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476949306~“A bit disappointing ”~Stayed in Novotel on Collins for one night, work trip. Location great . Check in was quick and friendly. Disappointed with room. Novotel is usually a good standard and you know you'll get a similar standard all over the world. This room was small and overlooked an internal atrium in the building so no natural light. I felt like I was in an office building. Bathroom had recently been renovated, but disappointing build up of dirt in shower corners as well as a bit of mould along shower. Mentioned this on check out. To be fair, the Manager has tried to contact me to discuss but we keep missing each other. Don't think I would choose to stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476738004~“Centrally located, clean & modern”~Stayed here for work. Hotel is right in the CBD, close to trams in the free tram zone. Hopetoun tea room is right next door, and flinders lane/china town easy walking distance. First time I was put in a room on the corner - very spacious however it being next to the fire stairs there was a constant buzzing when trying to sleep. Second time I was put in a regular room, no issue with the buzzing noise much better. Hotel also has a decent fitness centre only point of improvement would be to fix the fans there as is very stuffy when not working.  Staff was also friendly and assisted me when I had problem with the bath/shower taps.~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476349928~“Love this hotel”~This is the second time I have stayed at the Novotel on Collins. The moment you hop in the lift to head to reception, the staff are amazing with a vivacious good morning and welcome. We did check in early and our room was ready which was nice to drop the luggage. They even acknowledged a special occasion with a bottle of champagne and a lovely hand written note. (It's the little things that leave big impacts). Our room was spotless and a good size. Breakfast the next morning was delicious. A smiling staff member greeting us at the restaurant and taking us to our table. Another nice touch is that you can order a barista made coffee at no extra charge. Other hotels of this standard should take note of this little extra. Well done Novotel, your staff are a credit to the brand. Thank you for a lovely stay.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476253736~“Mini break”~I was hesitant to stay here right in the heart of Melbourne, thought it would be too noisey. How wrong I was, this is a terrific hotel, great location for shopping and eating. Hotel itself is very clean, rooms spacious, friendly and efficient staff. Mattress is very comfortable, pillows were great too. Recommend this hotel.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_476034044~“Great location”~Novotel is hotel situated on the main Collins street. It is very easy to approach tram and other locations of sightseeing interest. Huge variety of breakfast meals. Only thing to complain is that the rooms are being cleaned in late afternoon so it happend 3 times that we came back from sightseeing and the room wasn't cleaned yet and towels werent changed. Rooms are spacy but very dark, not enough light.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475926273~“Great location, good service from hotel staff”~The buffet like most hotel breakfasts lets the hotel down. The scrambled eggs were a weird creamy colour, the fruit was not ripe (rock melons etc). A shame we ate breakfast elsewhere for the remainder of our holiday. We couldn't fault the location, and the easy access to amenities and transport. The staff are absolutely fantastic.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475746130~“Enjoyed going back”~I stayed here for the second time, this time over Christmas 2016. Loved the novelty of having breakfast on Christmas morning in the hotel. Staff were nice. Had a comfortable stay as before, this time with a handsome view of Collins St. Was a bit stressed about keeping food cool for Christmas dinner in sweltering weather, but all was well. Note: you can fit a full sized wine bottle and about a kilogram of cheese, plus some fruit, in the hotel room fridge, but not much more as it's a compact sized bar fridge. I would definitely stay here again but can do without the family related Christmas stress.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475744167~“Great Location ”~Enjoyed our stay here, great location for shopping, great variety of stores, cafe's & restaurants. Close to DFO's & malls. Taxi stand at the door step. Rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable, linen was good but towels & housekeeping some days was a little shabby. Big thank you to Sarah for providing great service at the desk.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475487122~“Customer service is an oxymoron”~Having stayed here previously and thoroughly enjoying it, the change in 6 months is nothing short of miraculous. Front desk staff that feign interest but don't actually listen to your complaints, hidden charges that take 5 days to be refunded, blinds that allow the bright street lights in Collins Street to brighten up your room throughout the night and lastly, the dulcet tones of hammer drills starting at 0600. Granted the last complaint is possibly not the fault of the hotel but it really added to my sense of dread. It felt like I was staying in a backpackers in downtown Prague. The concierge staff downstairs are brilliant but those upstairs are bordering on insolent and disinterested. That is obviously a generalisation, because I'm positive that not all staff could be that poor at trying to sort my issues. The fact is I gave up trying to voice my concerns, the staff didn't seem interested. Anyway, as a plus the breakfast was slightly better than average and the hotel is close to all the ill at ease walking the streets of Melbourne, that's probably a bonus and cheaper than the theatre if you're looking for some matinee entertainment that's cheap.~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_475416617~“Reasonable but expensive”~Hotel was just like a standard Novotel but construction was going on which made it difficult to sleep , concierge was not very good with information we were sent to the wrong place several times. Didn't eat or drink there as it was expensive~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475387266~“Good Central Location”~The limited frontage onto Collins Street belies the size of the hotel that is hidden behind the street facade. The Car Valet service is recommended - though make sure you give them plenty advance warning of requiring your car back - can take 20-25mins. The staff are helpful & friendly. The rooms are nice. The gym facilities though a not that great - they have a poor location within the hotel.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_475372172~“Home town get away.”~We love this hotel. Family, family, family. It's in a fabulous position. We catch a train from our home to have a quick city getaway. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. Anything to please you. Breakfast was fresh, and had quite a variety. I asked for poached eggs and spinach, that was not a problem!!! We just love to hang out in the lounge area to catch our breath after a days activty. I would like to see more variety of healthy options on the bar snack list! Highly recommend this hotel to any family!~5~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_475177411~“Amazing Staff - if you want to feel at home, here is the place to stay”~The staff were absolutely brilliant! Especially Andrew (concierge), Maddison and Michael (duty manager). My hubby had an incident with the lid of a taxi boot. He ended up bleeding quite badly from the large cut on his forehead and the staff were absolutely amazing. He had a towel provided straight away so he did not get a spot of blood on his suit or white business shirt, First Aid was there before we even walked in the door and patched him up. We also had Andrew (concierge) assist me later that night as my hubby's wound was still bleeding and he was contemplating going to the doctors. Andrew did some investigations on doctors for us and referred us to a surgery for the next day (as nothing close by was open that night). But with some extra supplies from First Aid, we managed to stop the bleeding. We could not have had anyone be more attentive to my husband's and my needs. We were certainly at the right place in the circumstances as we could not have been better looked after and cared for. For the next two days we had staff enquiring how my husband was as we walked by. Amazing staff! Great location because it is right in the centre of things but we would stay there again simply because of the staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_474846979~“Beyond brilliant”~I stayed at the Novotel on Collins because it is so convenient and close to everything.

review_474434469~“Visit with 2x 80 year olds ”~Family visit with 2 eighty year olds in tow, concierge staff x 4 all fantastic in assistance of finding walker for 1. Central location is vital for ease of getting elderly around and easy access to lobby was paramount.

review_473799283~“In the Heart of it all! ”~We recently stayed at the Novotel as we were attending a friends wedding. The check in process was quick and the staff were really welcoming after a long flight. The rooms were nicely appointed. We were a bit of a walk away from the lifts but it meant we didn't hear any other guests.  When we did have a problem with the room the staff were quick to fix the issues.  Beds were comfy and we took full advantage of the pillow menu. Which was excellent as someone who loves a harder pillow it was great to have options.  Check out was speedy and the staff were lovely again even offering to organize us a taxi to the airport.  The hotel is in walking distance to great shopping, excellent cafes and restaurants. You really are in the heart of the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

My sister and I spent two night at Novotel Hotel on Collins which was an excellent choice, perfect location everything is just around you and amazing helpful and friendly staff, very good rooms, maybe beds could be better. And best of all shopping center is connected to the hotel. Highly recommend visiting Melbourne and if you did, make sure to be at Novotel on Collins hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473408681~“Great Location”~The Novotel on Collins is as it says located on Collins Street which is one of the main central streets in Melbourne. It is therefore well located for the shops, restaurants, Federation Square and the River. The entrance is through a doorway on Collins Street which houses the Concierge and you travel up in the lift to the third floor which houses Reception and a Bar area. The reception staff were really friendly. Whilst our room had a very average view from the windows it was modern, clean and very comfortable. Wifi is free if you sign up for the hotels membership scheme.  The hotel sits above an exclusive shopping Mall. The Reception area and the foyer house a fascinating display of green glass latterns the like of which I have not seen before. There is a small gym and a pool which are adjacent to the open foyer area but some floors up which makes for a very different back drop. We enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would return.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473323615~“nice hotel”~Near Everything in town. The service is excellent . The room has very spacious and clean. The only short coming is the internet; it was very slow even by paying premium. overall the hotel is highly recommended.~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472804717~“Business Class”~We used to stay here once or twice a year but don't stay in Melbourne much these days. This time we used the airport Skybus and their city hotel shuttle service - which was very efficient and professional. We were very impressed right from arrival a couple of hours earlier than check in time - expecting just to drop off bags - but were happily allocated a room. We're only Accor Silver it's the first time we've found a complimentary drink voucher for each guest staying not just one per room. The bar staff were happy to dispense the complimentary drinks without feeling the need to explain that vouchers only entitle guests to a tap beer or house wine. Had dinner and breakfast in Lane restaurant. Food choice and quality was very good and the service was excellent. The dinner waiter was obviously keeping a close watch on his tables - attending to everything without being intrusive. The whole dining experience felt very much like dining in Business Class -especially with the waiter taking the trouble to call us by name. Stay here again? Certainly would!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_472791890~“Love the location”~Stayed here whilst in Melbourne, Extremely central to everything. Close to the major shopping, all restaurants and bars.

review_472499249~“Perfectly situated in the heart of Melbourne”~Had the pleasure of staying here for our visit during the comedy festival. Walked right by the understated entrance at first, not that it is hard to find with the large sign out the front!  Service was friendly and helpful on arrival and check out. The room was clean and very spacious. The bed was very comfortable and room service was great. My only criticism, and a bit of a first world problem, was that the television was too far away from the bed (room 1227) to see. As I said, not an issue really. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to friends.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472242668~“Average at best.”~First of all lets just say the hotel wasn't what I would call a 4 out of 5 stars hotel. The room my partner and I had was a disabled persons room. Small mirror, and extra bed put in our room ( which we didn't need ) the king bed we had was just two doubles put together. You pay $265 a night could expect a bit more then that.  The night we went down to the bar I asked for a cosmopolitan and the staff member said to me " I'd recommend you get something else we are too busy to make it". Also in the morning we had to leave we went down for a buffet breakfast which I was told when booking that we would get one. & we were told we could not get in to get one. All in all a very average place. Wouldn't go there again & spend that much money for something so crap.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471053829~“Not the Novotel Standard”~Our recent stay at Novotel on Collins was a little disappointing. This Novotel was not the normal Novotel standard we expected. The breakfast was very disappointing for the price. Very limited selection and the fruits didn't look fresh. Being a Sunday morning they were not busy at all. However our executive room was nice and big. It's a shame they don't include complimentary bottle water with this room. The best thing about this hotel was the location.~3~3~5~3~4~3~4~nan

review_469283804~“Better then expected”~Got an upgraded room because of the membership. It was big, clean with a nice bathroom, and soundproof. But probably the most important thing is that the staff is really dedicated and try to do their best by helping you what ever question you have. It's starts from the vallet if you have a car to the people on the reception. Thanks to all of them trying to sort out the big problems I had with Hertz and the small questions regarding Qantas. One improvement could be the place of the breakfast as it is really noisy in the morning. Too bad than the breakfast buffet is really nice. For sure one of the best Novotel I have ever seen yet.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469280464~“Perfect location, great service”~We visit Melbourne regularly but normally for longer than a couple of days. On these occasions we choose to stay in an apartment.  This time our visit was only 2 nights so we chose the Novotel. Mainly because of it's location and it had good reviews here, other hotels we were considering did not. The location was perfect for us, my husband was working one day so it was very comfortable for me to fill my day in coming and going. The Bourke street Mall is a short walk through The Block Arcade and on the Saturday it was full of amazing buskers. The shopping is all within a short distance. We did online checkin, being a member of Accor Plus so checkin was fast and efficient. Checkout was just as efficient Every enquiry we made was answered with a smile and an answer..  The room was clean and comfortable, pillow menu meant we had a choice and we slept well. We had block out window furnishings. The bathroom was clean and roomy. Our only complaint was the coffee in the room, I am not a coffee snob or maybe I am but we do enjoy a good cup of coffee first up and the instant variety supplied here just doesn't cut it. We couldn't drink it, I think for a hotel of this standard it should supply something better, disappointing. The breakfast buffet was adequate but the variety of dishes was not as extensive as some other hotels we have experienced. Just past reception there is a water station which is kept full and cold all day. This is a great idea and I took advantage of the lemon infused water many times over our 2 day stay. All in all we really enjoyed the hotel and would love to stay here again when next in Melbourne for a short stay.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_468232211~“Very Lush One Night Stay”~I arrived at Novotel on Collins and was greeted at the Collins street entrance and put into a lift to check in on level 3. The greeters and check in staff were lovely! I had been upgraded which made me even happier. If you have difficulty walking (injury/distance wise) or are in a wheelchair prior to booking ask to be put in a room closer to the lifts as my room was a marathon away from the lifts. Room was very nice indeed and clean. Shower is amazing it's like rain. Nice big towels too!! Room service was really nice and I ordered brekkie to be delivered to my room. On check out the hotel staff held my bag while I attended a work meeting and then I arrived back to collect me bag and catch the skybus back to the airport. Central location, shops and food all around hotel, if you love shopping defiantly stay here! I'd return and stay at Novotel on Collins again. Thank you for a pleasant and stress free first time trip to Melbourne~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467416946~“OK for Business Tavellers”~Good quality, very well positioned if soulless hotel in Collins St. Conveniently positioned for all centre Melbourne activities. Rooms pretty average and without any pretense at generating ambiance of any kind. Didn't eat there but bar good and staff reasonably friendly. Good for business stay but I think only attractive for short stay holiday makers.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

This hotel offers value for money.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467137724~“If you hate someone in a wheelchair... get them a room here.”~The Novotel on Collins is a nice place to stay, unless you are in a wheelchair. In which case, you'll get room 1054... a journey on the tenth floor that I promise if the hotel management tried to reach in a wheelchair, they would collapse from exhaustion trying to push their chair on carpeted flooring to this poorly designed room.  Also if your in a wheelchair you don't get access to the pool area or the gym area because they have two sets of steps in places where they could easily put ramps to accommodate you... so they simply don't care or nobody has bothered to inform them that people in wheelchairs use gyms too.  The beds in the rooms are dangerous because they move around.. so if your trying to transfer from a wheelchair, you stand a good chance the unachored bed will slide from under you. The toilet seat doesn't have a back on it so there is nothing to hold you up if you need to lean back or have any back support. Also... I wonder who the genius was that put the ONLY main standing light in the room that requires the person to use a foot pedal to turn it on in a room for people in wheelchairs... Hello? For me personally, the worse part of our stay was the fact that when I was sold the room I was told that "all rooms" have a bathtub in it... apparently I got the only room in the place without one, another friend I spoke too staying over that weekend said he had a bathtub in his accessible room ... I was very annoyed by that. Nice water pressure for a shower but I was hoping to have a nice relaxing bath and felt pretty ripped off. I aired my complaints to the front desk and the general manager and I hope they will rethink sending people in wheelchairs on that very long march to room 1054... Yeah... past 53 other rooms if you follow the directions on the wall of the 10th floor.. I feel sorry for any elderly people they send on that death march. (g) Also in the middle of the night my movies froze up... the only way I got them to turn back on was I unplugged the box behind the television so it reset. On the plus side.. that bed was really comfortable and the 'pillow menu' was nice.. we were able to get extra pillows no problem.~2~nan~5~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_466655389~“Great central location”~Fabulous location, central to CBD laneways and shopping. All staff we encountered were all courteous and friendly.

review_466637752~“Brilliant location”~There were a few things about this hotel that were not great, but the location made up for all of them. Also the reasonably priced valet parking was a winner. Biggest negative was that it was pretty noisy - both from outside and also from the hall. The rooms were clean and satisfactory with good ammenities, the service was good and staff were great. Only other gripe was that the TV emitted a lot of light and we couldn't work out how to turn it off. Having said that, we will definitely be back.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
