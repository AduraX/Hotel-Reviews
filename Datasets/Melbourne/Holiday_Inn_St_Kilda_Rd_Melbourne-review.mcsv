review_278310858~“Very central for the St Kilda street market”~Stayed here for our last night in Melbourne. Right in the middle of the St kilda Bay Area. The street market starts right outside the hotel. There is street parking around the hotel so convenient for meeting our friends. Beds were comfortable and there was no street noise on the 4 th floor even though it was Saturday night. Lots of nice restaurants around the hotel and there is a bar and restaurant in the hotel although we only had drinks in the hotel. Free wifi which. Was good for checking in on line pre flight. The hotel was just across the road from the amusement arcade and fun fair so good position if you were spending the weekend in the area with children.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan

Nice sandy beach. Small swimming pool. Good restaurant and bar. helpful staff.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
