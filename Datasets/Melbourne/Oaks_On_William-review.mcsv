review_479031118~“Perfect for a quick trip”~Stayed in a studio for 2 nights and would happily return. Affordable and probably one of the best options for the price. Studio was spacious, modern and well furnished. Kitchenette was more like a full kitchen, great for self catering. Downsides were very minor - a tad dark and air stagnant without door open/air con going. Location excellent. Thought we'd miss our flight but taxis queue out front of a morning ready to go.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_479029884~“Over night stay”~have stayed here quite often for over night catch up's in Melbourne with friends. Oaks on William is pretty central to most restaurants and close to public transport. Staff have always been friendly and helpful and our rooms have been clean tidy and often with a view of the gardens.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_478639735~“Oaks on William ”~I booked a studio apartment for my daughter based on the reviews I had read. I was not disappointed because the reviews were very accurate. The room was spacious , comfortable and clean. Nice balcony with an amazing view. Very centrally located.   The staff are very polite and friendly . I had a great time and would definitely recommend staying here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478535534~“Poorly equipped for self catering”~We recently stayed at Oaks on William with another couple we were teavelling with. We had selected Oaks as our plans were to have breakfast and several other meals in one of our rooms. This was our third hotel on a trip to south eastern Australia and the first two hotels had worked well with our self catering plans. It was clear from the start Oaks do not put much in the way of resources to self catering guests as both rooms did not have coffee facilities, there were odd numbers of knives forks and dishes our room had a kettle base and no kettle and I could go on Also I cannot remember the last time I stayed in a hotel without complementary wifi. These days wifi is a utility. the hotle did provide 30 minutes free every day but once you logged on the clock started and that would also be the start of the next 24 hours Hotel is in a good location in the City across from a park and next to the stop for the free tram that cirlces the City~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_478166780~“Good for the price”~Stayed at oaks on William for one night as a city stay and would say it's fairly good. We had a one bedroom apt on the 32nd floor overlooking Flagstaff gardens. The view was really nice. The room itself was good. Clean. The kitchen had a bit of a retro laminate look but did the job. The bed was comfortable. Only negative was the bathroom exhaust fan. It didn't sound good, as in "it's going to blow up in a minute bad". Turning the switch off didn't turn it off either. I'm sure they can fix it but was quite annoying. The price for the room was quite cheap for Melbourne standards so I really can't complain. If you aren't expecting 5 star luxury this place is fine~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478051687~“Great location, nice little balcony”~I enjoyed my stay at the Oaks on Williams. Helpful staff, nice clean room and was stoked to be up high with a small balcony to chill on. 10 min wall to food and shopping in town. Beautiful park across the road if you're keen on a nice leisurely walk..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477899945~“Great stay”~We arrived quite late in the evening and we found the reception staff very welcoming and friendly. Our room was on the 18th floor and when we drew back the curtains and walked out onto our balcony we just went 'wow'! The view of the lit up buildings and the big wheel (Melbourne Star) was fabulous. The view was just as stunning early the next morning when we watched several hot air balloons glide through the skyscrapers - looking like they were going to crash! We liked the modern décor of our room and it was very clean and spacious and lighting was good especially for reading in bed. There was a full oven and large fridge/freezer and a small dishwasher. Basic utensils meant a simple meal could be cooked if desired. The free tram stops very nearby and this will take you to all the attractions as well as give you a tour of the city. Queen Victoria Market is very close. There is a very small IGA a few yards away but a better bet is to go to either Woolworths (or Coles) in the QV centre near Victoria State Library which is about a 10 min walk away. There is a large laundry room on floor 3A with more washing machines and dryers in one place than I have ever seen before! The only slight quibble I have, and it is the reason I have not given 5 stars, is the free wi fi access. It was explained to us that it was only 30 mins in 24 hours and this would have been fine for just checking emails. However, we did not realise that the 30 mins were consecutive so if you only log on for 5 mins you cannot do so again until the next day! unfortunately, this meant we missed a one off chance to meet an old friend who emailed us to meet him when he found himself unexpectedly in Melbourne. Not the hotel's fault, I know, but as we were visiting from the UK we were gutted to miss him.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_477465523~“Clean, Modern, Comfortable.”~I requested a room with city views and was so satisfied with the room I was given. The views were awesome!  I stayed here due to exams being held in the city, and found the hotel quiet and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and modern. No reason why anyone would not want to stay here.  Mid-stay I received some sad news and had to return home/check-out early. The staff organised a taxi for me and called me from my room to let me know of the taxi's arrival. appreciated their efforts. Would definitely stay here again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_475432468~“Good comfortable stay”~We enjoyed our time here for a few days. We found it to be very central and within easy walking distance to the CBD.

review_475429184~“Super friendly staff & nice view!”~Indoor lightings not my favorite kinda creepy but it's has a great view facing the park. It's a self serviced hotel so be ware if u have many luggages u will need to grab them all into ur room by yourself.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474849960~“Oaks on William”~We had a wheel chair access room. The size of the room and bathroom was very good. Everything was easily accessed from the wheelchair. My only complaint was the parking. There was nowhere in the street to park while you unloaded the car, this was very hard for a person in a wheelchair .onsite parking was the only alternative and the price was exhorbitant.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474817392~“A great stay!!!”~I have stayed several times at this hotel. In fact it is my preferred hotel. I love the rooms - its a a layout that is really cool. I also like how they are self contained with a little kitchenette. Most importantly here is the service. Wow - the staff are awesome and have catered for every request as well as super friendly!!! Would recommend this hotel to everyone! Thanks everyone on Oaks on William!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474815114~“Generally ok”~Was able to help with my early check in request. Friendly staff.

review_474794836~“Friendly Staff”~We have been travelling back and forth to Melbourne for medical reasons for the past 5 months, staying somewhere diferent every time. Oaks on Williams was a true stand out.  They offered the best location, reasonably priced and lovely clean rooms.  The best thing they offer though is the friendly staff at the desk. The lady that greeted us was super sweet and then every time we walked past reception we got a friendly smile ☺ makes all the diference! Keep up the great work.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474770457~“Ticked all the boxes”~From the cheerful greeting when we arrived, to the helpful farewell, Oaks on William is now our preferred place to stay in Melbourne. Our 28th floor room with balcony overlooking the city, was very clean and provided all we needed for our 3 night stay. Very quiet, comfortable bed and quiet air conditioning. Plenty of cupboard space in the bathroom for toiletries for both of us. Close to the city and free tram, close to the Victoria Market - and opposite the Flagstaff Gardens for a wander in green space. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. We will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474002913~“Great Stay”~This accommodation was great. The room 1820 was exactly as it looked in the picture. The bed was great, the daily service was great, check in was easy. A liitle signage on parking would be helpful. Just FYI the carpark is quite tight if you are driving a larger/longer car it could be problematic. It was however extremely convenient $30 a night I don't how that compares but the convenience factor was worth it. In/Out privelleges are a bonus, but with the free tram practically outside the door, you hardly need your car.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473929212~“Clean and comfortable”~Comfortable walk to the city. Parking is tight, so not good for a big car, but ideal for a small car and is behind the hotel. Room was modern, nice and clean and comfortable. Slept well. Would stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473873982~“One Night Stay”~I wouldn't rate this place 4.5 stars as advertised on their website but staff were friendly and room was only $150 on a Sunday with a request for late check out of 12pm was only an extra $20. Rooms were clean but the view stole the show..was amazing. Nice placement over looking Flagstaff Gardens :)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473774208~“A very happy stay”~A reasonably priced hotel right in town. Clean and modern. Hot, high pressure shower. Lots of storage in the mirrored cupboards in the bathroom. Superb balcony views from the higher levels, especially at night. Handy bedside light meant I could read without waking my partner. Fridge/freezer with ice and water jug. Maybe we were lucky, but our room was very quiet, no noisy neighbours at all. We were delighted with our weekend stay here, it met all our expectations.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472526192~“Standard ”~A hotel for a price - not in the centre of town more on the edge but Melbourne is very walkable all payed out in a grid - so easy to get around - there are some open spaces nearby. Rooms are basic standard~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472347567~“Awesome location and perfect studio apartment”~By far my most amazing stay in Australia! i was totally blown away by the clean and big rooms, with fantastic amenities, beautiful view from the balcony, comfortable bed and huge bathroom with a rain shower. I enjoyed my stay very much at Oaks on William which also overlooked the gardens from my room and always woke up feeling refreshed and happy. The nightview was even more amazing and on a good day, you can even see stars up above you :) The staff were also very friendly and helpful and were always ready to answer any of our doubts and queries about the hotel. Location was perfect and a nice stroll will bring you to Flinders street. If you'd fancy a tram ride, there's a tram in the free tram zone to a stop relatively near the hotel and you can walk back from there! Also about a 10 minutes walk to Southern Cross Station where there's a huge Coles store for you to get your groceries or necessities :) There was also an airport transfer available at the hotel at a low cost, which brings you right to the airport in about 30 mins (on a sunday) The wifi was unfortunately only limited to only 30 mins per day which was a little annoying but otherwise happy to overlook it because of the other amazing features of the room :) Would HIGHLY recommend a stay here!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471749023~“Outstanding !1”~Stayed here recently for a few days at first though location might not be so good but it was fantastic. Within the free tram service for CBD so very easy to get around from here and so near to the brilliant Victoria Markets and loads of great restaurants and jazz clubs.

review_471267436~“Nice studio apartment ”~Stayed here for an overnight getaway and it worked out great. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen well enough equipped even though we only made tea. Appreciated having the milk. The staff was very friendly and helpful. On the downside , Room 1006 looked out at another building extremely close by. Had to keep the shades drawn.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471004560~“Enjoyable Stay”~We were the first people to occupy the apartment on the 34th floor. So high, we had a fantastic view over the city especially at sunrise. The apartment was large, with well equipped kitchen - washing machine, tumble drier, fridge, freezer, cooker, toaster but minimal crockery, cutlery and cooking equipment. The bedroom had a good king-size bed, large wardrobe (but only four hangers until we requested more) and no drawer space - we had to store most of our clothes in the kitchen cupboards! Being new, there were teething troubles - the telephone didn't work, nor did the standard wifi in our room. Mentioning these problems to reception, they were unfailingly brilliant at sorting them out, particularly Ashish the manager, Alfredo, Roxanne, Anna and Sana. The telephone was mended, and we were given special wifi codes to access wifi 24 hours a day, rather than the standard 30 minutes a day. Good maid service - room cleaned, towels, flannels, milk, tea, coffee replenished daily. Great location next to Flagstaff Gardens and handy for the free inner city trams. With attention to detail, and getting over teething problems, Oaks on William will be brilliant. We would certainly stay again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_470833753~“Great location, great potential but some things could have been better”~We stayed in a one-bed apartment on the 18th floor which was accessed by 2 lifts at the beginning of February. The location was super overlooking a park. There was a balcony with a table and 2 chairs which we could not use as it was always covered in bird seed, presumably this came from a floor above, and as a result the table and chairs were covered in bird droppings which were never cleaned up during the 3 days we were there. The furniture and furnishings were fine but I took a look at the cutlery and crockery and put it straight through the dishwasher before I was prepared to use it as some plates had smears of food remnants on them.  It was good to have a washing machine and dryer in the apartment but I found there was a smell coming from the washing machine and on investigation found sludge and small stones in the rubber ring. I cleaned it out myself and then informed reception who said they'd inform housekeeping. The ceiling was rather strange, as if unfinished. The tiles inside were exactly the same as on the balcony outside. See attached photo. Lots of potential but the apartment needs to be looked after better.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_469985675~“A good, well located,serviced apartment”~Six enjoyable nights at Oaks on William - its probably not quite as nice as the PR pictures, but still perfectly acceptable. Apartment reasonable sized, everything working OK although the Wi-Fi had it's idiosyncrasies, and a quick daily service which was just right.  Three additional plus points were: Free Zone tram station immediately outside; by hotel standards a reasonably equipped gym; and a good quick laundry.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_469919217~“Great place to rest your head”~Great place to stay whilst sightseeing. Has great amenities such as dishwasher, toaster, kettle, fridge as well as pots & pans. A home away from home. Great if you want to stay in if you are on a budget as food is quite expensive in Australia in comparison to the UK.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469760687~“The reception staff very friendly but apartment disappointing”~Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The studio apartment that we booked was functional with a small kitchenette and balcony overlooking the park. The rooms did not look as good as they did online. The complex was a bit tired looking. Thirty minutes free internet per day was annoying with no free internet in foyer .  The location was quite good The apartment was about a 5 minute walk to Victoria market and 10 minute walk to Elizabeth street Next time I visit Melbourne I I would probably pay more and stay somewhere nicer It is but good place to stay if you on a budget~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan
review_469530834~“Nice location”~Nice location - close to CBD and train station literally across the street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and spacious (we had a park view).

review_468974823~“Great view of Flagstaff Gardens”~Decent rooms providing overlooking the Park with balcony. Good staff and service throughout. Small gym useful. Easy reach to all town locations.

review_468652316~“very clean staff very friendly”~We were on the eleventh floor, our check in time was 2 but we stopped by at 10.30am to drop our bags of and were pleasantly surprised to find our room was ready. Impressive view at night from balcony, hot night and so we left sliding door open all night. Very happy to find an opening window let alone a door. Staff friendly and obliging. We used the free city circle tram to get to Etihad which is worth knowing. Overall no complaints!!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

No minibar at all probably will look elsewhere for my next stay~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467478594~“Perfect for our trip”~Staying in Melbourne with the family, had two 'apartment' rooms. Well equipped, furnished and finished. The location is perfect, on the South East corner of Flagstaff Gardens and easy walking distance to CBD and riverside attractions. The hotel has a great gym and even a laundry (very useful for a family of 5!). Staff were very friendly and helpful and parking was a breeze. Will definately return on our next Melbourn Trip.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_466017114~“Nice Appartement Hotel Good Location”~Stayed for a week on business, great front of house staff always very welcoming and friendly. Rooms very spacious and extremely clean, good work always from the housekeeping staff only reason it's getting 4 and not 5 is the room had a poor view at the back straight into an office meeting room needed to keep curtains close for any privacy, room was 1608 if booking upfront as for a front or side view room, front has nice views across the park opposite.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_465429748~“Lovely property, great location, super cafe! But housekeeping needs improvement.”~I would first like to address some recent reviewer comments: The reviewer who stated it's not a hotel...she's absolutely right and readers should know this. This property bills itself as "serviced apartments in Melbourne City". This term seems more accurate to me. As an environmentally responsible measure, towels don't tend to be automatically changed every day, and I think the same thinking is being applied to the bedsheets The bed was, however, nicely re-made every day and i didn't mind the sheets not being changed daily. With over 200 rooms, imagine the impact on the property's electricity use, water, and soap down the drains if that were the case (not to mention the housekeeping staff's fatigue!). I certainly don't change / wash my own sheets every day! Another recent reviewer mentioned among other things the level of housekeeping here and I completely agree, will get into that. I just wanted to add about the lack of a real coffee maker, given the coffee culture in Melbourne in particular, it doesn't seem surprising that a drip coffee maker (North American-style) is not provided. Of the gazillions of cafes in Melbourne putting out gorgeous, delicious product, you won't find one that will pour a simple cup of what we call coffee (thank goodness) - it simply doesn't exist! So, we get a kettle with tea bags and yucky instant coffee. NOW THE REVIEW! We stayed here on the recommendation of a friend who had stayed here previously.  Room: We had a studio park view room and we were surprised by how big and bright it was. Loved the colours. The furniture is not luxurious (a reviewer mentioned the "plastic" chairs) but it is quirky, modern and fun. Plastic chairs didn't bother me as I was planning to be out of the room rather than sitting on them! I did use the bean bag chair as an ottoman though. The room looked the same as in the picture on the site. We used the safe in the room; it worked fine and held a laptop no problem. The wall decor in rooms and throughout the property is mostly views of Melbourne which I thought was an inexpensive and fantastic way to showcase the city to visitors. Not a cookie-cutter, corporate hotel chain decor, instead highlighting the city we were in. We found the room and the whole property to be quiet, despite the location on the edge of the CBD. The slider on the balcony blocked most sound, save for the occasional faint tram bell, and that wasn't a bother. The bed was comfortable and the room got quite dark at night. The balcony is a fantastic feature and if you're facing the park, you'll be flooded with afternoon sunshine there - it's lovely! The evening view is beautiful, too. Kitchenette: This also was a much-appreciated feature and we used it. There was a full-size fridge, small oven (yes, oven!), microwave, dishwasher, a small cooktop (two burners), a sink and electric kettle with tea and instant coffee supplies. The property provided all that was needed for washing up - detergent for the apartment-size dishwasher, and hand washing soap/cloths and dish rack. Guests who wish to prepare meals in their rooms can do so easily with the large fridge storage and cooking facilities. There is an IGA X-press (groceries) on Queen St, not far. The only small drawback was maybe housekeeping should inventory the cutlery and dishes so that guests have a consistent, reasonable number of items. For example, we had lots of small/large plates but only two mugs for tea, and one spoon but a few forks, etc. There was a corkscrew (yay), baking sheet in the oven, and some serving utensils. Bathroom: more on that below. It was a large bathroom. There is no bathtub if you care for one, but that makes the glass walk-in shower even more accessible for all. The large rainshower showerhead was DIVINE, the pressure and temperature were lovely - you will have no complaints on that score. Liked the modern styling of the glass, no-door shower stall (unconventional yes, but it doesn't need a door). Toiletries provided were fine and refreshed daily. Wi-Fi: we paid extra for wifi and it worked well. We have found in the past that in Australia, wifi is not as readily available and inexpensive as other parts of the world. This visit we saw things are improving though and I would encourage the property to consider providing guests wifi as part of the room rate.  Front desk: very helpful and friendly. We had no specific issues to be settled by them. Laundry room: big and bright in a windowless room on floor 3A, next to the gym. If you have lots to wash, the $$ can add up. $3 to wash, $3 to dry, and $2 for a one-use pack of powdered laundry soap. Lots of machines! Note there is no bill change machine there but the vending machines there for drinks/snacks might help you. Brother Thomas: this is the cafe next door. GO THERE! Friendly staff, delicious lattes, tasty breakfasty items (I didn't have time for full-on meals) and generally a cool place to hang out. It has free wifi. Only open until 3 on weekdays. You can enter from the hotel and from the street. I think there were a couple of tables outside as well. These would be shaded in the morning. Area: Check out your neighbour across the road, Flagstaff Gardens. Very beautiful and peaceful. All manner of activities going on there including group exercise lessons, quiet reading, strolling, sunbathing. Grab a delicious takeaway breakfast or lunch at Brother Thomas or the Queen Victoria Market (about a 7 min walk), and take it across to enjoy it in the park! Also, when you need to go farther afield, take the tram! You'll be starting your journey in the free tram zone in Melbourne's CBD so take advantage of this charming feature of Melbourne. You can obtain a Myki ("my key”) card, and add value to it, at Flagstaff rail station across from the property. FINALLY, Housekeeping: dear Oaks property management, this needs help badly. Although the room seemed generally clean, I immediately noticed where it had not been cleaned (and i'm pretty forgiving!). Example: bathroom baseboards - the tops of them are wide and white, but they were covered in a gunky dark dust that at one point I just had to wipe down myself. Ugh. Also, the vent over the shower had some hanging gunky dust in it. And even worse, the air conditioner unit on the wall in the room had a thick frame of moldy-looking dust on all sides on the wall around it and, unfortunately, it's right overtop of guests' heads in the bed. Ick. Please note these things were quite obvious; I didn't go looking for them. Also, during our stay we noted that our kitchen counter was not being wiped down. Further, the housekeeping staff member chose to leave our new dishwashing supplies and cloths under the sink sitting on top of the kitchen rubbish bin. Would rather not have fresh dish cloths/tea towels sitting there.  All that said, we did have a very pleasant stay here. We were comfortable, the room was bright, quiet, and generally well-appointed. I would still recommend the hotel; it offers a lot to travellers. I would simply suggest that the hardworking housekeeping team revisit its checklist items and pay special attention to a few specific items to deliver a cleaner product to your guests, who in many cases have flown a very long way to stay at your property!  Hope this was helpful as you make your decision. Enjoy your stay in beautiful Melbourne!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan
