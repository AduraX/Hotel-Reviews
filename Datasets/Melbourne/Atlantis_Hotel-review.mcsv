review_479113717~“"Great hotel, location and value for money"”~Stayed at Atlantis hotel midweek to Sunday, April 2017. Honestly, can't praise the staff enough, they were very accommodating, friendly and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Our room (926) was new, modern decore and very, very clean. I booked through the hotels online website and got an excellent rate with breakfast included. Considering the location of Atlantis, and having stayed at other hotels in Melbourne CBD, I can honestly say, when we visit Melbourne again, Atlantis will be our first choice of accommodation. Fantastic location - Spencer street train station, Factory outlet and Coles supermarket across the road. Thank you to all staff for making our holiday such an enjoyable experience.

review_478132590~“Good location. Clean ”~Stayed overnight for one night. The rate included breakfast. The location is brilliant - almost directly opposite spencer st station and a supermarket / dfo. I walked to the casino for dinner and it was a brisk 15 minute walk Breakfast was continental with the usual toast/ muesli and there was also some decent scrambled eggs and beans Had a long flight coming up so avoided the beans.  The staff pretty much sat at a table and chatted however were attentive when someone entered The room was small, however was clean and comfortable and had tea/ coffee and ice bucket The gym was excellent and had reasonable quality equipment and the pool was great. Until recently i have been a hilton traveller and decided to change my travel patterns as hilton were just too expensive. Have changed to beat value for money and this place is very good value for money, whilst imho not far behind the likes of sydney hilton, which has a similar size room The only gripe i have is beyond their control, the outside of the windows are filthy and whatever view there is is obscured by layers of dirt on the outside. Again, this is beyond their control, as there is a substantial construction site next door ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477279204~“Great price for location.”~Stayed here during a midweek trip to Melbourne, very reasonable prices for being so central. Southern cross is a hop down the street and the city circle picks up on the corner outside the hotel. What more can you ask for :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476228685~“Unprofessional”~On Saturday the 15th we stayed at this hotel. We were woken by a fire alarm and we evacuated the building. The staff were in over their heads and seemed to be untrained in an emergency situation. People were allowed to continue using the elevator or etc. Firefighters attended and the issue were under control. We were all sent back to our rooms with no information of what had happened or if any further risk. As we laid in bed the fire alarm continued for sometime as you could imagine we were in settled and going back to sleep was a struggle due to not knowing what was going on. We woke the next morning tired and obviously annoyed. We attended the front desk to check out and not a word was said, no sorry, no explanation of what had happened..all we got was "ok your good to go" I asked what had happened then the look on the receptionist face changed..."oh sorry there was a fire" " sorry for your inconvenience". They were shocked when we asked because they did not want to deal with the issue. I find this dangerous and very rude. We are paying guest and believe we should leave happy not tired and angry. Emails have been sent back and forth for a refund but they believe this is normal practice. I would not stay here as not being informed on what had happened and not wanting to address the issue until the customer brings the issue up. Very unprofessional and the worst hotel experience I have had thus far...money wasted~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475311454~“Lovely hotel, clean, modern, good amenities.”~My husband and I spent 2 nights at the hotel this week. Check in was great, very friendly staff. We got to our room and it was lovely, very modern, spotless, no issues at all with the room, very spacious.  We settled in then decided to go out, tried to put our iPads in the safe but it wouldn't work, we rang the front desk and we were told the maintenance guy was away so we could bring our things to the front desk and they'd put it in their safe.  The next day we decided to see what movies were on to watch that night, but we couldn't access the movies. We spoke to the front desk and they said they'd get someone to go and have a look while we were out n the afternoon. I got a phone call a few hours later to say that the movies couldn't be fixed but we could swap rooms if we wanted to. I said we'd think about it. When we got back we asked to have a look at the other room to make sure the movies were working, which they weren't when we had a look! We rang front desk again and told them. One of the girls came to the room to have a look, she said that as the maintenance person was away they couldn't do much, but she'd have a look herself. We decided to have a swim in the pool to relax, but when we got there we found the indoor heated pool really cold, not relaxing at all. When we got back to our room we were told that the movies in the other room weren't working either! Chloe was very apologetic and said she would deduct our parking fee from our total as compensation. This was very nice of her, and she was very polite and helpful the whole time this was going on. So we were left with a spare night with no movie to watch, very disappointing. things in the room need to be checked and maintained when guests leave each room. It was very disappointing and we wasted a lot of time trying to get it to work.  Overall I was very unhappy with the amenities at the hotel, and I won't be staying there again.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475142087~“Comfortable and accessable”~Easy access to and from Southern Cross. Public transport right there. Friendly staff and affordable. Clean and tidy. Many eateries within close proximity. Would not hesitate to book and stay again for any reason.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474280458~“Nice place; Good Value”~I stayed here for four nights in March. The room was clean, well equipped and comfortable. The staff are helpful and the venue has a good location within walking distance of everywhere a tourist would want to go.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473953728~“Reviews are way off- over rated and lacking”~This is one of the few occasions that trip advisor reviewers have let us down. Booked this based on the advice of travellers but seriously the only thing this place has going for it is location only if you need fast and no cost access to the bus, rail or airport transfer services. Good for people to know that this area and the blocks around it are one of the dingy parts of Melbourne cbd, by this I mean all the transient types that like to hang around railway stations , homeless people and those looking for trouble are attracted to this area, dirty as well.  Also in this part of town very few food options both the cheap and cheerful or anything special. You think you can get a good meal anywhere in Melbourne but that is not true. The hotel is like a back packers without the bunk beds. No security peep hole, no security chain on the door, no fire evacuation map on the back of the door- would have thought these things for an international chain hotel to be standard. No water glasses, no shower cap, no tea spoons. You get a tv, kettle, fridge, soap and towels pretty much. The room smelt so bad so we bought air freshener from the Coles across the road. The bathroom was clean but the room was not, dusty carpets and stains. This is budget with a capital B and not that cheap either. Staff in a coma, relaxing on their chairs behind the desk nothing could move them to stand up. Attitude perhaps because of the horrible area they are in? I agree with other reviewers, staff completely unmotivated should not be working in hospitality. Definitely would never return or recommend what an ugly way to finish a trip to Melbourne.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~1~nan
review_473558056~“A pleasant surprise :)”~We were fortunate enough to secure Adele tickets before they "officially" went on sale through American Express, so we were able to jump in quick and secure accomodation, before it become outrageously expensive. Just really needing a bed for the night, shower etc - the price was right for this hotel. $200 for a deluxe queen "view" room - plus parking, from memory $20. Honestly, some previous reviews and the price - I wasn't expecting a great deal, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Room was basic, but clean and everything we needed. Whilst no "mini bar", it didn't bother us as it allowed us to put our own drinks in the fridge and we spent quite a few hours looking out the (dirty ) window at Etihad Stadium having drinks before joining the masses to go see Adele. (I am sure most of the hotel's guests were also going to the concert !) lol.  The big thing for us, upon return and stumbling into bed, was just how quiet it was. Granted, we had the air con on which provided some background noise, but given how many people piled back to the hotel after the concert - and in high spirits - it was just so, so quiet. Didn't hear any hallway noise, or slamming doors etc - we had a great nights sleep ! Why 4 stars and not 5 ? Nitpicking, I guess - but the windows were filthy and the lifts were really, really slow. We ended up using the fire escape to the car park upon check out after waiting a lengthy amount of time for the lift. I guess it's understandable when a big event is on at Etihad Stadium and the majority of guests have attended and are all checking out at similar times. Would I start here again ? Yes, definitely for another event in the area and if the price was right~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472995986~“Basic, no frills.”~Basic hotel,nothing flash, no free wifi,parking extra but in saying this I has a room on 18th floor therefore was quiet but if you stayed on lower floors I could imagine it could be a lot of noise with traffic and trams. View nothing outstanding looking at Police Station or Football Stadium. Windows are very dirty. Room good size, basic decor. A couple of the towels has seen better days.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472886168~“Very central, good service and value”~The hotel is located very close to the Southern Cross Station and so to the Sky bus terminal (direct airport connection). Also very close to the city center. The rooms are clean, the staff is friendly and helpful. The price is fair. Free WiFi was not always easily available.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_472802083~“Good value for location”~The Atlantis hotel is an excellent Melbourne accommodation option for the budget conscious traveller - very comfortable rooms, convenient CBD location and pleasant staff. Convenience to airport Skybus was an additional benefit.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_472529185~“One night only.”~For one night only, this Hotel suited our need. Arriving via Skybus from Melbourne Airport after a10 hr. 30min. flight from the US  state of Hawaii, we need to be close to Docklands to catch a ferry to our home  town. Due to a lack of accommodation and high prices due to the Grand Prix being  in town, when this location came up, we booked quickly, before we left on our trip. Spencer Street has changed. Once a wind blown, deserted, unattractive west-end  of town, it has developed over time to cater for an influx of students, with  Southern Cross station as the hub, almost across the road. Food shops have  appeared, from an Asian supermarket,to a Patisserie and a huge Coles  supermarket within a little mall close by. Having to settle for a salad sandwich and a  meat pie at 5 pm contrasted strongly with the American delights we left behind -  such as burgers, BLTs, huge mountainous cheesecake slices and gorgeously  flavored coconut shrimp with salty, marinated fries. Back to reality they call it. Our room at Atlantis was on the 6th floor, with a window view across to Etihad  Stadium, the NAB building and Docklands. The image would be more spectacular..  and clearer...if the windows were cleaned. The grey outline of Melbourne visible  this Autumn morning was smeared with what looked like decades of grime. The room was OK. It was clean, tidy and spacious. Room to place bulging suitcases,  a room safe for essentials, coffee/tea making facilities, a fridge for the breakfast  yoghurt , an iron and a hairdryer. The bathroom was spotless, bright and large.  There was a lack of colour, no decorative touches, rather bland. The carpet was  stained. However this didn't detract from the positive touches. The front of house  staff were smiling, welcoming. The room felt safe and secure. It was also very  quiet which was good for us right then. I would recommend this Hotel as a good stopping off point, close to public  transport, shopping, the Harbor Precinct and the City.~3~nan~nan~5~3~nan~3~nan
review_471278056~“Great location, Great price”~Me and my hubby stayed here last Sunday night. Because of the motel's location, being close to Etihad stadium. Because we where going to the football. We were really happy with our room, the bed was super comfy, and the room was clean and quiet. The parking is responsibly priced too. I highly recommend this motel and we will definitely be staying there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471156764~“Great experience!”~Very clean!! If they had the windows washed I would have had a wonderful view (was on 17th floor). The hotel needs just a bit of care. It has been well loved and beginning to show it. Staff is VERY kind. The shower stall was ENORMOUS. Very luxurious bathroom.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_470560664~“Great value for money”~Stayed here multiple times when in Melbourne. Great location, with trams out front or around the corner, but easy walk into shopping area and DFO Southwharf, plus Ethihad stadium and the train station. Has above standard size hotel rooms with space for a sofa. Normal hotel facilities with very reasonable car parking fee. One window in room which can't be opened which was a shame, and needed cleaning on the outside. Also maybe a microwave could be an asset. Prefer the rooms with a view, and website spells out the type of room room are booking. Best deals usually on line, but a phone call can help if you wanting to clarify rooms or availability. And so quiet for a city location. Take advantage of the William Angliss college cafe next door in La Trobe street. Very cheap bakery produce can be bought that has been made by students during the day. It really is worth going into. Thankyou again Atlantis staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470208633~“Great hotel close to Southern Cross Station/Etihad/Skybus/Coles”~I was quite impressed with this hotel, especially the location for what we needed to be close to, ie Southern Cross station, Etihad, trams, Skybus, and Victoria Markets. Coles and DFO shopping are right across the road too. The bed was so comfortable that my fiancé who has back issues was able to have a full night's sleep and not wake up in pain. Two complaints only...there are no towel rails or USB ports. Other than that the room was well appointed and very clean. I'm not sure whether paying extra for a city view room was worth it as you only look at buildings from our 10th floor room. We'll definitely recommend this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469009114~“Overnight stay ”~Myself , my husband and another couple stayed here Sunday night after attending the Adele concert. This hotel is well positioned to Etihad stadium and Spencer St train station. Our rooms were on the 18 th floor so good view over the stadium and surrounding area . Our room nice size and very clean , disappointed that no free wifi, but you can walk across the road and get free wifi from DFO Spencer st . Other than that great cheap accommodation .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468371103~“Good location , clean, noisy air conditioner in our room”~This hotel has a very good location. We chose it due to its proximity to Etihad Stadium where we were going for Adele concert. Room was clean and comfortable enough but the aircon would stop and start every 15 min or so. Quite noisy.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_467131059~“Compact and great location”~A great location in the city of Melbourne.... we booked twin deluxe rooms fo five couples and although surprised that we had single beds .... the quietness and location surpassed our expectations....

review_467120093~“Cheap inner city stay”~Close to spencer st shops and trams this hotel is an easy stay mid range hotel. Decent pool and gym and clean rooms.  Didn't have a problem here as a place to lay ur head while exploring Melbourne it's a great economical hotel.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan

review_466413155~“Comfortable stay in a great location”~I have stayed here a few times over the last couple of years and this hotel is always consistently clean, affordable and an easy option for an overnight stay in Melbourne. It's a very easy walk into the city, sky bus and to the docklands so makes life pretty easy when you are in the Melbourne cbd. The rooms are of a good standard, functional and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a great option for convenience and if you need a minimal fuss, easy stay in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465934548~“Ok stay.”~My wife and I stayed on the 7th March for one night as our regular hotel was booked out. We have previously stayed at the Atlantis some time ago prior to the second tower being built so this was the first stay in the new 2nd tower.  We appreciated our request of a room higher up away from the elevators. The room was maybe a little basic for some however for us it was OK. Clean, comfortable bed (we both slept well) , linen was fine, tea and coffee provided and for our short stay we were happy. The staff were efficient on checking in/out not overly friendly but during busy times I guess you expect this these days. We paid $120 for a Tuesday night which was more than reasonable for a standard room in Melbourne. Would we stay again, yes given the location to Etihad Stadium, CBD, Docklands, Southbank, Casino ect.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~3~nan
review_465442518~“Great Location”~The Atlantis is listed as 4 star which I think is a bit of a stretch. Comfy, clean, good bed, but without some of the things you associate with 4 star. Only basic toiletries - soap, shampoo and conditioner, no herb teas in the rooms, no mini bar, breakfast was listed as "buffet" which does suggest a range of hot food included, and perhaps croissants or pastries. The only hot food was watery scrambled eggs and baked beans - and only bread - although did include fruit bread. All in all a little disappointing. Would be excellent if rated 3and a half.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464805342~“Good Value and Great Location”~We stayed 2 nights on arrival in Australia and 3 nights before returning to the UK. Main reason we booked this hotel was proximity to Southern Cross Railway Station and the Skybus terminal making it so easy to get around. It is also over the road from Coles supermarket plus it is located on the junction with Spencer Street and Latrobe so within the free tram zone and perfect for getting around the city with ease. The rooms are plain & functional but very clean with all facilities. Breakfast is basic but good enough. Staff are helpful and pleasant An all round good hotel which we recommend without hesitation.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464706220~“Very Disappointing. Not value for money”~We had recently stayed at the Atlantis and were pleased and that is why we went back. I wish we hadn't.  We are very regular holiday goers and have travelled to Bali, Whitsundays, Queensland etc etc. We also visit Melbourne several times a year.  We feel we are equipped to give a review!  What a disappointment, we paid $180 per night. To get none of the basics that hotels normally supply. No flannels,the only beauty products were soap, conditioner and shampoo. The hairdresser is so old I was almost scared to use it. The towels were hard and crunchy and only 1 pillow each. Yep ouch!  The final straw was we had a city view BUT the windows were seriously so dirty we could barely see out of them. I took a photo! So lastly to top it off we went to check out and they asked us to provide proof that we had paid for the second night because they had no record of it.  We are not negative people so I will end of a good note. The bed was super comfy!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464664403~“It did the job, but......”~5/5 for location, ideally situated a short walk from southern cross station, Coles, and CBD. The lobby gives the impression that your stay is going to be far more opulent than it really is. The rooms are in need of an update. The biggest disappointment was the pool. With child in tow we booked this hotel for the location and the indoor pool. How we had fantasised about relaxing poolside after a day's sightseeing. Have you ever seen the mad Russians bathing among icebergs? Well they had their training at the atlantis's pool. It was freezing and impossible to use. We tried on 2 consecutive days, as did fellow guests, and observed that a quick dive, one lap, and out for a hot shower was the norm. So disappointing.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_464394528~“Good stay”~This was the best value business level hotel I could find in Melbourne at short notice. Didn't have high expectations, but was better than expected.  A few points to make 1. Check in was easy and efficient. Interesting that I paid for the hotel upfront on arrival, which meant checkout was extremely fast.  2. No restaurant, but I think there was a breakfast room that I didn't visit. Was recommended the Italian next door to eat in the evening, and that place was average at best.  3. No wifi that I could see, although I did not look that hard and relied on personal hotspot.  4. Room was clean and well serviced.  5. No mini bar in the room, but vending machine downstairs 6. Bed comfortable 7. Door to the room did not close by itself, I had to remember to close it each time. Not the best security wise.  Overall, not a bad place and probably good value for money in the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464207592~“Good value in good location”~Stayed 2 nights on business. Room was spacious enough with expected facilities, except no freezer compartment in the fridge or toaster. The Coles supermarket just across the road is very handy & there is also a chemist in the same complex. Bed was comfy and the free Wifi is adequate for browsing & email, although you only get 1GB download every 12 hours. Higher speed packages are available for purchase but are excessively priced for the amount of downloads given. The pool is big and very well maintained. Parking @ $15 per night for guests is a bit steep. Would also be good if they offered some foxtel channels as well but hey, cant have everything. .~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan

Their gym was far better equipped than some of the supposedly 5 star hotels I have stayed in and their swimming pool looked great albeit I did not actually try it.

review_461351424~“Great location for what we wanted”~Good deal for $175, which included a buffet continental breakfast. Breakfast included scrambled eggs and baked beans, along with the usual continental type menu. Room looked new and modern, only downfall was one of the hand towels was damp and dirty, but not from previous use. Looked like it was dropped on a wet, dirty floor then folded and placed on the otherwise clean and dry towels. Police station is opposite and the occasion siren was very loud but otherwise traffic noise wasn't highly noticeable. 5min walk from Southern Station and about 10-15mins easy walk from the Melbourne Star. We had a room overlooking the stadium (not into it) but wouldn't bother paying the extra again for this view as not much else of interest apart from the police station dead in front and couldn't see the Melb Star. Another disappointment was no in room wi-fi, had to be in the lobby.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

I had breakfast then slept until 1pm (I had worked night shift). Walked to Flinders Street (easy 15 minute walk) to board bus for Bruce Springsteen concert at Hanging Rock. Reception staff kindly reprinted my ticket for concert as I'd left mine at home. I requested a late check out, left hotel at 11am and walked 2 minutes to Southern Cross station. Comfortable room, very reasonable pricing and breakfast was basic however very fulfilling.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
