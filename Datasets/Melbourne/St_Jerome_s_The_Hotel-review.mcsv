review_477581115~“Birthday surprise ”~The check in staff were rude and displeased to be serving us, and uninterested in customer service. The tents were fine, however the bathrooms were terrible. The toilet was flooded, it was dirty, and the lights didn't work. We immediately informed staff and were told to use another bathroom. When we went back to tent fifteen, the lights did not work. This was a luxury package and a high end price which certinately did not meet the standard you should get when paying for a "luxe" tent. When paying for a caravan park, even some free camping, there have been cleaner and better facilities. As it was our dad's 50th birthday we did not want to ruin the experience or the stay but we were definitely disappointed in the experience. The staff, other than those checking us in, were brilliant. They were accomodating, helpful and were genuinely interested in their jobs. However, we were extremely dissapointed in what we got for the high price we paid.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477573214~“awesome experience”~everything about this experience was amazing - for a couple who aren't able to get into the city much it was beautiful, romantic and the view was spectacular. The bedding and pillows were also really good quality - highly recommended for others~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476662664~“A Must Do!”~From the moment you walk inside St Jerome's you feel so welcomed and at home, The staff are so friendly and helpful. After you settle into your tent there are so many things that you can do at St Jerome's there no reason for you to leave. And why would you want to leave when you get such an amazing view of the Melbourne CBD. Would highly recommend it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476628669~“A fun glamping experience.”~We really enjoyed the experience at St Jerome's and most of the little perks offered. It was a lovely tent that was comfortable and we were greeted with a tasty afternoon tea. We had a fun time and enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop, tasty beverages and the central location. It was quite cool that you could text the reception for requests, although the walk to the desk wasn't far and they were usually very accomodating. I was disappointed however that when I sent a polite text at 8:57am querying when our requested 8:30am breakfast hamper was arriving, I received a less than polite response stating they are delivered at 1/2 hour intervals. To the best of my knowledge 8:30 is a half hour interval? If you are going to offer times for brekky, please stick to it. The macaroons and cocktails were delicious, the ice-cream was awful - I'm not sure what flavour they were trying to make? - and breakfast was mostly nice, however my tea was cold and we were given bowls though I'm not sure what they were for when the yoghurt came in a cup already? Overall, great fun, just a couple of things I believe you need to address to keep up to the standard you seem to be striving for.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475695742~“Okay, but not worth the price”~We stayed at St Jeromes - the Hotel, in a Lux Plus tent, for $480. We arrived on Good Friday.  Whilst the experience of staying in a tee-pee was cool, we feel as though for $480 we could have stayed in a lush hotel and had a more enjoyable time.  Cons: - Tablet provided for movies was only 60% charged when we arrived and must have been old because the battery didn't even last one TV episode before going flat - staff didn't have knowledge of what was open on Good Friday. A Strike Bowling voucher is included as part of the price but when we arrived we were told that Strike was closed and we couldn't do the bowling. So we made other plans to see a movie instead, only to receive a text message after 8pm advising that Strike re-opened at 8pm - bed was really hard... We both woke up with a sore back - hard to sleep because the noise of the traffic in the city was so loud Pros: - experience of camping in the city was nice - morning breakfast was good - bar and recreation area would be good in nice weather Overall we just don't feel like we got $480 of value. If it was cheaper (eg. $300) i would have given a higher rating.  I wouldn't recommend this to my friends.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475664206~“Quirky and novel concept ”~It actually saddens me to write this review as I came with my husband looking for a lovely relaxing getaway and unfortunately didn't get it.! Let me firstly start off by saying that the tents are fabulous. Everything you could possibly need and want is available to you. The free treats on arrival, complimentary ice-cream and free cocktail are all lovely touches that I could go on and on about. Unfortunately however, and I don't know if it was just our particular night that we stayed, there was this awful thumping music playing. I'm not sure if it was from the Strike Bowling right next door, but oh my goodness. When we arrived back at the campsite at 10:00pm right through to 3:30am , this hideous pulsing, loud beat was playing. It actually drove me a bit crazy.! As I write this review, I have not had a wink of sleep. This noise issue is clearly out of the campsites control, but I would definitely warn future guests that it could be a bit of a mood dampener and definitely is an issue if you're a light sleeper like me! On the whole, the staff are very helpful and friendly, breakfast is great, the tents are chic, cosy and well heated. You are required to share a bathroom with 2 other tents, which for what you pay, I think they could look into building separate slim bathrooms for guests. If you can request a tent that does not sit below a floodlight too, the light comes right through the tent during the night. Nevertheless, a very unique and novel concept in the heart of Melbourne City.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475649325~“Luxury camping amongst the concrete jungle”~Amazing facilities and a amazing place to stay with the feel of staying a luxurious hotel mix with camping. Upgraded with a dessert platter was delicious and also the upgrade cocktail breakfast was amazing also! service was 10/10 couldn't ask for anything more! Loved it~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474861742~“Outstanding Unique Experience”~The entire experience was so different but so much fun. The weather turned very nasty but it did not effect our stay at all. In fact it was fun snuggled up in a warm, water proof tent while the rain came down and the wind blew. Activities for the kids was great.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_474785046~“Awesome”~Was first time experience so had no idea what to expect. The venue was great, and the staff friendly and helpful. There are so many things to see and do from this location and I look forward to returning with friends.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474744820~“Amazing experience”~I cannot recommend this place any higher. It was such and amazing experience!! The staff were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful.

review_474375635~“Great experience for most.”~We were looking for something different to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary and my wife had always been interested in canvas tent camping, not for me at my age. Suggestions came about glamping which is becoming popular. St Jerome's reads well and indeed is superb. No need for a car, travel by train to Melbourne Central station and you are there. 20 great tents. We took the larger 5m square bell tent, air conditioned and splendidly appointed with queen bed, electric blanket, stocked fridge, wonderful surrounds with many comfortable lounges on a vast grassed surface. Your ensuite is very close by.Outdoor bar provide tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages and snacks beside a games area from 3pm til 11. Breakfast is served at your appointed time, comes in a hamper with contents aplenty. We are in Melbourne Central so there is plenty to do, food outlets galore shopping and bowling as well, and tram and train access very close by Ipad provided, gives you access to Stan movies. Finally staff are brilliant in all they do and rain is not a problem. Regularly fully booked so get in well in advance!~5~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473241352~“THE PERFECT FAMILY EXPERIENCE”~From the word go the kids were so excited and were spoilt by the team at St. Jerome's Hotel. The hotel catered for the whole family! The tent was amazing so spacious, and fitted out beautifully. There were also complimentary esky's filled with juice and treats for the kids and beverages for the adults. Unlimited bowling and laser tag at strike! Complimentary Messina Gelato which was to die for and breakfast. The package also included movies in the communal area with hot chocolate and popcorn. And don't forget the late check out at 12! My family did not want to leave, there was so much to do and the location was an extra plus, can't wait to go back. It was an awesome experience for the whole family a must do for the school holidays!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472561531~“A W E S O M E !”~What an incredible setup and experience! From the setting, to the accomodation, the service (top notch and super easy to communicate with), the wine and cocktails plus those 1 per centers that the more traditional hotels miss out or fail on (complimentary Smith Journal & Frankie Magazine, great drinks beyond mass market mainstream brands), this was by far the best stay in Melbourne I have had. Slept like a log and woke up to the sun beaming over the skyline and camp. 5 stars, awesome!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472063814~“Glamping at its best...”~I was looking to do something special for my husbands birthday and came across St Jeromes Hotel and Im so glad. Everything from the booking online to check in and check out was just fantastic. I booked the larger tent with a queen size bed and because it was my hubbys birthday there were balloons and champagne in the tent when we arrived which was great, its the small things that count and these things are so easy to organise with the staff. I ordered the antipasto plate to arrive at 5pm and it turned up right on time. The bathrooms were clean and the products, soap, shampoo etc were beautiful and smelt lovely. As the weather was cool our tent was snug and warm and I mightve had a bit of an afternoon snooze on the comfy bed after our late afternoon champagne and antipasto. After a wonderful nights sleep, and yes you do hear the city noises but I thought that was wonderful to hear the city sounds at night and it did rain overnight and I loved hearing the rain on the tent (took me back to my childhood holidays). Our breakfast box turned up spot on time and it was delicious along with the barista coffee/tea we ordered. After we checked out we were able to leave our bags while we discovered our city. Such an amazing place and I recommend it to everyone, young, old and families you wont be disappointed.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471123966~“pleasing”~A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! those are the letters i would use to describe this hotel. the outdoor tents was really something that put a happy shock on my face. the staff was very friendly to me in every possible way. the view is something i can't even describe how beautiful it is. i recommend this hotel~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470722202~“Glamping fun!”~Really enjoyed this. Arrived on a hot afternoon to a cool tent with beverages take the edge off. Perfect! We opted for the queen sized bed and the tent was superb - large, open and relaxing. The furnishings outside were very well done, with bean bag chairs, deck chairs, fake grass, umbrellas. Nice drinks at the general store / bar area. Games of bocce, quoits and cards if you wanted.  The bathrooms were great. Self contained with toilet, shower, vanity and some creams and toothbrushes on hand. Very much glamping! We opted for a meditation session in the morning, which was really lovely and a great way to get present with where we were. After that we had a delicious breakfast which was provided - many yummy treats and lots of it! We finished off with our complimentary 10 pin bowling. What a hoot.  Great night and day and would thoroughly recommend for anyone wanting to glamp it in the heart of the city.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_470239153~“Great Experience”~Such a great set up and friendly staff. Definitely something I would want to do again. We loved it!  Glamping is the only way I'd go camping ;)  Best experience I've had in Melbourne CBD for a long long time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469009956~“Glamping at its finest”~What a lovely, one-of-a-kind glamping experience! The entire process from pre-booking to post stay was seamless and enjoyable.  Upon arriving at the hotel, I was surprised by how quiet it was on the rooftop, being in the heart of Melbourne. We arrived a bit early so were invited to grab some macarons and tea while our tent was getting ready. The hotel offers little delights every few hours like the mentioned macarons upon arrival, a juice bar, free cocktails and beer, ice cream and sleepy time tea! There’s even a voucher for free bowling downstairs.  I loved staying in the fancy tent! It had AC, electric blankets, comfy pillows and little amenities like eye patches. Our comfy lounge chairs and hammocks were great for zoning out while enjoying the sunset.  The staff was incredibly kind and helpful. If we needed anything or had questions, they were only a text message away. Since our flight so really early the next morning, they made us to-go breakfast at 5am and brought it to our tent! St. Jerome’s is the perfect getaway for both adults and kids. It’s convenient for a fun staycation, to celebrate a special occasion or just to experience another side of Melbourne! We had amazing sunshine and blue skies the entire time, which made it that much more relaxing. Definitely recommend this unique experience to anyone wanting to go glamping in the city!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468972394~“A Fantatsic experience and Highly recommend people explore the opportunity”~A fantastic experience and I highly recommend that people explore the opportunity of staying a night or two at St Jerome's. The service was excellent and the facilities were equally brilliant. This is a unique way to spend an evening in the Melbourne CBD~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468949423~“Amazing experience!”~Everything was perfect, from the check-in, complimentary everything to the gorgeous bell tents and the spectacular Melbourne skyline.

We will be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467146969~“Enjoyable experience”~Service was abit on the ordinary side as we had to relay our breakfast preferences three times and they still got it wrong, the bar closed early and the smaller of our two tents smelt damp :(. Enjoyable but expensive for what it was. Would I do this again? Yes, but not for the price it is right now.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467074371~“Amazing Experience”~My husband and I had the most amazing experience at St. Jeromes - The Hotel this past weekend. This is the only way to go Camping/Glamping. The staff, accommodation, food and amenities are everything and more you could ask for. Bit hard to find initially so, maybe more clear signage to the actual hotel would help. But, other than that, this is an experience we will be talking about for a long time. The $35 parking at 300 Latrobe Street is a win and once again, staff bend over backwards to help in any way they could. Keep up the great work guys. When Melbourne puts of the weather for this experience, it truly is so relaxing, refreshing and lovely to get away from it all.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466637186~“Very cool place but a bit of a let down”~We found it very hard to get here. The information provided told us about a car park on la trobe street. This car park is quite a distance from the hotel and the directions to find the hotel even from the car park were not clear so we found ourselves walking around the entirely of Melbourne central trying to find sports girl so we could find the lift so we could find the hotel. All the while carrying our bags, clothes and bags, hats etc. we even left our pillows in the car because we weren't sure how far we had to walk. Glad we did in the end.  On arrival other than relief we were excited. The place is very inviting and just gorgeous in the sunshine. We sat in one of the deck chairs just waiting for our room to be finished being made up.  The room was boiling once we got in but after a few minutes with the aircon on it was fine. We were super excited just to relax. We lazed around outside in the deck chairs and had a few cocktails and played some of the lawn games.  When we came back from dinner exhausted we were a bit upset to pull the doona back and see a long hair caught up in our sheets. Then pull the top sheet back and find more hair and eyelashes. Very gross. Then on the doona I found some red something - no idea what it was. It looked like food or something. It was gross.  We told the front desk and at 10pm sat in a lounge area until the sheets were changed. Went to get in bed and noticed the doona cover hadn't been changed and he red stuff was still on there so had to go mention it again. It got changed and we were told that anything on our bill would be complimentary.  The staff were quick to rectify the issue which was clearly a house keeping issue.  We enjoyed the gelato as well and movies on the tablet.  This morning we enjoyed our breakfast box. Unfortunately I couldn't drink my tea as it had been delivered with milk (I was not asked if I wanted milk or sugar) and I can't drink milk.  Then we noticed food scraps and even a skewer on the floor in front of our bed.  Housekeeping was the real issue here and for me it was also the inability to sleep due to noise. They provide eye masks which is great however they probably need to consider ear plugs as well. I didn't get to sleep until after 1am and woke several times through the night and up at 6.30.  Very tired little lady here.  A very cool place and we had a good experience however I don't think I'd return.  Thanks for a really fun time~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466403848~“High Times!”~Wonderful unique experience. Staff were friendly and helpful. Had the most lovely relaxing time. Option of late check k out was a bonus and meant you didn't need rush.

review_465205129~“Glmaping on a roof top in the CBD”~Our experience at St Jermone's was fantastic. We took our two children (7 & 4) with us to celebrate our 9 year wedding anniversary. it was a wonderful night and we were blessed with truly amazing weather. The check in process was smooth and easy, welcome treats on arrival and just a great ambience. Each "tent" had its own space and outdoor area and we never felt on top other guests. There was great entertainment for adults and children alike - and a complimentary game of bowling. The tents were well appointed and the bed gave us the most comfy night sleeping in a tent ever ! don't expect a peaceful night sleep, as you're in the middle on a major city - so naturally its loud. The bathroom facilities, were clean and tidy with beautiful products to use. I loved it, the kids loved it and overall I'd highly recommend this experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465180620~“An amazing night in the city”~Staying at St. Jerome's is more than just a bed in a tent on the roof of Melbourne Central. It is an experience! We were lucky to not have anything else booked for the night and next morning, so took advantage of what St Jerome's had to offer. When we arrived we were warmly greeted and taken to our tent, then moved to the general store to enjoy our free welcome cocktails and some board games (I won). After that we retired to our tent to find a voucher for a free half rack of ribs, so we went to the restaurant to eat them - AMAZING! Following dinner, we used our free tenpin bowling game and then headed back to our tent, where we had some delicious messina ice cream and T2 tea delivered in a thermos. We also splurged on the dessert platter which was massive and kept us going all night. Last stop was the sauna to wind down, then retire for the evening. You would think that sleeping in the city would be difficult, but we had no trouble at all with the hum of the city being constant enough to keep me asleep. In the morning, we had the amazing breakfast box delivered which had the most delicious egg and bacon rolls, coffee, juice and anything else you would want for breakfast. Thank you so much for a great night!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465138096~“The only way to go camping”~This was my style of camping, 1st class all the way. Everything at your finger tips and if not, for example an ironing board, all I had to do was ask and it was delivered to my tent. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464958361~“Fun experience”~Our stay was a good experience although I think there can be many improvements. The shared bathrooms aren't great because once someone showers it gets quite steamy and dirty. There could be more entertainment options, perhaps a rooftop movie screening? The breakfast was also very average. Considering the price per night I think it's more for the glamping experience rather than a quality overnight stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464939722~“Truly memorable roof top glamping!”~We will never forget our stay at St. Jerome's hotel! Staff are amazing and cater to your every need, all the amenities are clean and well stocked. The tents are the same and very comfortable and inviting! All the added extras are a bonus and make your stay the little bit more enjoyable! We will be recommending St. Jerome's hotel to everyone.

review_461841469~“Have your mind blown by St. Jerome's”~Hands down the best experience you can have in Australia. Nothing like walking around on a rooftop with a robe on and a beautiful cocktail in hand. Amazing how the city just falls away. Can't wait till they install the waterslide.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461808214~“Beautiful Location and Tents”~Beautiful location, very well thought out concept. We had the luxe tent. Very clean and spacious! Bathrooms were new with toothbrush, shower caps etc! My only complaint is that the shower floor should have been wiped down regularly for the amount of money you're paying :) other than that, the bowling, cocktail and breakfast were amazing! So was the Messina before bed. I could text reception at anytime to order food etc! Would recommend staying here! Thank you! Oh and also you should reply to your customer on social media, I've tried so many times to ask questions and prolonged my booking here.. it is a staple to have someone looking after your account often!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461597107~“Amazing luxury camping experience!”~A friend and I visited St Jeromes last Thursday the 16th of February and we can't even describe how impressed we were with this incredible luxury camping experience!  Everything is so well thought out, the service was incredible, particularly from Ash, Paris and Dylan who made sure we had the most comfortable stay possible with nothing being to much trouble. It is most definitely an experience due to everything that the stay includes and the cocktails were phenomenal.  We also enjoyed the luxury toiletries and Messina delivery. Thanks so much for making us feel so welcome, we'll be back!  James and Jesse.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461579562~“Ok stay...was let down by the small details. Go with realistic expectations”~The whole glamping aspect of St Jeromes is pretty cool. Aesthetically it's awesome- I had put in heaps of effort trying to organise this as a surprise for my partner but we were pretty disappointed by the "extras" that are promised. The breakfast box was awful- focaccia bread was cold and a pretty sad sight. The yoghurt tasted like it had sat out for a while before being served to us. The coffee tasted like it was from an instant machine- this one I can't get over being in the middle of Melbourne and getting a bad cup of coffee! The Gelato messina( which I was really looking forward to) turned out to be Black Forest flavour, which I find a really unusual flavour to be offered as a standard? We weren't given a choice so I'm not sure about that one. The staff did not question us to why we had not eaten any of it when we returned the full can. The free ribs voucher that we received- we went to the place and were bluntly told "we are out of ribs". Besides that, the stay was ok/ the tent in itself and the surrounds were lovely. The comp. cocktails were good. The beds are comfy and we weren't bothered by any outdoor noise. Staff were friendly but in a "I'm dead on the inside kind of way". As a suggestion the place could use a bit more vibe- maybe some background music playing before 10pm or something. Felt bad writing this but after 10 years working in hospo/events and for the amount that you pay I definitely expected more.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461268622~“Amazing and super friendly ”~Loved the whole experience, it was super nice and clean and soooooo cosy! And the staff were super friendly and helpful.

I've stayed here twice now and on both occasions staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The venue decorated with all the luxury trimmings you could hope for, and we were treated to lovely little surprises throughout the night (complimentary cocktails and an esky of ciders, snacks, ten pin bowling and other rooftop activities, Messina ice cream, T2 tea etc.). Definitely recommend a stay at St Jerome's for both tourists and locals alike.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_459937931~“"Camping" in the CBD”~A romantic and relaxing get away and certainly very different to another hotel stay. Had a great time "camping" in the heart of the city for our 15th Wedding anniversary. Tent was amazing. Beers and cider ready to go in the esky + cocktail. Very cool set up to relax and watch the clouds swirl past the skyscrapers. Share bathrooms which were fairly basic but did the job. Staff great. Internet dropped out whilst watching the movie with 10 mins to go but managed to catch the end the next morning.  All it needed to be perfect was a table tennis table and a spa. A great escape away from the kids.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_459884079~“Glamping”~We booked the Luxe Tent as it's bigger than the regular and well worth the extra money. Check in was easy as you pre select any requests 24 hours prior and then just have to hand in your credit card and ID on arrival. 1 free cocktail per person on arrival was a nice surprise and then our tent had a cooler of Beer/Cider. Breakfast was ok, the roll was good but neither of us eat yoghurt/muesli so that was wasted on us.  Really good atmosphere and would definitely stay here again for a special occasion~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459838603~“Title ”~Customer service was very average which was disappointing, and the food was okay. The tent was lovely but not much privacy at all as the tents are very close together.. Probably not worth the money you spend~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459018199~“Amazing weekend ”~We had an amazing stay over the weekend for a friends birthday. The staff were all so helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we had the best experience. The cocktails were great - thanks Dylan, and the tents were modern, clean and comfortable.

review_458849536~“Excellent tents and staff. Average bathrooms.”~We stayed at St Jerome's for one night in the standard tent. The staff were really attentive and friendly. The tent was lovely and well equiped. The afternoon cocktails were super delicious and I highly recommend asking for the gelato at bedtime.  For the the price paid the bathroom setup is fairly average. There are several bathroom pods that are shared with the other glampers, which itself is not issue. However the bathrooms were not clean either when we went to bed or when we got up in the morning one had urine all over the floor and the other had dirt/mud. There was one hand towel that was shared and fairly gross. The bathrooms lack pretty much anywhere to put your stuff on if you want to have a shower and the body wash dispenser was empty... We had a really nice stay but unfortunately the hotel is let down by their bathrooms. I get that it glamping but for the price you pay the standards should be a little higher. It is a cool concept and was no where near as loud as I thought it would be but it need some improvement.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~5~nan
review_455819830~“Glamping at 50”~A very novel idea and great 50th birthday present for us. Service was great. Tent a really good size with a very comfy bed. Macaroons and iced tea on arrival and cocktails at 5. Lovely setting too. The breakfast hamper was very impressive and delivered within 1/2 hour of our allotted time. Best baguettes we have had. All in all a great night with a difference. In true camling form it rained whilst we packed up this morning~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455099896~“Rooftop”~The glamping on the rooftop at St. Jerome hotel is simply an AMAZING experience! I took my partner there as a surprise as she was busting my chops about going real camping which i dont really like! So, glamping it was and i was in the good books for a day at least! I would highly recommend doing this and you could take the kids even! Dean~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_454356920~“Superb city getaway”~Beautiful setting, fantastic service with lots of extra inclusions - a perfect quick getaway for the whole family. Highly recommended St. Jerome's for those looking for something a little different in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452845963~“Pretty Good”~Apart from the special request of balloons in the room, as we were celebrating a birthday, not being done, I can't complain about the service at all. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel clean. Would definitely go again but woukd ring ahead 1/2 hour before checking in to make sure special requests were completed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452473576~“Great option for something different”~Booked for our wedding anniversary and were very impressed. Lots of complimentary items, friendly and helpful staff, fantastic location. Tent was very comfortable. I would suggest packing ear plugs as I found the aircon sound kept me awake. Bathrooms were stocked with nice products. The breakfast hamper was delicious and generous. Highly recommend this place for something different.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452270956~“Roof Top Glamping”~The staff were excellent and very helpful. The venue was great had luxury tents, we were up there with 10 other tents some filled some not, all the tents were fitted with aircon, heating and electric blankets. The night we stayed it was pretty cold especially as I came down from Darwin. This was my 21st present which I would recommend to anyone at anytime. As some people have said you actually forget that you are in the middle of a large city. It is close to the CBD easy to get to by train which is the way we got there. Thank you for a very enjoyable time and will we do it again for sure...maybe even a couple of nights.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_452213571~“A Melbourne Must! ”~My partner and I decided to stay here on our last night of holidays in Melbourne. I'm not going to lie it was an extremely hot day and we were concerned about the heat in the tent, no need to worry the air conditioner was spot on and the bed was divine. The staff were friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the cocktail hour and all the other little perks that came with it, someone has clearly taken the time to think about what people would like out of this experience.  I highly recommend this place, my partner and I will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451958244~“Everything great!”~Would definitely reccomend, the staff were nice the facility's were nice and clean everything we orderd came right on time, restraints are all close by you hardly have to leave your tent it's great, would definetly recommend~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451850239~“Glamping in Melbourne city rooftop”~We had a quick get away at St Jerome's -The Hotel rooftop Glamping in luxury tents equiped with aircon heating and electric blankets. So comfy and luxurious. From in tent treats to cocktails and bowling!!And yummy breakfast delivered following morning to the tent. All included. Was a absolutely wonderful overnight stay!! The best staff possible. Nothing was ever a problem when we asked for things. Can't wait to come back again. !!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451784504~“Unique glamping experience ”~What a great place to stay. Awesome staff that are very helpful, as well as great rooms that make you forget your in the middle of the city. Plenty to do around you including the free bowling next door or you can just stay and relax with some board games and drinks. Definitely recommend~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451101465~“So different, so incredible, so good”~Loved it. Didn't expect such an experience at a lot of levels. Great staff, friendly, vibrant and helpful. Loved the ice tea and treats. Tents are fab, with really good bed and amenities. Everything has been thought of before you need to ask. Nights are quiet but still with the buzz of the city, so you have everything at your doorstep if you decide to venture out for dinner, walk etc. Big Thumbs Up !~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_451091582~“Perfect anniversary/birthday get away !!”~Have just checked out of this wonderful unique hotel and cannot fault our experience. My partner And I spend three wonderful nights here and we are sad to have left. From the minute you walk in staff are friendly and went above and beyond my expectations. Even from the first email staff were very attentive and delivered on all my requests eg. Balloons and light board msg. As it was my partners bday the day before. Bathrooms are clean and well stocked beds so comfy it was hard to wake up the next morning. Cocktail hour is a must and complimentary bowling was fun. Best experience ever and hope to be back soon! Thank you so much to all the staff that made this such an unforgettable experience:)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450630645~“Lovely escape in the middle of the City”~It was a lovely, relaxing escape in the middle of the City. I did not know what to expect but was happy with the friendly and eager staff to help; beautiful breakfast, great meditation class, interesting City views and very comfortable tent! I heard about the place from colleagues at work and would recommend it to others. You get the best of both worlds - you can step into the bustle of Melbourne Central and the City or just sit back and relax!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450360013~“Couldn't say a bad thing!”~Everything about this place is just perfect. The staff are incredible and offer perfect service with no hassle. The whole place has a very relaxed atmosphere and felt like a mini holiday on top of a roof.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449807586~“Very Cool Experience”~Hip! Is the word I'd use to describe this hotel. My partner and I stayed here a night for a couples getaway. The hotel is exactly as the website pictures, very laid back, quality tent accomodation on a Melb rooftop - great concept. Great staff, good beds, very much a boutique novelty stay. The staff always friendly and approachable. The breakfast delivered to your tent is seriously awesome, and the provided refreshments included make this a quality stay. I noticed most of the guests were under 40, we're early 50's but we were made to feel welcome in any case. A couple of things to be aware of: We stayed in January, it was hot and the tents are canvas, thus heat up 'supa' quick. Even with the aircon in the tent it was almost unbearable during the day - perfect at night. The quality and way the tents are presented is serious good. The bathrooms are shared between a few tents, very good quality, but are made of fiber glass - *hot*, very hot during the day. So hot that my partner couldn't put her make up on in the bathroom. Couldn't find an iron!!! If you're looking for a supa quiet wilderness camping experience don't stay here - the city noise and ambiance makes this place the ultimate urban escape. It is a great place and idea, while not a cheap place I would recommend it to the middle-aged single or couple traveller wanting some thing different. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449775442~“Loved it”~This was a great Christmas gift from Redballoon. The staff are excellent and it's a great way to spend a night. With about 20 or so tents this top floor glamping ground is well equipped. A complimentary cocktail on our arrival with a free game at Strike Bowling, Messina icecream for dessert and the most amazing unexpected breakfast box the next day saw us leave incredibly happy. There are communal bathrooms with approximately 1 bathroom to 3 tents and we never had to queue, so it worked really well and being able to nod off to sleep with the sound of the city in the background was really nice. You should stay here~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_448604282~“Camping at its best”~This was a gift from our kids for Xmas. We weren't sure what to expect when we were told we were camping on a rooftop. But wow what a brilliant idea this motel has come up with. 5 stars on the tent it has a full queen size bed with bedside tables aircon and electric blankets. Cocktails at 5 while playing a number of board games they have on offer then off to play tenpin bowling before dinner. We watch movies on an iPad and ate ice cream from a tin.  Camping will never be the same again  If your looking for a great present this is an awesome gift.  One recommendation if your a light sleeper bring some earplugs.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448179059~“A different type of getaway!”~We spent one night here and loved every minute! The service is incredible and the views amazing. The set up inside the tent is fantastic and breakfast is delicious! I recommend making the most of happy hour and bowling right next door. It's an experience we will definitely want to come back for!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447084475~“The best Christmas”~The kids and I loved it  So kick back and relaxing and the kids described it as the best Xmas ever ! We will definitely be back or even better we are thinking about making it our Christmas get away every year~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446998190~“Rooftop glamping”~Room/tent was well set up, well equipped, comfortable bed. Breakfast was amazing. Service brilliant. We loved the experience. We recommend getting there early so you can enjoy the cocktail hour and all on offer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446848827~“Such a fun and different experience ”~Stayed here with my husband last night and had such a fun time. It's a total novelty so it was exciting from the get go. A kid free night is also totally exciting and was topped off by breakfast in bed. This couldn't get any better for me except it did. Movies, shopping and bowling only 100 mts away. Woman's meca. Only tip is to pack some ear plugs!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446815998~“Loved it!!!”~This is such a unique experience. I took my 2 boys and paid for an extra rollaway ($50) on top of the Luxe tent price on Christmas Eve, and when we got there the staff had set up 2 single beds for the boys, which was very unexpected but very welcomed. It was a very hot Melbourne day (34C) so when the sun was on the tent it was very hot and the AC struggled a little, but when the sun was not directly on the tent, it was lovely. My boys loved this experience. Our only complaint would be the ice cream as it only came in 1 flavour choc top and the flavour had a fake almond taste, so we didn't enjoy it. Because we stayed Christmas Eve, we woke up to an array of gifts from the hotel such as vouchers, games, a beach towel, iPad mini beanbag and chili sauce. It was amazing.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444905416~“Glamping is the NEW BLACK!”~I never knew "Glamping" existed until I stumble upon St Jerome's at Melbourne Central, what a cool view! We totally enjoyed our experience, from the moment we arrived at the reception, right through to our departure, there were so many things to eat, drink and do, we wish we have more hours that night to keep on glamping! The staff are so friendly and bartender Oli was cool, he made me no-alcohol and no-sugar mocktail during Happy Hour - hats off for doing something so well, so randomly! A sunblock in the tent to use under the scording summer sun would tip this experience over the perfect edge. Keep up the awesome work St Jerome's team!~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444559282~“Relax in the heart of the hustle and bustle...”~I spent one night Glamping on top of a building in Melbourne with my bestie, I took her for her birthday. It was a fun time of year to enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city becasue when you walk through the doors to St Jeromes and out to your little canvas hotel room you relax instantly! The staff are great, just text a request to reception and there they are ready to help or to deliver T2 sleep tea or Gelato Messina directly to your tent door. It is a fun way to surprise your bestie or partner...~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_444157429~“Something completely different!”~Thoroughly enjoyed an anniversary evening here. Took advantage of the extra bonuses. Great location and attentive, thoughtful staff. Great vibe, and good location. Loads to do and explore. They provide eye masks as the tents can get light early. Would recommend earplugs too as the hum of city life can make it a bit tricky to get a deep sleep.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443628205~“Amazing out of hotel experience right in the heart of Melbourne CBD!”~If you want something authentically Melbourne - get yourself over to this hotel, which is made up of 20 or so state of the art glamping tents, with double bed, Samsung Tablet and AC all included! If you're lucky enough to grab Melbourne on a sunny day, this place is paradise and even when you wake up to the pitter patter or rain falling above you, it's actually quite a magical experience.  The staff are another level of helpfullness - staying true to the Melbourne vibe, they are pretty cool kids by all means, but more than capable of enhacing your experience. There's some fun activities to do on the rooftop as well - table tennis and a nice garden bar which is great in the summer sun. I will definitely come back to this place, it's a great example of a city getaway and pretty unknown to most folk.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_442718450~“Fun, fun, luxury, fun!”~We had the best time staying at St Jerome's - The Hotel. We were made to feel so welcome and cancelled our dinner plans to stick around and make full use of the incredible roof-top. The bed was superb, with gorgeous, comfy bedding and the fan/heater combo was a godsend. If you want a relaxing, unique getaway in the heart of the Melbourne shopping precinct, I highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_441683246~“Outdoor Escape in the heart of the city”~What a fun experience. Really felt like we had 'got away'. Came back so relaxed. Such a novel idea. Tents are so well equipped with all you need. I do recommend going for a luxe tent though as the little bit of extra space really makes a difference. Can't recommend this little getaway enough. Great for couple as well as a large group.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437321730~“A great night for something different”~This is great, loved all the extras you get. To get most value make sure you use them....from the welcome sweet & tea, to the bowling, cocktail, gelato (amazing!), pizza, snack and night tea. A slight mix up with breakfast which was quickly rectified. Really comfortable mattress. Even borrowed a phone charger for a few hours. A really unique experience. We didn't take advantage of the relaxation it brings as we packed our day with Christmas shopping. Was grateful for the birthday card left for my husband upon arrival into the tent. a great personal touch. I especially loved the toiletries in the ensuite - smelt amazing.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_435746959~“Nothing could beat it”~St jermones hotel is indescribable. From the moment you walk into the reception you feel as though your in an incredibly humble, fun and quirky place.  The countless amount of activities also adds to the incredibleness that is st Jeromes. From boccie to the sauna with inbuilt Netflix!  The staff are also perfect. They are such down to earth, friendly people who go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. i cannot wait until my next stay!  Xx I love you st Jeromes~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435216057~“Awesome experience ”~My boyfriend and I stayed on the weekend and we had so much fun! Would definitely recommend to everyone to try. The tents were so cute and comfy and even had a split system in them. I loved the bar/ outdoor area - lots of bean bags, board games & bocce. The staff were really cool and very helpful. The bathrooms were very clean with quality amenities (forgot my toothbrushes but they had toothbrushes in the bathroom).  Thanks for a great stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434148146~“Amazing Birthday Stay”~Stayed with my girlfriend for one night during the week for my Birthday. Staff were great and even left me a birthday message on a light box and some balloons. Great vibe up on the roof during the evening and the breakfast was without fault. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434128331~“Exceptional experience in every way”~Took my guy along for a surprise treat, and our expectations were met and surpassed. The level of service was super attentive and sensitive, with so many added touches that made it a truly unique and exceptional experience. Thank you for the macarons, the yummy teas and beers, the ice cream, the fab bathroom products, board games - it was huge fun, and we will be recommending this wonderful place to everyone!~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433144931~“Get away ”~What an awesome idea. Although quite pricy there were a few extra inclusions. The car park wasn't included and it was quite far and difficult to locate . Their emails prior gave great directions to the hotel so it was easy to get to. I had to stop myself from window shopping being on the third level of melb central . Upon arrival we were given macaroons, warm tea, beer, cider, nuts and chocolate bullets!! We sat on our deck chairs enjoying our snacks. We were in ore of the set up.  It was a really cold night so we went Bowling after dinner which was fun - I lost! Once we got back , we wanted to sit outside on the beanbags to enjoy our complimentary cocktail and watch the sky above but it was way too cold! We ended up hanging out in the general store area and drank our Jaffa cocktail while staying warm near the heaters. The bar guy was very friendly and we had a great old conversation with him. None of the other couples were outside either , We went back to our tent and were bought our Messina ice cream?? Mmm not much to say about it. We only got one to share and seriously it looked very old. The seperate bathroom block felt like we were really camping ! Freshened up before bed then jumped into our electric heated bed to watch a Stan movie on the tablet - 1 hr of trying to upload movies it just didn't work so we gave up. I drank my warm relaxation tea delivered in a good old camping themos and camping cups! It was a great night sleep , noisy but that's expected your in the heart of the city!! We were woken with our breakfast - so Kool and very generous serving! I was so releaved they bought my latte in a glass as I requested and not a take away cup. Overall an excellent experience - weather permitting i would stay again - probs not in a hurry but during the warmer months next time . I think it is a bit pricy especially the fact that arrival at 3 and checkout by 11am following day you really don't get much time to enjoy the atmosphere! Never the less definetly worth a one night stay to judge for yourself .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433105580~“Surprise”~Well my wife had to tell me whilst we were looking for our park where we were staying, the parking system they use is a bit of a walk through to city then you get to Melbourne central and go up three levels with luggage , check is nice, free cocktails we missed out on, staff are greats , antipasto bit expensive, champagne bit pricey, we had a small tent, it's all a bit fun, don't go to be comfortable don't forget it's in a tent, toilets showers are clean and good you do have to share with another two tents, bit of a walk to get there, all in all it's all good, plenty of places to eat n drink in Melbourne central even late. Asian beer cafe was awesome , so affordability definitely over priced when I finally found out how much it was, like I said great fun , cheers guys~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431748035~“Honeymoon Stop - Best Decision!”~You guys, this place is awesome! So unique! We stopped here for a night on our honeymoon trip. I came across the hotel thru social media and fell in love with it, but the prices were a bit higher than we would have liked. Toyed with the idea for a week or so then just decided to go for it! I mean how often do you get to camp in an awesome bell tent on the roof of a downtown building?! And we were so glad we did. The staff was awesome and the price was well made up for. Great customer service! They even upgraded us to the larger tent because they found out we were there on honeymoon! Cocktail hour, the stocked Esky in tent, smores, and hot breakfast brought to our tent just added to the already awesome experience.  I would highly recommend St. Jerome's. Especially if you are looking for a unique and fun experience! O and super comfy beds!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431119401~“Great experience but could be better”~We glamped on a perfect night. The tent was great, bed was so very comfortable. The view from the rooftop was awesome. Unfortunately you pay so much money to stay there then you have to leave and find dinner. We were given a bowling voucher for entertainment. I think some entertainment and food right there on the rooftop would be better.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428620904~“Left feeling relaxed and refreshed”~What an amazing place! They have got every detail right, we had an incredible night and were sad to say goodbye. We left feeling relaxed and refreshed, after being spoiled by the amazing staff. The tents are cosy and you are provided with everything you might need for a comfortable stay. The tent service is an added bonus as well as all of the treats. We will definitely be booking another stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
