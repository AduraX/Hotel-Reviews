review_3300338~“A boutique hotel with classic Victorian Gothic charm”~The charm of the Tilba will hit you as soon as you approach it. It looks stunning standing on a corner in Toorak Road, with a gothic tower above the entrance. Although it was built in the gothic revival style of the early Victorian era, it was in fact built in Edwardian times. The entrance hall and reception area have a really opulent feel with a gorgeous marble floor and all of the guest rooms and shared facilities have antique furniture and fittings. The moulded plasterwork on the ceilings in the best rooms are true works of art.  We were very warmly welcomed by the manageress, Kim, despite having woken her up at 6am with a call from the airport to see if we could drop off our bags. We took one of the mid-price rooms in order to have room for an infant's cot, but she put us in one of the best rooms as it was free. This had a balcony under the octagonal tower and the most enormous and beautiful brass bed. Kim helped us get hold of an infant car seat when we had a problem with the hire car booking and looked after us very well. We returned to the hotel at the end of our trip for another five nights and got another free upgrade to the best room on the front of the house, with a four poster bed and a big bathroom.  This hotel only serves breakfast, which is amply provided, but it is very convenient for the restaurants of Toorak Road. It overlooks Faulkner Park and is only five minutes walk from the Botanical Gardens. It's not the cheapest hotel in the area but nothing else comes close on charm. We can't wait to stay again. We actually stayed at the Tilba almost a year ago in April 2004 but have only just got round to writing this review.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
