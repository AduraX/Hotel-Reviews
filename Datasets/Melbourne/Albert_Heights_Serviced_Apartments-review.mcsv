review_450034713~“A quiet place to stay in Melbourne”~Friendly and helpful staff, clean, quiet and comfortable self contained apartments within walking distance to a lot of attractions. We stayed here for a week 12mths ago and parked our car and walked or caught the tourist tram around the city, visiting as many sights as possible. The convenience of a supermarket, fish & chips shop etc opposite Albert Heights apts is a great find. This time we stayed 3 nights after returning from Tasmania, once again enjoying the beautiful city of Melbourne. Would recommend staying here.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_435221898~“Pleasant Surprise”~Check-in was easy and fast. I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which was fairly nice. I liked the artwork on the walls. The sofa, chairs and bed were all very comfortable. It is an older-style building and some of the facilities are a little bit dated. Otherwise, the room was clean, comfortable and spacious. There is an arcade across the road with a good variety of shops (fish & chip shop, convenience store, pizza place). The only gripe I had was that it was a bit of a walk to the nearest tram and train station. Overall, however, a very pleasant experience and would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_424236960~“Friendly service, good facilities”~Second time I have stayed here. The apartment is in a good location and is clean and comfortable. A bit dated, might need some work in the next couple of years, but kept well for what it is. The young lady on reception was so very nice, unfortunately I didnt get her name, but she was very helpful on check in and check out. We will be back.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_409102811~“Friendly service, wonderful room”~Located in East Melbourne, I cannot recommend this apartment complex enough. From the moment I entered, the staff were extremely helpful and even recommended somewhere to eat in the evening and morning (located directly across the road). Loved the layout of the deluxe suite, which was a very warm place to stay on a cold evening.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_403520975~“A pleasant place to stay close to everything.”~This is an older accommodation venue but it is clean and tidy. The management is friendly and accommodating. We were in a one bedroom unit on the ground floor. Solid concrete walls makes it quiet from the neighbours, the heating is excellent on a cold winter night. The bed is comfortable, the kitchenette adequate. The shower over the bath is the only negative if you are older as it is a bit of a step up to get in. With restaurants and IGA across the road and access to several tourism venues close and handy. Free wifi is a bonus. Parking is free too. Don't expect a flash venue, but it is more than adequate if you are looking for a base in melbourne. Will we be back? Definitely haven't got an issue with staying here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399837933~“Genuine, welcoming, tremendous value”~Everything about the Albert Heights apartments was delightful. The staff were proactive and helpful with making my booking, when we arrived on a cold, wet, miserable Friday night, the parking was simple, the staff were so very welcoming, the room was pre-warmed and lit, and the place felt incredibly peaceful. It was also scrupulously clean. The beds are comfy, the kitchen well-equipped, the wifi free, the couches and chairs comfy and the artworks in the room and around the corridors - which are undercover but open to the gorgeous garden courtyard with its canopy of trees and treeferns - lovely.  The apartment stayed warm even with the R/C off overnight and the hot water supply was great.  Also glad smokers aren't treated like pariahs but have places to sit in the courtyard with ashtrays. The lady doing housekeeping was friendly, chatty and helpful and seemed to enjoy her job. The location is also simply perfect - three minutes walk at child pace to Fitzroy Gardens [and the city centre is about 20 minutes walk from the top of the park down through Treasury gardens and across Spring St to Collins St], The apartments are also literally across the road from the IGA and food and beverages at Tribeca, six minutes walk via Tribeca to the tram stop on Victoria Pde that takes you to the bottom of Smith St and Brunswick St or into the city via Collins St, or about three interesting blocks walk [there's some fabulous heritage buildings along the way] from the Richmond tram stop opposite the MCG. At night East Melbourne is very peaceful, which is also lovely. Especially sitting out in the garden courtyard. We have definitely found our new favourite place to stay in Melbourne.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380126840~“Great price and location”~I stayed there with my partner for a weekend. Location is fantastic, a few minutes walk to the tram station, and less than 10 minutes to CBD by tram. The station is out of the free tram zone, but I thought it's okay. Room is clean and big enough, and price is very reasonable with free car park.  Staff is very friendly and helpful. I would like to stay here again next time in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_378278297~“Great apartment for a good price”~Not far from the center by foot, it's a lovely place to get a big apartment. With all you need (washing machine, all for cooking).  We stayed there for 4 days in Melbourne for business, it's was very nice. thanks a lot~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_375292273~“Good location”~The staff are great, place was clean, had everything you need, great wifi, the pull out bed in the couch not comfortable at all, they really need to get rid off the innerspring mattress and put in a foam one instead, close to the CBD and tram stop, had IGA and food places across the road, all in all not a bad place to stay~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_371140487~“Family stay”~This apt is located East of Melbourne. It's not a big luxurious hotel but reception staff, Anita, is very friendly. We were given map & she explain on how to go round Melbourne. It's a smooth transition and we were given key to apt. Reception personnel only works till 8pm or so. Rooms are spacious with one queen bed and the other with sofa bed. There's a convertible sofa chair as well. Fully equipped kitchen with microwave and electric stove. Kettle and tea/coffee is included. A lot of powerpoint in the apt. There's lift next to reception. Free carpark next to apt. Opposite there's a small supermarket and a few eateries. The location is quite central and quite near Melbourne city. Even though the apt looks a bit old but it still feels like home.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368940334~“G R E A T L O C A T I O N”~The management and staff were very helpful, great location walking distance to the city approx 15 minutes, parking was also included. Everything was in walking distance restaurants, cafes, bars and even a small supermarket. Rooms were very clean and well maintained. Stayed here on two separate occasions in March each time for 3-4 days preferred the ground level apartment to the top level. Will stay here again on my next visit to Melbourne.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_365586436~“Excellent stay”~From the moment I arrived and arrived early they were very nice and friendly. I had just put my husband in hospital and needed somewhere to stay and I would highly recommend. Very neat, tidy and clean. Found out that if you have someone in hospital you can bring confirmation and get accommodation cheaper. Don't know by how much but might be worth a try. I had a unit which had a kitchen, lounge, bedroom seperate toilet and shower. 5 rooms all together. Will be staying here again.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_358567509~“could be better”~the young woman at the desk was very helpful, when we arrived. Good location also might be hard to walk into town with young children but tram nearby. Room was noisy as at the front of the building, bathroom in need to be re-done, hard to close the taps in bathroom and kitchen so they dripped.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_357716786~“Very considerate staff”~My wife stayed at the Albert Heights Apartments while I had a short stay at the Epworth Freemasons and her comments to me warrant passing on. She was very happy with the cleanliness and room overall. The staff could not do enough to ensure she had a stress free stay, allowing a later check out. Also the off street parking was an advantage in a parking meter area.  We would seriously consider staying there for visits to the city.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_343244293~“GREAT LOCATION, LOVELY STAFF, COMFORTABLE ROOMS”~We loved staying at this place. We could walk to the MCG, the city, Bridge Road and Smith Street. The tram was across the road in Victoria Parade, and a few stops we would be at Lygon St or the city. The rooms were tidy and kitchen had everything we needed. Laundry was a bonus. James, the manager and the staff were wonderful people to deal with and very helpful and friendly. We would highly recommend and will definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343005643~“top location, not too pricey”~We always stay here when we visit for the tennis. Its an easy walk to the mcg and rla, so would also be a good option for concents. Its a 20/25 minute stroll through a beautiful park into the city centre. Across the road is an iga, and a decent cafe for a quick brekkie, which we normally use on the day of our departure. On the days you have more time cross the next big road (victoria parade - this is where you can catch a tram) and yiu are in Fitzroy. Tons of cafes, bars and restaurants on gertrude, brunswick and smith street. SO......on location alone this place is worth picking. As for the accommodation itself tthe staff are very friendly and helpful. The apartments are a little old, but clean and serve their purpose. The open courtyard is nice and the place was quiet when we stayed but I can imagine it only takes one group of noisy people and the whole place would be affected. Its not 24 hour reception but there is security if you need it. We slept well in a comfy bed. Car parking available if you need it. I think they call themselves executive apartments. They are far from that but fine for us and we will use them again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336756324~“Comfy, clean and close to the MCG. ”~The Albert Heights is well located within easy walking distance of the MCG.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious with cooking facilities and a good bathroom. Aircon in the rooms is very good.  We had a very comfortable stay while in town to watch the BBL.  On site parking is a huge bonus too.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_327535597~“melbourne marathon weekend”~Every year I travel down to Melbourne to run in the half marathon. Albert Heights Apartments are a 10 minute walk from the MCG. This year we booked an apartment for 3 guests with twin singles and a pull out sofa.  It was freshly painted, clean and well presented. It was very quiet and we received great service. There was a foodstore, bottleshop and cafe across the road which was a bonus on Sunday when everyone tired and not up for walking any great distances.  We liked the idea of having a kitchen to prepare our own food pre race day.  The only drawback was the lumpy sofa bed. This was resoved by using the 3 spare blankets as an 'underlay'. I will certainly return again next year. It was a fantastic weekend shared with friends at a reasonable cost.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_320837444~“Value Plus”~4 of us stayed here the night before Melbourne Marathon. 2 BR apartment with its own kitchen which was handy as we wanted to prepare our own food. Comfortable, close to the MCG, restaurants and a supermarket. Very friendly reception. We wanted late checkout and they obliged.  Extremely reasonable prices. I would absolutely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_299037206~“How on earth are stars awarded to hotels.”~This was a double dose of disappointment. My original booking was I believed for a different hotel group nearby, placed through one of those hotel search engines popular for many travellers. I was caught completely by surprise to be staying at this hotel. I was in a difficult position, my preferred hotel booked out, so I was compromised into staying here. On our first night there was a party held in the apartment next door, conveniently starting 10 minutes after the hotel manager had left and finishing 30 minutes before the morning shift start of 8.00am. Not wanting to confront drunken teenage partiers, I had a sleepless night. I had plenty of time to take notice of the apartment, and tired décor is an understatement. My son was sleeping on something supposed to be a single pull out bed (luckily he was booked in to see the chiropractor on our return) a very lumpy affair that should never be used as any sort of sleeping arrangement. The tiles on the floor of the apartment are old and just look the worst sort of grimy, meant to be white, nice shade of grey. The bathroom looks like it was put in the 1980s and so does the kitchen. I don't think the owners would know when this place last saw a coat of paint. If you have the choice of staying home or staying here, just stay home. I contacted the service provider when I returned to seek some form of explanation. They have tried to explain that an error in their mapping process showed this as a different hotel and they were sorry it happened and offered 10% reduction in my booking costs, what a joke. So beware of anything you see advertised and always check that the booking stands with the hotel you have booked, although as I have found out the hotel cannot often see who has booked the accommodation they simply see the booking agents details. These comments are made without prejudice and are solely my experience.~1~nan~3~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_296274661~“Home Away From Home”~This is the only place to stay. Daughter having surgery once again at St Vincents Private and easy 2 minute walk away. 15 minute walk into the city. Everything is on your doorstep. Safe and secure and all the comforts you need~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_280861336~“Value for money & location”~We stayed here for 2 nights to watch an event at the MCG. The location is great, close to the MCG and only a 30 minute walk into the CBD (if you enjoy walking). The rooms were large enough and had separate kitchen and lounge areas. No issues with hot water and hairdryer etc were provided.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, we were assisted with a late check in after our flight was changed.  I would definitely recommend this accommodation and would stay here again. It's affordability means you can spend your money on the attractions in Melbourne.  Also, thanks to James for putting on the reverse cycle to warm out apartment!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_270655647~“Friendly service makes all the difference”~We picked the Albert Heights Serviced Apartments as they were next to a hospital we needed to visit. We really were not expecting to much as the apartments are very reasonably priced. I met Hazel at check in and what a wonderful greeting, I have never had such a genuine, helpful and friendly check in, including 5 star hotels. The hotel is in a great location with a small shopping mall across the road and many great Asian restaurants nearby. The apartments are only 3 levels and there is a lift. The car parking was included in the cost and was easy to access. There is a nice central courtyard garden. The rooms were basic but had everything we needed. The shower is over the bath but had plenty of hot water. We will stay here again as you can walk to the city and there are nice parks nearby for the kids.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_266782195~“Reasonable priced & well equipped”~Stayed one night with my dad. He walked down to the MCG for a Game and I went for a walked into the city.  We took a room with two singles and a sofa bed. My dad slept on the Sofa bed and it was super uncomfortable so wouldn't advice this room if you are planning to use that particular bed. The Single bed however was very comfy.  Kitchen was well stocked, bathroom was clean. All the important things ticked the right boxes.  This place is a great place if you have driven into Melbourne as there is a free car park. Its only a quick and quite beautiful 25 - 30 min walk into the city right past St Pauls Cathedral. Also only about 15 min walk to the MCG.  The only downside is if its raining to catch a tram you have to walk a few minutes and then you also have to change trams now that tram 24 no longer operates. Also they don't have 24hr reception but that is fairly standard for an apartment.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_263727819~“Excellent service from Hazel”~A friend and I were staying a Saturday night after a workshop in Melbourne. I had been looking at many different places but what made me book this place was simply because of the receptionist, Hazel. From the moment I spoke to her and inquired about the apartments, I felt an incredibly friendly and personalized service. She was genuinely very keen in helping, answering my questions and she just appeared so friendly. Thus, I did not hesitate to go ahead with my booking, even the area was far from where we were attending the workshop. I was looking forward to meet this lady, who had been so friendly and as we were running late, we got a call from Hazel to check if we needed assistance to find the place ..... which we did!!!! When we arrived at the apartment, she went out her way to help us with transport the following day, where to eat in the evening and where to do some light groceries. I noticed that she was as friendly and helpful to all other guests coming and going while she assisted us. The place itself is an older style accommodation but very clean and it had everything we needed in the apartment. However, the asset of this place was without doubt the outstanding service of this amazing lady, Hazel. If every place had a receptionist like this lady, more people would have an unforgettable experience, being treated and greeted with such respect and friendliness. Thank you so much.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_260771279~“Great location. Free carparking. Descent amenities. ”~Albert Heights is in a great location. Just out of the Cbd in picturesque East Melbourne. The staff are friendly. The rooms are well appointed with most things you could need whilst away from home. And the nightly rate is very reasonable. It is an older place that's gradually upgrading it's fittings. But definitely a place worth staying for those with a budget in mind who wish to have cooking facilities. A carpark. Yet still be close to the city and public transport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_259371425~“Convenient and enjoyable accommodation”~I have read reviews which varied about this hotel and were surprised that some people may not have ventured further than the footpath if they thought that trams and restaurants were to far away. Across the road (straight across) is a quality coffee shop/cafe, IGA, restaurant, a highly regarded wine bar, and pizza. Straight across from the IGA is the tram stop....so getting around Melbourne is easy. We stayed in a deluxe one bedroom which has a quality fold out in the lounge room which is separate from the kitchen and a big bathroom which had a separate toilet which is a good thing lets face it . No complaints from me. Room 16 2nd floor accessible by lift~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_259318090~“4 nights”~Recently spent 4 nights here as it was the only hotel that could accommodate me close to the CBD for a work trip. Located about 15 minutes casual stroll from the top of the CDB (the theatre district) its location was not too bad (and the weather was nice). Certainly not the most luxurious places to stay, but it did the job. The apartment was small, but still spacious, Bedroom, separate Lounge, Kitchen, Bathroom and Toilet. The room was nicely decorated in what seems to be a faux Versailles style.  The central courtyard was a nice oasis at the end of the day and great for a smoker. There were dedicated areas to smoke and THAT was refreshing rather than having to traipse onto the street late in the evening or early mornings like in most other hotels.  A couple of things I noted;  1) There was an iPhone dock alarm clock - as long as you have a 30pin connection for older style phone or a lightning adaptor. I didn't have one of those, so just plugged directly into the 4 point power board I cannot travel without. See point 3. I struggled to work out how to program the thing as they normally take the time and alarms from the iPhone and are not really easy to work out if you are not using it that way.  2) The bedside lamps were European in style - with European plugs - so they were jammed into the wall using a socket converter. Any time the lamp cable was touched, it feel out of the converter. When I checked it out - the socket emitted what sounded like electical arching whenever the cable moved. I ended up unplugging everything, 3) The wall sockets in the bedroom are so low to the floor you will struggle to plug anything extra in. My 4 point power adapter solved that problem.  4) The shower head is about 1/2 way up the wall, which is not great for a 6ft tall guy trying to wash his hair.  Would I stay here again - yeah probably, but only if it was for a work trip where I was staying for more than a few days. It feels less like a sterile hotel and more homely for those extended stays.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_259159182~“Needs a lot of improvement ”~On first glance looked ok......... But then started noticing that it's not very mobility friendly (too many stairs if your in a wheel chair) and hard to navigate stairs of you have lots or heavy luggage.  We settled in our room and tried to work out what theme they had going it was contemporary vs Impressionism vs modern vs Queen Anne vs I don't know what.  We went out for the night and on return there where people smoking right out side our door (we where on the 2nd floor) and inside our room just stunk (being an asthmatic is not particularly the best thing to be sleeping in) even tho I closed the bathroom/toilet windows before I left.  As we got ready for bed and switched the lights off (really no need for lights as the curtains are see through and the lights outside our room where always shine through the kitchen window).  The bed was comfy enough but waking up to cigarette smoke wafting in was disgusting.  Down side - bathroom was small and if your a bigger person you may get stuck in the toilet as there is not enough room to move and the floor tiles always felt wet under your feet.  Should be non smoking on upper levels so if your a smoker then this place is for you.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_256304040~“Great location but needs updating.”~This is a very old group of apartments however it can be somewhat forgiven for its location, price and free off street parking. First problem, the shower rose height is seriously for midgets! Bathroom desperately needs an update, actually the whole complex needs an update. Comfortable bed but the airconditioner made a terrible vibrating noise when in the lounge room. Also patrons smoking near the elevator was disgusting. If you can deal with old and rundown for the price and location then you'll be fine.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_253247395~“Great price, great location....very happy :)”~We were looking for somewhere to stay in town for a kid free weekend and this apartment was perfect for our needs. We would like to thank William at reception for an upgrade & late checkout...yay!!! Just made it that extra special. Free parking on site also. Lovely green oasis in the centre of the complex which I expected a chimpanzee to swing through at any moment....maybe I had too many wines that night! Overall, terrific value & highly recommended.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_250734387~“Convenient and Comfortable”~We were really pleased to get a booking only two weeks out from the Aussie Open. The location is perfect for tennis and the MCG as well as the compulsory shopping trip into the CBD. There are very convenient shops (an IGA supermarket is only meters away and is really well stocked and open late) and transport links (trams and buses to town or to St Kilda/Richmond). Great and very helpful reception staff.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_250718886~“Good place to Stay, Close to Everything”~We stayed here overnight as I had to visit a specialist just a few streets away.

A little expensive for what it is, however overall it was ok.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_247329461~“Reliable, quiet and close to transport”~My family and I have been staying at Albert Heights over a number of years but no matter when we go, the staff are always welcoming, the apartment is clean and the air conditioning works perfectly, particularly after a long day of shopping or exploring the attractions of Smith and Brunswick Streets. While it is located slightly to the east of the CBD, this is in fact an advantage. It is so quiet! The tram is a short walk away and for the energetic the walk into the city is quite do-able and very relaxing if you take the pathway through Fitzroy Gardens.  Having a sofa bed in the living room effectively makes it a 2 bedroom apartment and very flexible for families.  We will keep on staying at Albert Heights whenever we go to Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_247329048~“Great location and price.”~We have stayed at Albert Heights 4 times now on girls weekends (shopping trips). Always tidy and a good price. Last time we did have a few issues with small things like a light not working, a cracked power point and a broken pull out sofa. However we were moved to another room with apologies. This has never happened before, usually it's fine. The staff are always super friendly and helpful. It is walking distance to Bridge Road and the city but we usually catch a taxi and it works out cheaply between the three of us. The last two times we have been we have looked for a better deal elsewhere for a change of scenery but have ended up booking Albert Heights again due to it being a great location and price. Thanks Albert Heights!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Very well positioned with IGA across the road, very good fish & chips and pizza restaurant in the same lane way cutting through apartments leading to tram stop in Victoria St. The area is so close to everything, Smith St is close with many cafes & restaurants to choose from leading down to Collingwood. Tram 109 or 12 will get you to most places. The staff were very friendly & helpful. We will stay here again definitely.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_224217034~“Very pleased”~Stayed for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday night). Our apartment was spacious, comfortable and very clean.  William was very pleasant to deal in whilst checking in and via email prior to our stay. The only negative was on the Saturday night there was very loud shouting/arguing coming from a near by room which made it difficult to sleep. However that is not a reflection on the hotel.  Would definitely return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_219987027~“Great location and a good functional apartment”~We stayed at Albert Heights for 6 nights (2 adults and 2 teenage boys). The family apartment was simple and clean with a bedroom and lounge room (lounge converted to twin beds), plus a basic kitchenette. We booked online and it was excellent value. IGA and cafes across the road were good, and it is an easy walk or tram ride to the CBD. Off-street parking was also available.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_214176016~“Good accommodation close to Melbourne CBD”~Our 1 bedroom apartment was clean and spacious. The complex is old, & the rooms a little dated. Don't let this put you off staying here. Reception staff were helpful. There is a small shopping mall over the road with an IGA, and a few cafes with good food. Tram stop on Victoria Parade gets you into the Melbourne CBD. Also close to the MCG. I would stay here again. Practical, comfortable accommodation.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_207044195~“Would certainly stay again”~Three of us stayed here for one night and booked a deluxe double which was Room 3. It consisted of a bedroom with a double (maybe a queen...I can't remember...but it was very comfortable)....then a sofa bed in the lounge where our adult daughter slept. She said it was also a good bed. There was a small kitchen which we really didn't use, and a bathroom with a separate toilet. (Toilet was accessed through the bathroom). The bench space and mirror in the bathroom was plenty big enough for two of us to do our makeup etc at the same time. (I had read another review where there was no room for a toiletry bag, but in our room, the bench was quite long). The shower was above the bath and the water pressure/shower head was great. Didn't have to run around trying to get wet, or try to avoid the spikiness like some. Walls of the bathroom were quite thick, concrete? We had no trouble with any noise at all...I did expect traffic being near the front but didn't hear a thing except hubby snoring. The rooms are very secure and you enter through reception then into a lovely green courtyard type thing, before going into each room. Car parking was at each side of the building. Over the road in an arcade, there is a takeaway shop, a hairdresser, a wine bar, an IGA and a great place called the Geocery Bar where you can get a delicious breakfast (although at Albert Heights, it is certainly well equipped enough to bring your own ....but we decided to eat out). A short walk passed the Gardens and you are into the city. Very handy spot for the football/tennis etc. Reception was very helpful and friendly when we booked in, and the change of staff in the morning was just as friendly. Would certainly stay again.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
