review_478973486~“Awesome hidden Gem”~So well located walking distance from everything clean and tidy, great service. The view from the balcony was just lovely. Just down the road from the Queen Victoria Markets and Etihad Stadium. Cant fault it. Would definitely stay here again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478697683~“Spacious, well-equipped room”~A hotel located near the railway station. Very spacious and well-equipped room that I believe making a meal is of no problem. A washing machine is also provided. A pity that our room is not facing the park or else I believe the morning view would be splendid.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478685393~“No parking blues”~Good new property, well located but the parking situation not tenable. Using the Royal Mint car park which is un-secure and free on the weekend and trying to charge $40 is not the right way to manage parking. Fix that and it's a great place.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478668760~“Great view but not really all that Jazzy”~Very well kept, clean serviced apartment feel to the accommodation. The Studio Funk had a great view & was comfortable for the overnight stay however the only sign of any Funk or Jazz was simply a branded splashboard at the bedhead. Also some printed reproduced vinyl covers as another wall decoration. It didn't really feel like you were in a hotel but rather a separate apartment.  The added security deposit of $100 after paying for the room felt quite odd & it took 8 days to clear properly to my account so I didn't have a full refund for a whole week after checkout. I enquired by phone about this after 4 days & was told it would clear in 24hrs but it didn't. The hotel already had my card details from the initial online booking & the extra $100 temporary charge was never explained.  Overall not a bad experience but nothing amazing either.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478654138~“Excellent stay”~We had an excellent stay at the Jazz Corner Hotel. Simple professional and quick check in. Small kitchen had everything we needed to cook breakfast and enjoy the city views from level 33. Everything new and clean~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478652494~“Nice accomodation, maybe have to work the noise level from other floors”~We could hear the noise of upper levelled rooms dryer/wash machine on through out the night. This disturbed our sleep. Parking was too expensive, $40/night. Other than that it was nice, nice breakfast at ground level restaurant  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478648173~“Satisfactory”~We stayed 3 nights in this hotel as a last minutee change from an AirBnB apartment that was extremely noisy. Positive points: - Good service. Staff were friendly and helpful. - Definitely very quiet. I guess the downside of this is that the rooms feel a bit like a bunker because the ceilings are so low. - Very good value for money - good location within the CBD Negative points: - The main thing we disliked is what I mentioned before, rooms are very compact with low ceilings (especially the bedroom part which is pushed into a very small area) so you feel a bit claustrophobic. The air was very dry which resulted in us not sleeping very well. Its definately ok for a couple of nights but no more than that in my opinion.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_476997761~“Nice and clean set up”~Nice and tidy room. Efficient after hours check in from the friendly staff. Awesome view with a comfortable bed. Close to Melbourne Central and the markets. Quiet room aswell ensuring a good night's sleep.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476949875~“New - And Very Good!”~Really well thought out design...perfect for a couple looking for a chilled out stay in the city...very close to Flagstaff station which makes getting around very easy...my rating is probably more like 4.5!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476763103~“Didn't want to go home !”~Really friendly, staff whom couldn't help enough ! Really excited to see good size towels + a spare towel which is handy when you have long hair. WI- FI and TV both great,kitchen amenities outstanding Wonderful to have laundry- the only thing missing was instructions for washer/ dryer which I probably could have rang down at reception for, but it was late so I guessed (but not very well) We will be back !~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476747259~“Hotel policies need review”~When we arrived to check into the hotel, there were carparks in the "drop off zone" out the front, or nearby. As my wife was driving I went into the hotel to check if while she drove around the block. We knew Parking ($40 worth) was included with our reservation and the plan was to park there once I knew where to go.  The girl at reception asked for ID and credit card, standard procedure, which I produced, I was then told, as the booking was in my wife's name, I could not check in to the room, only she could.  I explained that she was trying to find a park and if they checked my ID they would see the Surname and address were the same as my wife's. If they could direct me to the Hotel parking my wife would come and check in. The receptionist just kept repeating that no, as my wife made the booking only she can check-in.  Once back in the car we rang the hotel and asked to speak to a manger but were told "no we don't have a manager onsite, but if you leave your details one will ring you back asap".  We were rang back, late the next day. We explained how my wife was driving at the time, couldn't find a park so couldn't check in. Her response "There is plenty of other places in Melbourne to park, she could have parked there and walked back".  Previous reviewers that have had similar issues were told it was due WOTIF's booking policy. This was NOT the case with us as my wife booked direct with the Hotel.  I can't say that this was a bad place to stay....Because we didn't get to stay there. But if it's good customer service that you would like, I'd suggest going elsewhere.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476632497~“Lovely location and friendly staff”~Everything was quite good such as the convenient location, view from the room, friendly staff and good facilities. But the shower needs to be upgraded. The water pressure from the shower was horrible.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476627243~“Excellent”~We had a wonderful stay at The Jazz Corner Hotel. Great location with good tram access everywhere; short walk to the Docklands and slightly longer nice walk to Bourke Street. Friendly staff. Excellent room - spacious, nice bathroom, iron, washing machine, kettle, coffee machine etc. We really enjoyed the jazz club downstairs and great dinner.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476625988~“Great escape to the city”~Good clean hotel. Everything new and very clean. Booked a high floor with view one bedroom which had amazing views over Flagstaff Gdns and to the bay - worth the extra $15. Only thing that wasn't up to scratch was check in was a bit slow, but very friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476616424~“Wonderful new hotel in Melbourne”~Wonderful and very friendly reception and service. Funky room and convenient location , great view! The kitchen and laundry are good facilities in your own room. Highly recommend to everyone.I will definitely go back and stay for next trip. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476613399~“Jazz corner Hotel”~Good location near the Circle tram for CBD access. Opposite the Flagstaff Gardens and a 5 minute walk to Vic market. Probably about a 15-20 minute walk from Southern Cross Station. Does have very good cooking facilities, not that we used them. Nice Italian restaurant on site.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476602685~“Buisness trip”~The rooms are very clean and modern. I was upgraded so the room was even bigger. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Public transport is just out side the front door and there is a park across the road. Had a lovely meal at the Jazz Corner Hotel and lots of close by options for breakfast, lunch and dinner.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476585437~“Great rooms. Great location”~We took our 3 year old for a weekend in the city. Beautiful view of Flagstaff gardens. Walking distance to everything. Trains & trams at your door. Lovely modern rooms. Front reception & maze to get to the rooms needs improving but staff were friendly & accommodating. Would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476584581~“Hidden Gem”~This hotel is nested close to the Queen Victoria markets, Flagstaff gardens and Flagstaff station. The staff are friendly and attentive. The room was clean, spacious with great amenities. The jazz themed furnishings added a warm and inviting touch. I stayed here when hotel first opened - will come back again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476580955~“Outstanding staff and great concept”~Outstanding staff and great concept, and very good rooms. I had a brilliant time, tried out the Jazz Club which was great. I would highly recommend. Only minor downside was the slow-ish elevator access.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473972436~“Good value for money and interesting interior”~New hotel with that freshly fitted out interior smell. Good bed, excellent lighting, bigger than usual TV, and nice little balconette to enjoy the fresh air. Interesting jazz themed interior and one of the best couches I have experienced in a hotel of this price range. Clothes washer, dish washer, etc all inside the room.  Great value for money. Do not expect full 5 star service catalogue, but what they do, they do with a smile. Strongly recommend you bring your own adaptors as they do not have any to lend in-house.  Conveniently located right on a tram intersection that will take you either to docklands or to Flinders St.  Nice view too and I requested a high floor.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473009864~“Great place to stay in Melbourne”~I will be staying at this hotel again, the room was very clean and having the kitchen to cook your own meals as I had an extended stay for 10 nights. Checkin were very friendly and helpfully. Only one small issues the parking but when I found the parking it was fine. Over all I enjoyed my stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_472059411~“Don't expect decent service ”~We arrived at the hotel on a Friday night at about 7pm, upon arrival we went to pay for our room and the lady at the reception desk replied that we could pay for the room with cash but the $100 security deposit must be paid by card (fair enough) but wait... the card had to be the same name as the person the room was booked under, which wouldn't usually be a problem except we booked the room under my partners name and her account was hacked which means she now had no card because the bank cancelled it and we hadn't got a replacement yet. So I tried to pay with my card but apparently to do that we had to ring Wotif (who we booked through) to change the room into my name. The lady at reception told myself and my parter all about another couple that had already paid for their room but didn't have a card under that name so they couldn't check in!! (Great work respecting people's privacy!!) so we asked for the number for Wotif and she replies oh you won't get through to them for hours as most people have gone home. Hmmm so what do we do now, we offered to pay cash for the deposit, but apparently we live in a completely cashless society now. We couldn't it into my name because I hadn't received my pay yet, tried to change it into my friends name but apparently you can't have two rooms under your name?? (In any other hotel that's fine...) this hotel needs to re-evaluate their policies pretty quickly. The room was great, view was nice but I'm not sure about paying a premium for a room and being put on the 4th floor compared to our friend getting a cheaper room and being on the 26th floor? The room had nice appliances and a comfy bed but for a new hotel we shouldn't be finding kitchen drawers broken/hard to open. They have premium coffee machines in the rooms but the coffee is cheap and horrible. And never pay the hotel for parking as they use the Mint's car park one block away and charge $40 per night, when you can park there and pay them $10 per day... not happy.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470777984~“That view!”~Booked this hotel prior to the hotel opening (they opened 9 March) and was slightly concerned... well I shouldn't have been. The apartment was great and had spectacular views and the hotel staff were so accommodating. We had booked a double bed 2 singles and arrived to find two doubles. We just assumed it wasn't available but they owned it by calling us and offering to fix the issue (that we hadn't even raised). Great location in the city and the jazz vibe is super cool. Will definitely return~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469305822~“Sparkling, funky room”~Staying a night in a 1br apartment for business - the room has a modern, music based theme - reference to the Jazz bar in the basement. Fully functional kitchen, full sized fridge, even a washing machine. Good sized balcony with great views over the CBD on the 29th floor. HUGE king sized bed, and a bigger than average bathroom.  Earlier service issues mentioned by other reviewers have been ironed out, checkin was quick, smooth and pleasant. No issue with the prepaid booking through our corporate travel agent which an earlier review mentioned. In summary - great location, great room and I'd absolutely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468465369~“Adele Birthday Celebration”~Booked a King Parkview studio with breakfast through WOTIF. Asked about breakfast in checkin and were told they weren't offering that yet. It was the second week they've been open. However asked for my booking confirmation which thankfully I'd printed. Then told us there was an arrangement with the cafe next door.  Once we got to our room it was not a King and not a park view, instead looked over the Queen Vic Market. We went down to reception and were told they didn't have any King rooms. They could move us to a park view queen and offered a discount. This process took 45min.  Up to the second room which upon entering had the same view as the 1st room but 4 floors lower.  By this stage we were annoyed as we had planned on enjoying the room and champagne pre the concert. We were once again asked to take a seat.  To her credit the manager Chloe then took us to a King 1 bedroom apartment overlooking the park. The process of keying the room cards is taking them a long time so she took us to the room and returned with the keys so we could begin to enjoy our experience. We had wasted an hour by this stage. The room was on level 4 so not the best views of the city and bay but still lovely. The king bed was very comfortable. All the Ammenities were great with a comfy leather sofa, kitchen, washing machine, coffee pods and twinnings tea. TV in lounge and bedroom. Perfect spot for enjoying the concert at Ethihad Stadium. They were accommodating with a late 11am checkout but unfortunately the kitchen had closed at the cafe for breakfast. Not that a big a deal we got some Bakery items.  More serviced apartment than hotel. But very comfortable, quiet and great blockout blinds.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467017970~“Opening weekend and it showed”~Firstly, this was the first weekend the Jazz Corner was open for. Had a room with a large queen size bed which was very comfortable. Views of the park and across Victoria Markets were actually quite nice. The bed was comfortable, TV came with a range of foxtel channels and the kitchen was appointed with cooking utensils, full size "small" fridge, gas stove and a coffee pod machine. More serviced apartment than hotel I'd say. You could certainly stay here and self-cater. Free wifi was fast. In room toiletries seemed quite good. There were small finishings in the room which weren't great - gyprock with filler that hadn't been painted for example. The block out curtains really worked well, so a dark quiet room to sleep in. As best I can tell the hotel building is shared with the Oaks Hotel and with residents who call the building home.  Service on check-in wasn't great. Our check-in was smooth but we had a reasonable wait while they were dealing with a number of problems others had encountered with their rooms. This is not a great start to your first experience. It sounded like rooms hadn't been made up / cleaned / serviced. When we served it was efficient and friendly. We had a two night stay so wondered if our room was going to be serviced and it was, new toiletries, fresh coffee pods, milk and towels.  On check-out they asked for a credit card to pay the bill and they had to verify that we had actually paid in advance. I'd stay there again, especially if I was going to cater for myself. The service issues seemed like teething issues.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
