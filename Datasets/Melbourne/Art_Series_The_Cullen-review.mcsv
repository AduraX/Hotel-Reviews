review_478367614~“Quality, comfort, distinctive”~This was my first stay at the Cullen. The brilliance of the artwork and the matching boldness of the design give a stimulating distinctiveness to the surroundings and each day feels exciting! Add to this one of the best beds I've ever slept on! My only disappointment was that the overhead bathroom lighting was not well placed to enable a good view in the mirror.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478364344~“Great hotel, great location.”~The room was excellent, good beds, good bathroom. Loved that we could actually open a window. Directly across from Prahan market and near lots of restaurants. Staff were excellent, cheerful and capable.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_478201918~“Funky Hotel”~The hotel is in an excellent suburban location opposite Prahran market and around the corner from Chapel St shopping and restaurant district. The hotel itself is modern with funky art work showcased throughout although not all of it was to my taste. I had a room on the top floor which was quite spacious with a small kitchenette and comfy bed. The only let down for me was in the bathroom where the toilet hadn't been properly cleaned and I didn't like the walk in shower with no door. The car park underneath is small and is open to the public so spaces are limited and it costs $25/day. I ate breakfast in the café on the ground floor and thought the food was pretty average but overall I quite liked the hotel and found the staff friendly.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_477712232~“Lovely hotel in great location”~My husband and I stayed in a balcony room for 2 nights. Hotel staff were lovely, room was comfortable and clean.  Bathroom facilities were good but we were not fans of the glass wall enclosure.  Location of hotel is very convenient. Walking distance to Chapel St shopping, and at night there is a huge selection of bars to go to within 5 mins walk.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477446676~“Close to Shopping and Dining”~Interesting Concept with Contemporary Art in the room. This particular Studio had cooking facility, dishwasher and fridge. Very comfortable bed. Very clean.  The staff was very friendly and helpful regarding where to shop, dining options and transportation. I would certainly recommend a stay at this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472291572~“My parents loved it!”~My mum and dad recently spent the weekend in Melbourne; being a good daughter I booked their hotels for them and also being a lover of the Art Series hotels booked the Cullen. My mum has just phoned me to tell me how much they both loved it, how wonderful the staff were, how good the location was, how lovely the bed was to sleep in and so on. For two country people who don't stay away from home much, it's just wonderful that they enjoyed it. Big kudos to The Cullen for another outstanding stay, we'll see you in a couple of weeks when we have a family trip to The Larwill.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472281369~“Awesome experience ”~If you've read the other reviews, no need to read mine. If you haven't, go ahead, read theirs, it all there and it's all true. ▪Quirky design that works ▪Brilliant staff ▪Clean, pleasant rooms ▪Nicely located to food, transport and entertainment  I can only add a big thank you to the staff member who booked us in; Your recommendation for our Friday night was spot on, and to the barista's working the machine down stairs, thanks for good coffee and attention to detail.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471766060~“Fantastic hotel with absolutely charming staff”~My partner was scheduled for an MRI at the Alfred on Saturday morning at 8.30am so we opted to stay close the night before to avoid the city snarl on a Saturday morning. The pre check in via the internet was a great idea as there was no waiting when we arrived. The service was prompt and very helpful booking our dinner at the nearby Chinese restaurant and booking a cab for the next morning. Being smokers it was refreshing to have the promised balcony room at a greatly discounted rate with an ashtray provided. Next morning the cab was waiting for us at the appointed time and  the staff wished us well. After our appointment ended we enjoyed a coffee at the attached café and were issued with an all day parking ticket in their private car park and on arriving at our car we noted that the staff had left a message for us wishing us well. The dinner at the attached Chinese restaurant was top class and the only complaint we had was the breakfast as they served sour dough bread that was so hard you couldn't cut it and it arrived slightly cold. Apart from that this is truly a top class hotel almost opposite the Prahran Market and all of the vibrancy of that area. Cannot recommend this place highly enough in our travels.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471758006~“Charming and Quirky”~My husband and I were attending our nieces wedding and it was my husbands birthday the next day, so we decided to find a hotel to stay over night. We picked The Cullen because we were intrigued with the idea of an art series hotel, and had previously stayed at Melbourne QT which is part of the same hotel group and was excellent. Online check in was easy and then all we had to do was arrive. This hotel stands out so locating it was very easy. Staff at reception were genuinely welcoming and helpful. The hotel decor from reception (which has two cow statues) to the rooms was bright, cheery and endearingly different. Given my husbands birthday we had booked a junior penthouse. The room was cool when we arrived, which was welcome in the blustery heat Melbourne. The balcony was quite large and had very fetching views. We enjoyed a coffee out there when we got back from the venue. The room itself was airy and well layed out. Not sure where these guys buy their beds, but they are heavenly to sleep on. When it came time to leave for the wedding, reception couldn't have been more helpful organising a cab. A very nice touch was the complimentary iced water and iced tea near the lifts. Check out, similarly was a breeze. Strongly recommend this hotel if you are in the neighbourhood. I intend to hunt down and stay at each of the art series hotels. Final tip - Its a good idea to join the priority rewards program - there is no cost and it gives a significant range of discounts across the entire range.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_469764939~“Quirky, Charming and Unique”~This is one is one of the most awesome hotels around, the hotel has a nice feel, it has so much charm and character. It is certainly not another pre-fab hotel. It is as unique and different as the art that it is embellished with. Would stay here anytime, it is in a great location with a great array of food and shopping options at its doorstep and with the city a quick short tram ride away.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_469537965~“My experience ”~I had not much of an idea where I'm going to stay during my just short passed visit to Melbourne last weekend. The Cullen stay was arranged by my soon son in law. He did well.  I arrived around 4pm where I was greeted in a nice, happy and friendly way by the receptionist. He pointed out that my room was his favourite and has views of the Melbourne skyline... I was in no time at my room on the 4th level. Security seems very well as you need your room keycard to move up or down. When I opened the door to my room I was feeling great looking at a very nice sized room with a King sized bed. On the bed there was a note saying "we know you want to jump on, go and do it", that made me smile. The bed was very good indeed 10/10 is my score. Sadly I could not spend a long time in it. All artworks where cool and vibrant. I also loved the Ned Kelly feature. The bathroom had everything you would expect, maybe a little on the small side but it was no issue to me. The view was also nice if you come from a distance. It's nice to get that city feel in a great location of a very good nearby market plus the ever fantastic Chapel Street. I could also not detect any noises, so yes it's nice and quiet. I would love to come back to the Cullen upon my next stay. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469324122~“Course on The Cullen Rooftop”~We ended up at The Cullen by default (our original course venue got double booked) and what a blessing it was! The staff were beyond fabulous. Our course ran for four days (Sat - Tues), we were appointed a contact person for the weekend, the fabulous Steph who was available for any help we needed from tech to set up changes (she can do it all!). The change over to the weekday contact person Ben was seamless and with the always smiling helpful Adam being present for our entire stay, there was always a friendly face to greet us at reception in the morning or on the end of the phone to help us out. No request was too much trouble, there was always a smile and "no problem, we will sort that out for you".  The food was a hot topic for everyone attending our course. "The best food at a course / conference EVER!" was mentioned more than once. There was always plenty of food, it was fresh, super delicious and always on time.  The space is gorgeous, it has a fabulous break out patio area at the back with a big sliding door to open up and get fresh air during breaks, with a great view.  You have control over the thermostat so you can control the temperature of the room. It was very hot the days we were in (over 30deg) and the afternoons did get a little warm with the type of roof they have, but we sorted this pretty quickly.  The room was always cleaned and back to looking perfect the next morning even if another function had been in overnight. One afternoon we had to be out a little early (we knew this when we booked) so I asked if we could have our afternoon tea in the bar. The usual answer of "no problem" was given. When we got down there, not only was our afternoon tea ready and waiting for us, they had a section (a good section) reserved for us so we could all stay together.  These guys think ahead and go above and beyond. We could not recommend them highly enough for an event. The staff are very obviously well looked after as they are happy and dedicated to their jobs. The venue is great but it is the staff that are asset to this hotel. Massive thanks to Steph, Ben and always smiling Adam. You guys rock!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469054429~“Simply the best”~Wow wow wow and that's just the staff. We arrived at The Cullen after 2 nights at the Olsen and I am not sure if it was the only just ok service we got at the Olsen or the staff at the Cullen are AMAZING.  From the minute you walk in the door the staff make your stay something special. Blown away with the staff on front desk they alone will have me coming back to the Cullen for all my future stays. The rooms are great spacious, light, quirky and the finishing touches like T2 tea and Evo products leave you feeling like you have had a treat. People might say the bathroom is small but let's face it you go into a bathroom to shower or use the facilities. If your planning to spend your holiday sitting in a bathroom then steer clear (noting a Huge mirror outside the bathroom for make up so fellow ladies no need to panic)  Do seriously do yourself a favour and book at least a night you won't regret it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_466308322~“Quirky Hotel”~Have stayed at The Cullen 3 times now and will be coming back next year. We just love it. It is in a convenient location for Chapel Street (shops and restaurants) and easy to get a tram to the CBD or St Kilda.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465467778~“A jewel in Prahran”~An extraordinarily comfortable stay in a five star hotel. One of the best accommodation set-ups that I have seen domestically or internationally. My only criticism would be that the restaurant is very loud ... though the food is great!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465121267~“Another excellent Art Series hotel”~Only stayed one night but excellent hotel. Handy online check-in with text message to let me know my room would be ready (arriving a little early due to flights) and acknowledging and accomodating my request for a non-road facing room as I'm a light sleeper. Check-in very friendly and helpful. Very good location almost opposite Prahan market. Decent sized room ,comfortable bed and as in all Art Series hotels once selection of art books. I'm not a great Cullen fan but still enjoyed the art around the hotel. Very friendly check-out. All in all a terrific stay.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_465017301~“very comfortable stay”~Great Great staff and an incredibly convenient location. my only possible negative is that the walls between the rooms may be a bit thin and one can hear your neighbor pottering around int he room and taking a shower.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464950765~“Very Good Hotel.”~The Cullen is a nice hotel situated in the heart of Prahran with comfortable, spacious and clean rooms. Our room was fully self contained, with basic toiletries and tea/coffee being provided. We booked on line some weeks prior and check in was a breeze with hardly any details being required. The welcome banner on the TV when we entered the room was a nice touch as well. We had a slight problem with our room and were quickly moved to another room, with free internet being provided for our trouble. The bed was big and very comfortable, allowing a nice nights sleep. Staff were polite and efficient. Would have no hesitation staying here again and highly recommend it.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_464855769~“Great place for inner city stay”~This is my 2nd time staying and it was an absolute pleasure. On check in, which was quick and easy my partner and I mentioned where we were planning on going for dinner and the receptionist gave us tips on where to grab a drink while we waited and what we good on the menu. The room was nice and large and very clean. As always, the art series quirkiness was great.  We ordered room service for breakfast and one of the meals was missed but all it took was a quick phone call and all was rectified.  I'd definitely recommend and will be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464421082~“Always reliable”~The Cullen is yet another outstanding Art series Hotel. Snug next to Parhran markets and right in the centre of the shopping precinct.

review_462340350~“Fantastic ”~We were fortunate to stay at the Art Series Cullen Hotel recently. The deluxe balcony suite was divine. Bed incredibly comfortable.

We would definitely recommend this great hotel to anyone wanting a relaxing escape. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461880919~“Better than staying in the city”~Two nights at The Cullen and I would return in a heartbeat. Loved the unusual artwork and decor. The hotel looks like it has been designed from the ground up and everything thought through. The fittings were all classy and well designed. Most important of all - the king-size BED was very comfortable. Well stocked bar and fridge. The distance from the city makes it a perfect option when you have to stay a night or two in Melbourne. Breakast in the hotel restaurant downstairs was excellent - as was the coffee. And as a bonus, it's right across the road from the wonderful Prahran markets!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461837248~“Funky”~I can't see the duomo in Milan, but this could be Hotel Straf. Modern art, contentious and evocative, floods every wall, corridor, open space. The lights draped in the atrium/light well for instance are simple but different.  Good use of Gramercy Social restaurant downstairs as though it was part of the hotel. Great location, directly opposite Prahran markets, great restaurants, good eateries, tram stop out front. This place oozes convenience. Our room was huge, dining table for 6, lounge, 3 x TV's. Just tops. Great place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461065790~“Convenient and classy”~Great for accessing Prahran, Windsor etc. A little far away from the city - but easy enough to access via tram or Uber. Not the best vibe around the local area, but the downstairs dining provides some essential experiences. Very clean, and classy environment. Simple and straightforward design - could be a little larger room size, given the price point. The biggest low point was pour service in the dining area downstairs. Rude, slow and incompetent is the best way to summarise the experience, which is a pity. This was the only real detractor.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_460306564~“A home away from home”~For those needing a regular stay, the Cullen team make you feel part of the furniture. Always a friendly welcome on arrival.

Plus tram stop right into the city also on your doorstep .The rooms are big and spacious with good shower facilities, bed very comfortable . We had one breakfast which was tasty . The only negative really was they charge for wifi which in this day and age should be a facility with your room rate . Would definitely recommend .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_456491881~“Cool and relaxing - good location”~This small hotel has the artwork of Adam Cullen throughout. The rooms have nice comfortable beds and ours even had a little kitchen. Being directly opposite the Prahran market meant you could easily buy some wonderful food to snack on. But being so close to Chapel st with all its cafes and restaurants you don't really need to.  The hotel hires out bikes and even smart cars. A tram runs down Commercial road into the city and the beautiful Fawkner park is a short walk away too. A good location if you are not wanting to stay in the CBD.  One thing to note: if you stay over the weekend you can get some noise in the night from clubbers heading home.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_454877314~“Only drawback was the frosted bathroom wall”~We travelled to Melbourne for the Australian Open Tennis, and for something different from our usual CBD accommodation choices, we decided on the Cullen.  Well, there are many many many things to like about this hotel.  As we arrived in Prahan at about 10am on a Friday, our designated room was not ready yet. While we were discussing making two single beds out of a king bed in our booked room, the concierge offered a room with 2 queen beds for a small upgrade charge, a room that was ready immediately. We were happy with that offer.... even more so with the reality. The room was fantastic in so many ways... so much so that my 22 year old daughter is determined to stay at the Cullen every year now on our now planned annual weekend together.  The beds were extremely comfortable, the room had a nice aspect, good block out blinds, good airconditioning, and was quiet..... yet was also very funky and sophisticated and quietly glamourous.  The position of the hotel was also wonderful... for Prahan, and for greater Melbourne as well. We "ubered", "trammed" and trained to many destinations... the trip to the Australian Open on Saturday night was so easy on the train... the station a short walk away at both ends of a 3 stop trip. The only drawback, in my experience, was the frosted glass wall separating the sleeping room from the bathroom. You can still really see the outline of your companion in the bathroom... on the loo, in the shower. It did not bother my 22 year old daughter at all, but it marred an otherwise faultless experience for me. I know that the frosted glass bathroom walls are increasingly common and trendy... but I just am not comfortable with them. Maybe it is just me, but perhaps others feel the same.  Anyway, other than that, the Cullen is a great hotel. Very helpful staff, great, fair value 2am room service after late finishing tennis, and fun fun fun comfort and quiet glamour.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452949797~“Terrific location and experience”~This is a very neat hotel right in the heart of Prahran and just over the road from the Prahran Market. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is full of artwork from Adam Cullen and each of the rooms is dominated by some of his work. The rooms themselves are spacious and well setup. We also took advantage of the free tour of the artwork of the hotel - thanks to Stephanie for doing an excellent job on this. Very informative~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_452512927~“Interesting experience”~The hotel is very impressive, especially if you have an eye for detail. The room was decorated well and bed was comfortable but the products were not the best quality. It was a 40 degree day when my partner and I stayed and, due to an issue with the reservation, the room was stifling hot, snacks were melted and unfortunately the aircon did very little to assist (even afte the front of house took over central control).  On the up side, hotel staff were more than accommodating and apologised for the inconvenience of the heat (room was 28 degrees), it would have been nice to have been offered a room upgrade or something though.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452220892~“What a great find.”~So glad we found this place. Decor is bright and modern. Position of hotel is great. Sound proofing made for an uninterrupted sleep in. Staff are so helpful and friendly. Can't wait to try another Art Series hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452118062~“Ideal location”~This was our second visit to Melbourne & we decided once again to stay at the Cullen. Location is fantastic- walk to train station, local markets, tram stops- perfect to travel out & about & into the City. Restaurants & shops nearby.  Staff always helpful & welcoming. Rooms ideal for short stay. Small kitchenette in your room if you choose to stay in & restaurant/Bar downstairs if you choose to socialise. Will certainly return.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_450005565~“good location, Modern Quirky Hotel”~Went in November for a business trip for 2 days Well located in Prahran, opposite the markets. The taxi driver had difficulty finding the front entrance, which is off a side street, and left me on opposite side of Commercial Road, and kindly carried my bag across the street. Friendly front desk staff, free morning papers. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with a kitchenette. Bathroom small but very clean, with large shower with good water pressure, no bath. Good storage in bathroom mirror cabinet. Comfortable bed. Cullen Paintings on walls and even on shower screens are a bit of an acquired taste! Paid for on breakfast, which was excellent in the downstairs cafe, and had dinner at the Chinese restaurant which was also very good. Would be suitable for a longer term stay, had a modern Hipster vibe.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

Their service was great and they were accommodating in sorting out an early check in for me.  The location is great with easy access to the City via the tram or cabs. Walking to Chapel Street was also easy. The restaurant downstairs is also recommended.  I will be sure to return on future trips to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_448694582~“Service from staff fantastic”~I stayed for three nights in late December. Room was very comfortable (bed particularly so!), although the bedside table not really practical. Blackout curtains were very welcome. Mini bar very reasonably priced. I rented a Smart car for the day - great service and no hassle. The highlight however is the staff. Very friendly and attentive (without being instrusive) and really go out of their way to make a difference. Everyone I encountered, even when just waiting at the lift, made conversation and was friendly. I left a phone charger in the Smart car upon return and it was delivered to my door within a couple of minutes. Staff are a real asset. Location of the hotel is great (opposite Prahan markets) and rooms were very quiet. Would definitely stay there again ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448388629~“Disappointed”~I was so looking forward to my visit at this boutique hotel. Its in such a nice area. Shops, bars, coffee houses etc. I was blown away by the hospitality. Staff, servers, bartenders , so friendly. Now as for the maid service that cleans the rooms, totally ruined my stay. Upon arrival, spider webs, dirty bathroom, and patio filthy. Even to ghe point, they never replenished toilet paper? We called every day for towels and trees for shower. I complained to manager and was given a $70, discount? I spent $1600 for 4 nites? Customers pay for rooms and maid service to keep rooms clean and fresh . Oh well, guest they are banking on their past history . Sorry, but i recommend you visit restaurant and bar only. As for the room, i wont recommend.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448181040~“Five star room, one star service ”~We checked into the Cullen for a New Years Eve celebration, a small gathering of two friends. We booked the Cullen Suite; a wonderful room, two king size beds, two bathrooms and sweeping views of the city. I can't recommend the room highly enough. However, the service we received was appalling. I left my toothbrush at home, when I contacted reception and asked for a dental kit, I was scoffed at before being told that one would be sent up. It took three phone calls and several hours before I got the dental kit. We also requested that two clean plates be sent up to the room so that we could dish up some food - our room had a kitchenette and only a couple of plates. This request was received with similar disgust and I was promptly told that they were "under the pump" and would try and send up a couple of plates. Needless to say, they never arrived. When we asked for two buckets of ice, we received only one. When I rang and requested a second, I was informed they would need to collect the first ice bucket as they didn't have enough. Again, this didn't happen. While I completely understand that hotels get busy, I would suggest that enough staff be rostered to deal with peak occasions. The rooms at this hotel are fantastic, but that won't be enough to keep people coming back when the service is completely inadequate.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447617612~“Terrific location, Great rooms”~This is a great location, close to the city but in a great dinning area just off Chapel Street in South Yarra. Rooms very comfortable and well appointed with bright model decor and very comfortable beds. Restaurant is great for breakfast or a quick meal after work.. Terrific art on the walls makes for a pleasant environment and style.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan

review_447422831~“5/5 Highly recommended!!”~Our stay at the Cullens was very comforting and we love the artistic feel of the rooms. Wonderful service - person I made the booking with was Ben. He was easy to talk to and was very pleased to assist me with all questions I had to ask. Made some request that weren't 100% guaranteed, but in the end all request were granted. The Cullens crew knew the stay was for my boyfriends birthday and they made him feel really special during check in. Cullens crew also left a kind birthday message for him with a bottle of bubbly. Boyfriend and I enjoyed the comfort at The Cullens - would definitely stay again! all staff are kind and make you feel very welcomed!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447326726~“Modern,close to Chapel St”~We stayed over Christmas and found the staff very helpful and the rooms modern and clean.The Cullen is located close to the Chapel St precinct and the Prahran market.The Gramercy restaurant offers a good menu at reasonable prices.Our room faced some private units which meant we needed to keep shade blind closed for privacy. I think that the 25.00 per day parking fee is high, but I guess they can charge that as there aren't any other close options.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446818831~“Everything you'd wish for”~As a family of four we are always happy finding places where we can comfortably stay in one room. This one is a great location, great decor , comfortable beds and very friendly staff. The cafe downstairs saved us on Christmas Day as everything else was closed. Would come back anytime.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_443697932~“Wonderful stay”~We decided to stay at The Cullen because of it's excellent position in Prahran and ended up loving everything about it. Our room had everything we could have wanted. The bathroom was small but well planned and had a great shower!. The super comfortable bed and really quiet position meant we slept well. Nathan and the rest of the front desk staff were very helpful and made sure we had a great stay. Great position and loved the art, we will be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_443578507~“A Gem in Prahran”~A hidden away treasure in the heart of prahran offering a unique experience.  With a well planned room that had ever thing for a short or long stay . A cafe that offered the most amazing food for the health conscious to amazing burgers.  Staff were knowledgeable with the area and just a short walk to the Prahran market and a tram ride from the heart of Melbourne.  We will return~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_443404689~“Comfort again”~Love this boutique hotel which is friendly and comfortable. Front desk couldn't have done more. Beds were a dream. Location very close to public transport and shops. I'll be back as soon as I can. Great stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443356581~“Simply Great”~The location and hotel staff were really great. Everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, and nice. Restaurants of all sorts are nearby. To the city is only 5 to10 minutes by car. Room deco is fantastic.  Many thanks to Nayton or Nathan ( not of spelling ) and the one who gave my son a paint set.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443238449~“Always a pleasure, but don't expect parking.”~Having stayed here a few times now, the staff are always super friendly and helpful, and the rooms are amazing. The only suggestion I'd make to The Cullen is to have an option when booking to request a carpark spot for your stay. When we arrived we were told that the carpark was full. We parked along the street, and I asked reception if they could notify me via phone when a spot was available, as I didn't feel comfortable leaving my car parked on the street on a Saturday night in Prahran. I confirmed my phone number, however we were never notified. I'm not sure if the Cullen's carpark is open for use from the general public, but if so, I feel they should allow guests to reserve a spot when making a booking.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_442655247~“Funky digs in the zone in Melbourne”~This was a nice place to stay. In the heart of Prahan and across the road from an excellent fresh food market, this art series hotel gave a good vibe for a happy Occassion to visit Melbourne. In town for a graduation, we were on a high and the room with its amazing art and stories to match did not disappoint. We travelled with two teenagers and they were impressed too. The only draw back is the open plan means that the room privacy is limited which was not a huge issue for us. Also the kids did not like the frosted glass walls to the toilets (prudes!) I would come again as a couple and go lower level with the kids to give them some space next time.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_441816668~“Quirky, cool, and true 5 star service”~I love this place. Rooms are stylish and well appointed. Building is cool. Art is great. The restaurant downstairs does great food and coffee. The staff are fantastic, approachable and always keen to help. Everything a hotel should be.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441748791~“Great location and good value”~We stayed at this hotel for the weekend.  It is excellent value. Great location close to restaurants and shops but still not noisy. The Pathan Food market is just across the road too.  I think the room cleaning daily could be a bit more thorough.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440492495~“Comfortable, great location and friendly staff.”~Had a great weekend stay at the Cullen. Rooms are well appointed with more than you need. Not huge but the beds are very good. The location is great if you want markets, cafes and lots of variety. Not cheap however worth the expense.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_438163215~“Awesome with no complaints”~Had a quick overnight stay in Melbourne for business and was surprised when the travel agent booked The Cullen. Upon arrival i was greeted by the most friendly staff who were quick to identify themselves by name. After 5 different modes of transport that day to get from home to the hotel (bus, ferry, train, plane and taxi) together with a 6 hour meeting all I was looking forward to was a hot shower and a comfy bed. The Cullen certainly didn't fall short of that, with a huge shower head that was at perfect height (at 6 foot after a long day of work I hate finding a hotel shower head that's too low that I can't adjust high enough so I don't have to bend over) and a king bed with 4 of the most comfortable pillows (better then what I have at home and I thought that was good) that it made it difficult to get out and explore the wonderful surroundings later that evening. Needless to say, I had an amazing stay and sleep. Thanks for a great home away from home stay, well recommended and will be back again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437903094~“Great location! Comfortable beds! Tiny soap...”~This is a great place to stay when visiting Melbourne. The Cullen is located opposite Prahran Market, and a short walk to shops, bars, cafes and restaurants on Chapel Street and nearby Toorak. There's a tram stop around the corner and you are in the city in 10-12 mins. If it's windy... the tram stop catches a breeze and there's no shelter, so be prepared for that. This is my 3rd stay at the Cullen, the smaller rooms are fine. Absolutely perfect for a weekend. The larger rooms, definitely are bigger and the space helps - but is it better for a weekend? Probably not, if you're staying longer - then I'd go for the space. Always, the beds have been super comfortable - slept solidly, on all visits. If getting a good sleep is a priority... try this place out. The only thing at odds with the feel is the tiny soap... Even for a weekend, you'll end up calling housekeeping for another. But they are happy to bring you more - you might have to wait a while. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436965143~“great hotel”~Our room had everything we needed. The staff were great. We arrived late, and the car park was full; so we left reception the car keys and they were able to park the car later in the night when the linen had been collected. The bed was very comfortable and the new linen was really wonderful. There was a lovely gesture left on the bed, as it was our 19th stay at the Cullen. The late checkout is really appreciated as we are only able to have a sleep in when we are away from our business.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436490496~“Quirky eclectic hotel”~Recently stayed there for work as my normal hotel was booked due to Melbourne Cup, it's in a great location directly opposite the Praha markets which was great but didn't realise they close on Wednesday. Room service was very nice and the breakfast was excellent, the rooms are very different but very clean and modern. My only call out would be the room I stayed in you had to watch the TV from the bed as even though wall mounted you couldn't really move it and the bedside tables you can't put anything on them due to their style. Overall a very nice hotel.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436241065~“Artsy hotel in hipster neighbourhood”~Tastefully decorated, spacious rooms with beautiful artwork on the walls.

review_435763830~“Great hotel - not so great room”~We chose The Cullen as our wedding night hotel and from the moment we contacted them, they were fantastic. Terrific experience booking the hotel and really friendly staff who made us feel special right from the outset. We even got a complimentary bottle of champagne, a late checkout and a lovely handwritten note in the room to welcome us. Perhaps the only thing not right about our stay was the free room upgrade. Don't get me wrong - it was a lovely gesture, but we were moved to a room on a higher floor with a very comfy bed and an outdoor balcony... and on a windy night, the constant rattling and squeaking of the outdoor screens were enough to keep us awake for quite a while. But much worse than that was having our upgraded room located right near the lifts... and literally right next door to a conference room... where a conference was being held on a Sunday morning (!!). Although the conference didn't seem to start until 10am, the arrivals began at 8am... which meant a constant level of noise from the lifts, constant squeals and loud "hellos" as people greeted each other as they arrived, regular bouts of applause from the conference, and of course attendees having to walk right past our front door to get to the bathrooms. It made room upgrade and the late checkout pointless as we were woken up at 8am and didn't get any sleep after that. The noise got so loud we decided just to get up and have breakfast instead. Not really the experience we had hoped for and poor planning on behalf of the Cullen staff - someone must have known that there was a conference on that morning and that it wouldn't make the greatest sense to put newlyweds on their wedding night in a room right next to all of that. We would rather have stayed in the room we originally booked - anywhere but the room we ended up with. The upgrade gesture was appreciated and in the right spirit, but it's the attention to detail that separates the good from the great.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435471644~“Very cool!”~I stayed at The Cullen a couple of weeks ago for my birthday with my sister and a friend. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the mini penthouse suite (happy birthday to me!). This would normally be out of our budget so it was a real treat to stay in this room. It was gorgeous and had lots of cool and funky artwork and furnishings. It was well equipped with a kitchen and super comfy beds. The staff we encountered were helpful and gave us info on local places to eat, get a coffee and have a drink. I would definitely stay here again.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_433832403~“A Luxurious Treat”~I loved staying here. The room was of a reasonable size with a kitchenette and decent sized bathroom. The artwork may be garish for some but I think it's great to stay somewhere a bit left of centre and really enjoyed my experience. Great location, just off Chapel street or jump on a tram into the city. Nice view looking toward the city, too. Can't wait to come back.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433119768~“Recommended”~We got what we requested a room away from the street which was larger too. Grammercy staff great too make a mean coffee and martini. Check in no issue, Daily papers at the checkin desk a bonus as is the T2.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan
review_432804637~“Quirky place!”~Lovely hotel with friendly and happy staff at check in counter. Clean and well equipped room with comfortable bed and sufficient blankets . When I first walked into the room I was a bit overstimulated by all the art and details in the room. But once I got settled in, it actually works quite nicely. The mini bar is well stocked with affordable items . I'd recommend the DIY canvas for donation to the hotel!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432576687~“My Sanctuary”~I took a long term stay at the Cullen between settling on my property and purchasing a new one. I certainly can see the attraction in living long term in a good hotel. The long term stay rates are generous. Management are generous on all counts. I thoroughly enjoyed engaging with the front desk. No matter whether I had a parking issue or electronic card malfunction, they had my back and found immediate solutions to mitigate any potential crisis. The room delivery was consistently DELICIOUS. The flexibility on any and all matters was outstanding and much appreciated given my vulnerable situation. Robert, the Manager was super efficient offering genuine warmth and care factor. The room was good. Upon checking, I expressed disappointment at not having a balcony. Within ten minutes I was upgraded and ushered to a balcony suite. Essential amenity if you enjoy having a drink on the balcony & anonymously watching the Chapel St action. The beds & bedding is luxe divine although I didn't feel great looking at Ned Kelly with a gun facing out at me from the dividing frosted glass wall to the bathroom. My one and only criticism and one that would defs serve as a deterrent if I was to return, for more than a single night is the ludicrously narrow wardrobe. Impossible for one, let alone two coats and a hung shirt due to the size, made even smaller because the ironing board, iron etc are all hooked to the internal wardrobe panel. Worst design feature ever! The other neg was the wifi, but I received as much support with tech issues as required by a most accomplished hotel staff member. Sarah (?).  It was really special being part of this friendly professional community for three months. And living op the Pran Matket and beside The Cool Hunter was dangerously good too. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432260649~“Quirky Decor, Spacious Room”~Decorated around the work of Adam Cullen, the decor is arresting if repetitive. The room was spacious, bed comfortable. There is a large refrigerator, kettle, microwave, stove top and bar area. In the summer or spring, the large balcony would be a great plus. The housekeeping was a bit haphazard and lackadaisical. Front desk staff cheery and accommodating. The attached restaurant was very noisy... the music was always at a volume that made thinking let alone conversing challenging. While I can kind of get this during the evening cocktail hours, it was very annoying at breakfast. That said the breakfast menu was good and the service prompt and pleasant.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_431695689~“Great stay, great service, great staff.”~Great position.Great bed.Great staff.

review_431631130~“Bit tired”~My wife and I spent a night in a $730 suite. While it was nice enough and the staff were friendly the room itself was a bit tired. Door hanging of the fridge, towels and robes scratchy and overdue replacing, hatch into wall for services left open. Bit disappointing for somewhere that expensive.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431380114~“Stylish, interesting hotel in a great location”~Stayed in Prahran for a foodie weekend and you couldn't get better than to stay opposite Prahran Markets, within cooee of the myriad eateries of Chapel Street (soooo many) and the splendid Chez Olivier french restaurant within 400 metres. Try the great Rufus bar on the other side of the small park from Chez Olivier - very stylish. The Cullen was exactly as we hoped... stylish and with very comfortable, well executed rooms. We'll be back. Our room was pretty quiet except for the noise of room doors slamming occasionally.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_431054179~“Wonderful!”~Lovely staff. Hotel was clean, funky and comfy. We were also lucky enough to be upgraded. Restaurant downstairs had great coffee. Only fault was that we could here guests in the function room all night. Would stay here again in a heart beat.~5~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_429869383~“Great return stay”~Return stay this time for business to attend a conference in the city. The hotel is close to train station so this saved having to drive. Staff were lovely and helpful and this time we had a lovely meal in the Chinese restaurant for my birthday. The room was set up for wheelchair access needs which was great but I wish they would act on my previous feedback and change the sink to make it more accessible for wheelchair user. The sink is a bit old anyway and could so with a refresh. Also we were overcharged for one night, was fixed quickly when I picked this up, I think it's a problem with art series hotel computer system as we've had this happen before at other art series hotels. So fix the sink and the overcharging issue and will be five star review . Thanks again, we'll be back~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429802530~“Quirky and cool”~Second time I stayed here, this time for 9 nights. Nice location, funky design. Friendly staff, large and well appointed (apartment style) rooms. Very small (but adequate gym), and 2 really good restaurants downstairs. Close to many cool and hip pubs and wine bars. Tram stop 30 basically outside the door on Commercial street, only 20 min to city centre. Well worth a look at if you looking for a place to stay in the Prahan area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429492818~“Modern hotel with a modern feel”~Nicely located opposite the Prahran markets close to the Alfred, Chapel St and a $15 taxi ride to the city. Rooms are spacious and well appointed with kitchenette, iron, free wifi and a comfortable bed. Some outside noise filters in and noise from the corridor also makes it's way into the room. The bathroom/toilet was adequate but on the lower side of the scale for a five star establishment; it was utilitarian rather than luxurious and some discoloration was evident in the grout between tiles. Front desk staff were efficient and polite.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_425508765~“Clean and Comfortable ”~Booked this hotel as it was recommended by The Alfred Hospital and it was only a 10-minute walk away. Has two cafes along the stretch... Chapel Street not too far off and Prahan Market just opposite the hotel. Nice and comfortable room equipped with kitchenette stuff and microwave. Staff were friendly and helpful. However, it would have been great if the bottled water (at least one) was free... Could have saved me the decision-making process of $4 for a bottle at 2am. Self-service laundry on every floor I think... Love it but would prefer if the machines were cleaner..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424606727~“Ideal, trendy, comfy - A1”~Quality location close to the busy Chapel St. Plenty of places to eat and the Prahran markets are directly across the road. The hotel staff are friendly and check in was made easy by pre doing so 24 hours out so we got fast tracked at the hotel. You can hire 1 of 3 smart cars for only $50 a day from 7am to 11pm to scoot around Melbourne. Well known breakfast joint Tall Timber is 300m away. Uber cars in this area are in abundance. Gym is not state of the art.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424498534~“Really trendy hotel, great location”~Love visiting the Cullen in Melbourne, great location, right in the middle of Prahan with plenty of bars, restaurants and things to do around the hotel.

review_421866867~“I have a thing for The Art Series 😍”~The Art Series Hotels have to be amongst the best in Australia. They represent great value for money, are always immaculately clean and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. The Cullen is no exception - fun, funky, quiet and oh so comfortable beds!!! For this reason booking I am a frequent customer at their hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421041523~“nice”~everything was perfect. only downside was that i needed to book a cab to get to a work meeting in the morning. use a weird system where the cab booking needs to be accepted and my booking wasnt 'accepted' so i sat waiting not realising a cab was not on its way. ended up having to run out and hail a cab. need to be transparent about this 'service'.  on the upside, staff were lovely, the design and room, great.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_420089214~“Awesome boutique feel”~Very cool hotel full of wonderfully weird art. Friendly staff, solid location, breakfast at the hotel restaurant was good. Overall happy with the hotel.
