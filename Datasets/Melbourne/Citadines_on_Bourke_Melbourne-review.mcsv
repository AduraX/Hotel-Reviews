review_478384464~“Feedback for Citadines”~-consistency in providing resolution to a problem -they do selective cleaning as there are times that they would only clean certain dishes. They will not clean all even if the housekeeping is supposed to clean everything. ~4~4~5~5~5~2~3~nan
review_470231371~“Fantastic Place to Stay”~My husband & I stayed at The Citadines 20 - 23rd March. It was a fantastic place to stay. The room was a good size, modern & spotlessly clean. It had a microwave, fridge, dishwasher, toaster & everything else required to cook at meal. Every cooking utensil & piece of crockery was also clean. The Hotel has a free tram stop out the front & is less than 5 minutes walk to Bourke St Mall Shopping precinct. It is also walking distance to many Melbourne attractions. The staff were friendly, helpful & gave us a room upgrade, which was lovely. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, have only good things to say about the Citadines & would certainly stay again. Highly recommended~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_477839097~“Just perfect”~Here are the things that are important to us wherever we stay. Large room. Clean bathrooms. Comfortable beds. Proximity to theatres, restaurants and bars. The Citadines exceeds all of these and more. We slept until 11am the first proper morning (normally awake at 6, so the beds are obviously dreamlike!). City views were an unexpected bonus - we were on the 22nd floor! This place is really good value for money. Special mention to Sandy and Harwinder who were on reception when we checked in. We'd arrived on a "red-eye" flight, so were tired and disheveled. They really looked after us, and even managed to get us into our room early, which we weren't expecting. Thanks guys - you gave us a great start to our holiday Melbourne!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477602200~“Nothing left undone”~This great modern and spotlessly clean property and the staff make this inner city property well worth serious consideration on your next stay in Melbourne. Excelent location in the heart of the CBD, excellent staff who do not hesitate to go to the extremes to make your stay more comforatble and vertainly relaxing.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_477366386~“Fantastic stay!”~Our family of four stayed for five nights in a two bedroom suite. The room was very spacious - king bed in one room and two singles in another, with a large lounge/dining room and kitchen. The kitchen included a microwave, dishdrawer, large fridge, stove top and all small appliances and cutlery. We had one (large) main bathroom and an ensuite - great for a family of four! The room was very clean and modern.  The hotel is in a fantastic location on Bourke Street with a tram stop outside the front door, a short walk to the Bourke Street mall shops, and a good range of restaurants within a few blocks.  The kids enjoyed the lap pool, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a fantastic stay and would definitely stay at Citadines on Bourke next time we are in Melbourne!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477280538~“Very well run, comfortable and convenient ”~We booked the two bedroom deluxe - it had two spacious bathrooms and everything was clean and new. The daily Housekeeping was really thorough with change of linen and towels and there is a complimentary launderette for the rooms which don't have a washing machine. The location is very convenient - would definitely stay here again. The service is very friendly and efficient too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475988967~“Good location but not much for the money”~The location is great, but that's all you get. This was very overpriced and didn't include the basics to start us off for breakfast. We had to keep phoning for clean tea towels and towels In Europe you always get four towels, two each. Housekeeping wouldn't put the dishwasher on and unload. We gad to phone for laundry detergent, this should already be in the apartment. The bed was very uncomfortable, rooms are smallish. We got stuck in the lift for about 15minutes, later on during the day all we got was a courtesy call to see if we were OK!!!!~3~2~3~2~3~3~3~nan

review_475708165~“Our 30th Wedding Anniversary”~We chose Melbourne's Citadines Bourke Hotel Apartment for a short night before our Hot Air Balloon flight over Melbourne. We were pleasantly surprised with the size of the apartment considering its location near the top end of Bourke Street in Melbourne's CBD. Our room was spacious with plenty of space for relaxing, working or cooking a light meal. An equally spacious double walk in shower was ideal. The only negative I have, and it is a small one, the designers have located the hand basin in a small alcove in the room...not in the bathroom. However, I consider that a very small negative when compared to the location and size of the apartment. I would love to return to Citadines on Bourke. Unfortunately (nothing to do with Citadines) the aforementioned hot air balloon flight was cancelled due to strong northerly winds, at 0350 so we manged another few hours comfortable sleep in our quiet before heading home.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475571432~“Great city views and plenty of space”~Booked an Executive Studio room for a working trip. Plenty of space and a great view of the city centre. Has a small kitchen with oven, hobs and fridge. Staff are very helpful and friendly - almost every time i came through reception after finishing work I was greeted by the staff there. Trams 86 and 96 stop outside and many other routes are a few minutes walk away in Swanston Street.  There is no shortage of food choice nearby especially vietnamese, chinese and Japanese but also burgers and so on.  Great choice for a centrally located hotel.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475208441~“So close to Bourke street,all your shopping dreams come true.”~Locations to Bourke Street Mall is great. Meaning that you can easily transport your purchases back to your apartment, then go for some more shopping. And it's within walking distance to all theatres and night entertainment venues. Access to the tram right out the front. Quiet rooms with everything one would want.  The front desk staff were so helpful and friendly.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474408278~“Nice rooms and good location”~We stayed in a two bed single room arrangement, beds were very close together but the apartment was nice with a writing desk and a comfortable couch, fridge and basic bowls/cutlery allowing us to eat in if we wanted. Wouldn't go for the pool or the gym but the rooms were very nice~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_473959526~“Fantastic Destination”~My daughter and I stayed at Citadines for 6 nights. What a fantastic location with the tram literally at the doorstep. Very clean room with all amenities required for a short stay. Rooms freshened daily and up to a great high standard. Facilities great with a well equipped mini gym and a fabulous lap pool. The reception staff always offered a kind greeting when passing.  I would highly recommend the city view rooms with the floor to ceiling windows, what an amazing sight - we didn't close the curtains during the night as it was such a beautiful sight. Well located and appointed, we will return.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473938121~“Good place to stay for a good gym and location”~I have stayed here in the past for business and the stay that I have had again was good.

review_473704071~“Hunters”~Friendly and efficient staff with a central location ideal for shopping and dining in Melbourne. Room had everything required and was spotless. Free wifi and laundry was an added bonus from previous visits.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_473548763~“Love this hotel!”~Excellent service, reasonably priced for melbourne CBD. Easy access to trams- right outside the door in the free tram zone. Catch a tram or walk 5mins to Bourke street mall. Rooms are clean, smell lovely, and are secure. Make sure you get a room with a view of Bourke street- we got a bad view of the building next door. Parking is expensive, so if you have a car you should book online for the car park garage next to the hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473027368~“For the most part really good, but there could be some minor improvements”~By and large really good. Very comfortable bed. Apartment very clean. Internet very good and included in the price, unlike some Melbourne apartment chains. Pool is very good - you can actually swim in it! And a great location. Staff are very helpful - a problem with the room was sorted out very efficiently. On the slight downside - provision of kitchen equipment rather limited. The assumption seems to be that cooking will involve re-heating TV dinners. There is no coffee machine of any type, not even a cafetiere.  Overall, a great place to stay for a week or so but the apartment facilities are a bit limited for a longer stay~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472569386~“Great great great!”~Great location Beautifully clean Helpful and welcoming staff. Super comfortable beds and fantastic view of the Melbourne skyline from our executive apartment on 21st floor... well worth the slight difference in price!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472539257~“Unexpectedly disappointing”~I have stayed here 4 times in the past 5 months (3days each time) This time I have felt the need to share my review as I was extremely disappointed with several things 1. I have emailed asking to be helped with a corporate rate as I have conferences here every month and travelling with a newborn baby it's convenient staying on location. No one got back to me and I ended up paying 35% more for the apartment  2. The apartment is filthy! The carpet and sofa was grubby 3. There was no cable for the DVD to work 4. No batteries in the remote.  Overall it was incredibly disappointing~3~1~4~3~3~2~3~nan
review_472290164~“excellent accomodation option in the heart of Malbourne”~Apartments were less pricy than hotels, very well situated, clean and convnient. It is a very convnient option for business travelers on a relatively low budget but also in order to be more relaxed than the sterilised hotel environemnt.~5~4~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_472258725~“Central, clean”~Hotel very easy to get to tram stop outside door Block from the Bourke Street Mall.  Room was very comfortable with a separate area with a couch, room was clean  Staff all friendly gave me a call when room was ready~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472242034~“Very good, a bit noisy”~Rooms are spacious, clean. Personally I could do without the kitchenette as I don't use it, and find it gross to walk out of the hallway smelling someone else's breakfast. But that's just me, I wouldn't hold it against the hotel. Everything was super easy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472010942~“One of the best hotels I've stayed in”~I have travelled to all capital cities in Australia and stayed at some great hotels. Citadines is one of the best for a number of reasons. Firstly, the hotel listens to your room requests - I asked for a quiet room, away from the lifts and laundry and with a stand alone shower. Citadines granted all of these requests with my room located facing Little Collins Street and with a stand alone shower instead of a shower over the bath. Secondly, the hotel is modern and well-equipped with a small kitchenette, dishwasher, microwave. I even had a little couch. Thirdly, my research indicated that the windows were double-glazed and I found that I could hear hardly any traffic noise which in other cities had woken me up early in the morning. The minor exception were trucks reversing into the hotel loading bay. I find it difficult to give a hotel 5 stars but for the reasons outlined above Citadines was 5 stars for me. Well done!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471750739~“Getaway”~We enjoyed our stay here. Booked 2 rooms - a studio and a 1 bedroom apartment and both were great. Cleanliness could have been better as I found a toothpick on the floor next to the bed when I checked in. However no major complains. Location was accessible and we could walk around the city and return to the hotel to rest or freshen up whenever we wanted. Parking was $30 aud a day and was fuss free. Housekeeping was daily even though we were informed by front desk that Sundays were rest day. My room was cleaned after I put up the "Make up my room sign" and that was great. Launderette was complimentary and easy to use - great for long term stays. Gym was well equipped and nice.  Staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly although we had a hard time trying to get a room extension due to the popularity of the hotel. Eventually managed to get a late check out at 5pm for $90aud. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471750730~“Great stay”~Enjoyed staying here - had a one bed exec apartment 20 floors up.  The room itself had a separate living area, kitchenette, bedroom and huge bathroom - but no bath. Each floor also had self-service laundry facilities - really useful. Was a really useful base for a few days, especially as we could do simple meals ourselves. Staff were really friendly and value was good. Excellent location - with (free) trams directly outside. Couple of slight downsides: sofa in the lounge was very uncomfortable, couldn't relax well plus lack of light in shower- made it a bit dark. Other than that, great stay and would recommend.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471658911~“Comfortable hotel in CBD”~Hotel is conveniently located in the free tram zone of the CBD. My request for a room with a view was met. Staff is friendly and works efficiently. I had back problems sleeping on a soft matress and it was exchanged for a firmer one the next day,additional towels were supplied instantly. Pool and gym in good and clean xondition.Closet space is way too small for 2 adults staying for a longer period of time.Booking was for 1 bedroom,executive floor.Overall a very satisfactory stay,will definitely be back!~5~4~5~4~4~3~5~nan

review_470988695~“Great location in Melbourne CBD”~Wonderful location near inner city restaurants and very quick to Southern Cross station at the other end of Bourke St on the free trams. We had a good view to the west from the 19th floor. Spacious clean room with a sensible well equipped kitchenette. Bathroom vanity was in the main room which is a bit odd but worked OK. Nice swimming pool considering the tight inner city site.~4~3~5~5~4~5~3~nan
review_470937267~“Can't be Beat”~Just for the location, this property can't be beat. The fact that the rooms are fairly spacious and beds super comfy are just nice extras.  Even better is the staff at reception, who are always ready to help with just about any random question. I asked where I could find a particular beer on draft and the woman went out of her way to find it for me.  I had a city-view room on the 18th that was very nice. The shower door didn't close all the way and the vanity was a little narrow but these are very minor issues in an otherwise great property.  Did I mention free wifi that is strong and fast enough to allow VOIP calls? All in all, this was my second stay here and I have no reason to look for another hotel in Melbourne next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470691476~“Cozy, comfortable and convenient”~Staff was nice and helpful (great advises for dinner), location is almost unbeatable and the rooms were large, comfortable and very well equipped. Particularly the kitchen had everything you would need. An additional chair is likely the only thing that could be improved. I will certainly choose this place for my next time in Melbourne.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_469722114~“Great location”~Being located here was just great, lovely restaurants and eateries near by. Free tram right outside the door gave access to other areas or connected you to train stations. Staff were extremely friendly and room was lovely. Great size rooms with nice kitchen and living space. Carpet was a little tired, but hey this did not impact our stay. The pool was great as was the sauna, we made use of this each day, and were pretty much enjoying this on our own. Took a peak at the gym and that was well set up also, but not really my thing on a vacation. Bedrooms had separate air con, so we could adjust to different needs and while out the room was serviced and it was lovely to come back to a clean well set up room. I would happily return here.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469515741~“Great Position Great Hotel”~Positioned perfectly for Melbourne CBD shopping and events Citadines on Bourke is a value for money, comfortable hotel.

review_469042547~“Great location and awesome amenities”~We stayed in a studio room and it was everything that a couple needed while travelling. We had a king bed and lounge, Once thing we noted was that the hand basin was outside the bathroom which was convenience, especially when someone was in the shower. The life were quick with 3 available, staff were friendly and helpful and the cleanliness of our room was spot on. Excellent location with the trams being right out the front, but also very quiet in the rooms (even though we were located right next to the lifts). Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting fuss free accomodation for their city stay.~4~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_469024657~“Fantastic Apart-Hotel ”~This apart hotel was very well appointed. We booked a deluxe studio but I believe ours was upgraded to a one bedroom as the bedroom was separate. It had a lovely big lounge kitchen area and was very comfortable. The Tram through the middle of Melbourne cbd was at the door and this Tram also goes down to St Kilda so its easy to get around, though we rarely used it as everything we needed was in walking distance. Bourke St mall is one block, as are the theatres and China town. I've been to Melbourne four times now and I will rebook this hotel for future travel, have definitely found our favourite!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467750472~“Home Away From Home”~Citadines service apartments offer a relaxing atmosphere. The one bedroom studio apartment is good for 2 person although the bed is a bit small and there is no bath tub. You can probably do simple cooking with the small and simple kitchenette and it would have been ideal if they had provided a small dining table and chairs for meals. The gym was well equipped with well serviced machines sufficient for a good workout and the 18m pool was suitable for a decent swim but not so suitable for families with kids to have fun, it is more of a lap pool. Staff at Citadines were pleasant and helpful, except they did not understand well about tourist tax refund matters. What makes Citadines stand out is the location. It is right on Bourke Street, and you can practically walk around the city from where you are or just hop on the free inner city tram to get around...There are many interesting shops, restaurants and bars in every direction, all within a stone throw. Ideal for folks who loves to shop, dine or even pub crawl as you can practically crawl back to Citadines with minimum effort wherever you are within the inner city..... Well, we are definitely coming back to Citadines in our next visit .....~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_467164226~“Good value”~Good to be in the heart of the city at a reasonable price. I had a lower room so very dark with a view of a close by wall, clean except for some stains on the carpet and an odd smell (in fairness when I told staff on leaving they said they would have happily changed my room if I'd told them). Loved the toiletries. Room service comes from the Japanese restaurant downstairs which had very limited choices for a vegetarian. However my pumpkin soup was nice and came quite quickly even if in a plastic container- there were dishes in the room I could have put it into. Free wifi. Staff attentive, friendly and capable. I had quite a roomy studio type room which had a desk for working, small kitchenette type area, small bathroom (basin out next to the couch, but great shower, comfortable bed. Not my favourite sort of hotel - utilitarian is maybe the word I'm looking for - but would suit many travellers.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466676855~“Value for money ”~This apartment style hotel is by no means luxurious but it is of a good high standard and in a truly excellent location. The rooms on the side at lower levels can be rather dark as there is little natural light due to facing an adjacent building.  Very convenient having a kitchenette. Nice quality toiletries supplied. Staff at reception were very helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466503800~“Amazing value for such a reasonable price”~My mum and I stayed at Citadines for 3 nights as a more affordable option, than our usual crown metropol. Could not fault this place at all! So very central, close to pretty much everything, and if not, tram access is outside the doorstep. Very polite and helpful staff, no issues at all with noise, was given a nice view on the 19th floor, and love that it was fitted with kitchen appliances, tv, Ipod doc, etc. will 100% be back here!

review_466181080~“Far better than expected for the price”~I was travelling to Melbourne at the last minute to catch up with a friend. I had left my hotel booking to literally the last minute after arriving at Melbourne airport. I was staying for a weekend and wanted to be right in the city but didn't really want to pay a lot of money for this unexpected trip. Citadines came up on TripAdvisor as a potential option and though it didn't look that fancy, it was very reasonable and very central. I was so pleasantly surprised when I arrived (after midnight). The staff were incredibly lovely and helpful. They informed me about the white night festival that was on and gave me some good advice about where to go in the city. The room was so spacious and had everything I needed. Just a wonderful experience. The good parts: The staff were superb. No matter what time, day or night, they were helpful and went above and beyond to make my stay great. The rooms were large and comfortable. Mine had a lounge and a bathroom with a great shower. The price was very reasonable for central Melbourne. The not so good parts: The window of my room looked in on another room not far away. This is expected on the lower floors in the central city so no big deal. Would I return? Absolutely yes! If you want a reasonably priced stay in central Melbourne in a comfortable room then this is a great hotel.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466156335~“Home away from home in the heart of Melbourne”~Wonderful staff, quiet, clean comfortable apartments, great location. When we arrived for a 10 day stay we were able to move to a higher floor for more light and a better view- the lower room was lovely but windows looked out on building walls. The staff are the most helpful I have ever encountered. Looking forward to the next visit already!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_465834044~“Worth your while.”~Citadines is in the heart of CBD and the location makes this a great home base for checking out the city's main attractions (such as Melbourne Park/the Australian Open). We stayed in an executive studio room, complete with a kitchenette and small living area. The room was clean (bonus points for the stereo), the bed was comfortable, and the views weren't too bad either. There are also laundry facilities on every third floor — and they're free (all you need to do is ask for detergent).  My one minor complaint is that check-in wasn't as smooth as it should've been. We were coming off a long, international flight and just wanted to settle in ASAP. If you say check-in is at a certain time, it'd be great to actually have the room available at that time. Overall, a great property with knowledgable staff.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465475753~“The Little Things”~This apartment hotel stands out from the rest. The staff are intensely dedicated to your needs. Thats sounds a bit OTT, but they welcome you, and they try to check you in swiftly in a charming and responsive manner. There is the possibility of early check in if rooms are available, which is almost unheard of elsewhere, and they are happy to search for that ready room. When you get there the room is clean, not too hot or cold, and some of them have quirky design with sliding panels between living area and sleeping area, which just makes it feel different, without having a 'suite' price tag. Furthermore little things contribute. The flex on the iron, which works and has steam, is long enough to enable you actually to iron without standing on a chair, with the board vertical, or sending for a 2 metre adaptor to reach the nearest plug to where you can iron and watch TV at the same time. The sink is external to the shower room; very nice touch! The shower allows you to have one without your elbows scraping the walls. And what's more the water temperature is continuously controllable from hot to cold. The downstairs restaurant, although not part of the hotel, serves great Japanese inspired fusion cuisine, and has a good wine list, and nice beers. If you want to cater for yourself there is a good range of equipment. Theres a gym and a small pool. Little but nice.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_465448383~“Value for money”~Great location, friendly helpful staff, nice room and comfy beds...........stress free holiday accommodation. Were able to get shuttle service from hotel to airport also and they were great also. Will be coming back~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465203556~“good”~had an ok time. as stated many times not happy with the bathroom layout. water was everywhere and needed multiple towels to clean up or there was a slips and trips hazard. shower nozzle wouldn't stay upright- very annoying!!~3~4~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_464918556~“Excellent hotel in the CBD of Melbourne”~It's excellent hotel to stay, the location easy you to move anywhere you want to, the facilities are well provided and the hotel staff was very helpful. The hotel are surrounded with the option of restaurants~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_464480685~“Great business stay!”~Room: very confortable. Clean and spacious. Shower is great. Wifi high speed. Hotel: well located, close to restaurants and in front of free tram. Breakfast is served in the restaurant, was not included in my room price. But is delicious! In general, would recommend this hotel for a business traveller and families! Ah! The kitchen is very well equipped.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_463970991~“Excellent value”~Location is great, right in the city centre. Melbourne is generally a well-connected city and the accommodation is located right in front of a tram station. Amenities within the room itself is also great, as there is a mini pantry so if you don't feel like going out for a meal or want to save some money, there is the option of cooking. The rooms are spacious...feels more like a studio rather than a hotel room.  My only peeve is that the service at the restaurant is super slow. Not a good idea if you're in a rush.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463652634~“Home from home ”~We have stayed here several times and it really does feel like a home from home. The staff, without exception, are friendly and welcoming and the facilities are just what a traveller needs - basic kitchen, launderette and spacious rooms. Also the location is perfect for city, shopping, restaurants and transportation. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463608487~“Great location and amenities”~I chose the Citadines for a weekend getaway and was very happy with the location, the cleanliness and spacious room, and the extremely friendly service team. Being close to Parliament station was very helpful as I needed to travel from the city to some outer suburbs. While the view itself was just a wall of the next building, that was not as important to me - as getting out of my room and exploring and enjoying Melbourne's fantastic hospitality and shopping. Going 'home' to a comfortable room, a very comfortable bed and clean and secure surroundings was my impression of Citadines. I would love to stay again, and the Pool and Sauna were immaculate.... so relaxing. The walk to Federation Square, South Bank and surrounds is just a short stroll really and nearby shopping and cafes, everything is right there, it's a great location and vibe.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_463594837~“Outstanding location and apartment”~Our 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment was on level 24, with an outlook over city rooftops to the sea in the distance. It was quiet, light and pleasantly furnished with everything in very good condition. The kitchen in the open plan living area was well equipped, with a half sized dishwasher, complete with sachets of powder. Tea and coffee sachets, sugar and individual milk portions were provided. The only odd feature is the lack of a cutlery drawer. The cutlery was in a tray in a cupboard near the front door! Our beds were comfortable with quality bed linen and blockout curtains ensured a good night's rest. I appreciated the bedside reading lights and the manual found in the hall cupboard with full instructions for all appliances. The cupboards were very generous, with removable coat hangers. but only 3 drawers. We appreciated the wi fi, individual air conditioning control panel in each room and the extra tv in the main bedroom.  The main bathroom was spacious with a level access shower and the en suite was also well appointed, with a large mirrored cabinet with storage, excellent hair dryer, and particularly good shampoo, conditioner, liquid and bar soaps and body lotion. The shower was located over the bath but a grab rail had been installed for ease of access.  The property is particularly well situated and unlike many apartment buildings is on a well lit, wide street. There are many cafes nearby and the main shopping area is only a block away. If you wish to buy groceries, there is a small convenience store close by and a very comprehensive Woolworths about a ten minutes walk away in the QV building. Theatres, museums and other main attractions are within easy, level walking distance. The only feature that I missed was a washing machine, though this is available in the Executive 2 bedroom apartments. However, small items of washing dried easily overnight in the bathroom.  We had a problem with the door swipe which was immediately fixed and a request for more black tea resulted in multiple packets within 5 minutes. We found this property to be exceptional in every way and would certainly choose it again when visiting Melbourne.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463397910~“Great hotel”~Back again for a few days and still very well run with efficient helpful staff. Always friendly and offer advice. Great central location with tram at the door. Clean modern apartments and rooms should suit most people.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_463364160~“Amazing Room and Service”~I stayed here November 2016 with my friend, and my boyfriend in one room together. I was afraid that with the room being meant for two people, there would be a problem sleeping a third person. The hotel was very accommodating and organized a roll away bed that was even comfier than the one in the room, and there was still so much space for all three of us. We arrived at approximately 6am when we got to Melbourne and the Hotel already had the room ready for us to check in. The room was immaculately tidy and actually looked liked their promotional pictures. The kitchenette was very handy and came with pots and pans and all the utensils we needed to make ourselves breakfast. I don't usually leave reviews, and I actually forgot to until I saw the hotel advertised again - But I would definitely stay here again and I recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere very affordable to stay without compromising luxury or comfort.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463103208~“Short stay in Melbourne”~This apartment is in a wonderful position, close to the centre of town and public transport. There are a number of very nice restaurants in the immediate vicinity and it is a short walk to the Chinatown area and the large number of restaurants there. The apartment we booked was large and both the bathrooms were also large. It was very clean and in good repair. The furniture and fittings were all very nice and in good condition. Every single staff member we dealt with was very friendly and happy to help with any queries or requests. I was very happy with the location of the apartments and could not think of anywhere better to stay if I was staying in the CBD area. I would absolutely book these apartments again and would recommend them to anyone.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_462675512~“Average hotel to stay”~Stayed here from 17-22/2/17. The people working at the reception were awesome. They were helpful and very willingly to introduce us to places to visit as this was my first time to Melbourne. The room was spacious, bright and tidy. There was a common laundry room at our level to wash and dry your clothes. Simply collect laundry detergent from the receptionist and proceed to the room to do your laundry. Just make sure to time your washing and drying as this room can be shared with other guests. Unfortunately, there were two things which I didn't like about this hotel were the housekeeping and the shower head. The room's side table and coffee table were never wiped and cleaned. The side table was very sticky with some drinks, left behind by the previous guests and they didn't bother to clean the chocolate sauce off from the coffee table which we had left behind. As for the shower, it would either heat up or became cold suddenly, in the midst of showering. Super frustrating! Anyway, this hotel was situated near to several shopping areas and many eateries. Also, there was tram stops which were only stone throw away and you could just hop on to any trams to enjoy free travels within the city. If you wish to travel out of the city, you could just purchase a myki card from any 7/11 stores or train stations. Each card cost $6 and you need to top up the card to access out from the city. My advice is, do not top up too much. To get a refund for unused credit is very troublesome and difficult for tourist.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462641736~“Good business hotel in a good location”~The location of the hotel is great in the middle of the CBD on Bourke Street. The reception team is efficient and friendly. The rooms are new, modern and big with a kitchenette. The bed is a bid soft but ok. The pool is small, but the fitness room is not bad.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462639078~“Multiple Stays”~Just has my 12th stay at Citadines in Bourke, twice in feb and my 13th stay already booked for March. You couldn't ask for a better place to stay. The rooms are constantly at a high level of cleanliness and I've n ver had a bad bed. Located at the top end of the Bourke Street Mall between Russell and Exabition Street, there's plenty of opportunities for shopping and the tram stops right out the front. Tram 86 will take you to Docklands without changing over. Be sure to book parking when making reservations. Enjoy your stay.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_462396652~“An awesome experience”~We stayed here expecting it would be "ok" but Citadines certainly exceeded our expectations. The location is obviously fantastic being so close to everything in the CDB but from the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a very pleasant stay indeed. Front counter staff were lovely, the room was spotlessly clean, it had a kitchenette with everything we needed, bed was super comfy. Really couldn't find a fault. Thank you Citadines for a memorable trip to Melbourne. The only minor thing was we booked through Wotif who didn't bother passing on our email requests re: bedding configuration but Citadines sorted it out in a jiffy when we arrived. Next time I'll book directly with Citadines. Would stay here again without hesitation and highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462359666~“Make sure you ask for a room with a view! ”~We selected this place due to the view it had advertised but we were given a view of a concrete wall. We asked to be moved and we were moved to a room with a slightly better view however the room was a step back as it was smaller. We were so disappointed as the pictures make it look amazing!!! The room it's self wasn't really much to rave home about as mentioned it was small. However, the service was good as they did move us on request and provided another bed for a guest then removed it as our guest changed her mind.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462105674~“Good location and stay but missed on higher rating”~overall good place to stay. Front service staff needs more training. Did not know how to handle 2 problems - 1. Digital door lock battery flat - could not get in 2. Incorrect bill at check out - did not know procedure to refund. Had not been for these issues would given 4 rating.~3~3~5~3~4~4~3~nan
review_461649626~“Great stay”~Just stayed 3 nights in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom executive apartment right from check in by the friendly staff to going up to our 25th floor apartment & finding a beautiful spacious area with good kitchen, sitting area & table & chairs, washing machine & dishwasher we were very happy. Views were fantastic able to see thru to Port Melbourne. Location was excellent with plenty of dining & shopping options on site parking was also a bonus as was free wifi would recommend this & will stay again when next in Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461084183~“All round great stay”~Fantastic location right by all the great eats flinders lane has to offer. Reasonably priced, friendly and helpful staff. Very clean hotel room - including every corner and grating. Big room, with everything you need. Only wish was for more towels so we could use one/dry one and help save on washing.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460817868~“Highly recommend”~No need to go to the Novotel anymore. You'll get exactly the same service and rooms here for a cheaper price. Great location, clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff. I'll definitely stay here again on my next trip.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460615962~“Excellent”~Everything is superb. Quite but close to center, furnishings is morden, great view if stay in higher level, lobby spacious, staff helpful, fast wifi. Would come back.  Could be perfect if have washing machine.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460501545~“Excellent Location”~This is our second visit to Melbourne for a theatre performance. We decided to stay at a more affordable hotel this time and saw that Citadines was quite cheap for us. The staff were very polite and helpful when checking in. The rooms were a great size for is. All the amenities are good. Really recommend this hotel. It is in the centre of town and close to the tram line to get around the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459302025~“Great service, excellent location”~Conveniently located within walking distance to many attractions and shopping. Tram stop also right out front of hotel. Rooms are quiet. Late checkout made available day before checkout without fuss. Only complaint is that the bed in our room sunk in the middle. Lounge could also be more comfortable, but we didn't spend enough time in the room to rate that as a big concern. Well appointed gym, nice pool and sauna.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459042528~“Great location. Rooms are good”~The location is the best thing about this hotel. On the parliament house end of Bourke street, it is in a great spot for going to shows or China town. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are good but not great. The room we had has a view of a concrete wall, so do choose this place if you want a nice view. The toilet and shower area is a bit pokey and the hand basin is actually in the main part of the room, not in the toilet area, which I found a bit odd. The rest of the room was good so as long are ok with a bad view and no hand basin in the toilet & shower area, it is a good hotel to stay in. I would stay there again.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_459035821~“Top place to stay in Melbourne for work & Holidays”~The Citadines on Bourke is well placed to meet both business & holiday needs. The Scandi style modern rooms provide a real home away from home experience. This is ideal when working here for extended stays.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_459000926~“Business travel stay”~Excellent front desk staff. Good pool and gym facilities. Pool is just long enough for laps. Room clean and tidy. Good location - I prefer this end of town, so many great food options. I did not use F&B facilities. Will stay again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_458978088~“Outstanding all round!”~This is really a great place to stay. I had an Executive apartment and it was truly lovely - very tastefully laid out with plenty of space and nice open views. One of the best things was the spacious bathroom with a great shower. This place will meet all of your needs whether this be a city pad to drop off your shopping, a place to do some work (there is desk space/lamp etc) or someone to chill out to watch TV in the evening. The gym is very well equipped and the staff were super friendly and helpful.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_458820962~“Perfectly acceptable”~Have been coming here for the last few years. The rooms are mostly clean (this time around the studio I was in had carpet that could probably do with a good steam clean, likewise the curtains), with a decent sized kitchen in the one bedroom apartments. I stayed in a studio this time around, which was nice for one person, though the layout was odd (the sink and vanity was outside the bathroom). The couches are uncomfortable after a while, but not a big deal. The bathroom walls are rather thin (not going any further with that). Otherwise, the service is quite good and the location is excellent.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458370903~“Really really good apartment hotel”~Apartment hotel was booked accidentally. We actually wanted a conventional hotel. However we were bowled over by its most central location, its cleanliness and such well appointed rooms. Really couldn't fault it in any aspect.  Walk outside and you are straight into the hustle and bustle of Melbourne. What a great city. Perfect apartment in a perfect hotel in a perfect city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458193653~“EXCELLENT LOCATION TO ALL AMENITIES”~Stayed while at the Australian Open Tennis. I have stayed here many years and have found the service and welcome has always been awesome.

review_457893475~“Great location!”~These serviced apartments are in a great location, with a tram stop right outside! The apartments are really nice - exactly what we needed for a 5 night stay! The only down-fall is there was no sun in the outside seating area off the pool and the pool was way too chlorinated! But other than that it's a great location!~5~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan

review_457753050~“Fabulous Location”~The staff at our check in were wonderful, friendly and very efficient and helpful. Our room on the 12th floor was at the rear of the building so didn't have a view to speak off, but was very clean and well fitted out. We had a Queens size bed and the only thing I found odd was the tiny amount of space on one side of the bed. There is a wall that juts out into the room and there is literally only centimetres between the wall and the bed. But we managed fine. The large shower was clean and the toiletries were very nice. We swam in the pool one afternoon as the temperatures were in the high 30's. The tram stop is literally outside the door and this area is filled with cafes, bars, and china town one block down. Fantastic location and lovely apartment.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
