review_473476844~“Excellent apartments in good location.”~When we arrived at the hotel after a very hairy bus trip from the airport we were met at reception with the most helpful receptionist. Not only were we able to book in early but we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment. The apartments have everything you need for a long or short stay. Breakfast was a lovely selection of hot and cold. Swimming pool was a good size for lengths and gym looked well equipped. I could not get into the safe on my last night and the handyman went out of his way to solve the problem. Would definitely recommend to friends and come and stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478503761~“pleasant stay”~stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, location was good with queen victoria market just behind us, and shops nearby us as well, within 5 mins walk. staff was friendly and very helpful. room was relatively spacious, with plenty of walking space even with 2 big luggages, and fully equipped cooking facilities (although we didnt use them). room was clean and neat, and toilet was pretty spacious as well. also, travel between the hotel and airport is very convenient, with the skybus hotel transfer. would love to stay in this hotel again in my next trip.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478407755~“2 room aparntment”~1 of the bedrooms seems like its an office converted to a bedroom with ranch slider doors that don't close properly. There was no air con just a heat pump so the room was always really hot and once you close the bedroom doors there is no form of air flow at all. Also it is very noisy all you hear all night is the elevator going up an down all night! Pool is good and Staff were all friendly and helpful.~2~3~5~2~2~4~5~nan
review_478397355~“Good Room Rate and Great Location. Don't expect any Friendly services”~Good Room Rate and Great Location. Poor Front Desk and housekeeping services. Rude and disrespectful staff with no sense of hospitality. Can't imagine how it gets such high rating in Tripadvisor. - Poor Housekeeping, room is not clear - Poor Front Desk, in the date of checkout, called reception to ask if I can keep my car in the car park until 3 pm, answer is yes. Checkout in Front Desk, they said no and need to charge me for another parking day. Given the hotel check in time is 3:00pm, I can't understand why they can't allow this. - It is a rain day during my check out (a family with two little kids), I ask for borrow umbrella. The answer is no, since there is no stock. And most important, they don't offer any help, just NO.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_478374922~“Convenient and comfortable”~Room was a twin so relatively small but perfectly adequate for me. Well laid out and clean.  Bathroom nice but lacked bench space - again acceptable for this type of room. Food and servie in he restauran t was very good. I like that I was able to get 2 for one drinks at the bar while at the restaurant.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_478368670~“Great value for money in the CBD”~A very good apartment in an excellent location if you have kids. Being right near Flagstaff Gardens was a massive drawcard. It gave the kids somewhere to play and burn off all that unused energy. It was still close to all the things we needed in the CBD. The apartment itself was a little on the small side, however given that they presented very well, were clean and tidy, and also included a full buffet breakfast, it was overall a great experience and value for money.~4~5~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_478173986~“Overall”~Above average, The man on duty (looked like a Asian) offered his assistance to bring my heavy luggages to the next building to await the skybus arrival on 20 April @ 8am. I am in a hurry but I have forgotten to get his name. I like to thank him (what is your name)for the great service and will likely be back to stay in this hotel soon.~4~4~3~4~3~3~4~nan
review_478095552~“Great location!”~This accommodation was in a great location. Rooms are on the smaller side but clean and comfortable. $10 to do washing was a bit steep though and security was a concern-anyone can access the lifts. Good value for money for the accommodation.~4~5~1~4~4~4~4~nan
review_477928100~“Brilliant place to stay”~I booked this place because of the reviews and I'm glad I did. The staff were really nice and courteous. They mentioned to us that if we book breakfast the night before we get it at a discounted price. It was well worth it. Plenty of food and lots of variety. We were lucky and got upgraded to a two bedroom unit with a lounge area. It was very quiet, clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were very nice, not too soft but not to hard . . . Just right! The hotel is close to Queen Victoria market and also very handy to downtown Melbourne. Everything within walking distance. We have booked to stay again in May.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477812940~“Very good hotel”~Perfect location, excellent service and amazing breakfast. We surely will recommend it and be back when we travel to melbourne again. The only bad thing is that you need to pay 25 dollars per day to parking, this should be included in the rate and the rooms could be a little cleaner.~5~4~5~5~4~3~5~nan
review_477811637~“Great location,shame about the cleaning.”~We had 9 nights at the Hotel. Great service at the reception, but it fell down with the cleaners. We were missing either tea towels, detergent,milk every day. Had to ask if the beds had been changed on the 7th day, which the answer was" I don"'t know". Very nice cleaning staff, but not organized. We assisted the cleaner to change the beds, as she was by her self,and you could tell under pressure to get through the days roster.  Nice Hotel, great location, very good front staff, and a fantastic Happy hour...~3~4~5~5~4~3~3~nan
review_477592357~“Amazing hotel”~I like everything. They think in everything that a guest needs.

review_477336429~“Stay at Pegasus”~The service apartment is located ideally in the heart of the city. Tube station, bus stop, convenience store all in a walkable distance from the apartment. The staff in reception, housekeeping and restaurant carry a charming smile and very co-operative.~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_477318541~“Nice stay”~This was our first time in Melbourne and hotel was in a good position in the CBD. Friendly staff. Easy check in and a great late check out. Hotel held our bags so we didn't have to cart them around town and called when room was ready. Good service~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_477297194~“Business or Holiday We Always Choose Pegasus”~Why? I'm just going to list them (sorry I'm in a rush). We often find great online specials for accommodation so price is more than reasonable - especially when my family travel with me. The rooms are always roomy - allowing space for each member of family. There's a desk in each apartment room - so easy office set up. Wifi is usually v good and its free. The staff are accommodating in every need. Friendly staff (they even remember me by name). When I'm there with my family my children are always welcomed. Pool, spa and gym are awesome for end of day relax/workout. Laundry a must for every hotel - so easy to use on Level 1 (same as the pool and gym - throw a load on and workout or swim/spa). Comfortable beds. Clean. Great location. Good brunch cafe in lane way - Operator 25 (it's an old telephone exchange). Walk through lane way to La Trobe St and catch a free tram ride down to Swanston for Melbourne Central Shopping or State Library (beautiful building) and then tram or walk further into town or Chinatown. Also easy tram from Swanston to Lygon St (great eats, Readings bookshop and Nova Cinema.  Pegasus is a stones throw from Queen Vic Markets (good coffee, food hall, food, gifts, clothing etc). Love love love Melbourne.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

review_477073572~“Great location and facilities ”~Great place for a family stay. Walking distance to everything in central Melbourne. We are repeat guests and will come again. Our kids love the pool. Only negative is wifi is slow. Right behind Victoria markets and a short stroll to Etihad Stadium. Grocery stores and many restaurants close by.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477061128~“Clean and quiet”~We stayed over the Easter long weekend. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Kids enjoyed the pool. Found the hotel to be very clean and, although centrally located, it was very quiet. We only had breakfast there one morning and, although the food was nice, didn't think there was much variety. We would stay there again~5~3~4~3~5~5~4~nan
review_477009109~“Short Melbourne visit”~Only a 2 minute walk to Victoria Markets. In fact, close walking distance to CBD, trams & trains. Nice quiet corner of the main CBD. Room was very clean with all amenities needed and the beds/pillows very comfortable. Room had it's own air conditioner/heater which was great.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476959854~“Nice place to stay but...”~We enjoyed our stay at Pegasus. The location is great and the two bedroom room was spacious and reasonably priced. A minor problem arose when I tried to ensure our room was on a low floor. This was assured to be the case when I rang the hotel's number but unfortunately the request was not recorded. The manager made a good effort to fix things up and we were offered a free breakfast the next morning. Pity we had to leave early... We would stay there again though for sure :) Dining room staff were great!~4~4~4~5~4~3~4~nan
review_476912029~“Great Location and Facilities”~Was a great place to stay while on our easter trip. Good location just outside the CBD and next to public transport.

review_476631427~“Disappointing”~No wardrobe in main bedroom. Second bedroom bigger than the main. No view, probably the worst room location (816). Carpet worn and dated. Lounge chairs uncomfortable. No Foxtel. Spa had 2 jets in the middle like fountains and was luke warm. Tiles missing in spa~2~1~2~4~2~3~2~nan

review_475959926~“Good room at a good location”~Pegasus had everything we needed in our trip. It is a short walk to the free city circle tram, the vic markets other tourist attractions. Our room didn't have the best views but we weren't worried about that. Both check in and check out procedures went smoothly. For A$250 for a two-night stay, I'd highly recommended the Pegasus. Traveller tip: ask for a room furthest away from lift so there's less noise. NB: we booked directly with Pegasus and stayed in a studio queen room.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475706299~“Good, but not amazing”~This hotel is good, but i wouldn't go so far as to say its amazing..  The good things: - Right near Queen Victoria Markets  - Just up from Flagstaff station if you need to get around Melbourne - Pillows and bed are nice and comfortable - Buffet breakfast is well worth the extra when booking, and very delicious - Quiet location - Wifi was fast (when it worked) The not so good things: - Some of the staff seemed a bit abrupt or not helpful when asked for assistance - Its right on the northern edge of the CBD, so if you are spending alot of time around Bourke St / Flinders St / Fed Square area, you'll be walking about 20-25mins to get there. - Standard rooms are a bit small and cramped - Microwave is tiny. Very tiny. You would barely fit a microwave meal in there. We had an infant's bottle sterilizer that holds 5 babies bottles and even it wouldn't fit in the microwave - Wifi was a bit sketchy at times and for the last 12hours of us being there, didn't work at all While this one isn't really the fault of the hotel, we also had an issue with a cigarette smell starting to come through our air conditioner on our 3rd night there. Problem was whenever we would call them up to smell it, by the time they got there, the smell had dissipated. Then 30-40mins later it would come back. It was like someone was smoking in the room next to us and blowing it through a hole in the wall. We slept with the aircon off that night, but when it came back even worse the following night even with the aircon off, we asked for our room to be changed, and they were happy to oblige and moved us to a much nicer two bedroom suite. Overall, its a nice hotel, but i'd recommend getting a larger room if there's two of you.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475677951~“Not a family hotel”~Strange that you have to carry your baggage to your room, even when you are willing to pay for these services which are universally available. Toiletries had to be called for every day. Nothing great in the room service menu.....~3~3~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_475642302~“A lovely stay”~The motel is situated in a grest location near the city centre of Melbourne, we were able to walk to the main shopping areas and walk and take uber to some great restaurants. The rooms were spacious and very tidy. The avaliability of free wifi was great to be able to contact family and friends~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475509922~“Excellent independent hotel”~This is a large independent hotel to the north of the CBD. I stayed for a week to attend the F1 Grand Prix in Albert Park. I am fortunate enough to be an Expedia VIP+ gold member, and I was overwhelmed by the amazing extras they offered me. I was not expecting a 2 bedroom suite (!) when I only reserved a standard room, and the free breakfast and restaurant discount were also very welcome. Good points: - Large, clean rooms - Free WiFi that was reliable and fast for the whole stay - Kitchen facilities in the room are so useful - Great free indoor pool and gym - Good food to take away from the restaurant and eat in your room - Friendly and helpful staff - Great view from the room Bad points: - Location. It's in the CBD but quite a walk from many of the main amenities. - Breakfast. It was free but the selection of hot food was limited. If the chefs are reading please buy better sausages! - Some of the furniture in the room was a bit cheap. My room had an exposed clothes rail but no wardrobe for example. - Despite having a 2 bedroom suite there was only a shower and not a bathtub in the room Thanks for letting me use the shower before my flight back to the UK, made a lot of difference before 24 hours in a plane! Highly recommended and I'll stay here again if I'm ever back in Melbourne.~5~nan~3~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_475482465~“Good”~The hotel room and facilities are good. Near Queen Victoria Market, a few minutes walk to the free tram zone. But a bit far away from China Town, Melbourne Central, etc. It's good if you want a quiet evening.~4~4~3~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475434829~“Too small for 4 people”~The location of this apart'hotel was very good, with easy access to the trams and trains at Flagstaff. It was also right next to Victoria Market and as such there were excellent food locations nearby. Staff were friendly and helpful. However, our two bed apartment was far too small for 4 adults, and one very small bathroom was inadequate. The walls were also very thin which meant there was sometimes a lot of noise from neighbouring rooms. The windows also did not open and looked onto another high rise, making the apartment very dark.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475414925~“You get what you pay for”~Great location, a little dated and tired in places but good value for money in Melbourne. Friendly and helpful staff - they left a card and some chocolates for my husband's birthday, which was a nice touch.~3~4~4~3~3~3~4~nan

review_475230571~“Great location”~Location of this hotel is great for shopping, zoo, aquarium. Right near free tram zones. Service of the hotel was a let down. Promised by 2 staff members to make an early check in a priority as we arrived at 11:30am with 2 toddlers and had to leave by 3pm (normal check in time) to get to a show. We organised this a week before we got there and when we arrived we were told the room wasn't ready but were a priority. After having some lunch we returned to be told that it was not ready and we got checked in at 2:45pm and literally had to dump our bags and leave. There was still rubbish from previous family in room. On the second day it was raining and we hd left our umbrella in a taxi after rushing to get to our show on time and were told there was no more umbrellas to borrow and we had a 2 & 3 yr old with us which then made having to walk in the rain and wait for a tram. Breakfast was average and really bad coffee but the chef on was amazing and went above and beyond to make something for our kids to eat.~3~4~4~4~4~3~3~nan

It was after 10 pm when I realized that may be the Housekeeper forgot to leave a Bath Mat and only one Face washer were left. I rang the Reception and didn't take long for someone to come with the Bath Mat and Face Washer. Two Tram Stops were very close. VIctoria Market is only 10 to 15 minutes walk.

review_473914008~“Outstanding”~This place was amazing. We stayed there for 3 nights, then rented a car to see the Great Ocean Road and then returned for 2 more nights. The best part was the friendliness of the front desk staff. We were even given upgrades to full apartments both times. Highly recommend staying there. Easy trip from the airport by bus and great location.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473913496~“Could be a good CBD hotel with some minor upgraded”~Good location and great rates but let down by the small things.

review_473759434~“Noisy”~We were placed into room 1306. It was like sleeping in a wind tunnel, we got minimal sleep. The air would rush through the apartment door seal on and off all night. Very disappointing as we have stayed here before and enjoyed our stay. Wouldn't stay again after this experience. Not what we needed the night before flying out for a business trip.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473712689~“Handle needed”~I find it would better to equip one handle inside the bathroom space, and another handle on the toilet walk. It would be more safe and easy for senior clients.  The second suggestion, please have some attention on the gap between window blinds, light secretly run into the room via that narrow gap, it won't be noticed until all lamps are switched off.~4~5~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_473688651~“A few days in teh city”~Overall we had a great time and really enjoyed the hotel. Beds were super comfy and the shower was great. We were expecting a washing machine but that was probably our error. Fridge was great but limited cooking equipment - being near the market meant that wasn't a problem as we stocked up on delicious treats. We al enjoyed the pool and a god breakfast too.~4~5~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_473533078~“Perfect for a mid-long term stay”~This was a great location to base ourselves while we explored Melbourne and shopped our days away. The room had all the facilities we required - a little kitchenette enabled us to start the day with a healthy breakfast, a clean bathroom and a small bedroom with twin singles. There wasn't heaps of space in the bedroom but for a short stay it was ok. The bed was comfy, allow the pillows were extremely soft (ok, if that's your thing). The room was really warm and while there was aircon it seemed to be off or full blast. The room had blinds rather than curtains, so we were awake with the sunrise - although that could have been body clock too!  We ordered takeaways from the restaurant and enjoyed our meal. The location is great for central Melbourne and Victoria market. While this location is outside the free tram zone, you only have to walk a block to be inside the zone. I'd definitely stay here again.~5~5~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_473512428~“Great location - but otherwise fairly undistinguished for this price point”~The Pegasus has a nice location, at the northern end of the CBD, right next to the pretty Fitzroy Gardens, and only a few minutes' walk from Victoria Market. However, it takes a good 20 minutes or so to walk down to the riverfront, or to the Indian, Chinese, or Greek restaurant districts scattered around central Melbourne. (People not fond of walking - and/or frustrated with the city's exasperatingly opaque public transport system - would probably prefer to be much closer to the Yarra River.)  The rooms are large, comfortable, and well-equipped, with decently quiet A/C, and offer great views of the city from the upper floors. The double window blinds provide fairly good blackout (a surprising rarity in many hotels of this kind).  However, the single beds in my room were very narrow and VERY soft - not very comfortable at all, especially for someone with back problems.  Worse still, the tea and coffee provided free in the kitchenette were unbelievably AWFUL, the worst I've ever encountered: poor taste, and very, very weak (you need TWO tea-bags to make one small cup of something-like-tea). This is just an unfathomably stupid choice; it's not that difficult to find inexpensive but decent quality tea and coffee. And indeed, at this price point, I think you have the right to expect something of fairly high quality.  The windows did not appear to have been cleaned for a very long time - which detracted slightly from the stunning city views. Also, they are only single-glazed and not very thick: they rattled alarmingly during a night of gusty winds, and provided poor sound insulation against traffic noise from below. It's a very quiet area at night, but it's difficult to sleep in beyond 7 or 7.30 once the morning rush-hour starts.  The wi-fi was stable, but not very fast (LONG buffering waits while trying to watch even short streamed videos).  The cleaners didn't seem to operate in the afternoon: 'please freshen the room' tags were ignored if you didn't leave your room till noon. I only managed to get one cleaning in four or five days. And when I arrived, I found housekeeping had left a used carton of creamer in the fridge - a small oversight, but it doesn't make a great first impression.  The bar/restaurant on the ground floor is large and ambience-free; but it's reasonably priced, and the staff there were very friendly and helpful - much more impressive than most of the desk staff, who could seem a bit offhand at times. In particular, I found them disturbingly unconcerned and unapologetic about an incident in which several guests had been briefly trapped in a malfunctioning elevator. (That might have been a much more serious incident. It was supposed to have been taken out of service for maintenance, but there was only a notice about this in the lobby, not on any of the guest floors; and the elevator had only been partly disabled - the control panel inside was frozen, but it was still answering floor calls, and opening its doors to guests on those floors.... who would then be stuck inside the non-functioning elevator until it was summoned to another floor by someone outside.) I know Melbourne's a very expensive city; and I was there during the F1 Grand Prix, but.... I was paying USD 150 a night, and this place just didn't have that extra level of quality you expect for that kind of money.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_473480456~“Just Average”~The apartment was clean, comfortable and quiet, it's located a street behind Victoria's Market and close to all the public transport.  The breakfast had a variety of hot and cold foods available but it was pretty standard. It's located about a 15-20 min walk to Bourke St Mall.  I found the receptionists helpful but not friendly. If you are looking for apartment style accommodation this is a suitable place.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_473467248~“Best suite in Melbourne”~We booked through Expedia and couldn't be happier with our choice of hotel. We were upgraded to a gorgeous 2brm suite overlooking the Victoria Markets and cityscape. Suite was large, quiet, clean with great facilities. The buffet breakfast was really good too. Didn't use the pool and spa but checked them out and they seemed nice. Close to the Bourke St shopping precinct and the free green zone tram lines. Will definitely stay here again.~4~5~5~4~5~5~3~nan
review_473307632~“Good stay on a budget”~Enjoyed my stay at Pegasus. Was upgraded to a One bedroom from a studio suite which was nice.  The construction next door was loud from 7am every day including Saturday which was annoying but out of the hotel's control  Would stay again~5~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan

review_473041907~“Overall satisfied but room for improvement”~Overall the facilities presentable for ratings and staff friendly and helpful.

review_472541477~“Pool out of order.”~Disappointing stay as pool and spa were out of order and had been for a number of days. A call from the Hotel and option to cancel stay would have been appreciated. Desk Manager brought us some wine and food which was a lovely gesture, but would have cancelled had we known.~3~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan

Self contained room allowed me to cook for myself when I wished with fresh supplies from Vic Markets nearby. 727 store at the corner. No fuss transport to Carlton gardens and Zoo.

review_471954448~“Good location, clean but a disappointment”~Make sure your room is away from the lift as there is a constant whirling noise every time someone uses the lift night and day! Front desk staff are efficient but not accommodating or helpful. Not much assistance for a tourist who needs suggestions! The Room service policy is Strange at best...it's take way at its worst. Room was reasonably comfortable but lacking in any ambience at all..extremely sterile. Location quite ok.~3~3~4~2~4~4~2~nan
review_471795901~“Good Value”~The hotel is pretty central in Melbourne. Rooms are clean, staff is nice and the pool is good. Had a nice stay there. Can't say anything about the food or breakfast, was not included. Unfortunately didn't try the homebrew beer, maybe next time.  ~5~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_471765885~“As difficult to check in, as it was to get out”~The rooms are fair to middling (although the couch is bizarrely third rate) and tidy. Our drama started with the difficulty in checking in. The needlessly obtuse desk manager was foiled by the fact that my wife had made the booking, but that it was me who was going to provide ID and pay for the room. After a mind-numbing discussion and bizarre explanation, we were finally 'permitted to stay'. If we weren't so over it and it had been the morning rather than the evening, we would have just walked out and gone to another hotel nearby. Then the next day when I was trying to leave, it took me around half an hour to simply go down stairs, retrieve a baggage cart (yes, there are no porters), take it back up to my room and bring it back down to my car again. Reason being they have no service lifts, so as soon as the cleaning staff fire up around 10am, the lifts pretty much visit every floor, right at the time most of their guests are trying to check out, or head out on excursions. A crazy arrangement. Needless to say, I think the rest of Melbourne would have to be booked up for us to stay there again.~2~3~3~3~3~3~1~nan

review_471736861~“Disappointed ”~Upon arrival the manager was rude we felt unwelcome. We also witnessed the same manager talking to his staff members very rudely which was awful. The pool in the basement was cold, the elevator kept breaking, there was no airflow in the room and we were unable to open a window which made it difficult to breath, this was made worse when they were painting in the hallway. We asked for a room with a double bed on 2 occasions but they just put two single beds together which was uncomfortable. The laundry was ridiculously expensive, they did not deliver room service and taking a bottle of wine up to our room was not allowed. All in all very disappointed.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471593147~“A good option for self catering”~A warm, genuine, efficient welcome from Front Office Reception. Check-in is 15:00, however luggage can be tagged and held in the large storage room for guests who arrive prior to 15:00  Our 9th floor Queen Studio with large windows let in natural light with views of the high-rise city skyline and the Queen Victoria Market. Our room was stuffy on arrival, some air freshener would ensure the initial entry to the room is more pleasant. Windows in the studio were able to be opened using a special handle provided. From around 10:00 pm when the city noise had subsided, it was pleasant to have the window ajar to sleep without the drying effects air conditioning.  The apartment was clean and provided with suitable facilities for light self-catering; adequate closet hanging space, some shelves. The large flat screen TV was positioned along one wall, however sat on a coffee table; it would have been more convenient for the TV to be wall mounted leaving the Coffee Table to be used as a coffee table. The Apart-Hotel was a short walk to the central city free trams, and close to the Victoria Markets. These markets are closed on Mondays and Wednesdays, and trading hours vary on other days.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
