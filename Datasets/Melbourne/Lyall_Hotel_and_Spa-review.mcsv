review_479052682~“Couples Getaway”~My husband and I had a fabulous stay and would recommend to any traveller that prefers smaller, quieter boutique hotels. Staff are extremely accommodating and friendly with rooms beautifully appointed. We will definitely be using The Lyall from now on when visiting Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476708747~“Lyall Hotel & Spa”~Stayed for 2 weeks and must congratulate the management and staff on excellent service and accommodation. Good size suite with everything you could want on hand. Regular turndown service and every morning and evening towel change. Breakfast could not be faulted and finally their car valet service was fast, secure and a must for Melbourne streets with parking restrictions. Will definitely book again on our next trip to Melbourne. - Norma & Howard Barbarash - London England.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475413652~“Terrible stay”~I have little positive to say about this property. The location is fine with choices of restaurants. There is construction on one side of the hotel; I found this out thanks to Trip Advisor. When I called the hotel I was told we should have booked a different (more expensive) suite! The management did upgrade us, however, room service was horrible and the suite reminded me of an extended stay apartment. No charm, dust and mold. We didn't sleep for two nights due to partying in the apartment building next door and construction noise. This is a good choice for a family who needs kitchen facilities. The management was not helpful and uninterested in meeting needs of guests. There is a workout facility plus a laundry room. Very disappointing~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474477640~“Boutique, understated luxury”~'It's so quiet....', goes the Bjork song...this is a perfect lead in to this luxury boutique hotel tucked away off Toorak Rd, South Yarra. We stayed here just after our wedding before we flew away on our honeymoon and it couldn't have been more perfect.  As far as the rooms go, the decor and furnishings are all top quality and the heavy blinds can drown out the outside world (or the F1 Grand Prix!). You can judge the coolness, care and attention to detail by the minibar products and I'll just leave to to your curiosity to discover the delights. Prior to our stay the staff were very responsive in helping us book in a massage prior to our flight and the Spa experience was another great discovery of Melbourne. One of the best things was that our room service coffees were top notch and we could choose to have them in a takeaway cup. I'm so glad we chose to stay here because now we can make an excuse to come back on special anniversaries.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471956548~“Lovely Suite Hotel in a Great Melbourne Neighborhood”~We wanted to stay in a Melbourne neighborhood--out of the central business district. South Yarra was perfect for our week's visit. The neighborhood is sort of upscale Bohemian. The Lyall is a half block off the main street (Torook Road) and within two blocks of the train station (few stops to the CBD) and one block from the #8 tram (our favorite--about 20 minutes into the CBD, 30 minutes to the beach at St. Kilda or north Melbourne restaurants. The main road is lined with restaurants, cafes and shops. The Lyall Hotel itself has a variety of small suites. These are true suites: our one bedroom version was just that--a bedroom, small living room, good sized bathroom and a dining area/kitchen (including a washer/drier--a real plus for a weeks stay). It's elegant in a neighborhood way and I found the public spaces and room to be well decorated and maintained, clean and quite comfortable. The staff was small but extremely helpful. With all the neighborhood cafes and restaurants, we never ate at the hotel--we worked our way up and down the street and never had a bad meal (seems to be a feature of Melbourne). The only issue we had was the construction next door (it's going to be a Lyall residence): It should be finished soon and was only a minor irritation as we were out each day. It all, I'd highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in a Melbourne neighborhood....~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471777057~“Excellent boutique hotel in a great location”~Couldn't better placed for a shopping trip to Melbourne .. wonderful eateries and shops all around. The hotel itself is boutique style, rather European in feel with a little champagne bar in the foyer. The room we had was nicely appointed with a separate lounge and bedroom with a kitchenette (including washing machine, dishwasher and coffee machine!), although the bedroom itself was a little cramped. Comfy bed and nice bathroom. Good breakfast, but quite expensive. Nice small gym. Looks over a building site currently so weekdays will be bit noisy on one side in 2017. Very helpful staff. All round good spot.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470956866~“Terrible”~Whilst the location is very good ,almost everything else about the Lyall is terrible ! On arrival we were advised the computer system was down and we would not have any keys available for our room until further notice. Once getting in to our room we were greeted by 2 giant excavators at the window that were no more than 2 meters from the bed, Keep in mind this room was being charged at $500 AUD per night. The service is horrific and we were not able to get a porter to help with any of the luggage during the 3 days we were at the hotel.The hotel is old now and run down, lamps are placed over the top of stains on the carpet, TV didn't work , the old dirty iron ruined a $300 white shirt and so on .. I strongly recommend against staying at the Lyall. There are plenty of other boutique hotels in and around South Yarra and i would never stay at the Lyall again.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_467073253~“Building site on one side”~Good location but hotel is tired.Bed was old and badly down on one side.Breakfast good but service a bit erratic.Did not like a kitchen in the room but others might. Building site next door a real turn off on left side facing from the road~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_465694696~“Run down hotel ”~I stayed for one night recently at the Lyall Hotel. I travel frequently and enjoy boutique hotels. This wasn't boutique it was run down and grubby. There was mould in the grout of the shower ( over a bath ) and around the door jam the timber was splintering off. There is clearly no maintenance occurring to keep this hotel at a level that it once enjoyed.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463942214~“A Very Special Place.....Best Bed in Melbourne....”~This is the second stay for me at the Lyall and it won't be the last. It is quite simply THE BEST Boutique Hotel in Melbourne. The service is unsurpassed so much so that you almost feel like you are bunking down with relatives.....albeit the wealthy ones!...The rooms are sooooo cosy without crossing over the line to cluttered...they include everything you require for a short or extended stay including a washing machine, well appointed kitchenette etc......I am just in awe of the beds....how is it possible for a Hotel bed to be so comfortable?...the intimate bar provides all the atmosphere you require after a long day or the perfect spot to read the paper and eat your delicious breakfast......so much so that you will find the locals in there as well....it's proximity to all the transport you need if you are without a car is another of it's fine points.....trams/trains/cabs on the adjoining street....explore the bustle of the city and then head home to The Lyall.....you will pay more than your average Melbourne Hotel but I always feel there is value in the difference....I'm paying for an experience....not just somewhere to put my luggage and lay my head.....Oh and if you do stay....keep your eyes peeled....I have spotted two very high profile personages on both occasions I have stayed....celeb spotting too....what a bonus.....:-)~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_453227592~“The Best in Melbourne”~This is THE boutique hotel to choose if you want to live like a local. It's in a neighborhood rather than the dead center, locals drop in and out of the cozily chic bar because it's so comfortable. It's the perfect upscale home away from home. Don't expect hip. Expect elegant and comfortable, the best and most accommodating staff I have ever experienced in Melbourne and just a lovely naturally chic feel at all times. It's not cheap, nor in the city center, nor big and fully loaded with service and amenities - although they valet park, do a mean in-room breakfast and have a spa. Most importantly it is just a whole lot better than all the rest - especially the endless sea of very average corporate chains. Highly recommended for longer stays.  Big fresh suites, charming staff, great spot.  Loved it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452038294~“Wonderful”~We really didn't want to leave! One night just wasn't enough. Staff on reception so helpful and friendly and suite had everything you could have wanted. In the morning I realised there was even a washing machine in the kitchen. Best nights sleep on our trip. Hoping to return if we ever return to Australia. So nice to abandon the car and walk around the corner to restaurants and bars. We arrived at the weekend so could park the car on the road outside.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450311900~“Our home from home in Melbourne”~Everything about this hotel is special. The suites are airy, spacious and very well appointed with super comfy beds. Our view from room 407 wasn't the greatest this time but someone has to have the crappy view. The staff are all efficient, polite and friendly. Would highly recommend the Lyall, as the title says this is our home from home in Melbourne and we will be back soon~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450113976~“Great place to stay for couples who need timeout”~Loved the spa, it was an enjoyable experience. Great location, close to great cafes. Great value for money!!!

review_448355936~“Very enjoyable in South Yarra”~In cool South Yarra, this is a nice property offering mainly suites. Spacious with all needed. Perfect sleep assured. One thing to improve now would be the lighting in the suites- it is outdated and too dark. Very good breakfast. Very helpful and friendly staff. Treatments at the spa were very nice and one particular therapist deserves high rating. Great location outside the city with plenty of nice coffee shops, restaurants and fun shops a few minutes away.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_444175221~“Great location but average customer service”~We stayed at The Lyall for 2 nights to attend to a friend's wedding which was located closeby. We arrived to a beautifully appointed suite which was spacious and equipped with everything we needed for the weekend. Most notably, the bed was heavenly and offered some of the best night's sleep. Unfortunately it was the breakfast service that detracted from our experience. Our rate package had included breakfast however when we arrived no one had informed us that breakfast was only limited to the light continental breakfast. Nonetheless, that morning I ordered the big breakfast without eggs (as I am allergic) and after it had arrived I overhear a senior member of staff question the waiter in a bewildered and perplexed tone "who has a big breakfast without eggs??" While I see nothing wrong with questioning guests' orders, it would have been more circumspect to ask the waiter that question in the kitchen or after I had left the dining area, rather than having the guest at arms length and being left made feeling uncomfortable. Naturally I skipped breakfast the next morning. Sadly I could only offer 4 stars for this visit, when some better manners could have easily made it 5.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443854742~“Great place to stop overnight”~The service is excellent and atmosphere really nice. The library area is stocked with books and a beautiful open fire. Our bedroom was a little tight on space but the bathroom was spacious and clean and we loved the fluffy dressing gowns. Seems like an older building but it's mostly really clean. Great location too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443749575~“Good place to stay in Melbourne”~Lyall is a small hotel in a good location in a quiet street near to the South Yarra train station. The room I had was more like a whole apartment, and it was good to have a nicely working kitchen.  The staff were friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_443417623~“Weekend pit-stop in Melbourne ”~Away from the crowds at Melbourne City center, but still very easily accessible from South Yarra train station, this tucked away hotel was a cool find. Set up on a quiet little residential street, it is minutes away from the bustling toorak street and chapel street which is home to numerous shops and cafes.  The hotel itself is very well-kept. A pleasant experience with spacious and clean rooms. Polite, friendly and helpful staff. Deserves a return visit!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442302646~“Great location and service, but cleanliness not good enough”~Location: Perfect in the super cool south yarra with lots of great cafes, shops and restaurants. The train station is 5 mins away so u can be in the city in no time. Service: Really good Room: Good, but not clean enough~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441804077~“Pleasant but Not special”~Friendly and helpful staff but not really a great five star hotel. Small room with boring beige decor. No desk just a small table. The room could be much better soundproofed- I could hear across the hall and kids talking and running around in the hallway. And also every car driving past - they need to put in double glazed windows. Cute balcony though. The shower over small bath was not the decadent experience I'd expect from a lux hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439374383~“Great Boutique Hotel in the heart of South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia”~Stayed there for several days in October. Delightful. Staff was more than attentive. Stayed in a room with a balconey in the back away from the street noise! Intimate setting, patio ambience on sidewalk, suite was terrific and in the heart of South Yarra, close to shops and restaurants! Recommend to everyone!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_436689355~“Great Hotel with a personal touch ”~The Lyall is a very good hotel in a quiet neighborhood. The hotel is only a few steps away from the south Yarra train station from where you have convenient access to the city center (just two station from flinders station). There is a valet parking service at reasonable 25$ per day.  The hotel is not too big and the staff is very friendly which gives it a personal touch.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434181575~“Melbourne Cup”~What a week, great fun with family and spoilt rotten by the folk at the Lyall. Didn't want for anything, and done with such finesse and style. Our home away from home when in Melbourne. Seriously if you want to be pampered but left to enjoy on your own this is the place to come~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433604824~“The perfect accomodation for our stay in Melbourne!”~My wife and I were booked at the Lyall by the tour company we used to arrange our recent (and first) trip to Australia. Melbourne was the first locale on our two-week itinerary and the Lyall was, by far, our best hotel experience compared to the other "luxury" hotels (including name brands) we stayed in from Darwin to Cairns to Sydney. The location isn't in the heart of town, but only about a block away from a tram stop, so it's easy to get anywhere in relatively short order. We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival (which was an excellent surprise). The room was extremely comfortable and quiet. The staff was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful - whether in something as simple as arranging a taxi, offering the use of an umbrella on a rainy day, or in providing detailed directions to points of interest, local services, or offering dining recommendations - true concierge services at their finest. On that last note, the restaurant's breakfast offerings were exceptionally tasty and we were happy to have family there for dinner during our stay as well. Our compliments to the chef and dining staff! We don't often book such high-end accommodations and perhaps felt slightly under-dressed at times, having come prepared for a vacation of hiking and outdoor activities, but we were certainly never made to feel that way at any time. Our stay at the Lyall itself is truly an integral part of our fond memories of our few days in Melbourne. Well done!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_427428588~“Birthday celebrations”~Visited the Lyall for Peters birthday Great location  Residential but close to Toorak Rd and Chapel st Friendly helpful staff The lobby bar dining area is very relaxing enhanced by the fire at one end to talk quietly or read a book and enjoy a latte Our apartment was fine but the furnishings a little tired Peter had a massage which he thoroughly enjoyed and the therapist was very effective in relaxing some tight neck muscles We had breakfast the next morning with friends at the hotel  Fine but nothing special! Guess we are so spoilt for choices in Melbourne  should have strolled to Chapel St Easy walk to enjoy the Botanic Gardens after breakfast  All in all a positive experience Susan Sims~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419953178~“Close and Comfortable”~Located close to Chapel stand the great shopping and restaurants this is a nice boutique hotel with lovely rooms.

review_413734551~“The big smoke meets the suburbs”~Well, what can someone say about this hotel, especially when one doesn't stay in places like this and is always budget conscious...Pretty damn good. I was lucky enough to be billeted here for business on a recent stay in Melbourne and the first thing I noticed was that I was uncomfortable as it was more than I expected. That soon disappeared when the concierge made me feel quite welcome. My room (106) was on the ground floor so I expected a lot of foot traffic, but to my surprise, as soon as I closed the door there was silence. I knew I would get a great nights sleep. The bathroom had a shower and a spa bath. These were a bit older, but everything seemed to fit with each other, producing a calm air around it. I absolutely loved the bed, which was big and comfortable. Not hard or that ghastly soft type where you sink into. There was also a small kitchenette, but all I made was a coffee. I would certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and family if they choose to go to Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_411657718~“Another wonderful stay at the Lyall”~My self and my wife have just returned from another relaxing stay at the Lyall Hotel, made even better by being upgraded to the Grand Suite. I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel, from the highly trained, helpful and friendly staff to the tasty, freshly cooked and very satisfying breakfast, via the well equipped, extremely comfortable and calm accommodation. When we have stayed in other, larger hotels within the CBD there has always been noise of some description along the corridors but here there is absolutely nothing to disturb the tranquillity. We originally found this hotel by accident when looking for somewhere to stay near the restaurants on Toorak Road and I am so glad we did. We will most definitely be back and the sooner the better.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_411183025~“A lovely boutique hotel”~We stayed for 3 nights. A great spot in South Yarra and easy to get to with Uber/taxi. We stayed in their smallest suite which was more than generous! They offer breakfast as extra but we decided to try the local options instead which were very good. Would definitely recommend this hotel!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_406004266~“Just the right tonic, again!”~As always, this stay was like all others.

review_402487730~“Very comfortable, quiet, stylish and efficient ”~We stayed in the Lyall for two nights. They upgraded us to a great suite. The room was stylish and clean. The minibar, which I did not use, was the most impressive I have ever seen in terms of variety and selection. The staff were extremely friendly, polite, and efficient. Having free parking (valet) was a great bonus. The location is not CBD, but we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396046849~“A touch of European elegance in Melbourne ”~Boutique hotel with one and two bedroom suites within stylish surroundings, open fires everywhere, excellent service, 24 hour concierge and room service, parking and champagne bar. We stayed in the Grand Suite, which included kitchen, lounge and dining area, heated tiles and rain shower. Spa bath, two open fires, pillow menu, 3 tv's and balcony. 2 min from trendy Chapel Street for excellent shopping and restaurants. 5 k's from the city. Totally recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395295521~“Great hotel, even better staff”~This is a lovely boutique hotel. The rooms are well appointed, elegant and tastefully designed. The location, in the heart of South Yarra and 3 mins walk from the South Yarra railway station, is perfect. On that basis alone I'd recommend the hotel. But I had an unusual experience that made me appreciate it even more. I came down with a very high fever and was unable to get out of bed. The hotel staff arranged for a doctor to come see me in my room and then picked up the prescription he gave and delivered it to my bedside. Despite being far from home and in a hotel, I felt well looked after. Thanks to this rapid care, the next day I was able to go downstairs for breakfast. All the staff asked after my health. It was a heartwarming experience. I'm truly grateful to all those who looked after me when I could not do so myself. Of course I hope no one reading this review ever has to avail themselves of this type of service. But it just shows what a great culture they've developed at the Lyall.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_394524291~“Absolutely spoiled us”~Loved it. We chose the Lyall because we didn't want a big hotel. Our suite was very spacious, clean and comfortable. You could easily settle in for a week. Thank you to David and the other staff. Central to the Botanic Gardens and Chapel St and a short hop to Greville St and Windsor. The tram to town is at the bottom of the street.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390949139~“Wonderful hotel”~This hotel is a real gem. My husband and I stayed here with our 20 year old daughter. All staff we encountered were warm and welcoming.

review_388654163~“Fabulous location, perfect for a girls night away.”~We had a room that had a small lounge room, kitchenette and a separate bedroom. There were 3 of us staying so there was a rollaway bed. The beds were all very comfortable and the room has everything you need and is very quiet. The only criticism was that the room was incredibly warm when we got in. We turned off one heater but didn't realise there was a separate one in the bedroom so it was still hit when we got back from the dinner. Once we turned that off and opened the windows the room eventually cooled down to a comfortable temperature, we had too service for a late lunch which was lovely and the continental breakfast was great. The location is fabulous and I would definitely stay here again. It was perfect for our one night girls weekend.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_388590785~“boutique hotel , well worth considering”~My wife and i decided to return to the Lyall for a weekend break in Melbourne. It is a terrific alternative to the city based, 'corporate', 5 star hotels. Located in a quiet side street in South Yarra ensures that your stay will be relaxing and stress free. The arrival was exemplary. The front desk staff are a step above others and provide a personalised welcome. You are not just a number at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  Small things are the difference between great and exceptional hotels. The Lyall falls into the later category. Bathrobes that have the belts correctly looped ( how many hotels overlook this !), a breakfast that can be ordered 'anytime', a coffee machine , free wifi and fresh air ( via a balcony ). Granted ,small things...but they do add to the overall experience. Some bottled water in the room ( not minibar) would be a further enhancement. We enjoyed champagne in front of the open fire before dinner. Once again the staff were helpful and had real personality. They are a great example of how to demonstrate a truly customer focussed approach to service. The breakfast was another real surprise. Choosing to stay in our suite we were told that anything we wanted from the menu was included in our breakfast package - not the typical 'restricted' approach that many hotels adopt. Its not often we want to extend a stay in a hotel.  With its combination of location, value for money, great rooms and even better service...this is precisely what we wanted to do at the Lyall. It will become our regular Melbourne destination.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_377262061~“Perfect Location and Top Class Service”~Service from the front desk team was excellent; location is very convenient for public transport and well as being walking distance from many dining and drinking options.
