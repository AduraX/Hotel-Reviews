review_479045401~“Great Location ”~Our two bedroom apartment was clean and in a great location. Close to restaurants, shopping and Botanical Gardens.

review_478132182~“the view”~Great find a couple of days in Melb and after checking many places we found Oaks Southbank. very impressed from the greeting at the desk from Vanessa, very li lucky to get an early check in and just so impressed when we opened the door to our room. so well fitted out and that view of the melb sky line, even better when it gets dark. all you need for a couple of days, had the idea of cooking one night, (it did not happen), great space enjoyed the fact of a small balcony that we could open the door and let in the air and noises of Melb.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_473460666~“Not what is portrayed when you book - beware”~This is a rude and insulting little hotel, booked thru Trivago for a one night stay over - costs that were hidden were parking (not on site, pre booking required and an extra $25) and cleaning the room (Like is that my job??) Pre auth fees that have still not been returned after two phone calls and being hung up on by one guy on the phone. So far its been two weeks re the hold on my pre authorisation fees, which when handed over was told 2-3 business days. The place is a shoe box -I dont think you could technically call the balcony a balcony, perhaps a strip of concrete better describes. The staff were not pleasant to deal with and rude. Certainly learned a lesson about Hotels in Melbourne and booking online, will never stay there again nor recommend this place.~1~nan~3~nan~nan~5~1~nan
review_473101451~“Funky modern interior ”~I was booked by my work to stay at Oaks and was pleasantly surprised. Modern, fresh decor, this property is less than a year old. Everything is fresh and new.  Living and bedroom areas are compact but well designed and feel comfortable. The bathroom is tiny though and if I was a large framed person, I think I would have struggled to turn around.  Location is a short walking distance to Southbank.  There is no restaurant on site which means you have to exit the property for breakfast which I think is a serious let down.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472026682~“Great location ”~We booked online, check in was easy we arrived early but were given our room a one bedroom apartment, the apartment was clean and comfortable, no street noise which was great, also no noise from surrounding rooms, everything we needed for a short stay, The tv was rather difficult to operate but we got there in the end, location is the reason I'd stay again~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470834102~“Home for 2 months”~Being my first time in Australia I was new to everything here. Initially only had expected to stay for a few weeks but turned into 2 months for work. Amenities are good. A bit like living in an Ikea display however. The couch definitely not one to cozy up on to watch TV for a length of time. Beds comfortable. Shower was great. Would suggest not having cutlery drawer near the floor below sink however... had to clean it out several times from dust. Housekeeping was hit and miss. Internet hard to stay connected on 36th floor. Minor stuff when I had a million dollar view of the city and harbour! Can't say enough about GAURAV and DIDIER though. They made my stay! Not only were they professional and friendly, they took the time to talk to me about work, hobbies and give me tips and info on local attractions and fun things to do around the city in my free time. They made me feel at home.  Oh. Awesome lobby coffee too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470713091~“Perfect location, excellent amenities... self important staff”~My wife booked an apartment for our family to attend the F1 GP at Albert Park. It offered a good location, for a reasonable price and excellent parking for the CBD as we were driving from Adelaide for the event. On arrival friendly reception staff and easy to follow instructions. Rooms are a bit small for a family of four but as we would be out nearly all day fitted our needs, sleeping requirements slightly flexi as no twin bed option for two young hyper at chasing Lewis all day, living space a little cramped for anything over our family size and deffo no two sets of adults room unless you're swingers. All the basics covered as sweaty clothes dispatched with the laundry facilities, downside a little cramped to utilise the two machines but quiet and hidden away. Overall a good package on a budget if you don't mind being flexible space-wise. Downsides, over entitled cleaning staff blocking the elevators with their trolleys when you're trying to navigate access and exit from the hotel, eye rolling and speaking in their native tongue when asked politely to move aside so your family or yourself with bags can access parts of the hotel, garbage shoot inoperative on our floor and rubbish left piled by it (luckily aircon keeps the smell down) and I love dogs but a small poodle yapping on the balcony next door can be annoying (but she/he calmed once they realised we weren't coming to their space) but get passed that a nice hotel~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_467957745~“disappointed”~I've stayed here before with my sister in a two bedroom apartment and was very happy. It's a lovely clean and new apartment. This time I stayed again, but as two couples and I was quite disappointed. The rooms are way too small, especially the second bedroom, only a double bed (I'm used to a king bed - fine probably if you used to a smaller bed). Also the bedrooms get very hot with the doors closed and as there is only an airconditioner in the main living area, each night was very uncomfortable. I was still happy with the cleanliness and modernness. We were on the 36th floor, which had a great (city) view. I guess I'd stay again, but only as singles where you feel happy to leave bedroom doors open overnight. I did request a bigger room which the staff were very accommodating with (and for a fair price) however second bedroom was still only a very small double bed/room so no advantage for us.~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan~4~nan
review_466725279~“Great location”~Enjoyed a long weekend in a 2bd apartment. Fully equipped kitchen. 2 bathrooms. Clean and very comfortable. Great to have a balcony to take in the gorgeous views.

review_466182981~“Nice new, tidy hotel... excellent facilities. Watch the lower floors and internet pricing!”~Nice tidy rooms, relatively new location. Very large TV, excellent quality appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, fridge/freezer). Washing machine and dryer very quiet in operation (ran them while sleeping next door - couldn't hear them). Everything you need for a short stay. Minor gripes.  Couch not the most comfortable (aesthetics over comfort) - bright "felt" cushions look the part but not nice to lean against.  The lower level apartments (I was on level 4) are entered through the carpark (bit disconcerting on exit) and run across the front of the building - without the blinds down the sun cooks the apartments during the day (you need the air-con on and the blinds down). There is no air-con in the bedroom, so if you want to nap during the day you need to leave the door open to get some air from the living area - or the bedroom becomes a sweat box. Internet is included only for 30 continuous minutes per day, then the pricelist looks a decade old ... $85 for 7 days (the most cost effective option when staying for 4 days) is outrageous in a highly connected central area with NBN connectivity (disconnected but active NBN terminal in the wardrobe!)... it was cheaper to use mobile data on my phone than the hotel internet... in this day and age (and with these connection options) this is unacceptable level of internet and pricing - and the hotel would do better to offer free internet and streaming TV options over the very expensive (but included) Foxtel option.... or might actually find higher levels of adoption if priced more reasonably (most good hotels now include internet rather than charging extra). Foxtel was included - but so few channels (amongst many) it is difficult to find anything worth watching - Foxtel almost irrelevant these days when streaming options abound (offering extra channels with "upgrade your subscription" in a hotel shows how out of touch Foxtels offering is). Overall though - the hotel is well located, well equipped and minor gripes shouldn't mean avoiding the location - they are minor after all, and I list only so people can be forewarned and make alternative plans or workaround if necessary.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_465466583~“Amazing service”~My husband and I stayed at Oaks Southbank on the 4th and 5th March 2017 celebrating our wedding anniversary. We were greeted by two very helpful and informative staff members Didier and Gaurav.Their information ranged from restaurants in the area to how to access the car park. The apartment was clean and very well furnished. The bed was very comfortable. Overall this apartment complex is in an extremely handy location for Southbank restaurants, room was spotless and staff went above and beyond normal to ensure our stay was fantastic. We will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465207428~“Great two bedder”~Turned up at the wrong Oaks and the woman behind the desk fantastically transferred my booking and got me a room...and it was great. Well appointed but not plush. Great if you want to do your own cooking.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462537995~“Great location, comfy bed and strange room layout”~Not easy to find this hotel - the entrance is pretty much at traffic lights so you can't park right at the front door. The hotel should ask about your vehicle when you book - I booked a carpark before we arrived but wasn't told about the size restriction (lucky I left the ute at home) - as it was my car only just fit in the car lift - which was an all round strange experience. The rooms look brand new but they are very small - I hit my head on the towel rail sitting on the loo! Having the bedroom and kitchen lounge separate didn't really work for us as it was a warm night and the aircon didn't reach the bedroom and it was stuffy. A nice addition would be locking screen doors on the balcony to let some air in. Would also be nice if the ice cube trays were filled up - why have them if they're in the freezer empty. When we asked for a bucket of ice we were directed to the local IGA. The kitchenette is fantastic - well stocked with a full size fridge and dishwasher. The view was amazing over Melbourne's sporting precinct out to the Dandenongs and the location is right on the doorstep of the Southbank/Crown complex - an easy walk across City Road~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461813110~“So-so”~The one bedroom apartment we got was small and had only one cramped sofa. For a self catering kitchenette, it did not provide a cutting board and had only a fruit knife. Car park was quite inconvenient as you have to go up in a car lift. We stayed 5 nights and the daily servicing was only to make the bed, replenish the coffee etc and change the towels. Bathroom and floors were not mopped. Otherwise, the best thing about this hotel is its location - 3 mins walk to riverside at Southbank and Flinders St station.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461323797~“A great new location, A moments walk to all Southbank attractions.”~A one night stay in a 2brm unit, clean, tidy, and as new. All items were as new and not a mark to be seen. Staff were friendly and helpful. Main entrance faces a busy road so no stopping out front, not an issue if you know in advance, need to be dropped around corner and short walk. Apartment was a good size, not large, yet enough to feel a sense of space. Full size fridge and all necessary kitchen items, with a small grocery store only doors away. A small terrace/balcony to stand on. Bed was comfortable yet the memory foam top did make it warm. Might suit some, yet tossed and turned a bit to cool down. Building location is only a moments’ walk across to main Southbank area and attractions. The onsite car park is a unique experience that works well just a bit different for some. To explain, at the rear of building, there is no ramps, you drive into one of two purpose built service lifts to access set parking floors. You need to be allocated a space at Reception first. Most vehicles will fit in the lift, just check before if you know you have large or long vehicle.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461036040~“Excellent location, Great service”~I have stayed in many hotels in Melbourne CBD & this is deffinitely my favourite place to stay. It might not have a pool & gym onsite but that didnt matter as they offer you the option to visit Genesis gym close by. I stayed here for a week and loved it! The location was excellent, the rooms were comfortable & tidy, and the staff were very accomodating. Having a washing machine, dryer & kitchen facilities were very handy & the car lift for parking was super cool! I will stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460132232~“Happy hols”~We enjoyed our stay. There were only a couple of things that needed to be rectified but that is due to being quite a new hotel. The situation was excellent very close to Southbank where there were lots of restaurants to choose from. We were able to walk to the city and Docklands. Very close to Crown where we went to the movies. Really the hotel was situated where there were quite a lot of different activities.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459485266~“Handy to all at Southbank and the City”~We stayed with another couple for a catch up. Two bed two bath apartment on L21. Rooms were small but furnished Ok and beds were comfortable. All nice and clean. No drop off point on City Rd so had to make alternative arrangements for transport pick up. Not a big deal. Picked the hotel for proximity to Colonial Tamcar Restaurant and for that location was good.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_457417317~“Comfortable in Good Location ”~We had a two bedroom two bathroom apartment with a balcony. It was nice and clean with a full kitchen. The bedrooms each had comfortable queen beds. The motel is centrally located a short walk across city Rd to Southbank and a 10 minute stroll puts you in the city one way or at Southbank DFO. We attended an event at AAMI park in the Melbourne sporting precinct which was only a 10-15 minute walk. A great spot for families, couples or if you are travelling by yourself.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455768953~“Great Location”~Stayed here on the weekend for the tennis. Great location. Short walk to Flinders Street Station and free Tram to the tennis.

No gym or pool but we didn't need them.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_455330907~“Good apartment good location as well”~Nice tidy apartment. Had a room with city views on level 32 however the view was torwards tennis stadium not directly at the city. Only negative is that no one made up the room or replaced any towels etc in our four day stay hence only a three star rating~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454360770~“Great location, friendly staff, but.......”~Booked in for a 2 night stay in a one bedroom apartment and was pleasantly surprised with the exact location and the size of the apartment. This is obviously a pretty new apartment building! Disappointed with the sofa as quite hard, and the overhead cupboards were obviously built for giants as I had to stand on a chair to get the plates, cups down! I am not exactly short at 5ft 5in! So this could potentially be a safety issue! Champagne glasses would have been good too!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453884314~“Quest view moved forward 30 meters”~This new property was being constructed while I was staying at the Quest and it was easy to tell that it would block a lot of the nice views from city-side rooms at the Quest - so looking at the views from my room at the Oaks felt very familiar, and no chance of the view being blocked by a new property as the Oaks is right on the street front of City Road. I thought being on the road might make it noisey (can be the case at the adjacent Mantra) but despite the busy nature of City Rd, it was surprisingly quiet.  Being new, it's clean and tidy, and has a "now" look and feel. As with so many apartment hotels on a small chunk of land, corridors are slimmed down and the elevator waiting area on the ground floor is ridiculously crammed. A couple of guests with bags waiting for a lift to arrive are enough to restrict the area for those getting off an arriving elevator. That area is going to suffer bag damage to the walls as people shuffle around trying to make space. It's a shame as the entry foyer is nice and spacious, but that feeling is his lost in this narrow waiting area for the elevators - bit of an architectural fail IMO. Also, at the end of this waiting area by the elevators is some kind of plant room, the door was always open and seeing into the plumbing or some such right by the elevators was hardly an image they would put on their publicity photos. Crammed shower, again reflecting these "minimum space" designs of new city appartments, but otherwise OK. Great staff - fast, friendly and professional service. Good location handy to Southbank, the city, Flinders St station, and easy access to/from airport. Like all hotels in Melbourne, the rates sky-rocket during major sporting events so value depends on city demand and your comfort level with that. Rack rate when not busy is good value, but the room rate during periods of high demand is an absolute shocker. This is just the effect of supply and demand, can't say I blame them for raising the rates when market conditions allow - but it does alter the perception of value for money.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_451642066~“Good location”~We visited here in January for 2 nights with our 13yo and 9yo. The apartment was super clean and fresh. We did request for 2 single beds at the time of online booking for the children but the hotel doesn't offer single beds (we didn't know this wasn't offered until we checked in as no one contacted me to let me know).....they did offer us a roll away bed for an extra $40 a night.  The hotel is in a very convenient location~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450829117~“Beautiful View, Great location!”~We stayed here 4 nights and loved almost everything. We arrived really early (approx. 11am) check in was scheduled for 2pm but our room was ready so we were allowed to head straight up. we were placed on the 33rd floor and the view was absolutely amazing! Rooms are modern, CLEAN, and very quiet. TV's were surprisingly big and had plenty of options for us to watch. The only thing I can fault in this room was the air conditioning unit. While it cooled down the lounge it didn't reach the bedroom very well and made It difficult to sleep on some nights as we were in Melbourne during a random heat wave. The bed was a little uncomfortable also. Room had a great range of amenities.  Check in and check out were faultless and staff were incredibly nice. Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_449072273~“Great new hotel”~we recently stayed at the new Oaks Southbank between christmas and new year for three nights with our two children and our two bedroom apartment was fantastic. Front of house staff were great and more than accommodating. The carpark lift was easy to use however a lot of people need to learn how to use. We stayed during the period of part of the hotel flooding due to Melbourne storms however no one was inconvenienced during the cleanup. Our only issue with the apartment was the fact that the ensuite shower was very hard to use as the wrong shower screen seems to have been installed and doesn't open.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

I wouldn't bring kids here with the balcony. small rooms but nice and new and modern and fully self contained. Two bedroom apartment is like 60 sqm.Very small. The exhaust fan in the ensuite didn't work and the toilet seat was broken. Also note apparently house keeping don't work on Sundays. The bed was very average not up to standard to the soft pillow tops I'm used to in hotels these days. 7/11 right across the road which is handy and walking distance to the Southbank, River, Casino and Restaurants.
