review_478636107~“3 Night weekend Get Away”~Recently spent 3 nights here for a quick get away. The service of the staff, the room and all around were of high standard. We were fortunate to book a room with a Juliette Balcony (which was a nice touch) The location is very central, right in the middle of the city. Trams are running past the hotel which is a big plus. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Melbourne~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477627760~“Don't book in advance”~Learnt the hard way last week that you definitely do not book in advance with the Westin. As an SPG Gold member, paid $390 in advance per night for a deluxe room that was available on the day for $242 for anyone that comes in off the street. Response from the hotel was basically you get that and maybe next time book a flexible rate that you can cancel. Better idea, stay at a different hotel. The service has dropped to an unacceptable standard as they try to cut costs. If you're an SPG Member you will need to ask for the benefits and if you want amenities refreshed during your stay you will need to ask for that as well. With impending construction works happening next to the hotel, this is one to give a miss as there are plenty of better quality hotels in Melbourne that care about their customers.~2~nan~nan~4~nan~4~1~nan
review_477344718~“Classey Quiet and Central”~Central Melbourne is general;ly busy with people on mass though entering in the Westin you immediately find the spacious and calmness of the hotel ovecome you. There is a great lobby area in front of an open fire where you can order bubbly or coffee what ever suite you and chill. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The room was clean set up well modern and with a great city view. Will I stay again yes thankyou.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477031955~“Old, dirty, poor serviced rip-off”~We have stayed in over 20 five star hotels around the world over the last few years as an expat family. I write travel articles for Conde Nast. We have experienced the finest hotels in Australia, Asia, America and London, and this is without doubt not even close to being one of them.  Arrival is a little taste for what is to come - disappointment. The only person greeting you in a valet who suffers from 'not my job' syndrome and leaves you to open the heavy greasy glass doors yourself. Confused by the layout you must walk down a long hallway to the reception, where sloppy looking staff greet you with an air of boredom. Upon checkin, you are then directed to walk to the other end of the hallway to the elevators where the buttons are conveniently very out of reach.  The room - advertised as a suite for platinum ambassador SPG members, we were grossly underwhelmed. An outdated, dusty and stinky bowl of grandmas potpourri sit on a dusty side table. The bathroom to the left is cramped with old, itchy towels. The toiletries are cheap and smell awful. There is nothing luxurious about this first impression. The laundry bags are tiny and plastic (compared to real luxury hotels where they are linen and monogrammed canvas), the mini bar and snacks are unimaginative and cheap (and warm!). There is a very impressive layer of dust on most flat surfaces (top of the wardrobe too where aircon blows it down). We immediately found three long black hairs. At least the laundry bags double as sick bags. The pool is old and rusty in places, the chlorine is overwhelming (probably a good thing judging by the people who stay here) and the floor tiles are incredibly slippery. Great insurance claim for someone. The token bowl of complimentary apples in the gym are old, soft and bruised. These little things absolutely count because they show attention to detail.  The breakfast buffet in one word - depressing. The chef is very unenthusiastic looking and messed up many of our orders. The hot food looked old, overcooked and very unloved. The toast section and fruit was good. But not $40 worth. The staff are not attentive and avoid helping you. There is permanent central air con on so the room is freezing. A very unpleasant start to the day. The room service was outrageous priced for the dog food that arrived. No bread rolls/butter, no salt/pepper, no condiments either. Just dirty overpriced warm food on a plastic tray. Order from Deliveroo if you must eat in. Location - being in the CBD is what many visitors seek when choosing accommodation. Please, stay at any other city hotel. The Westin is located on the filthiest, drug laden, homeless covered, cesspool of a street in Melbourne. I have never seen such a revolting, vomit covered, smelly, drug covered street in my life. It is incredibly noisy at night (screaming, fighting, trams, heavy vehicles).  Whenever we had a problem with the hotel, the front desk manager of the hour would tell us with a dragged voice that he was sorry for how we felt and waited to hang up. No attempt whatsoever to rectify or resolve our issues (overcharged for breakfast, doubled up charges for valet, a tiny room, broken bathroom lights, inadequate housekeeping). They really treat you like a burden here. It felt like we were staying in a self serve motel. Not only is the service appalling and rather offensive considering that they claim to be a luxury hotel - but the premise itself is very old and outdated. There is cheap artwork in the hallways, funky old carpet, rickety elevators, no consistent design theme and a general sense of below average.  We were very relieved to leave this hotel. I can't express how awful it is. A hotel stay advertised as absolute luxury should be relaxing, delightful, impressive, detail focussed and quite frankly feel like a special treat. This hotel felt like the opposite. Do not stay here. The Park Hyatt, The Sheraton, The Grand Hyatt are all much nicer.~1~nan~3~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_477004285~“First class experience”~Stayed here with my daughter for some mother daughter time on the town and had a great time. The hotel is extremely well located right in the centre of downtown Melbourne. The staff were very nice (especially liked the doormen who were very friendly and managed my daughter's one-star car like pros), and the breakfast delicious and top quality - what you would expect from a five-star hotel. Room was comfortable and bathroom spacious. There was a bit of Christmas jingle noise from the park / square next door which double glazing would have helped reduce - perhaps a room on the other side of the hotel would have been quieter - but we were in and out so didn't bother us too much.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476940200~“Friendly staff, great service”~My wife and I stayed at the Westin as we were seeing a show in Melbourne, and decided to stay over. Having reviewed many hotels in the city, we decided to stay at the Westin, and rather than booking a standard room, opted for a 'City View' room. Whilst technically we did get a city view from our room on the 2nd floor, in reality the view is of the buildings opposite the hotel. You're not really high enough to get much of a view - so this was a little bit of a disappointment - so recommendation is to ask for a room on a higher floor. Having said that, the room was very clean, and came with standard items not available in many hotels, such as bath and DVD player. The breakfast was typical of most hotels, with a variety of food available, all quite satisfying, and excellent service - it felt like as soon as you finished what was on your plate, then the waiters would clear it away. Overall a good hotel, but a room on a higher floor probably better, if you really do want city views.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475747562~“A business-class hotel with family-friendly staff”~We have stayed in many Westin hotels around the world. Westin Melbourne stands among the best for us. The hotel staffs were accommodating and friendly towards our kids. Really made us feel very welcomed. My kids enjoyed their stay. Definitely will stay at this hotel for our next Melbourne trip.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475699285~“Great location ”~This hotel has an excellent location right in the centre of the cbd. Close to everything really.  Rooms are a little tired/dated for a 5 star compared to other 5 star accomm close by but still lovely.  We did find our bags took a verrrry long time to come to the room (long enough that we went looking for them) but I don't think this was normal. Still it was long enough that it meant we missed getting to a specific restaurant before they stopped taking patrons for seating/serving~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475429843~“Wonderful holiday”~Having stayed a few times before, we always enjoy th Westin. Friendly staff, superb comfy not wanting to get out of beds, quiet with the occasional sound of tram bells reminding us that we are in Melbourne. Its a fantastic classy hotel which delivers a safe and secure base when taking a break. Close to everything. Nothing seems to be a problem. They truly look after you with wonderful hospitality. Genuinely worth the few extra dollars. We will be back Im sure again and again. Love the Westin Melbourne. ROBBO.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474482537~“nice return to this hotel”~have stayed at this hotel many times over the years with varying reviews.This time around we found the staff attentive and helpful.The room was clean as usual and the lobby lounge had a nice buzz about it.A couple of quibbles.The breakfast is very good but one needs to rug up as the aircon was like a refridgerator both times.This spoiled the experience.Why it was on in the first place given the low temperature outside makes one wonder.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_474375306~“Luxury Hotel and Great Location”~What a luxury hotel tucked away in a perfect location close to everything. The room was a perfect size and it was lovely to have a full bathroom with separate bath. Service was always fantastic throughout the hotel. I especially loved the Juliette balcony with doors that opened all the way to feel the breeze and hear the lovely noise of the city Will definitely be coming back for another anniversary stay!!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_473988081~“Very Good City Hotel”~We recently spent a night in town at the Westin Melbourne. It in a great location near the corner of Swanston and Collins Street. The Starwood Program is very good, the room was cheaper on their web site and you receive free Wi-Fi. The City View King Room was very well appointed and spacious. The bed was very comfortable. The only minor criticism was some plates from other rooms were left in the corridor for an hour or so. The gymnasium is one of the best we have seen in both variety and quantity. The pool is excellent and the Spa is good but only at pool temperature. Dinner downstairs was very good but on the pricey side. Excellent Breakfast. We will stay again~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_472262926~“Expensive business hotel, but great location”~I chose this hotel primarily due to its great location, & good experience at this hotel on previous stays. Check in was fast & friendly, & i was proactively offered a late check out. My room was located behind the elevator, but i never heard any noise usually associated with close proximity to an elevator. The rooms are large & very comfortable. The room features a large flat screen tv with a DVD player, a comfortable single chair & ottoman, ironing board & iron, & a laptop size safe. Good quality tea & coffee is available in the room. There are not many conveniently located power outlets in the room, & none near the bed. Two bottles of free water were provided, & wifi was free & fast. Another reason i usually choose to stay at Westin hotels is the consistent quality of sleep i am able to get, but i found that one side of the mattress was really soft, to the point of being unable to sleep there. The other side was fine.I did point this out to the associate on check out, so hopefully they change that mattress out. The bathroom is very large & well laid out with a separate bath & walk in shower with two shower heads.  I didn't get breakfast here this time, as during previous stays i have always found the restaurant crowded, although the food was good. There are numerous places to eat nearby at much cheaper prices. I had a room service dinner though, and the menu offers something for everyone, including plenty of healthy options at reasonable prices. Overall the stay was fine, and i love the location, but the price was quite high on this occasion, & the mattress substandard. Not as good as previous stays.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_470697257~“Personal”~Room and location was great. But the service was very cold mostly at the reception desk. When we checked in, the receptionist was very impersonal and cold. On one afternoon my husband was waiting by the reception desk for some friends to arrive and was asked very rudely why he was waiting there. Checkout was also very unimpressive. We had booked 2 rooms 315 and 317. The receptionist who checked us out was very unhelpful, cold and arrogant / rude. I was paying in cash and the charges were very small. $7 for 1 room, and $121 For the other. I was told I had to pay separately as it was for 2 different rooms. She wouldn't let me pay $128 in total. Attitude was very poor. The car park valet team was excellent though, as were the bellboys. We had stayed at the Marriott before moving to the Westin and what a difference there was in the service level. The location at the Marriott is not as good but the team there is absolutely excellent, very helpful, kind and attentive and made us feel special at every engagement. So overall, not impressed with the Westin at Melbourne.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469041866~“A great hotel experience”~Great room, beautiful bed and big bathroom, lovely for night's stay. Right in the centre of the city, super easy to walk everywhere. Check in staff were quick and efficient. Quiet night's sleep... cant ask for more!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_469017239~“Best!!”~Love this hotel!! Best we have stayed at in Melbourne, even better when we get a balcony room. We try to return here as often as possible but it is never enough.

review_468423613~“High tea westin style disappointing”~High tea for two - one gluten free. What a dissappointment. Service wasn't great starting at the door with the conceirge staff too busy chatting to open it. The sandwiches were fine. Tasty, even using the tasteless gluten free white bread. The savory tart was dry and over cooked. The scones were not even worth eating - texture was course, scone turned to a gluedy lump in my mouth, the jam tasted like cheap jam from the supermarket. The sweets were uninspiring - the ubiquitous almond orange cake gluten free people get feed everywhere like it is the only thing available, the macaroon was days old and soft and tacky, the chocolate looking cupcake was very banana(ry) tasting weirdly so and had no topping which it needed to balance the strong banana taste. Weak tea was strong... water was tap water and not filtered. Do not recommend.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467614847~“Gone a bit off the boil”~I've stayed in this hotel quite a few times over the last couple of years and it feels like the quality has dropped slightly, certainly in comparison to the Westin in Sydney, where I just arrived from.  The number of large towels in the bathroom were much less than in Sydney, and one of the face cloths in the room had definitely seen better days (see picture).  The design of the shower meant that after I stepped out and closed the door, water flooded over the floor of the bathroom towards the toilet, not so pleasant! I ordered a cheese plate in Melbourne and Sydney and I believe the one in Melbourne was a third of the size of the one in Sydney and much smaller than it used to be in this hotel in the past.  Things seem to have slipped somewhat here.    ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467432867~“Great location, beautiful hotel”~Central location on Collins street but set back from the main road close to Federation square. The hotel backs onto Flinders lane full of cafes and interesting trendy restaurants most of which will not take bookings so being close is an advantage. Lovely foyer, efficient check in and helpful staff. I had a quiet room on the seventh floor which was ideal. Free wifi was included but didn't operate well until I rang reception on my second night. Breakfast was on the first floor in the main restaurant which was quiet, plenty of fresh food and omelets made on request. Would definitely stay here in preference to the Sofitel up the road.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466405115~“Amazing staff and fantastic location ”~After an initial booking issue which required a room change, the Westin staff were so helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay rememberable. I highly recommend the Westin Melbourne. Walking distance to most things in the CBD.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466190772~“Amazing service and hotel”~I think the best part about this hotel is the staff!!

We had a great couple days here and I'd love to return someday. Thank you Westin Melbourne!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466183566~“Was once our favourite bar”~Over many years, we have had some great afternoons and evenings here as a couple and as a family including pre and post theatre, Mothers Day lunches and just dropping in for drinks whether staying in the hotel or not. We even had our last night together as a family at the hotel on the eve of our daughter's wedding and met up in the bar that night We hadn't been in to the city for a while and decided to drop in for a drink and supper after seeing "Kinky Boots" last Thursday. We arrived at about 10pm and, as we sat in our favourite corner next to the fireplace, we both sighed contentedly in anticipation of another lovely visit.  Our waitress arrived promptly but, whilst friendly enough, we struggled to understand a lot of what she said so just went ahead with our request for a martini and a margarita and ordered two club sandwiches. She asked if we wanted chips or salad with them and we asked for one of each. The drinks arrived and the waitress went to the trouble of bringing over a separate table to accommodate everything. However, both meals arrived with chips (no salad) and they were the worst club sandwiches we've ever had. Very crusty bread made them difficult to eat and neither of us finished them. $33 each was also rather hard to swallow. The margarita was ok but the martini was very ordinary and not a patch on the two excellent martinis I'd enjoyed at Caterina's at lunch. The extra glasses of water we requested never did arrive and the staff started packing up a bit before 10.30. The overall atmosphere throughout our visit was poor. It was a very disappointing visit and, tor the first time ever at this bar, we didn't leave a tip. the bill came to $106. Should have gone to Florentinos after all.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_466165799~“Rude staff in the Coffe Shop”~It was 8th March afternoon. I was with my sister in the city and we decided to go to Westin for a quick lunch. We had done a lot of shopping and were a bit tired . We went to the coffee shop and nobody attended to us for quite sometime. We found a table which was not cleaned after the previous customer had left. We called one of the staff and asked her to clean the table. A girl called Kathryn Leung came and very rudely told us that if we were in a hurry we could leave as they would take a lot of time to serve us. The restaurant was not busy.Infact she was asking us to leave. We did not say anything. She did a shoddy job of cleaning the table too. Nobody came with the menu .After a while we asked for the menu and she gave it to us with a long face. Meanwhile there was anotther girl called Patricia who was passing by and we asked her for some help. She was very good. She brought our wine with a smiling face and a gentleman at the counter went out of his way to be kind to us.  All in all it was a good experience except for Kathry Leung who was very arrogant and up herself~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_465461774~“Hard to Fault!”~This property continues to live up to expectations! Both the staff and the property. I've been frequenting the property for the past 5+ years and have not been disappointed. I stay on the SPG members floor, the rooms are spacious with a lot of natural lighting. The bathrooms are equally spacious with double basins separate bath and shower. Location a few minutes walk from the retail centre and fabulous restaurants. The staff are extremely helpful, especially Concierge - thanks Ian and Steve.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_465140880~“10 out of 10”~The hotel is located on Collins St - right in the middle of the CBD, close to Flinders Station and Fed Square. We had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking Collins St, so I was worried about street noise - but you could not hear a thing. Excellent sound proofing and black out blinds, super comfy bed and a large modern bathroom. I could not fault a thing about this hotel - didn't try breakfast so can't comment on that.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464423466~“Wonderful weekend... ”~We decided to have a girl's weekend away in city & to pamper ourselves with a stay in two beautiful inter-connected deluxe rooms. From the moment we entered the hotel the aura of calm, professional efficiency surrounded us.  One of our rooms had a Juliet-balcony over looking Collins Street & we enjoyed the added benefit of the use of the corridor our private hallway/entrance secured by a separate door. Both rooms were spacious & well equipped with a desk, armchair & footstool, a large screen TV & DVD player . One room had one of the hotel's signature "heavenly" king bed, the other room two "heavenly" double beds... A plentiful supply of pillows graced each bed which gave us all a wonderful night's rest through out our stay...  Each room had a luxurious bathroom complete with double vanity, big bath & separate shower with rain nozzle as well as a height adjustable power nozzle (bathroom bliss)... A generous selection of fluffy towels & complimentary toiletries in the Westin's White Tea range were available..  We the indulged ourselves late one afternoon with the "High Tea Experience" served in the Lobby Bar... We were seated in the secluded 'library' area complete with mantled fireplace & bookcase, the perfect place for conversation... Scones (jam & cream), savoury tartlets, finger sandwiches & sweet pastries were served on a cake-stand our table... We chose non-alcoholic beverages, although champagne & prosecco options were available...  The room service menu was extensive & catered for every palate... Our meals were served promptly, well presented & most importantly hot...  Every staff member we met from room service & housekeeping, porter to duty manager was friendly, polite & professional... The hotel environs were clean & sparkling (& has an opt-in environmental friendly housekeeping program)...  We did not avail ourselves of the many fitness or relaxation options provided, maybe next time... We requested a late checkout (complementary), so had a lazy last morning in bed...  All in all the Westin is a cut above the rest in every category when it comes to luxury hotels in Melbourne...  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464265592~“Great location, decor a little tired”~Location wise, you probably cannot get a better hotel in Melbourne, it's in the heart of the CBD. Meaning you can walk almost anywhere very easily (or take the free city trams)  Staff are great and rooms are clean. I feel like hotel has aged poorly though - having stayed here previously I don't think they have done any works in the last 6 years.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464152974~“Brilliant location and great staff ”~The Deluxe rooms have a small balcony with French doors, not big enough to sit on, but a nice feature to have (though the doors don't have the best seal so if you are sensitive to noise when sleeping maybe consider a different room. It didn't bother us.). Service was fast and friendly, particularly at the concierge desk where the banter was on great form and they are very happy to help with whatever you might need. One of the best things about the hotel has to be the location which is fantastic, right by all the laneways and arcades and a variety of great restaurants. The bed was comfy enough but felt like it might have seen better days with a definite 'dip' in the mattress that comes with time and use. That said, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463521605~“Great location and rooms, amazing staff”~From the moment you walk towards the door, you are handled with professional and friendly care. The staff are super friendly, and I can't say enough about how helpful the gentlemen at the concierge desk were! I really appreciated them coming around the desk to stand with you while talking, and were amazing in helping arrange a car rental, delivered right to the hotel! The rooms are very nice as well, standard great quality for the Westin. Location couldn't be better, so much around, and central to everything. Super happy we called this home for a few days while touring Melbourne. This was a business trip for my husband, and a fun trip for me. The hotel was perfect for business and for pleasure.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463117597~“Fantastic as always in the centre of Melbourne”~I stayed here for one night for a work function. This is by far in my top three hotels in Melbourne. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Bathrooms are a great size and really clean. The overall elegant feel of the hotel makes it always a smooth and comfortable stay. Food (in particular buffet breakfast is fantastic) and nothing is to much to ask.  If you are travelling it is the perfect spot to explore Melbourne with trams and train on your door step.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_461972875~“Superb hotel, great ovation, great service”~My wife and I stayed at the Westin over NYE and booked ourselves into an upgraded city view room. What a superb hotel it is. Not endowed with the extraordinary views of many hotels, it certainly makes the most of its mid city location. The room was bright, well appointed and lavish. The bathroom was huge as is the room and it has very nice city views from its floor to ceiling bay windows. The forecourt is huge and the reception and open areas of the hotel are welcoming and well laid out. We also tried out the pool, spa and sauna and they are good functional areas, the only complaint I could make is the pool areas is enclosed with low ceilings so very very noisy especially with children using the pool so some sound muffling options would be a smart move. The gyn is small but has a good array of equipment and open floor space~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461663219~“great staff”~Stayed there for the first time.. On the white night last week. Room was great. Only issue was the TV reception. The sound was not good.

review_461595822~“Friendly hotel”~We stayed here for White Night and we couldn't be happier with our choice. We usually stay at the Sofitel on Collins st but wanted something closer to the action.  The staff at the Westin were fantastic, nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them and they genuinely seemed to want to help. From the valet drivers to the housekeepers the staff were at a very high standard.  We booked a Deluxe room with a balcony facing Swanston St. The king sized Westin "Dream Bed" was very comfortable and the bathrooms are huge. I really appreciated the quality of the iron and the well padded ironing board, when you're travelling a lot and dressing from a suitcase a small thing like that makes an enormous difference!  My only gripe would be the placement of the toilet flush buttons, when the lid is raised it rests against them. This could be improved by installed "soft close" lids to minimise handling of the lid. It's a bit icky! Overall a lovely hotel and we are looking forward to our next visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461405425~“Near perfect hotel in a great city for arts, eats and wandering”~Remains one of our favourite hotels in a great city to visit. Low key luxury in a great location with good size rooms. Its relative low rise height means rooms with a view feel part of the city life which we enjoy - and tram and street noise didn't seem to intrude. The lobby balcony a great place for a drink. A good gym and pool must almost be 25m. Staff professional and helpful. Deserves its popularity and seems a reasonable price compared to cheaper options in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461092340~“Well-presented hotel in central Melbourne”~The location is excellent. Rooms are a decent size and well-appointed. Staff are helpful. The downstairs lobby bar is a highlight. Overall, a very good CBD hotel. If you expect professional service and a properly maintained hotel, you will not be disappointed.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_460854395~“In the heart of the city”~Booked the Westin as part of their summer deals with the Starwood membership. Booking was easy but you MUST have a credit card or no booking occurs, there is no flexibility on that one. Didnt realise at first the hotel is the hotel that sits above the old centre of Melbourne where the yellow peril was. When you look at it from swans ton street the facade looks old and the square is undertaking a much needed facelift. The lane entrance however is very impressive with a cobblestone lane, impressive glass facade and some high end shops. The lobby is also very grand. Check in was easy as well. Stayed with my 2 daughters in a double double room. The rooms are large and very quiet being the location it is. The rooms are very well appointed and the bathroom extremely large even though the shower temperature took a little while to work out and some instructions on changing the temperature would be good. The beds are amazing, leave it at that. On top of all that is the location, it doesn't get any better, you are central to everything and every tram you ever need leaves outside or near to the hotel. There are numerous great food options and coffee which is worth searching as coffee from the lobby bar was very over inflated on price. The pool and gym area are good and you can swim some laps but a little over chlorinated. Would stay again and recommend highly.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_460245613~“Great hotel”~Went for a girls trip and it was in a great location to explore and shop. Very nice rooms, indoor pool and great service. They found out it was my birthday and even sent up a bottle of wine with a personalised card which I thought was very thoughtful and kind.

review_459485749~“Weekend stay”~Great location in the center of Melbourne with easy access to shops and theatres. Clean spacious rooms, but best of all was the service. All of the staff could not do enough to help you. Will definitely return.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458613843~“Bacation”~Hotel is very well maintained. Everyone is very helpful. I wouldn't recommend trying to see much in the city. The 2 days I recommend is Phillip island and great ocean road. Visit the cafes for your meals. The food is great and the price more reasonable. The staff was helpful. They gave us a lovely room looking the church. A~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458011735~“Great Location and Excellent Service”~I chose this hotel because of its proximity to my son's university, RMIT in Swanston Street in Melbourne However, in addition to its proximity, we had excellent service from the hotel staff starting with the front office staff when we checked in after midnight on the evening of 1/2/17 and 2/2/17. Not only was the check in staff most helpful, she was also extremely helpful when my son and I had to use the computer and printer facilities to access and print various emails. This is despite the lateness of the hour. The staff were also most polite the next few mornings always greeting us when we were about to leave the hotel Apart from the proximity to my son's university, it is also 2 minutes walk from several major attractions such as St Paul's Cathedral, Federation Square which is where many of the bus tours start as well as Flinders Street train station. Swanston Street is also the main thoroughfare for Melbourne I would highly recommend this hotel for any visitor to Melbourne who wants to be in the city centre and close to a lot of attarctions. The Melbourne Tourist information centre is also in Federation Square so for any tourist, this is most helpful or you can certainly try the hotel concierge!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457980463~“Very nice room”~The Westin is a deserved 5-star hotel The check-in was a little slow with the need to wait for 10 minutes The service in cafe and bar was excellent The room was one of the most comfortable I have stayed in The bed sublime and the bathroom lovely The hotel is a little dated and the local environment (the square in front) is a little grungy~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_457470239~“Melbourne's BEST place to stay. Don't book anywhere else.”~I've stayed in thousands of hotels around the world. This is one of the most memorable hotel experiences ever. Perfect Location, beautiful big room, great breakfast, lively bar, but the best part was the level of service and attention to detail. From the GM to the over-the-top Concierge team, to the bellhops, every associate at this property clearly understands the meaning of hospitality and making guests feel welcomed and relaxed. Great pool, gym and spa also. If you're going to Melbourne (which is one of the world's great underrated cities) don't even think of staying anywhere else.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_457260170~“AFTERNOON TEA”~We have been here a few times for afternoon tea when in the city. It is really lovely sitting in the lounge at a window table watching the passing parade outside. Service always has been good and friendly. We usually, and again today, had a tea/coffee and a cake (actually today I had a bowl of chips, no salt as I like them). For $18/ head for this great resting time is worthwhile. We also love the Art Deco fit out. We will certainly be returning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457242251~“Tennis stay ”~We recently stayed at the Westin during the Australian open tennis, the service was excellent from front desk and cleaning staff, the room was immaculate and very large, and the breakfast was excellent , highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456521253~“Fantastic location and room... and very comfy beds.”~Returning to the Westin, this time on an SPG points booking, I remember my last visit to this property at mixed feelings.  The Westin is a centrally located business hotel and if you're visiting the adjacent Regent's theatre or wish to be on this end of the Collins Street precinct. A walking distance to the local malls, tram lines and train station. Booking was seamless. Just a few clicks on the SPG app. A few minor annoyances. Several emails and phone calls from SPG and the front desk about a miscommunication that there was a minor issue with the points redemption on their end. Okay. Fixed. But mildly irritating if you're en-route at the airport with a plane to catch wondering if your hotel booking fell through. Then another phone call after check-in saying they didn't record my SPG number for my booking for points earn, and asking me for my membership number... even though I booked using SPG's website on an awards redemption night? Everyone was very pleasant about it and the front desk lady polite, courteous, professional and welcoming.  The room itself. Spacious for a King room and exceedingly quiet. Clean. Well appointed. High speed wi-fi for streaming Netflix and work purposes complimentary for SPG bookings and a 4pm check-out as a Gold SPG Member. I didn't ask for an upgrade but was politely informed an upgrade wasn't available anyway as the hotel was fully booked. Not unexpected for a standard room award booking. The Westin beds have always been as good as I remember. Delightfully supportive and the pillow choices fluffy and oh so comfy. Almost as good as what I have at home.  Then again, I know I'll return. I have enough SPG points for another night here. :) Would have been a 4.5 to 5 star review on this occasion had it not been for the unexpected system problems mentioned earlier.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_455697507~“Last day of the Holiday”~Excellent hotel, great location, close to lots of shopping and entertainment and attractions on the Yarra river. We took a boat ride down the river. Lovely large room, fantastic lobby bar with exceptional service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455541932~“Great Stay for Business”~I stayed in a regent suit which was also ideal for a small business meeting of 8 people as the room has a good sized table and lounge. Had a great view and quiet for a city hotel. Had the usual fresh fruit on arrival, but at other hotels usually also wine is provided with similar rooms. The fruit and water was not replaced, and there wasn't coffee in the room either which I found unusual. Not enough glasses and none brought up on request. Otherwise Staff attentive as I had many events for multiple people organised meeting in the hotel lobby and assisted with a last minute printing issue for a presentation. Breakfast convenient and good but with many other nearby places offering fantastic and delicious food perhaps they need to reassess the offered food. I had heard they also have a different 'healthy' superfood menu but no one seemed to know about it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455112219~“Problems Galore, Management obviously do not care.”~Toilet was broken (constantly flushing), TV remote not working, airconditioning automatically turned itself off after midnight resulting in a 10 degree increase in room temperature (30 degrees at 1.00A.M.) ,winter- weight doona on bed in mid summer up to 40 degree heat, room service food extremely expensive and extremely disappointing ($50 for a large onion, table spoon of mashed potatos, tiny midget chicken piece), breakfast bar promoted as being healthy but all they did is put little leaf shapes on the remotely healthy items in the standard menu (how dumb do they thing customers are?), bed very hard and dead, Lifts slow. Staff professional but uncaring.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_455105633~“More than lives up to its reputation!”~Our recent stay at the Westin exceeded Westin's great reputation. Hotel location is a few steps from Federation Square and easy walking within the CBD, rooms and bathrooms are large and well designed. The heavenly beds can't be beat. But over and above this was the service of the concierge staff who expertly arranged to ship a bag for us and who went way beyond the job description to ensure we did not miss a scheduled tour when there was a miscommunication about pickup location. Wish every hotel could live up to the Westin standard. Thank you for a memorable stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455087266~“Just another Westin”~Decent hotel in the centre of Melbourne, however it doesn't compare with other 5 star hotels, particularly in Sydney. It's a little sterile, the room is kind of ordinary. Also delivery on room service is $8 compared to $2 at the Four Seasons in Sydney!!!! They should also consider a complimentary turn-down service. I understand this has to be requested in advance.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454880968~“Yearly Meeting”~We stayed here for our yearly team meeting and I loved everything about this hotel - classy, great location and the rooms are understated but luxurious and very comfortable. The bathrooms are huge which I like - my only gripe was the button to control audio from the TV that is beside the toilet came off and housekeeping did not fix it once despite it sitting clearly on the bench for 3 days so I was trying to turn down the volume unsuccessfully.. hopefully they noticed it when I left and actually fixed! Breakfast was substantial but not mindblowing with variety. There were no asian options to cater for overseas visitors and seeing that most 5 star hotels cater to the business crowd that could be an area to consider for future menu inclusions - dumplings, sushi, rice! I'm of asian descent and I travel regularly interstate and to Asia so am used to high quality breakfast buffets with healthier options beside a regular western breakfast. Our meeting room was City Square boardroom and it was perfect for us with realky great morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea options - quinoa salad was a favourite with our team. The staff looked after our every need technically and it was really private. Love this hotel so would recommend to visitors whether for business or pleasure! Oh and the bar was fab - we had a few late night wines and dirty martinis and had the sweetest trainee look after us fabulously! She was really attentive and checked how my martinis were which were perfect by the way - grey goose and 3 olives so maybe an extra dirty martini! Thanks Westin Melbourne.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454614954~“Heavenly it was not!”~We checked into The Westin Melbourne having flown in from Wellington NZ on 4th January 2017. This was a pre cruise stay. We were swiftly in our room and unpacking. The room was bright and airy with large windows onto Collins Street. The bathroom was clean and roomy with twin sinks. Although only there for one night the bed was a major disappointment. It was extremely firm and had that dead feeling. I have stayed at the Westin Sydney and that bed was fine. Sleep and comfort are very important to me so I would hesitate to stay here again. The location is great and the staff very pleasant. We dined in the restaurant in the evening. The roast potatoes were not up to scratch and were pre cooked. The attitude of the server was less than caring ie they didn't make any effort to remedy or rectify! Overall this is a lovely hotel but I won't be rushing back! ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454221627~“Great service, Great value, great hotel”~We grabbed this hotel as a last minute place to stay. I was totally surprised at the warm welcome, the incredible checkin at 1030 at night, the excellence of the BED and the rooms. Right in the middle of the city its close to everything. If you have stayed in a Westin Bed you know its good. if not check it out~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_453889406~“Nice place, great location, needs a revamp”~The building is stunning in the public areas. Room spacious but the furnishings need revamping. There are lots of knocks and scrapes and the room felt just slightly old fashioned.  The bed was superbly comfortable with excellent pillows and linen. Very good quality sleep on what feels like a very expensive mattress.  There are no power points on bedsides and the phone dock doesn't charge the phone. There are no power points for charging except at floor level.  Large well designed bathroom. Full width mirror and good lighting but only a single power point. There is a shaver power point but how many people have electric shavers? The grout in the show stall was grubby and although there was both an overhead shower and hand held/adjustable shower head, the taps were incredibly difficult to operate. Instead of an easy grip handle, they had only a dome to grip. The taps have an old fashioned washer so have to be turned off right so as not to drip. This means it is even harder to turn on next time. The bathroom looks nice until you look closer, then it feels a bit dirty. See photos of shower stall and grout.  Room service is expensive with a coffee costing $15. There is inroom coffee but the jug has to boil in the bathroom or on the bedroom floor for lack of power point near table.  I was slightly disappointed for such a Lernout hotel to be so shabby round the edges.  The staff more than made up for it and were extremely kind and courteous.  I enjoyed the stay which was sadly marred by the awful events in the mall where many pedestrians were run down by a deranged miscreant. I'd like to take a moment to remember those killed and injured.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453493924~“Not a business hotel”~Unfortunately a colleague bought a non-refundable room here for a recent one day trip to Melbourne (at 50% more that I would have had to pay for an alternative five star hotel). But as it had been 10 years since I was last underwhelmed by this hotel, it was probably time to give it another try. So what do I expect from a business hotel: 1) My room to be ready when I arrive 2) If my room isn't likely to be ready for 45 minutes and you say you will call my mobile when it is ready, remember to call my mobile. 3) My SPG gold welcome gift to be provided on arrival 4) A plug for recharging near the bed 5) Failing that a visible accessible plug near the desk 6) A desk light that doesn't have to be turned off at the wall. 7) A bed that isn't two singles pushed together with a huge lump in the middle where the bed edges are making it impossible to sleep in the middle of the bed and you feel like you are sleeping on a slope all night. 8) My newspaper delivered in the morning 9) Failing that, newspapers available at breakfast. 10) No "voluntary" donations added to the bill without my permission How did the Westin score? 0 out of 10.  2 stars, and only because the checkout person chased up a newspaper for me that I would have otherwise had to pay for. Avoid! ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453246001~“Business Lunch in the City”~Called in to meet business colleagues and decided to have a quick lunch. Staff couldn't have been more helpful and the lunch Menu excellent with great Australian Wines. I decided to have a Salad to start with, beautifully presented followed by Chicken and Indian Spices. They have a fast Business 2 course lunch at only. $A 39.00 per person including a glass of wine. Superb value and only $A 52.00 per person for 3 courses. A modern setting and Children friendly. It helps to have a Sheraton Gold Card when making reservations.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_452674811~“Excellent city location, large sized rooms and bathrooms- consistent”~I last stayed at the Westin 10 years ago and was keen to see how the hotel had aged. It has aged well and been maintained to an excellent standard. Rooms are large and the bathrooms are spacious with double sinks and a sep shower with overhead rain shower option and large bath. Check in was very busy with a wait of 20 minutes at 3pm. Large indoor pool and spa complex on a lower floor of the building. Location is better than the Grand Hyatt for shopping as it's closer to Bourke St mall where the large department stores are so you can easily pop back to your room to drop off shopping etc. Would happily stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_452498005~“Spoils yourself.”~I'm always disappointed when this hotel is booked out. It such a wonderful place to experience Melbourne from. No other hotel is quite so central or quite so luxurious. Look out for deals, its worth experiencing at least once.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

We got a great Summer Saver deal which included Valet Parking, Buffet Breakfast and a large room with 2 double beds and a view across to the Shrine of Remembrance and Fed Square. The hotel is very classy and everything was very smooth and the team is super helpful. We had a quick spa before going out to dinner and to see Kinky Boots. Very comfy beds and great block out curtains, we didn't hear a thing during the night. Really enjoyed out stay and will be back for sure.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_451485426~“Excellent!”~The overall experience exceeded our expectations. We are very happy by choosing this hotel, from the long list we evaluated. The best thing about the stay were the concierge. They are all very humble and good people, they try their best for you to have your best stay experience. For example, there was a major construction in the road to the airport (1.5hrs delay), since the skytrain people didn't advice us, we didn't know. When we called the concierge at the checkout to the airport at the morning, they gave us an awareness about the situation, and we were already late for the flight, we were going to call an uber or a cab at last. Since they knew we were very tight, we went down and the Cab (that we didn't call) was already waiting for us in the lobby, that was an A++++, we arrived just in the boarding time.  The rooms were very good and clean, we loved the big space, bathroom and the city view. Thank you.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

I do not understand though, why a Hotel like this appling a surcharge for a Credit Card payment, I have NEVER had a surcharge applied by a Hotel - really Westin, how else do you want us to pay, please dont say EFTPOS or Cash. Really if you are cutting that fine, raise your rate 1.5% and forget the surcharge, it just leaves a poor taste in your mouth.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_450030652~“A Disappointment ”~SPG is my chain of choice, mostly because I'm trying to build up loyalty points. They are not the cheapest chain of hotels but generally a safe bet - in other words you generally know what you will get.  On the plus side the concierges were amazing! Helpful, efficient and capable of working miracles at short notice.  However for a 5 star hotel I was disappointed by the facilities. The gym was dirty (do the cleaners even go in there?) and the TV in my room was old and didn't work (a problem with the sound and I asked several times for it to be fixed - it wasn't) and the movie channels were pay for view (although sports channels for free). At the sort of prices they charge one would expect everything to work and to be able to watch a free movie with your expensive room service (not just the footie!). I might just be a little spoilt as I live and travel extensively in Asia; and an Asian 5 star often seems more like a 7 star in comparison to the west. Average stay and overall disappointed... ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449908426~“Great location for family trip ”~We are a family of 5 who stayed here in December. A great location. Walking distance to everything. The concierges were fabulous. We were there over Christmas when lots of things were closed. They gave us plenty of ideas of things to do and places that would be open. They even found a place for us to send out our laundry and have it delivered back to our room. The rooms were spacious and free wifi which my teenagers enjoyed at the end of a long day. We loved Melbourne and would for sure stay at the Westin again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_449642921~“Always outstanding!”~This wonderfully placed Hotel right in the heart of Melbourne city makes city exploration and shopping so easy. We have stayed there for years and the very high standard has never dropped. From staff remembering your name to superb heavenly beds.

The Westin is extremely accommodating for guests with a disability, with a large, appropriately designed room with accessible door and bathroom. We were treated like royalty, such a professional and fantastic team! On Boxing Day a large group of us had high tea in the downstairs bar, which was delicious. Again, service was impeccable.

The hotel is located in an excellent, minutes walking distance to bars, cafes, restaurants, shops, grocery store, etc. It's also one block from a tram stop which can take you to the Southern Cross station for airport bus service- the tram ride is free.

review_449355167~“Best hotel in Melbourne”~This is my favourite 5 star hotel in Melbourne.

review_449091969~“Impeccable service”~This was our second stay at the Westin in Melbourne, albeit the first was several years ago.  The service was great, and the rooms were good. We had a room on the 7th floor overlooking Collins Street. I think the 7th floor is the highest you can go as the rest of the floors are rented/owned apartments. Possibly a better view is overlooking Federation Square (at the opposite end of the hotel). The location is perfect for a tourist - right in the heart of the city and within walking distance to many attractions and restaurants. There is great shopping in the city (Myer, David Jones and Melbourne Central). We often caught the free tram (free within a set parameter within the central city) when we wanted to rest our legs and the rest of the time we walked.  The only thing I didn't like at the Westin was the pool. We stayed on some quite hot days so wanted to cool down in the pool. It was quite small and underground. Unfortunately some families with children totally disregarded the no diving signs and were splashing and screaming, which didn't make for a very pleasant experience. Not the Westin's fault though, of course.  We didn't eat at the hotel but it would be a nice spot for a meal. I saw a high tea service being wheeled past one day which looked amazing.  Melbourne has awesome dining options. Some which we enjoyed were: * Shanghai Street (in Chinatown) * Chin Chin (queues of 1.5 hours while we were there - go early!) * Shandong Mama Mini * Doughnut Time on Degraves (loved the mini M&M's donut) * Brother Baba Budan for coffee I would also recommend checking out Queen Victoria Market and South Melbourne Market. If you're into dessert, check out Bibelot near South Melbourne Market.  I would definitely recommend the Westin as a great base for exploring Melbourne.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_448992975~“Great rooms and breakfast”~Spacious rooms with a huge bathroom and just a really large comfortable space to be in. We had everything we expected from this hotel and more. It's in a great location in between Collins St and Flinders Ln and we walked and caught ubers everywhere with ease. The breakfast was not included with our room (which we knew about) but they offered us a voucher for $25pp breakfast which we felt was a really good deal considering the quality of the coffee, juices and food. Loved our stay in Melbourne!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448573963~“Not for an SPG Platinum Guest, Good Location Though”~During my trip to Australia, I stayed at 3 SPG properties: The Westin Sydney, the Sheraton on the Park Sydney, and the Westin Melbourne. The Westin in Melbourne, while in a wonderful location, and had a fantastic concierge, underwhelmed significantly.  What they got right: Clean rooms, prime location, staff who are friendly and want to help. For example, when I ordered toast and eggs for breakfast in the lobby and waited over an hour only to receive cold breakfast and the order done incorrectly - the server apologized and offered us a free drink (which we declined) and took the food charge off the bill. When I was unable to print something at the computer in the lobby, the woman at the front desk immediately offered to help and print for me (many hotels will not do that). When I was given a room with a broken bed, I was offered a new room immediately and the bellman helped move our bags. Many of their staff were absolutely fantastic.  Where they missed the mark: The hotel did not recognize our platinum status at check in. They could have done this in a few ways, offer a platinum amenity, give us a room that does not face a concrete wall, leave a note inside our room, offer us breakfast in addition to the welcome points since they do not have a lounge, provide a drink coupon for the lobby restaurant - something to show appreciation. But the Westin did none of this. While I was there, I did not feel like I was at an SPG property, nor did I feel like I was a valued guest. Additionally, they need more outlets or USB plugs in the room. Most of their plugs are on the floor and if you use a converter, it will be too bulky and you will have to use the plugs in the bathroom or unplug the room phone if you want an outlet or two to charge anything.  Here's how their lack of acknowledgement compares to the SPG properties in Sydney. In Sydney at the Westin - 500 welcome points, plus warm breakfast in the lounge, plus evening cocktails and canapés for Platinum members. In addition, since they could not upgrade our room, we were put on a high floor with somewhat of a view.  Sheraton Sydney - At welcome since the hotel was full of platinum members and we could not be upgraded, we were given a regular room with a view of the park. Additionally, we got a note from hotel management apologizing for how crowded the hotel was and they offered cocktails and canapés in both the lounge and restaurant for platinum members due to how busy they were. They did not say, we are not big enough therefore sorry, they did something. Additionally, they upgraded our breakfast to an incredible buffet and they left a bottle of wine for us in our room. We asked for none of it and the Sheraton Sydney went significantly above and beyond to show their appreciation. I don't expect that, but I do expect the Westin Melbourne to do something more than give me a room facing a concrete wall.  After this experience, I would say SPG members, save your $$ and your points. Go stay at one of the other hotels in Melbourne, you may even be treated better. My final aggravating point at the Westin was when I called the front desk the night before my flight leaving Melbourne, I asked if I could arrange a taxi. The woman at the front desk told me I did not need to and someone would help me in the morning (3:30am). Sure enough, I went downstairs and requested a taxi. It took over 20 minutes to get one and I almost missed my bus to the airport. The gentleman at the desk was helpful and told me I could have arranged for one in advance to be there instead of wait for one and risk missing my flight. This makes sense, but was in direct opposite of what I was told the night before. Main message, the Westin Melbourne needs to treat its Platinum Guest better. They believe in the bare minimum. They may not have enough "nice" rooms for all of their platinum guests, but I've stayed in much less nice hotels, with rooms that are not great, and have had much better experiences.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~4~nan
review_448189652~“Wonderful hotel, definitely recommend the hotel ”~The hotel is located on the great spot, close to the Yarra river, and middle of shopping area, museums as well as close to all kind of restaurant. We had a room with breakfast package. The restaurant staff were very friendly and professional. They served 2 or three kind of cheeses, salmon and tuna, all kind of eggs, omelette, potatoes, sausage, bacon, fresh fruits, bread, cereal and pastries. Very good breakfast.  The rooms were large and clean. Two large closet, 10 hangers with mirrors. There were a alarm clack with the iPhone plug, which was awesome, we did not even need to take our iPhone charger out of the luggage. The bath room was so clean and well designed. The standing shower and bath tube were separated. The room and bath room was very clean and the housekeeping ladies were very professional kind and clean. The room had a tea maker and coffee maker, the coffee selection was not great but it was not bad either.  Overall, we had a good time in Melbourne and the hotel made it more wonderful.  A little note in case you are planning to see Melbourne. Don't waste your time and money, two days is enough for Melbourne, the city doesn't have much to offer. We are in Sydney now and we think we wasted 6 days of our 15 days in the Melbourne. We could got travel the Gold Coast or New Zealand.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447719157~“Urgh”~1. Line at checkin and spg line disregarded 2. Platinum status not even acknowledged and no upgrade given 3. Check in girl rude! Next time I came to the lobby she didn't remember me- ouch! 4. Bar in the lobby- Chloe: her customer service is terrible Positive: the rooms are on top form. Comfortable and spacious rooms Not worth the price. I booked out out of loyalty I stayed with spg. Total failure that was. Again- cloe at the bar, has no customer service~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447316867~“Great hotel in Great location ! Everything you'll expect in a Westin”~This review is for a stay between 12/7 - 12/10. This is our first visit to Melbourne, therefore, our first stay at the Westin Melbourne The Westin Melbourne is located in the middle of Melbourne shopping district. All the major malls are within 5-10 walk. There are tons of restaurant and coffee shops within 5-10 walk too The hotel itself is very clean and cozy. Our room is very large with a view of the christmas on the park. the bathroom is very clean, modern, and HUGE! As SPG platinum member, we received free breakfast buffet in their restaurant. The food are great! tons of healthy, high-quality food. We'll definitely stay at this place again in our next visit to Melbourne. regards,~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_447312733~“great service”~This hotel is very comparable to other mid range hotels and the service is excellent. Staff went out of the way to find out information that was required. Lovely room, very clean and well maintained. As a seasoned traveller we only stay on 5 star hotels and this one is only 4.5 but is very acceptable.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
