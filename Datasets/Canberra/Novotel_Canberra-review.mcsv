review_477582335~“Old Building But Comfortable”~I had a number of meetings around this part of the CBD so the location was really good.  The hotel is comfortable - its showing its age in a few areas but still passes the grade as very good.  My room overlooked the bus terminal - normally wouldn't be a problem but for the drivers using their horns and the reversing beeps - not something the Novotel can control but worth checking with reception as to which way your room faces.  There were a few minor attention to detail issues with the room - no plug for the sink and a couple of areas of the room that could use more attention from the cleaners - not the end of the world but I do expect more from the Novotel brand.  Otherwise it was a good stay, if I need to be in this part of Canberra again it would be my choice.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_475524987~“Good Location in Canberra”~The Novotel Canberra where my wife and I stayed in early April, 2017, is a nice and well-located hotel in downtown Canberra. The rooms are nicely appointed, although our room was next to the housekeepers' storage room which provided some noise early in the morning. The breakfast is also well done, although one of our morning's was overwhelmed by a bus group. To be recommended.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475153626~“More like a 3 star hotel with good facilities”~The Good: Pool area with spa and sauna was really nice, great for relaxing in. The buffet breakfast was also good with a great variety of food, all what you would expect at a good breakfast buffet The Bad: The room...first of all the basin for the bathroom is not actually in the room but in the kitchenette. The walls were dirty and marked. Cracks in floor tiles. Don't get me started on the balcony - it was soo unappealing I didn't even go out there~3~2~nan~nan~2~nan~4~nan

review_474440001~“Dropped the ball”~I stay here mostly when on business in Canberra & it's normally faultless. I don't know if it's because I've come from four nights at the Mecure in Sydney which offers the most impeccable service but this time the service here especially at reception needs a good look at! They just haven't got that warmth that front of house needs. The wait staff in restaurant give you the impression they'd rather be somewhere else. I would have mentioned all of this to management but you don't see them. The exception to all this is the ever present & obliging Kuda who's willingness to look after a customer is what it's all about.~2~nan~5~4~nan~nan~2~nan

review_473956629~“Arbre Restaurant Review - one night great and one night terrible !!!!”~We have been here many times before on previous trips and the chefs and quality of the food and menu is fantastic and standards are high. This is a busy hotel, families and seniors mostly and the staff are pushed to the limits most of the time, this affects the service you will get and the level of efficiency. For us the food is outstanding it’s the staff that can let this restaurant down. We had 2 dinners and one lunch last week. First dinner perfect, lunch unreal outstanding friendly and professional service and great food. Second dinner was like being in a totally different place, the staff took us to the wrong table, we had reserved one in particular even though no one was sitting there, daily specials were not offered, but the worst thing that had the greatest impact was that the dinner order was incorrectly communicated to the kitchen which resulted in us getting our entrees at different times as one had not been ordered at all and were not able to eat together. The waiter kept talking to diners at other tables about his uni course and personal information instead of focusing on his job and as a result people around us waited long periods of time while he mucked around hiding in the kitchen and walking around the restaurant away from his service area. We were watching him wondering what was going on ? The food runner from the kitchen brought out our main courses while we were eating our entrees and announced in a very loud voice "what would we like to do with our main courses " { what an odd question given the table was full- seriously lack of common sense and a complete lack of communication between staff and the kitchen. We replied we are eating our entrees .Time passed and when we were ready for the mains of course no one could be found, the food was cold, we had asked for it to be brought out hot of course. Long story short we did not pay for one entree and the staff member did not show any interest or care in his service to us. Again it is not the kitchen or food here it’s the staff that is the problem. So my husband ate a cold steak and I had cold pasta – by then OVER IT, no one to talk to anyway. The guy behind the bar takes payment- he is clearly fatigued with work despite trying to do a reasonable job. If we return again it would be great if the hotel management can sort out and arrange some experienced wait staff and leadership in the restaurant.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_473718632~“Canberra ”~As Canberra is the only Australian city we have not yet visited, we planned a trip here. Firstly the weather turned against us!!! Secondly we are very disappointed in the hotel......the room is not what we are used to in other Novotel and it is after 14.00 and our room which we left at 08.00 has not yet been cleaned. We visited the old parliament which we found very interesting. The art gallery but we're looking forward to visiting War Memorial when the weather will allow us to do so. We came to Canberra by rail, a great disappointment not half as good as the rail system in Queensland, however the views from the train made it worthwhile.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473476648~“Atrocious service for the price- think twice!”~I have again ventured into the Novotel Canberra with trepidation, although dubious after my previous experiences Novotel again didn't disappoint and is still old and worn, after first questioning the menu which had what appeared to be a fruit salad with the steak the kitchen manager confirmed this was a mistake on their new menu, after clarifying this meal and ordering room service I called the kitchen back after an hour to be told they were extremely busy and apologized, I explained this is a big hotel can't they manage their staff, surely the hotel didn't fill up with walk ins, at >$430 p/n this is totally un-acceptable, I called the front desk to speak to the manager to be told she was busy, Darren was marvelous and tried his best under the circumstances but after an hour and a half he personally delivered my meal after 9pm, it seemed to have been sitting somewhere for a while as it was a tough dry piece of meat with a vegetable side covered with something so hot it was in-edible, I hardly touched it. NOT what I call service from this exorbitant nightly rate, I twice asked for the manager to contact me and have not heard a thing, I ate out for the rest of my stay including breakfast. I questioned where all the coat hangers were and was was told a new housekeeping company had been appointed yea so what should I hang my cloths on even after my room was serviced still nothing, this hotel has backpacker status (no offence to back packers)in my book as a platinum ACCOR member sadly I expected this from the ACT hotel, I wasn't surprised.~2~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan~nan
review_472817067~“Novotel Canberra”~The Novotel is an old hotel close to the CBD with an efficient and friendly staff.

review_471246073~“Good accommodation clean Good location”~I find the Novotel Canberra a little soulless however the positives central location plenty of restaurants bars and clubs within walking distance. Beds and bedding super comfortable room was a little small so would definitely try to get a larger room / suite if I stayed again. Overall pretty good for business travel especial for overnight accommodation however wouldn't recommend for tourists staying a few nights - that's just my personal opinion.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_470975738~“Consistent older Novotel experience in terms of room quality”~The Novotel is the preferred accommodation of a number of my colleagues for reasons that I can understand. I personally did not have the greatest experience, however I will endeavour to give a fair and reasonable review separate of that.  I was booked in with a number of other staff traveling for business and we checked in together. For everyone else their stay was as wonderful as they always find it. It is important to note that I seem to have just been unlucky.  The positives: The room was nice. A good size without being overwhelming. Quite a reasonable size and layout for 2 people. The bed was good and the overall presentation was good. Everything was clean and tidy, and in line with what I have experienced at every other Novotel I have stayed in. I had a bathroom that was designed for wheelchairs and other mobility impaired travellers so if you are in the market for this I can say that it was quite good for that purpose. The breakfast was quite nice . The restaurant was quite nice to start the morning. I particularly liked the lighting in that it was nice but not super bright – I was relaxed and enjoyed my coffee. The negatives: It was a parliament week so the room was quite expensive due to being heavily booked. When I arrived my room (mine alone none of the other people I was traveling with were affected) was not available and seemed to have been overlooked. After some time a room was found and I was advised that I had actually been upgraded into a room that had just had the carpets cleaned. What became apparent was that they had just been cleaned. So recently in fact the carpet was still damp to the touch and made my socks wet. To offset the slightly damp smell they had sprayed a deadly amount of air freshener on top of whatever they used on the carpet. it was late and I had early meetings so there was no point in arguing, however the next morning suffice to say after breathing in so many chemicals all night I had an awful headache that went on for days and breathing difficulties. The staff had been in there and knew that it was sprayed to the high heavens to mask the smell so if I mentioning it would be pointless because unless they had no sense of smell they knew already. It hit you like a bus when you walked in. Had it been left unoccupied as intended it would have been fine after drying out for happy habitation. I am also quite sure that had there been another option that they would not have done it, so there was no point in complaining that late at night. But it certainly impacted my enthusiasm for staying there again. I am not particularly sensitive or a complainer, so the fact that I mention it even means it was really not good . If you have breathing issues or sensitivity to chemicals don’t remain stoic and take the room if offered – I am sure there was an alternative solution if you made an issue of it. I note the hotel does read these based on their responses so my suggestion to you is that if you are tempted to offer a room like this to people again to just not.  In summary, standard Novotel experience in terms of room, service, and services. Would I stay there again, maybe if I was part of a traveling group or got a good deal through Accor. Would I book again during parliament week, probably not. Does everyone else still love it and book there every time they travel? Absolutely.~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan~3~nan
review_470743297~“Comfy bed, nice suite!”~very nice bedding and well presented suite! Slight noise from nearby main road, but otherwise, very comfortable and quiet! hard to fault, only minor issue is that it's chauffeur parking only, which costs on a per-night basis.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_470539411~“Night in Canberra”~Rooms ok , the service at the restaurant sluggish, despite only few people awaiting for meals.

review_470194435~“Extremely Ordinary and Disappointing ”~We were very excited about our 2 night break in Canberra, and being Accor Advantage Plus members, we were hoping for a high level of service. Unfortunately, Novotel Canberra really let us down.  On arrival, I waited on the Accor Plus Member carpet (Accor members are supposed to receive special treatment) to check in. I waited while other customers - not Accor members - were attended to before me. On check in, my Accor Welcome pack was not ready. The whole point of online checking is that your key etc is all waiting for you on arrival. Not so.  Then, our key did not work, and we had to go down and have it recoded.  Our phone did not work. I went down to reception and asked this be attended to. I was assured this would be attended to immediately. When we returned from dinner, the phone had been moved to another outlet. But still did not work. I phoned reception on my mobile, asking this to be fixed. It was not.  The bathroom had mould in the shower.  The carpet was dirty. So much so that I phoned - on my mobile as the phone still was not working- to ask for slippers. A toothbrush arrived. Again, I phoned on my mobile for slippers which did come eventually. The halls were extremely tired and dated. The carpet needs a really good vacuum and shampoo. The walls and doors are all scuffed.  The room was not soundproof and being on the the same floor as the pool, we heard people moving frequently up and down the corridor.  On our first day, we returned to our room at 1pm, and the room had not been serviced. The phone was still not working.  On check out today, I mentioned that the phone was still not working. I was told they would get onto it right away. I did point out that this didn't really help me for my stay.  The staff were Ok, the beds were ok.  Not recommended and I will not be back. This stay has also decided me not to bother being an Accor member anymore. It's not worth it.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470181957~“Pretty basic accomodation - not what I expected at all!”~The hotel seems old and dreary with very poor lighting and the strangest room configuration where the bathroom sink is actually in the bedroom area (not in the bathroom). No free wi-fi for guests; breakfast at the hotel restaurant was also a very poor standard, and room service meal was terrible. Overall I would rate this as a very basic hotel and would not choose to stay here again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469571387~“Ordinary”~This is a place to stay if you are in town for a one night business stay in a horrible location.  The staff couldn't be bothered to great us or tell us about the amazing things that were happening in another part of town and, quiet frankly, if you pitch up in a hotel lobby that has a designated area for VIP guests with a sign on the carpet, then you know it is going to be downhill from there. Sorry for the tortured Engrish, but it makes me cross just thinking about what sort of evil mind would have a VIP check in, complete with a little rope. So funny. Shades of Fawlty Towers.  Expect to meet up with the same unhelpful, sighing, reception staff several times to let you into the room because the electronic key system doesn't work.  The room service food is cold, not surprisingly because it has taken an hour and a half to get to you. For the same price you could go to a really nice restaurant - that is if you wanted to venture out into the concrete downtown horrible boringness that you have landed in. Canberra may be a great place to live in the suburbs, but pretty awful to visit, unless you stay near to parliament at the Hyatt or up that way which is lovely and not that much more in dollars.  The pool is also cold, so don't even venture through the miles of horrible stained carpet to get there.  The mattress was soggy soft - and I like a soft mattress but I can tell the difference between soft and cheap. Having said all that the lovely young lady who was on duty at checkout was a delight.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469471919~“Canberra stay 17 - 19 march”~This is meant in a kindly way... We arrived to the check-in on 17/03 met by a too friendly girl gabbling in a dirty uniform. the dress and the blazer, given a disable room (we are not disabled nor did we request one) that had seen better days (room 303) rang about this no call back rang again told to go to reception. The man was helpful and changed the room to 728 we asked for our dinner reservation (which I had made at the time of booking the hotel) to be changed from 7:30 60 6:30 assured us this would happen. Went to room much better, went to dinner no reservation for either 6:30 or 7:30, but a table available. ordered. waiter brought drink served on, spilt the other everywhere, started mopping we left and went to another table, much to his surprise. Brought more dink telling us they were on the house. had meal went to pay spilt drinks on bill. Asked to check tomorrow dinner reservation and Angus made a note of it and time. Checked breakfast discount as well. Went to breakfast all OK came back to dinner that night no reservation. A bit of a comedy of errors. All perfectly friendly and apologetic, but a bit Fawlty Towers. Would I stay again not sure? Room good but service distinctly needs training. Food good in restaurant, but service a bit of a comedy.....Will talk about it with friends as a Fawlty Towers weekend in Canberra. Also wonder if the vacuum cleaner is still in the corridor on 7th floor?~2~2~5~4~2~3~2~nan

Reception on arrival was pleasant, welcoming, and efficient. The lobby is modern and cheery. I had a King balcony room that was very comfortable and well appointed. Room service menu is severely limited after 9:30pm as is restaurant service which is a shame. Breakfast area is pleasant and breakfast range is nice.

review_466653344~“Yeah, no. Keep looking.”~Sad, tired, dated - the list could go on. This property needs a BIG update and soon. I stayed for two nights and really didn't enjoy it at all. Reception and reception staff were below par, the restaurant and bar looked like a better option to the tired room, but, well, looks truly can be deceiving. And $16 for a thimble sized margarita didn't help my mood. From the thick dust in the air bathroom exhaust tot he chipped furniture. Ick. No, seriously, don't get caught as I did with no alternatives to run to. Book early - somewhere else.~2~1~nan~nan~1~nan~2~nan

review_466210561~“Good location”~Stayed at the Novotel Canberra for one night. Great location, close to the Civic Centre shopping and food places. To the National Gallery of Australia, Library, Questacon, etc. Also if coming by Murray's buses from Sydney, the depot is just behind the hotel. The room was clean and spacious. We had two single beds which were comfortable. Tea and coffee making facilities. Wi-fi was free. Bathroom was also clean. There is a good sized (for hotels) swimming pool with big windows which makes it seem airy and you're not swamped by the chlorine smell. A good spa. There's also a sauna. There was a good selection of cold and hot food for breakfast with the hot food well prepared.  All the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. Parking at the hotel is $20/day. It was a pleasant stay and I would happily stay there again. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466171923~“'Accidental visit'”~I was recently involved in a serious, car accident a few metres away from the Novotel Hotel.  Fortunately no-one was injured but I was alone, shaken, emotionally drained and about to have a breakdown.  I noticed the hotel across the road and with the help of a Good Samaritan I entered the hotel.  That Good Samaritan informed the manager that I had just been in a car accident and to look after me.  The staff of the Novotel were absolutely amazing, from the manager who I later found out had given me one of his best rooms, but didn't charge me full price, to the bell boy who took all my belongings to the room, helped me in, told me to let him know if I needed anything to Jai, one of the employees who brought me some fruit and juice.  When my husband arrived that evening the staff parked his car and gave him toiletries.  In the morning I found a trolley outside my room to help me with my belongings.  Two days later I received a phone call from the manager to see how I was coping and offering to personally look after me next time I stayed at the hotel.  This car accident was an absolute ordeal and I am still dealing with the emotional impact but I have nothing but the outmost praise and deepest gratitude to the employees of the Novotel Hotel!!  I highly recommend Novotel at Northbourne Avenue, Canberra as the staff are compassionate, attentive and very generous!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

There was no vanity in the bathroom, which meant that I had to shave in the small vanity area situated just outside the bathroom. It was very cluttered.

review_465161989~“If you have to be in Canberra for work.....”~This hotel is a little over 1km from the Convention Centre, should that be your destination, or other places in that area (theatre centre, casino etc), and just around the corner from the Canberra Centre and the surrounding restaurants and shops. The staff were very professional and helpful. The rooms ok, but not great, and I found the rather soft bed 'grounding out' (as in I was meeting the under frame) when rolling over. Somewhat pokey bathroom. So location good, staff good, comfort and rooms poor (for the price ~Su$200+). Breakfast was nothing to write home about either.~3~2~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan

The rooms are OK, staff are friendly, the location is central. No view on this occasion the room looked over the exit of the bus terminal but I wasn't there for long. It isn't luxurious but in times of high demand in Canberra hotel prices can be extortionate. On this stay the Novotel was a solid choice and half the price of other comparable options for this period.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_464037815~“Snooty reception, but the dining room staff are lovely”~The dining room staff are lovely, the housekeeping are friendly, but the reception area.....! We chose Novotel as a change from our regular choice and were prepared for a price difference, however we were not aware that when parliament sits the regular rooms suddenly become 'Executive Suites' and the price doubles (apparently it's the fold-out lounge that does it) be prepared for a withering stare from reception when you express surprise over this (apparently prices vary 'all the time'). Asking about a guest laundry also marks you as a lesser standard of guest (our receptionist informed us that there was a <pointed pause> 'public laundromat up the avenue further'). Oh, and there is an extra charge for parking your car. The Valet will take your keys (but not your luggage!) on any day other than Thursday. If you need you car on Thursday you're on your own. Your keys have gone to reception and you have to go back up to reception and humbly beg them to relinquish them (which they didn't think to do when you checked out) and then work out where the valets parked you car the night before (use your remote locking device for this). Apart from this it was a clean centrally located motel offering the same as other motels in Canberra that we have used.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~3~nan
review_463925981~“Staying at the Novotel ”~I've stayed at the Novotel several times now and it's always a safe bet - comfortable, clean and central. It's not exactly cheap, but that's Canberra! The breakfast buffet is good value for money, particularly if booked ahead of time. The only real issue for me is the taxi rank outside of the hotel; on occasions, I've waited over 30 minutes for a taxi, even after explicitly booking one. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463912653~“Novotel Canberra”~Excellent friendly staff. However I would not stay here again and certainly not accept upgrade to level 6 or 7 where the bathroom facilities have been compromised to offer a balcony. The "bathroom" only toilet and shower, no wash basin or mirror...which are facing the bed and you are expected to wash your hands and use the same water for coffee. Meanwhile the coffee, tea etc is in the wardrobe where you are expected to hang your clothes. No small table to sit together and enjoy a wine etc and only one upright chair. The key cards for entry work sometimes and several clients had problems with the keys and lift operation. The car park is a nightmare so valet attendants assist. Next stay in Canberra I will look elsewhere.~3~3~4~3~2~4~5~nan
review_463361260~“This is more a motel rather than hotel to me”~Not a place I would choose but travelling with a group of 12 and they prefer to stay at a place within their budget. Lengthy wait for check in there were 2 staffs at the reception when I arrived and both were serving the one guest. After waiting for about 10 minutes, third staff came to serve.  I chose the 'top of the range' room but it was still very old and dated. I opened the blinds and had the view of two overflowing commercial waste collection bins. I found a used shampoo tube on the shelf next to the bath tub. The hair dryer was the old style one when it gets too hot, the dryer won't start up until it cools down. What's worse was there was a huge safety test sticker on it with an expiry date of 7 Dec 2016, nearly 3 months expired and it hasn't been picked up. This is a concern. Photos on website look nicer than actual it was a little deceptive.  Breakfast on level 1 was OK. Will not be back~2~nan~nan~2~nan~2~3~nan

The hotel is convenient for local buses and adjacent to the major shopping and business district. We enjoy staying here and will return.~4~3~5~4~4~3~4~nan
review_461586086~“Fifth visit. Good location, comfortable but in need of a refurbishment.”~Stayed for 2 nights in January and were upgraded (thank you) to a suite on the 7th floor. There are 3 elevators - keycard operated - that also go down to the basement car park. Our suite was quite large but sparsely furnished and not greatly designed. The front door opened up straight ahead onto a small corridor which lead through to the lounge room or, you could go immediately to the left, where there was a "European Bathroom" i.e. the hand basin and mirror, which were separate from - doorway in between - the main bathroom. There were 3 chairs lined up, as if they were being stored, against the corridor wall.  The lounge room ran the length of the room and fronted Northbourne Avenue. It had a TV up one end of the room with a desk, swivel chair and small return, whilst, up the other end, which seemed a mile away, was a two-seater lounge. In the middle of the lounge room was a tiny coffee table. The bedroom was accessed from the lounge room or the bathroom, i.e. it was between the 2 rooms. This meant that you didn't hear any noise from the road but also that the air conditioning was poor as the A/C unit was located in the corridor and there was a wall between it and the bedroom. The bedroom had a king-sized bed (very comfortable) and bedside tables with wall mounted lamps. Lighting overall was good. There was also a wall mounted TV in the bedroom and under it a wall-mounted locked wooden mystery box that contained - who knows? In the bathroom proper there was a bath with shower in it (pressure was poor) and the toilet. The floor of the bathroom was raised above the level of both the bedroom and the area where the hand basin was located such that you had to be careful not to kick your toes. Whilst the room was clean the carpet, in the lounge, bedroom and corridor areas, and especially in the hallway between all the rooms on the 7th floor was badly scuffed and marked. Breakfast buffet was very good with an excellent mix of both hot and cold food. Staff at reception at both check-in and check-out and at breakfast were friendly and efficient however one of the night managers in response to our question as to what Sydney Sunday papers were available - Sun Herald or Sunday Telegraph - answered the Sydney daily - 3 times.  Car parking was available at $20 per night. You left your keys with the parking staff who moved your car around depending upon when you needed it. Location is excellent - close to the Civic shopping precinct, the Braddon restaurant precinct and a couple of kilometres from the Art Gallery and Parliament House.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_461130994~“Friendly service but dated”~We stayed in the Novotel Canberra Friendly service but the hallway was disgusting all the fluff.Very convenient to sightseeing, restaurants & shopping because it was near the bus station. The bathroom was stranger a toilet & shower but the sink was near the bed! I do not think it was a 4 star hotel. We had a balcony but the table was rusty.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_460244086~“Friendly service. Nice hotel. A little dated.”~Stayed at the Novotel Canberra again for work. Service has improved significantly since I was last here.

Close to restaurants, bars and the mall.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_459626132~“Great food, poor service”~I had arrived by bus from Sydney and only had a short time to eat between catching the next bus home. As an Accor staff member i decided to eat at the bar at the Novotel, it took 4 employees to work the very easy and simplistic "Micros" operating system, and after about 10 mins or so for me to repeat my order over and over. My meal was lovely which was the fish and chips and for dessert the pavlova and the wifi was pretty good considering it was complimentary.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

Nice indoor pool, & spa & well equipped gym. Restaurant pleasant with take away coffee available. Had room service & the club sandwich was very tasty & the fries hot & crispy.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_458829008~“Comfortable and Considerate”~We enjoyed 4 days as guests of Novotel Canberra. They were very considerate of our special needs and rang us the day before arrival to ascertain that the allocated room was most suitable (My wife does have a disability). A minor defect in the room was repaired very prompltly after we reported it.~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_458815728~“Couldn't be happier with helpful staff”~I booked this hotel from 7-11 February and on arrival they couldn't find my reservation. However, eventually it was found but it wasn't what I thought I had booked: I had mistakenly booked the hotel fir 2018! To make matters worse, I booked it non-refundable.  Because it was the first week of the new parliamentary term, there was no availability in nearly every hotel in central Canberra for four nights. However, they got me a room for the first night and last two , as well as arranging for me to stay in a serviced apartment for the other night. In addition, they kept my case until I returned. To cap off their service, they helped me to get a full refund from Expedia. Thanks to all the staff but especially Lauran! With Novotel, you have a good idea what you are getting as they are often fairly standardised. This one is towards the upper end of Novotels. I had breakfast two mornings and there was a good selection of fresh fruit, breads, hot breakfast and pancakes.  Overall, I'd definitely stay here if in Canberra again ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458784896~“Great Location - Great Hotel”~Located on the Civic end of Northbourne Avenue the Novotel is perfectly located with an easy walk to restaurants, shops, supermarkets, pubs and bars. Rooms are well appointed (some have kitchenettes), spacious, clean and comfortable. Staff are friendly and efficient and check-in is always quick and hassle free. For business purposes, all the usual emenities are provided and its central location makes it a perfect hotel to stay and relax after work. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458435001~“Hands down the staff are the winners”~My husband and I recently stayed at the Novotel Canberra when we needed to attend a function in the city. We had booked a room and breakfast package which was great value for money. The best part about our stay was the attentive and friendly staff. Whether it was the check in or check out staff, breakfast or dinner crew or Jay who delivered a bottle of wine to our room, everyone was so pleasant and accommodating. The staff at this hotel went above and beyond in many ways and were always so pleasant and willing to help. One thing that struck me, all the staff were always smiling.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_458085246~“Ok, renovations currently underway ”~Stayed here overnight and was unaware the hotel was currently undergoing renovations. (Not mentioned on website when booking) Noise stops at 5 but late checkout was not the relaxing morning I had expected. Very comfortable bed, clean room. Worth noting power points are fitted very low down into the skirting board so phone charger had to be plugged into the bathroom charger as the plug didn't have enough room between point and floor to fit. Buffet breakfast had reasonable variety.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457456859~“BEST LOCATION! ”~The Novotel Canberra is in the perfect location in canberra right in the middle of the CBD. Check in was fast and easy!

Breakfast was a bit pricey but it was pretty good, there was a large variety!  Overall absolutely loved this stay! We will definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457441332~“Good location, pool and gym”~I recently had a three night stay at the Novotel while attending a conference. I chose to stay here because of its convenient location to everything and also because it was one of the few that had a pool as well as a gym. The pool was really good and it was big enough to do laps and gym had plenty of equipment. When I first arrived I was given a room on level 2 which was fine but it was meant for a disabled person which I found unusual and thought could have been a mistake considering I wasn't and was staying for three nights. The staff were more than accomodating however when I asked to change rooms and I was put on level 7 so was very happy. So my suggestion would be to check what sort of room you are being given and perhaps request one on a higher floor. The second floor also has the gym and pool so tends to have quite a bit of traffic. I ordered room service once and I must highly recommend the chicken salad it was fantastic! Overall staff extremely friendly, breakfast buffet was pretty good and it was a very nice stay.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456793296~“ACCOMMODATION BAD. STAFF GREAT....”~We visited Canberra to attend the Versailles Exhibition at the National Gallery. Bought a package deal with Novotel.... Good value I must say. 3 days before our stay I called Novotel to politely request a quiet room as my son is unable to sleep with aircon on and needs external ventilation.. the young lady obliged and told me we were on the 7th floor. On check in a more senior and officious woman came and took over from the lovely young woman and seemed to make change on the computer. Were given a room over the bin bay and entrance to underground car park . Noises from trucks probably garbage, bins opening/closing, constant activity below our room even tho we were on the 6th floor. Very little sleep had by any of us. Room so darn tiny. Corridor carpets looked filthy on every floor. Oh and the car park..... tiniest car spaces so difficult to manoeuvre that even the parking valets have trouble. I found a small white scrape and paint chipped on my passenger rear door and rim. Probably from the white concrete pillar my car was next to. Definitely wasn't there before our stay and not found until we arrived home later that day. I didn't bother reporting it to them as i will just never go back.~2~4~nan~1~nan~nan~4~nan

review_456080076~“Dislike valet parking”~Only stayed one night, carpets look like they need replacing on at least two floors, staff were lovely, breakfast was fine - I didnt like the valet parking, carpark is tiny & some cars are double stacked indicating the need to shift your vehicle multiple times - we would stay elsewhere next time just because of this! Also, there was no freezer compartment in the fridge.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455822123~“Good location, friendly staff, but poor housekeeping.”~We stayed there for 4 nights in January. Location is great. Dining facilities Ok. Breakfast Ok. Bar service poor. Checkout slow. Housekeeping appalling: Night 1: No hand towels or bath mat supplied. Night 2: Cups not washed and toiletries not replenished. Night 3: Toilet paper not replaced. Night 4: They completely missed servicing our room. All items were rectified quickly when we complained, but seriously?~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_455499608~“Reception may need more training”~We had a booking made by the company, arrived on Sunday afternoon to the rather quiet Reception, a male staff manning the priority check-in counter signalled that he could help us and we gave him the booking name. The only two lines of conversation we had after were the time he asked how long we were staying and he needed a credit card for the holding deposit. That was it, we were handed our room key. He didn't tell us what facilities there is at the property or anything about parking, so we asked where we could park our car, he then provided a brief direction to the carpark. We further reconfirmed if there is any cost and then he advised there is $20 overnight which was fine, but at check-out we found out that it was covered by the company. I feel the staff that checked us in needed more training, he should do a standard run through on the basic of the booking and the facilities the property has. And he perhaps could put a bit of smile on his face to 'welcome' the guests. We stayed at other properties in Canberra and find this is being one of the 'bad' check-in experience.  All in all, the room was rather ordinary, just a standard hotel room. Parking is really challenging. There are very few parking spots around the property. The hotel carpark is rather small and the parking spaces are extremely narrow.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~2~nan
review_455489339~“Great hotel with kids/toddlers ”~We moved here for 2 nights after a bit so good stay at the Pinnacle. This place was lovely. Had a bit of a hiccup with check in, Michael couldn't do enough for us to make everything right again. We had 2 adjoining rooms, which were very clean, block out curtains were good and beds really comfortable. The food was great! The breakfast was lovely, they had Ikea high chairs which were clean. Everyone smiled and were genuinely lovely. We had a great dinner in the bar area, where Sophie couldn't do enough for us. The kids really liked the food as did we. Beers on tap were great as was happy hour. We loved the pool as well! Room service and house keeping were excellent and speedy. Would stay here again. Feel free to ask any other questions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455302856~“Not the usual Novotel standard...”~Not a bad location, but disorganised staff and really small rooms!! We had booked a king room with balcony, the balcony was not worth the reduction in room size. As a gold accor member you are entitled to an upgrade when available, when I asked if there was an upgrade available the response was "yes but it's a 1 bedroom suite that has a kitchen, you don't need that, you're only here 1 night. We've given you one of our best rooms" (627) if that was one of the best rooms I'd hate to see the bad ones!! The bathroom was in the foyer!! Shower and toilet behind a door and vanity in the foyer!! ridiculous!! We were there for the Versailles exhibit at the gallery and the fantastic restaurants in Canberra so we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, if we were there longer I would have changed rooms for sure. As a female it's too hard to do your hair and make up in the foyer of your room! At check in we were supposed to collect our Versailles package tickets - they weren't available, although I did the online check in 2 days earlier! It is a small tote with a guide and tickets inside, surely they could be behind the desk! The staff had to run upstairs and find one...Then I was given the wrong room number, went upstairs to find my key did not work, had to come back downstairs and find out what the right room number is!! The conclusion I came to was - Canberra really needs a Sofitel!!~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_455302814~“Great location and fantastic staff”~We stayed at the Novotel Canberra and celebrated Australia Day in our nations capital and we highly commend the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. The restaurant supervisor/manager and the breakfast team in particular were fantastic, approachable and super under pressure. Our room was comfortable although a tad small for 4 of us so next time we would choose a double room. The location is perfect as we walked almost everywhere - perfect for shopping, casino, Commonwealth park, national library, Questacon etc etc. We will stay at the Novotel again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455100727~“Family friendly ”~We stayed just one night. The staff were all very professional and friendly. The indoor heated pool and spa was a hit with not only my son, but quite a few other children staying at the hotel. Dinner was lovely. There was entertainment, which was very good (easy listening music). The design of the restaurant was also nice. Breakfast was equally as good. They make eggs anyway to order and barista made coffee if you desire, at no extra charge. Yay! The location was great, a stones throw from good shopping and trendy cafes. We enjoyed our stay. We also went to Questacon and Versailles: Treasures from the palace, reviews to follow.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_454445002~“Excellent location”~I stayed here overnight while I was in Canberra to visit some exhibitions. The location on Northbourne Avenue is central and very close to many of Canberra's big attractions. Lake Burley Griffin, Parliament House, the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the High Court and the National Museum are all less than 5 km from the hotel. I travelled with a friend who is an Accor member. This entitled us to a free drink each and a 50% discount on dinner and breakfast which made the meals excellent value. Dinner in Arbre Restaurant was delicious. If you are not an Accor member, it may be a little pricey so you might want to investigate the many restaurants and cafes across the road. Breakfast was the standard hotel breakfast: cereals, toast, hot dishes, fruit, tea and coffee. I stayed in a standard queen room. The room size was adequate for 1-2 people and the bed was very comfortable. While the room was quite clean, a deep clean is needed. The pool area was crowded with children (it was the school holidays) but is very nice and includes a gym, sauna and spa and plenty of pool towels. Service at the hotel could be slow at times but was always friendly and helpful. Overall, the location of the Novotel Canberra and friendly staff are the main benefits of this hotel.~4~nan~nan~5~3~nan~4~nan

review_453885390~“Lauran - Exceptional Customer Service!”~I am a regular business traveller but this was only my second stay at the Novotel Canberra. While the location is great and the rooms are comfortable, it is the customer service that will keep me going back.  I checked into the hotel last week after a long stressful day, and I was greeted by Lauran at reception who was efficient and personable. I shared that the day had not been a good one during the check-in process, and after getting to my room and unpacking, there was a knock on the door - Lauran, with a bottle of wine and a smile, hoping the gesture would see a better end to the day. A very pleasant surprise and a wonderful reminder that there are those out there willing to go above and beyond for their customers. The live music in the bar was also a definite plus. I intend on returning to the hotel, and I continue to share this story with friends and family. Thank you Lauran!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

Everything worked properly and I did not have to fix or adjust any of the bathroom fixtures as has been the case in many other hotels we have stayed in around the world. The buffet breakfast could be improved and the dining room manager did not seem to be able to keep up with the supply of hot foods particularly the scrambled eggs. The tables were not cleared of dirty dishes in a timely manner. We cannot comment on the dining room at night as we never ate dinner there, The menu was not very appealing and there are a number of excellent restaurants withing a few minutes walk from the hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan

I have stayed previously on a few occasions and choose this facility because of its locality, service and faciliities. My fiend and I enjoyed the pool, sauna and food and beverage facilities and the room was excellent and very comfortable. The hotel is family friendly which is wonderful, however, I felt that the children being allowed everywhere in the hotel partially spoilt the experience, particularly for people wanting a quiet and relaxing weekend away from children.

review_452764544~“5 star staff”~We usually stay while in Canberra but haven't been for about 6 years, this trip was a typical novated experience but he highlight was the staff and excellent customer service, I'd turned up one week early, first time ever but my huge error was fixed by the lovey lady who checked us in, as we'd booked through the Accor site she changed our booking for us, no fuss!!!!!! The lowlight was a leaking bathroom seeping in to the bedroom in. Room 326, once we noticed within 5 minutes someone checked it out and issued keys to a new room, again no fuss. So while the hotel is ageing a bit and there were problems the staff were amazing, best customer service I've ever had in this country. Location was good for civic, however lots of people begging and approaching for money. We ate at Hellenic club.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~3~5~nan
review_452244008~“Not really up to standard ”~I would say I am normally a really fair reviewer on Trip Advisor, so I don't take it lightly to give such a bad review. I can't rate anything at this hotel as being great. The indoor pool is ok but even on a 37 degree day it was freezing cold. The check in staff tried but really lacked in providing a friendly welcome. The hallway on our floor had an odd smell (for 3 days). The "suite" was ok but was poorly designed. You start putting these things all together and you just feel a bit let down. The things that were really disappointing: - the bathroom was so tiny. The shower head was not adjustable so the water hit my chest not my head. The bath was so narrow my feet were on an angle to stand in the shower. The glass screen was not wide enough so excess water ended up on the floor. The shelf in the cupboard under the sink was broken so you couldn't store anything there. There was no bench space to store your toiletries. - the room was not properly cleaned, we found pens on the floor and old blueberries.  - the fold out bed was saggy and had missing springs. - The TV is in the sitting area was off centred so if you sat on the couch part of it was behind a wall. - the layout of the room was so odd. Half of you sqm's were used in a hall way and an odd sink with wasted space. So overall the room did not meet any expectations of being a "suite" that I paid extra money for! My suggestion if you choose to stay here (for price, location or loyalty program reasons) to stay in a standard room and then you might not be as disappointed for spending a larger amount of money. The biggest disappointment of the entire stay was the car parking. So yes it does cost money, which is understandable, but it is the dodgiest parking you have ever seen. They have too many parks squashed in, if they lost a few then it would be heaps easier for people to get in and out. The pipes etc hanging down are so low in some parts you can't open the back of your car (if you have a wagon or SUV) fully. To get out or into a car park you need to take 20 swings as there is not enough room. We saw a person pull out of their park and because there wasn't enough swing room nor were the parks long enough (so most cars had to hang out a few cm's) they clipped the front of another park. Then to top it off the boom gates never worked with the tickets we were given to get in and out! So if you don't need to have a car here, that's another positive!!! Overall I think the hotel needs a handful of changes/focus to make it a more comfortable, pleasant place to stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_451787576~“Perfect location for a visit to Canberra.”~We spent 3 nights at this centrally located hotel. It was a very pleasant experience it being close to all public transport and therefore all locations were easily reached. Our room was on the 5th floor and was pleasantly furnished and decorated. Staff were friendly and efficient. Breakfast was really good and as my husband said, "even the knives are sharp". What more can you ask for? Perhaps though consideration could be given to do the housekeeping for guests who are staying longer a little earlier. It was very hot during our stay and it was a little disappointing to find our room had not been replenished etc., on the second day by the time we returned after 3.00PM. We found the housekeeping staff and the matter was rectified there and then. I guess it was just a matter of asking nicely.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan

After 15 minutes in the room, couldn't handle to constant slamming of the pool door and other doors on 2nd floor so asked to be moved. Was moved to 5th floor which was much quieter - even the doors close quieter. There we enjoyed our 2 day stay. Easy walking distance to everything.  Asked for the car to be available at 6am but not sure what happened and we had to wait for cars to be swapped around as it was jammed in pretty hard.Needed to climb over passenger seat as the drivers door couldn't open. Not sure if the valet parkers did the same thing in my car ?? Restaurant was nice - quiet - waiter staff were great.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_450347460~“Good city centre location”~Stayed for 3 nights in a Balcony room at this City hotel. It is well positioned for both business and tourist travellers, carpark is a bit of a disaster but otherwise a good enough. We stayed over New Year, obviously off-season for Canberra as the rates were reasonable. Never used the restaurant except for a morning coffee, very friendly staff and great service. Reception guys were a bit average...Accor membership took me to the counter where I got the guest whisperer, even though I said I was a bit deaf he still spoke so softly that I could not understand half of what he said! It is weird that a business hotel like this charges for any sort of decent WIFI connection, if its free at Macca's where you spend $10 it should free at your hotel where you're spending hundreds? Hotel is close to bus stops including the Red Bus tourist service which does the rounds of the sites to see.~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
