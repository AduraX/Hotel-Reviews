review_477894755~“Basic but fine”~The hotel is basic but clean and perfectly acceptable for our needs. Staying at the hotel also gave us free membership to the RSL next door (Tradies) which gave us discounted meals and access to the draw. I'd be happy to stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477271255~“Quick check in late at night”~Booked and checked in easy after car trouble needing emergency accommodation at 10pm. Staff were friendly and helpful. Motel was quiet and clean. A refurbishment would make a big difference but pleasant enough as it is.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_475925747~“Great value, easy to access”~Stayed here for NRL match at GIO stadium. Only 10mins away.  Basic motel but huge rooms, comfortable beds and great showers. Internal access to Tradies RSL club which is very handy. Extremely good value for the price. Will absolutely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475409766~“Large rooms, very clean, great food and close to all amenities”~We stayed here as part of a group tour of Canberra's attractions. Couldn't fault the accommodation and the staff were friendly and very helpful. Bonus membership to the adjoining Tradies Club is also offered to all patrons and the hotel is located right in the middle of a restaurant area if you are looking to dine out.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_475364285~“Clean rooms with good location but could be better”~It's a good hotel located near to all amenities but was disappointed with preauthorisation of $50 at the time of check-in. I don't like preauthorisations as it sends the wrong message of mistrust to the customers. There is no swimming pool at this hotel if you are travelling with kids you might be able to find a better one in the same price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474794072~“overpriced”~When your room is right next to building site and you are being awaken by hammers and loud noises before 0700 in the morning, the hotel should charge you less. If you mention this to the receptionist and she does nothing about it-it is also unprofessional. All this, on top of a place which is actually a motel that calls itself a hotel. Not good~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_474405374~“Good value hotel for business or pleasure”~My husband booked this as all our preferred accommodation was not available.  Inner north location at Dickson makes this a suitable venue for anyone wishing to access local restaurants, and proximity to Northbourne & Limestone Avenues makes all the attractions of Canberra easy to get to. Room on 3rd floor was quiet, well-appointed and had plenty of room. Comfy bed, large TV, microwave, iron & ironing board. Adequate service by house-keeping.  I would stay there again, now I have learnt the drill with access to the underground car park.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473112644~“Nice meal”~On a bus tour we stopped at the Tradies club for lunch two choices 1 restaurant and the bistro. Restaurant was very busy so went to bistro for a light meal we had nachos and toasted rap both were good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471703230~“Handy to Shops and Restaurants”~I've stayed here every time I'm in Canberra. It is very close to shops, restaurants, bars, supermarket. The hotel is as usual quiet, clean and comfortable. Staff are always very attentive and eager to help. Will definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470162291~“Dinner at the Tradies”~Having had family in Canberra for many years we always dine at the Tradies at least once per visit. This is a very popular restaurant and is always crowded. The variety of food on the menu and the servings are large. A great place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469999692~“Dickson Delight”~We stayed in a large pleasant room with doors to a balcony situated on the second floor. The king size bed was extremely comfortable with excellent quality bed linen and bath towels. Currently there is a large construction site next door but we did not experience any disruptive noise. The hotel is walking distance to all take aways and restaurants, especially asian. Our only concern was the shower head was over the spa bath which is awkward for older people. Parking is a little tight. We ate at the hotel's bistro called "Essence" and found it to be affordable and efficient. The servings are large and can recommend the lamb shanks and rib eye steak, very good pub food. The hotel is situated within easy driving access to all of Canberra's attractions.. Would definitely stay again.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468458301~“A comfortable stay close to great lovely eats”~Our standard queen room was upstairs and at the back of the building, was nice and clean, quiet and comfortable. There's a lift from reception and the car park. Its a good area with several different restaurants within an easy walk. You'll need transport to get to the city centre and the Canberra attractions. Recommend a stay here.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_467944794~“Spacious, quality and convenient - hard to beat”~This hotel continues to be our go to stay place for Canberra. Convenient in location (near shops, restaurants and facilities) whether you are driving or flying into Canberra for a short or long stay. The rooms are very very clean, spacious and are equipped with many facilities such as microwave, kettle, frig and a proper single kitchen sink making it a great place to self cater with local takeout meals. Also the full Tradies Club facilities, bars, cafe/restaurant plus the wonderful array of other nearby shops, full Woolworths supermarket make this ideal for any type of traveller. Also a well know spot for getting into city centre by taxi or public transport nearly at the door or if you are driving. Staff are friendly the rooms maintained to a very high standard and very clean and updated. Again on our umpeenth visit it does not fail us. Well done and we will be back.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467078379~“Clean, comfortable, convenient.”~I have stayed at Quality Hotel Dickson a few times now and it lives up to its name, Quality . The beds are comfortable. Very clean.  Bathrooms are up to date and roomy. Convenient location with shopping centre within walking distance and plenty of restaurant's/ fast food outlets within walking distance.  The Quality Hotel is within the Tradies facility and everything is at your finger tips. There's even a barber if you need one.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462160085~“4-star accommodation at reasonable cost”~I stayed at this Motel for a few days while in Canberra. The room I occupied was large, bright, very clean, with a fully equipped kitchenette. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I was given a free membership to the Tradies Club next door which allowed me to get discounted meals at the bistro. Within short walking distance are at least a dozen restaurants, a medium size shopping centre with several cafes and and a Woolworths supermarket, and an Olympic size public swimming pool. To avoid the steep parking fees in Canberra, I left the car at the motel and caught a bus at Northbourne Avenue, the main thoroughfare, for a short and quick trip to the Canberra CBD. I will definitely consider staying there again because of the excellent value of the accommodation and the fantastic location.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_459536518~“Enjoyable Stay”~We stayed on the weekend of 28/1/17. We had intended to stay at the Pavilion but after reading the reviews on this site about their poor air-conditioning, we decided to book the Quality Hotel and pay a little more. So glad we did and it was worth it. The air-conditioning worked a treat and we stayed cool during the hot nights. The service is friendly and professional and the rooms are big and very clean. I had previously stayed at the Lyneham Motel Inn where the rooms were very unclean. They are owned by the Tradies Club and you get free membership of club if you are guest so it was fun having a late night drink and you only have to walk up to your room. Although the hotel is part of the club, our room was very quiet. Definitely a value for money hotel.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_456252492~“Well positioned”~A regular to the hotel it is well positioned to the Dickson Restaurant quarter within walking distance. Clean comfortable rooms, most with a balcony and spa bath. Don't expect the Hyatt, but friendly staff with ample parking. Be mindful that building is going on next door during the day but very peaceful in the evenings.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455739825~“Good value”~Was in Canberra for weekend. Found Hotel easily all staff friendly and welcoming. Rooms were nice and clean and spacious.

review_454592020~“Good Hotel”~I have always stayed at this Hotel in Canberra. Our checkin was late this time, but the Manager was wonderful & gave us a complimentary Breakfast. Rooms are comfy & close to Shops / Gym. Highly recommended Hotel in Canberra. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453649635~“Always good value ”~Well located northside of city in bussling restaurant area. Rooms and staff good and plentiful parking, easy access highway - it just represents great value for money. Would recommend heading across road to find breakfast though, where there is an excellent choice of cafés.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450335624~“Very impressed”~Stayed overnight recently, great customer service on the reception desk. Rooms large with everything you need, large bathroom with excellent shower.

review_445125567~“Fantastic Hotel”~I would put this hotel at the top of my list for the ACT. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean, as well as being well priced. There is free underground parking, free Wi-Fi and there is a club (The Tradies) right there beside the hotel. The food at the club is very reasonably priced and of good quality and the entertainment is of good quality too. There are lots of other restaurants in the area, as well as supermarkets and service stations. We would not hesitate to book in to this hotel next time we are visiting Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443445511~“Good accommodation ”~During our daughter sport competition we stayed in this hotel. We choose is it because it has free parking and close to Australian institute of sports. When we arrived the outside interior of hotel didn't impressed me. Same feeling I had after conversation with unprofessional staff at reception. However I changed my opinion when we stepped in our room. It was good size room with nice balcony towards the park, well organised with two double size beds, nice modern style desk, table and other type of furniture, which contains iron, microwave, kettle and necessary dishes. Also has TV with complimentary movies channel. It was very clean and cleaned everyday, including Sunday. My little complain is about shower only, which doesn't have flexible hose, as most of Australian hotels. The hotel is part of Tradies Club , so hotel guests can receive club membership during their accommodation at hotel , for example to get discount at Blues cafe, which staff recommended for breakfast. Unfortunately reception staff doesn't inform guests regarding this membership issue. Actually this cafe has really small range of dishes and even to cook simple ones such an omelette, takes a lot of time. On the other hand this hotel has great location. Many different cuisine restaurants, wine shops and bars are around it. Also Woolworth" supermarket with liqueur department and even three different fuel stations are there.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443234630~“Looks drab but rooms are a decent quality”~From the outside this hotel doesn't look that flash. Even the reception area is underwhelming. My opinion changed when I went to my room. The room looks to have been updated and very spacious.  The hotel is linked to the Tradies Club and is also very close to multiple restaurants. For the price it is definitely a place I would stay again as it is easy access to most things in Canberra.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_442964678~“Quality in the Capital”~Walking distance to all your life-sustaining essentials; McDonalds, KFC, Subway and BWS. Balcony great for having a beverage while watching the hustle and bustle of Dickson town centre. Would stay here again on my next vacation to the capital.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_441683532~“dining experience”~We frequent the club often and take a meal there, but on most occasions the vegetables that you serve on the plate are raw certainly not soft as in steamed, more like stir fry raw, I have mentioned this often to the staff, who are very nice and attentive, but I think they fail to mention my complaint to the chef. I hope with this review you might do something about this.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_441007892~“Large ,comfortable room .”~We always stay at the Quality Hotel Dickson as it breaks up the drive from Albury back to Batemans Bay . Check in was easy and we were soon in our room on the 2nd floor. We had booked a Spa room as it is nice to relax in a Spa after a long drive . The rooms are quite large and it was pleasing to find the Air conditioning on in the room when we arrived . They have secure underground parking. Free Newspapers each day and Free Wifi.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_437716572~“Lights and airconditioning on when I arrived. Welcoming.”~I had a room on the 3rd floor but the only view was the sunshades over the atrium but apart from that the room and amenities were first class. The adjacent Tradies included a restaurant, coffee shop, lounges and the gaming hall (not used at all). Bed was very comfortable. The management might think about a better system when two busloads of delegates arrive at once to book in. The staff were very patient.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_437335455~“Last minute 2 night stay”~Stayed here on same weekend in November for the SCALE ACT Model Show for last 4 years. This year left it a bit late and couldn't get the 2 nights- all websites showed full. Called direct, got a room, very large with twin Queen doubles. Room is great space with private balcony, undercover secure parking and is part of the Tradies bar and grill. 60 seconds from room to first beer, and they have Kossies on tap - perfect all round actually. Located in the central eatery area in Dickson, short walks provides multiple eating places Breakfast in the cafeteria, made to order, and the best poached eggs-done perfectly. No buffet breakfast for these guys, cooked to order and fast. Price is reasonable, but booking well ahead guarantees a great price.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_433133478~“Review of Tradies Club Restaurant Only - Average”~$27 for a very ordinary chicken parma, ouch that hurts. It was real Chook thank goodness but the chips were cold and had been cooked for some time, the salad small and average and at these prices, I'd have expected a lot more. Service was good and drink prices a compensation though. Average.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_432286423~“Good Value Good Location”~The room was quite big and bed comfortable. Microwave, toaster also cutlery and bowls and plates if one wants to have their own light breakfast. We requested a room in the "quiet area" and it certainly was quiet. Close to amenities and shops which was good if you did not wish to have a meal at the "Tradies" every night. Would stay there again~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_428057756~“Solid Value”~A largish hotel room with free parking at a location surrounded by services and restaurants doesn't often come with a decent price tag, but Quality Hotel Dixon seems to be the exception. Feel wise, the Quality Hotel Dixon felt somewhere between a motel and a hotel (the food/gambling hotel sharing the facility adds to that notion). However, the rooms were better equipped than most hotels', with a microwave, a fridge and cutlery provided. Indeed, facilities wise the only thing we were missing was a room safe. The close proximity of dining hotel facilities meant our room wasn't as quiet as we were hoping it to be. Also missing was sunlight: the only window in our room faced the covered inner court; it doesn't sound like much but it does contribute to a rather depressing feeling. The fact you're spending your time at a cheaper room is evident by things like cleanliness (the previous guest had left us their razor - how generous!) and the hot water system's highly dependence on your neighbour's watering activities. However, I have been to 5 star hotels that charged me double the amount and failed to deliver half as much.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425936323~“shame about the construction site next door”~Great location with lots of fine restaurants and part of tradies in Dickson. Shame we were stuck next to the construction site which started banging and crashing at 7 am on a Saturday morning. Rooms vey nice comfy bed Room well appointed, one issue shower was a dribble in fact run around the shower to catch the drops. Bonus was the membership to tradies which we enjoyed a few night caps,would stay again but with construction site next door stay away from rooms 215 to 223 which makes you feel if you are part of the construction site o my goodness how bloody nosiy~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_420683671~“Great hotel, great location and friendly staff”~We stayed at the Quality Hotel Dickson for 3 nights, the hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful (a hat tip goes to Abby and Harry for going out of the way in providing assistance). Our room for 2 was large, very clean with a comfortable bed and big size bathroom. What you see in the photos is exactly what you get. The location of the hotel was fabulous as it is in the middle of the Dickson local shops and restaurants as well as the Tradies Club, where the food was very reasonably priced and good. Next time I'm in Canberra, I will definitely come back to the hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan

Parking was a breeze. Complimentary membership to the adjoining Tradies club gives you member discounts, free gym access, etc. The room we stayed in was clean, warm (it was snowing outside) and well equipped for a travelling family. Security key cards were reassuring and gave us easy to access to our room, car park and lifts. The staff were very friendly, professional and helpful.

review_397039357~“Spacious rooms in great location”~We were visiting relatives who live in a small unit with little space for guests. This hotel was a 10-15 minute walk to their home. The rooms was good sized with two queen beds, a round table with two arm chairs, and a desk with another chair. It was equipped with fridge, microwave, kettle (complimentary tea and coffee plus biscuits), iron, ironing board and hair dryer. The bathroom was also good sized and well provided for. An underground car park is provided for guests. It is close to the Dickson shops where there are cafes, restaurants, and a good selection of shops. The bus stop is a short walk away. The hotel is part of the Tradies group and temporary membership is available to hotel guests. A lovely wine bar in the hotel makes a nice place to wind down with a drink and small eats.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_375645400~“A Pleasant Surprise”~My daughter was a little apprehensive when we drove in, probably because the external facade needed a bit of spruiking up - plus there was some construction happening on the roads. The boom gate for parking was not working - not a good sign from a security perspective. I checked in, chatting with a lovely chap called Harry who was great at the front desk - good recommendations for places to go plus he shifted our rooms so we were closer to the parking area. The room looks to have been recently renovated, and a thorough job at that. No skimpy paint jobs here. Spotlessly clean, even the bathrooms were brightly lit and well equipped. Rooms were well appointed with complete amenities. We didn't try the restaurant downstairs but there is a lovely dumpling house round the corner and a Maccas, if that's your thing. Overall a great place that also offered value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_375642537~“A pleasant surprise”~We had just one night here, but would not hesitate to return. Our room was spotless, spacious, and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom appeared to have been recently upgraded. Wifi was free and fast. The cost was a very reasonable $140, including under cover parking with lift access to all floors. There is a cafe in “The Tradies” for meals and decent coffee. The Canberra Wine House is located in the building – a great spot to try excellent local drops with nibbles. There are many Asian restaurants within walking distance. The Wine House has a deal with most local restaurants – just buy a bottle of wine and take it to any of the participating restaurants. Corkage will be free and your wine will be served in top quality stemware.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_373924052~“Return visit”~We returned to stay here for 4 nights after a nice stay same time last year. The room was comfortable enough though the hanging space is awkward with ironing board etc crowded into the small area. Housekeeping was good though I think they got half way through cleaning one day and didn't finish as the pillows were on the floor, otherwise it was fine, the hotel is in a good location a short drive to most places of interest with plenty of restaurants, shops within walking distance, it is also attached to the tradies club but after our dinning experience there I wouldn't recommend the food.

Anyway, back to the room. It was pleasant. Quiet. Spa bath/shower combo. Great for little ones getting a hot bath. The room with king size bed was very spacious. The bed was super comfy. We brought our own pillows. We were lucky enough to get this room at special deal $171 per night. We didn't dine there as way too many options outside of premise. We would stay here again next trip to Canberra. Luv it.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_370322042~“Good value ”~Good value hotel right near the restaurant precinct in dickson - very handy. Comfortable beds, nice big shower and a balcony overlooking a leafy pathway. Carpark underneath with plenty of spaces and elevators straight to the hotel. Definitely worth the price.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368412518~“Average night in”~I was awoken on several occasions due to a very noisy a/c system and very loud closing room doors and my in room meal was cold for dinner and wrong for breakfast. The shower in the spa suite was not easy to get in and out of and I think older patrons would really struggle.~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan~3~nan
review_368399598~“Great location!”~Nice hotel, great location with the Tradies Club in the same building is a real bonus. Room was really nice and very spacious. Check in was just OK, they insist on "holding" the whole amount of the accommodation as well as a $50 bond. Not happy about it but did know about it from a previous visit.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_367965707~“great overnight option”~we were looking for a reasonably priced overnight stay option for Canberra Quality Inn exceeded our expectations super convenient with shops and restaurants walking distance large clean room club facilities next door just great~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_366204951~“What a find in Canberra”~Standard room - spacious and clean with a massive bathroom! Room on ground floor, no road or street noise. Staff very friendly and helpful and we found the rates to be very reasonable. We travel to Canberra regularly and this will be our new regular hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_365280736~“Fantastic Value”~I have stayed here numerous times and could not be happier with the hotel and it's services! The staff are friendly, the room is super clean and the bed is very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_365001014~“Great value for money”~Stayed here for 2 nights recently and the room was spacious and clean. Little confusing as part of the local club but accommodation great value for money. Didn't eat at the club so can't comment on the food.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_363226492~“average”~We have stayed here a couple of times and visited the club on numerous occasions. The rooms are very spacious and clean. The service at the motel reception is always very good. We like staying here because of its great location for the places we need to go when in Canberra.The club area on the other hand is terrible. The staff show no enthusiasm and have very poor knowledge of the products they have to sell. We were actually served by one person on Saturday night who did not say one word to us, no how much, no can I help you , no please , no thank you. They could all do with a training course on how to serve a customer. The bad service does put us off going here and I think on our next visit to Canberra we won't bother. There are plenty more motels & gaming venues, we would rather pay the extra in taxi fares to a more pleasant venue.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362620860~“Want to rate higher but.... ”~When I first arrived I was amazed at the upmost cleanliness of the room. It was immaculate. I have nothing negative to say apart from the street noise..... All night was loud yelling and people making a heap of noise on the street only followed by what sounded like garbage trucks.... Needless to say I'm going to have 2 grumpy kids to deal with from lack of sleep and I will struggle with the drive back to Sydney. Real Shane for such a great first impression.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362426122~“You Can't Go Past this Place for Value”~Stayed here on a recent sporting visit with a very large group and they really looked after us. Check in was a breeze, all of the staff at reception and the cleaning crew all very friendly, and the rooms excellent. The rooms had everything and the beds were very comfortable, very important when staying almost 2 weeks. The rooms were cleaned daily and always spotless. The Hotel is next to The Tradies Club so good restaurants, cafes and bars in the same place, very handy. Also walking distance to the very popular Dickson food shops. WIFI was always good as well. If going back to Canberra again, would happily stay here.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_360296144~“Great Spot in Dickson”~This is a great hotel. It had everything including a microwave (which was a pleasant surprise). It is a stone throw away to Woolworths and Dickson shopping area where there are plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from. Staff were very pleasant and friendly.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359531593~“Well located, clean and comfortable”~Was initially disappointed with first impressions. Had difficultly in locating the Hotel. Cold welcome from Mr D at reception. Arriving to my room, I had trouble opening the heavy door and my bag sliding to the terrace as the floor was slanted towards the atrium. Putting this behind, the room was very comfortable, with fridge and microwave. Room service was impeccable. Lift was supposed to be security card operated to accommodation but this did not work. Hotel was within walking distance from all amenities such as post office, Woolworths, and great restaurants.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_358319911~“Good Value”~Very young staff at check in who try hard but could do with some old hands at the tiller. Rooms big, clean and great freecwi fi. Free mship of Tradies Club helps to access good club type dining at good prices. Some noise from other rooms but generally quiet and proximity to large shopping centre excellent.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358104012~“Comfortable & Clean”~I stay here regularly. It's close to great restaurants & the city, without the noise. The beds are always comfy & pillows not to flat.  It's clean and the staff are professional. If you can't carry your luggage up the stairs, make sure you book a room that's more accessible.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_357940258~“Disappointed”~I booked this on the experience of staying at "Quality" franchise accommodation in other locations. Unfortunately this location is visually ugly. It was difficult to work out where reception was located and the lift was grubby and felt like we were using the tradesman entrance . However actual rooms were quite nice, with good quality amenities and clean. Unfortunately our room was like a cave with no window to see the sky This motel is actually called The Tradies Hotel which sums up the ambience.~3~2~1~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_354240822~“Very comfortable & good location”~The hotel is comfortable with free access the ":Tradies" Club so you can use the club facilities dinning room. The meals there are very good quality and reasonably priced. Also it is within a vey short walking distances to many restaurants in Dickson~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_354158529~“A joke”~This place calls itself a 4 star place. The rooms are average at best containing broken controls broken shower screens and less than average facilities. They have little substance in terms of a room service menu. Thanks god for the Dickson township. Staff are less than helpful. Then what tops it off is that they take a $50 bond as a security. I have never had this before. What topped that off with not having incurred any expenses they then say on leaving that the bond will be released probably in the next few days. But no guarantee. Front desk says that they were new and that is what they have to do. Really angry that these practices are allowed to continue. I will guarantee that the manager does not contact me~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353466082~“Top notch for quality and location!!”~Very impressed with quality of appointments, size of rooms. Immaculately clean with fantastic facilities (bars, restaurants, gaming etc) at Tradies Club within the same complex. Within a few minutes walk to an enviable array of quality dining options and within very short drive to all the wonderful attractions Canberra has to offer. All at a great price, wouldn't stay anywhere else. However, felt sorry for the poor guy on reception, should have put extra staff on for check in time. Very happy customers.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_352741005~“Excellent Value”~My daughter and I were visiting for Canberra Royal and found this motel very close to the Showgrounds. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and modern, with a quiet atmosphere. Very reasonably priced. Would recommend to anybody wanting accommodation in Canberra.  Thank you.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_351978214~“Not too bad.”~Booked direct & received free in house movies, free undercover parking, free membership to the club (Dickson Tradies) that it is attached to, free gym. Stayed for 2 nights. Rooms starting to look tired & in need of upgrade, some dirty food marks on cupboard door under micro wave (still there on departure despite us advising front desk) Table in room very unstable & appeared it would collapse anytime, still the same on departure, also despite reporting. Restaurant attached at The Tradies serves average quality meals with a discount for members. The area surrounding has a wide variety of restaurants available, also a Woolies.  Although not in central Canberra, you are no more than 10 mins. from anywhere. I would probably stay here because of price, if I ever travelled to Canberra again. Check in & out is a lengthy procedure~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_351264971~“Modern, comfortable and well-equipped”~This modern hotel is part of the Choice Hotels chain and does it credit. It is a big city hotel but nevertheless had the facilities of a good motel - microwave, fridge etc. I had a huge, clean room that was in good condition with two double beds, desk, free wifi, and spacious bathroom. There were a number of bars and cafes nearby, plus petrol stations, McDonalds, KFC, and local shops. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. I was able to park my car close to my room, which had a door that opened into the parking area.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_350966381~“Excelent Hotel, pity the service from the club isnt better”~We booked a deluxe room but got an upgrade to a one bedroom apartment. Excellent facilities within the room , everything one needs to prepare and cook meals. As the hotel is part ( I think) of the Tradies Club which it adjoins we gave it a try. The service was slow, items were incorrect. Just seemed they were short of staff. Look forward to staying at the Hotel again but will definitely give the clubs café and bistro a miss~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_349808170~“Canberra Stay”~The deluxe room was very good although the shower was a little small. The adjoining club offered a nice place to have a drink and a meal. The hotel is very well located with a large range of restaurants, shopping center and public transport within 5 minutes.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_344153374~“Excellent stay”~We stay at the Quality Hotel Dickson as it breaks the drive from Albury to Batemans Bay. The rooms are Spacious , clean and comfortable and as the Hotel adjoins the Tradies Club , they have all the facilities a Traveller requires . This visit was no exception .~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_339800274~“A good sleep”~I was tired and in need of a good night's rest. This hotel is linked to the Tradies Club with ready access to its restaurant, Essence, that has truly excellent meals served in convivial surrounds at a reasonable price. The service was excellent and my meal was served after a short wait. The room I occupied was on the second floor, very quiet, clean, roomy and comfortable. The curtains blocked out the city lights and I slept well. In the morning I went back to Bluey's Cafe in the Tradies for breakfast. It opened at 7 am and had a good selection of dishes and its own blend of coffee, sourced locally from Wagonga Coffee Beans, which proved to be excellent. This is a great place to stay at a reasonable tariff.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_338562019~“Good Value”~This hotel is very clean, well serviced, secure, with good parking. There are lots of good restaurants close by. Access to a gym is included - although we didn't get time to try it. Very good value for a family holiday.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_338539544~“A pleasant stay”~Underground parking Ng and a lift to the foyer is a good start. Friendly staff to greet. Rooms are 4 star and clean. Everything works. Great value for money. Dickson tradies is integrated to hotel so you can relax there without leaving the building, which is very convenient.  I have written about the club brasserie called Essence so you Can make your own mind up whether or not you eat there. However, the coffee shop does a gods breakfast.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_337474864~“Modest exterior, luxurious interior”~A fairly unassuming building from the outside, but the twin king bed room was great, being reasonably modern, clean and with all the right features. The free wifi worked well and the bed was very comfortable. It's located right amongst the Dickson shops which includes the usual take away food stores, many Asian restaurants and Woolworths. It is also only a 10 minute drive to the Canberra CBD. The adjoining Tradies club has a decent bistro with discounts for guests if they sign up for free membership. Although the air conditioning worked excellently to keep the room at a bearable temperature away from the 37 degrees outside, the noise it made in the room was like a loud old fridge. One star off for that. Otherwise very good and fantastic value.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_337112293~“Best ever!”~Best one tht I ever stayed in canberra! It's really worth with the price! Also they have hairdryer, microwave and bar fridge, air conditioner. It's really helpful for me to keep my food in the fridge and heat it up. Strategic place near canberra "market city". Just walk a few minutes to reach woolworths, petrol station, Mcdonald, kfc and different kind of restaurants also Chinese. I'll recommend this for everyone~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336335764~“A nice place to stay whilst in Dickson ”~There was a need for some minor maintenance with the toilet flush as it was broken. The bed was quite soft and there was a sagging problem in the centre. Apart from those two minor things, we had a nice overnight stay here and it was extremely handy to restaurants. It also came with a microwave, which could have been handy as a Woolworths was nearby.  It was great to be able to securely park a van there overnight too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336114508~“Business”~I had a one day business trip to Canberra  I needed an affordable hotel, found quality hotel being reasonably priced and with positive reviews  It met all expectations and beyond: Clean Neat no noise  family oriented  perfect location~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_335643699~“Well priced, good location”~I stayed here on Christmas eve 2015, traveling through to my final destination. Room was clean and well presented. I found the blackout curtains to be great, yet there was very poor sound proofing in the room. despite booking a late check out i was wide awake by 7am by all the opening and closing doors and children running around. Only other issue was the TV needed to be re programmed as no channels were available when i arrived (was able to do myself) and my normal gripe that there were no man sized towels or drinking glasses in the room (minor stuff overall) I would stay again, yet would be more suited to groups or families with early starts.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_335275064~“Good option for short stopover”~We stayed one night as a stopover in Canberra. The room was big with 2 double beds and the bathroom was clean and fairly modern. Enjoyed the Tradies restaurant and the meals were large and cheap. Only negative was the beds were not firm enough.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335149846~“Great Suburban Option”~Great hotel in the heart of Dickson. Clean, free parking. Excellent restaurants within walking distance. Dickson pool also within walking distance. Perfect for visiting family close by. Friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_327283145~“Great Value”~Maybe I am getting old but I found the convenience of the hotel being attached to a licensed club quite appealing. We stayed in Canberra for a couple of days to attend the Socceroo's WCQ and have a bit of a holiday. The rooms are basic but have some thoughtful little add-ons including a bar fridge, microwave, crockery, cutlery etc. This allows you to avoid forking out for breakfast if you want to buy in some supplies from the local Woollies. All in all, the room was great value for the price. An added bonus was being able to stroll downstairs to the restaurants, bars etc of the attached Tradies Club. Recommended.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_326816396~“Tradies in Dickson”~Great stay in Dickson at this hotel which is close to city centre. Free undercover parking and the Tradies Club attached to the hotel. Excellent meals at restaurant and Bluey,s cafe but there is also a shopping plaza across the street inlcluding a Woolworths and many restaurants to choose from.Of particular note was a Vegan and a vegetarian restaurant . Public transport at the doorstep if you choose to leave your car parked. Room was very spacious and clean . Large bathroom area and in our room a toaster and microwave. Definitely get the free membership to the Club as means savings on drinks and meals. Would recommend for families and ther is a local close by as well as a gym.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan
review_322815791~“Convenient accommodation in Canberra”~A very large comfortable room of the standard you expect from a Quality Hotel. Friendly staff. Rooms were large and very clean. Beds comfortable with good pillows. The bathroom was huge. Very convenient to access the Club for meals, although we had terrible steaks and an hour wait despite there being not many in the restaurant. However usually the meals are good so maybe the kitchen was having a bad day. Breakfast however was excellent.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_320812944~“The tradies”~The Tradies Club is part of the Quality hotel in Dickson. It costs $2 for a w8 day temporary membership, which is well worth the outlay, if you'r looking for a good place to eat. The meals were all very reasonably priced and of excellent quality and quantity. Actually all the meals were at least twice the size we expected. The food was that good we ate here every night, bar one, that we were in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_319735596~“Good Quality Rooms”~Booked 2 Double Spa Rooms. Rooms nicely furnished. Possible safety issue with access into the spa/shower. Suggest non slip mate in spa and on floor (in preference to a bath mat). Free Wifi and parking an asset. Reception staff professional and helpful. Short drive to the centre of Canberra.  We used the free membership to the Club attached to the hotel. Breakfast at Blueys Cafe was good food and great service.  Could not say the same for the restaurant in the Tradies Club. Dress code, service and food quality varied the three times we ate there. There are a variety of other eating establishments around the hotel.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
