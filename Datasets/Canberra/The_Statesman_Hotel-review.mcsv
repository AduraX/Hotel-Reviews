review_476372281~“Impresive hotel in a good location , very clean room.”~It was long weekend most hotel are fully booked. I booked a room two weeks ago in different hotel I didn't realize it was wrong date. Then I tried to find a room from hotels.com /tripadvisor websites etc but all booked out.  I called this hotel directly I was lucky they still have the last room, they didn't charged normal price too so we took it. The room was been refurbished nicely, very clean spotless and a good size. What this hotel has provided in the room is more than a 3* hotel an extra blankets and tea, coffee some biscuits, ironing etc. Breakfast at their café very good. definitely we will go back to this hotel. The only thing which was lacking is the wifi.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_475774706~“Limited access to hotel wifi”~I just don't understand why the free wifi offered by most motels and mid range hotels are non existent. The room was comfortable. The bathroom towels were a bit worn but overall we accepted the condition as we were here for one night.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_474448464~“Good range of beer and food”~Been here a couple of times for dinner. Don't let the sports bar put you off if you walk through that way - keep going to the main bar and bistro. The beer is good (most important) and the food is surprisingly good for the money (next important). As it is now my local I will be back.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_470449028~“Better than average”~A fairly last minute booking had me going to this 1960s hotel in the suburb of Curtin. While it was not as central as I'd like, I think the taxi from the airport was about $32 which isn't much more than to more central options. All reception staff I encountered were friendly and service minded. The room was clean and quiet. The negative was that wi-fi was basically non-existent in the room, however it worked fine in the lobby and in the bar. I didn't try any of the food. The bistro is part of the very plain bar. I had a couple of drinks but decided to check out a restaurant down the road (which turned out to be pretty average). If I stayed here again I'd probably take a cab elsewhere for more dining options. The next morning I went around to the shops behind the hotel for breakfast, at a quite good coffee & deli place. The hotel's courtesy shuttle to nearby suburbs is a great & friendly service which I did use. All in all the hotel offers good value and a rating of 3,5 stars would be right.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469041736~“Statesman review”~poor management in need of renovation make sure you do not get a room with a connecting door or you may not get any sleep at all. location is reasonable if you have limited requirements blah blah blah blah~1~nan~3~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_459353070~“Tired and desperately in need of a renovation.”~While not at the high end of cost for Canberra, this hotel saw better days 50 years ago and seems stuck at that point in time. Floor was so dirty on arrival I had to request a thorough cleaning in order to continue sleeping there. The restaurant serves well-cooked meals but in an atmosphere redolent of 60's chic-ness that has long passed any cuteness in might have once had. Think Motel 6 with a 60's decor.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457784928~“Basic rooms, but good food in the restaurant”~The rooms are pretty basic with limited hanging and drawer space and a pretty small bathroom (shower isn't very deep and for a larger person it's tough to have room to close the door to the toilet), but after telling the reception staff that the floor was dirty and very dusty and that we needed it well-cleaned we came back to a much cleaner room which was good service. The food in the restaurant was surprisingly good, tasty and well-preserved, so it's worth eating here.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447610219~“Convenient location”~We have used this hotel a few times as it is close to friends especially if they are booked out for family functions! It isn’t expensive as we were there over the Christmas period however the restaurant and bar were closed. It is 2 storey so no lift if you are disabled however ramps on the ground floor. We didn’t use the Wi-Fi but on the website says it is for purchase. Australia needs to get with the program of free Wi-Fi.  We stayed in a double/twin room which was adequate as we were away most of the day anyway. The bathroom had been done I think but the shower head didn’t appear to be a water saving one. We have hot and dry summers inland, this needs to be addressed by hotels wherever. The towels were a bit thin definitely not new or luxurious. Plugs for hair dryers, chargers were on the floor, nothing at table height, a little inconvenient but tolerable I guess. Air conditioning available but used the fan which was good but a little old. We were on the ground floor, couldn’t open the windows for security reasons. Beds were fine, plenty of pillows. Under cover secure parking which is always a plus too!~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_447542365~“Excellent value and very comfortable and clean”~We required urgent accommodation after two family members were involved in an accident and flown to Canberra hospital- we rang at 7am asking if we could take a room straight away so we could shower and then get back to the hospital - no problem at all with no additional cost. Later when additional family members arrived they quickly and efficiently organised to move us to a new room so we could have adjoining rooms, which we really needed as everybody was very upset. Very impressed with the cost and the very friendly and efficient reception staff. If you say you were recommended by Canberra hospital you will also receive a 10% discount - really counts during family emergencies!~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445309663~“A good hotel in a convenient location”~All went well just about sums it up. The booking was uncomplicated, the price was reasonable, the room was very comfortable and clean, the staff were friendly and helpful. Oh - there were plenty of options for eating and drinking (even for gambling for those inclined that way). The nearby shopping center is home to one of Canberras best second hand bookstores. I´d stay again any time.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_442957715~“An excellent surprise”~I could not believe it. The stairway carpet looked a bit tired, but what a surprise when I entered my room. It was a decent size, very clean, well laid out. The bathroom was spotless, no mould in the shower. I will definitely stay there again, and it is only 10 minutes into the city centre. The bed was very comfortable. The towels smelled and looked very clean.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_442024447~“Nice motel”~The receptionist was very nice and explained clearly all the rules (checkin time, checkout time... etc). Room was clean and quiet. Hopefully one day they will upgrade the TVset (very small screen and far from bed, hard to watch). Location of the motel is near a pub, where we could find good food and plenty beer.~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_436721258~“Good value but could be quieter”~This was my first time staying here and I had a deluxe balcony room. On the positive side - the room was quite spacious and had a decent-sized balcony for sitting outside. The rooms are a bit dated but, given the price, that didn't bother me. I found mine quite spacious. (Some new pillows though would be a good idea, the ones on the bed had very little life left in them.) The room is also stocked with a decent supply of tea, coffee and biscuits, as well as a mini bottle of milk in the barfridge which is a nice touch. The biggest drawback was I could hear water running whenever neighbouring rooms had a shower/ ran water, and it was actually pretty loud. This included showers running late in the evening and from 6am in the morning. It's a pity, as otherwise it was a quiet location with very little noise from outside. Also, although free wifi is provided I couldn't get it to work. Overall, a good price for Canberra accommodation but the noise was off-putting.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_435330561~“Big room with 2 beds”~Our room is on the 2nd storey, so we have to carry the luggages to the room. We managed to get this room with 2 beds. The room is big and spacious and the beds are more than comfortable to rest our tired bodies after a 3hr plus journey. The heater is strong enough to keep us warm throughout the cold night. There were plenty of toiletries, laid out in an orderly manner for us to use.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_431650670~“Highly recommend this one...spotless and affordable”~We were in Canberra for a family wedding and found this hotel to be inexpensive and well located. Taxi fares to and from venues in the city were reasonable. The breakfasts (not included in tariff) were excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful. Teabags, etc were topped up daily. The rooms were comfortable and spotless. The hotel is right next to Curtin shops including a Coles supermarket.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_431031398~“Weekend visit for Wedding ”~Lovely hotel. I stayed in the King suite and it was very clean and comfortable. The cleaning staff are really lovely and professional as I had a chat with them while they were doing their rounds. Well priced and the location is great as there are parks nearby and a small shopping complex with a Coles next door. I also spent my Friday evening for drinks in the outdoor part near the bar and it was wonderful with friendly bar staff and good service. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Canberra.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429074178~“Comfortable and very affordable”~Stayed one night as had some job interviews close by. Room was comfortable. Great shower and generous with tea bags etc. Free wifi. Good restaurant in hotel and Coles supermarket next door. Plenty of parking and easy to find coming from the South Coast.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_428118777~“Clean & comfortable”~This hotel is old, but clean and comfortable. Our room was spacious (apartment room 99). There was however insufficient car park spaces by night. We found that we would often go offsite for meals or the event we were attending to return late at night to a full car park and have to park on the street. We also experienced difficulty entering the hotel after hours with our swipe cards and had to alert the overnight duty manager.~4~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_427482137~“Excellent value for money”~Had a small self contained apartment for 5 nights. The well appointed kitchenette had everything you would need to cook a meal, although we only used it to make our breakfast. There was generous supply of tea, coffee, milo, milk and biscuits which was topped up everyday good. Beds comfortable. Small but comprehensive shopping centre right next door. Location was ideal - about 10 minutes from main Canberra attractions and lake. Staff were helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again. Only negative was a very noisy exhaust fan in the bathroom which was attended to immediately when we complained.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_425506317~“Birthday stay”~Stayed in a family room for 2 nights to attend a family birthday at a very close location and was very happy with our choice of accomodation. As someone who was in the accomodation industry for 14 years and knows the importance of good staff together with clean rooms ,it was lovely to find the same at The Statesman. A bonus is always a nice sized shower with a good supply of hot water and this is what we got .  We will certainly stay here again when needed in the future .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425213502~“Value for money”~Value for money is the verdict. Rooms are dated, worn but appear clean. Reception staff friendly but emphasis is motel and not hotel expectations. No safe in rooms. Limited extras apart from coffee and ironing board~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424872869~“The "budget rooms" are comfortable but noisy”~We started our 3 day trip to Floriade in room 9 and I hardly slept a wink,The walls are extremely thin and you could hear every word the lady in the next room was saying whilst on her phone. Later on it began raining in Canberra and the gutters were overflowing through a spout designed for a downpour but even in a more normal rain ran all night with water dropping onto the ground right outside our bedroom window. The receptionist next morning asked how I felt and I told her. Within 5 minutes of leaving the manager gave me a call and subsequently arranged to move us to room 2 which had no water issues but no lookout from the window. The rooms have a queen and a single bed which makes them a little tight even though they look spacious. A lovely touch was a small bottle of real milk in the fridge although it could do to be twice the size and our fridge didn;t get replenished for the third day! The secure parking is a fenced in area with the fence beiing relatively easy to scale and the parking spots very tight.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_418995801~“Good value,cozy”~I stayed for three nights after a recommendation of a friend and looking at Trip Advisor reviews.The Hotel is cozy the rooms are spotless,large with all the usual amenities.

review_415975402~“Value for your money”~This is a nice hotel with value for money and close to all the consulates and cbd. No microwave sink etc but you have room service and there is a Coles literally next door. Can recommend to stay if you need a clean budget place. Like others have noted no stairs here but even the third floor climb with a 3 year old wasn't bad!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Decent sized TV, room has everything you need - iron, hairdryer, shampoo & conditioner. All though the hotel is a little dated it is well maintained & clean & tidy. Hotel has a restaurant, bar, bottleshop. Coles supermarket just a 5 minute walk away for all your extra incidentals. Recommend.~3~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan

review_386831486~“Great stay”~Fresh,Clean,comfortable and good value.We loved that they had blankets for the bed,which we personally find a lot more comfortable and heat adjustable than a hot Doona. Pleasant ,friendly staff . Our second stay and equally happy. Can genuinely recommend to others.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386312162~“Very good budget accommodation”~The Statesman provides a very good level of budget accommodation with everything you could want including a restaurant, hotel, bottle shop and within ten minutes of the centre of town. The room was quite good, especially the shower, and there was secure parking right below the room. Recommended but dont bother with the cooked breakfast.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_383834748~“Convenient for a short stay in Canberra”~This was my second time in Canberra, and both times I have chosen the Statesman for my stay. It is conveniently located, closed to Embassies and close to shops and restaurants. The hotel is a bit tired but caters for both business and family travellers. My room was comfortable with good bed, and well set bathroom and shower. The front desk service is quick and friendly. Nothing fancy, but good value for money, functional and convenient.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_383003968~“Solid old performer , convenient, reasonable price”~I had three nights back at the Statesman, where I had stayed previously. Still same old tired look, carpets etc in need of replacement, rooms old style but clean, beds fine and comfortable, good amenities, small but hot shower, usual tea and coffee facilities, micro wave, fridge. It is 5 minutes drive from my grandchildren, convenient shops nearby, great coffee shop there for breakfast. Above all, QUIET Was upstairs this time, Room 27, a bit of a hike up stairs if you have a heavy bag. Taps dripped a bit and Foxtel quite limited (Wanted to watch football at night and unable to do so)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_376299135~“Above and beyond staff”~Our rooms were very comfortable with not much outside noise. The stairs (no lift) were entertaining for our daughter but thankfully we only went up and down them a few times. We ordered room service from the attached restaurant and it arrived quickly and was delicious.  Our daughter left behind a precious toy and on phoning the evening after we checked out the staff were only too helpful, running up to our room, twice, to search for the missing toy. It was located and mailed back to us.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_375020807~“Night Manager”~We had an emergency dash from the far South Coast of NSW to Canberra Hospital. We phoned the Hotel well after 11 O'clock at night after leaving the Hospital and the Night Manager was able to arrange a room for us. They usually keep a couple of rooms on the ground floor for such occasions. The A/C was on and the room was comfortable. In the morning we met the friendly reception and still the night manager was on duty. Attached to the accommodation section is a great Bar and Bistro so you don't have to venture outside the premises.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_369993447~“Exceeded expectations”~For the price and star rating, I really wasn't expecting anything other than a bed to sleep on and a roof over my head. I was really pleasantly surprised. It's in a quiet location with plenty of parking. The lobby is clean and attached to a pub/bistro, which is right next door to a Coles.  In the room was a double bed and a single bed. I was surprised that there were so many bathroom amenities (I wasn't expecting anything at all). There was also plenty of milk along with a variety of tea and coffee (and even Milo) and a nice new kettle. There were even biscuits! The airconditioning was already on when I got to the room which was nice. I found the bathroom to be very clean and the shower had really good water pressure.  I had an extremely comfortable sleep. The sheets were nice and clean and the bed was perfectly comfortable. Checkout was hassle-free.  To be fair, the wi-fi did not work at all for me, and in the morning I could hear the neighbouring rooms showering.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_368280781~“Noisy”~The walls are extremely thin and you can hear every word the people in the next room are saying. Particularly when they come home late.

review_367572819~“GOOD VALUE”~Together with my husband, we stayed at the Statesman Hotel for two nights, whilst visiting Canberra. We were travelling on our motorbike and were pleased that the Hotel offered secure parking during our stay. Our room was clean and cosy, the bed comfy and water pressure in the shower excellent. We dined at the Hotel one night and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. There is a little shopping centre 2 minutes walk away where there are a few cafes offering excellent breakfast choices and good coffee. Would highly recommend this establishment and will stay again if we are in the area.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_366767472~“Good clean budget Motel”~This is an older style motel - but it was clean, the service was lovely and the sleep quality was wonderful. Totally recommend it - stayed here during the week while attending a seminar at Weston Creek, only took about 7 minutes from door to door.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_364331574~“Easter break”~Very tired hotel in need of a makeover & facelift. The stairs from the carpark were a killer if we'd had heavy bags & would not be inclined to stay again due to no lift. On the brighter side, the bed was extremely comfortable & made up for yukky brown carpet that I wouldn't walk on without shoes.The whole room was painted a dismal brown which made it very dark.~3~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_362322807~“Centrally located”~Very good budget hotel with all modern amenities. Good for stays with family. Very centrally located.. About 5 kms from sights such as the Parliament and questacon. There are good restaurants just opposite the hotel and one within the premises~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362234388~“Bed sheets not changed!”~When first entering the room I noticed my pillow was crumpled (looked used) so I wondered whether housekeeping had changed the sheets. Looked closer and found a long hair on the pillow. Checked the pillow on the other bed and found hairs on that pillow also so I knew that housekeeping had just remade the beds with the same sheets. Had to ask reception for new sheets and pillow cases and made a complaint (which they said they would pass on to housekeeping). Will not stay here again for this reason.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356645050~“Ok to stay but for Godssake dont eat there”~Its run down and dingy but the rooms are ok for the price. Clean and just retiled and repainted. .. ok but if a bit dark. Whatever you do though... dont eat there. We made the mistake of having breakfast. Yuck. The bread, cakes and croissants were so stale... days old. The toaster doesnt work properly. There is only instant coffee unless you want to pay $4 for something awful made on the machine. The hot water urn was cold (no tea or coffee). And the dining room was like a mausoleum with no light and the curtins closed. What a horrible experience. We went to the restaurant the night before. It opens at 6pm. We didnt know.  When we tried to order at the counter which was staffed at 6 minutes to 6 they told us to come back. The bar isnt very friendly so we thought we would go somewhere else. Looks like a lucky escape if breakfast is anything to go by. If you want a bed for the night this is fine but dont eat here.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355534585~“Pleasant surprise”~Needed a room for one night stopover & was not looking for too much. The Statesman appear unassuming from the outside but it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Reception was efficient, courteous & helpful. Checking in was fast. The room was really clean, well appointed and smelled fresh. The air conditioning worked really well! The bathroom was really well maintained, looked and felt new. Guest amenities were plentiful. Good quality toiletries. Generous supply of tea, coffee & biscuits.The room came with free parking and free internet. Our room was at the end of the corridor so there was noise issue. It was a very pleasant stopover.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_351446518~“Hidden Gem of a Hotel”~On arrival this hotel does not look like much, right next door to a shopping centre and bottleshop, BUT it is excellent!  I was in room 44. Room was large and spacious. Modern with VERY comfortable bed, additional pillows, blanket if need. Roomy bathroom with shower. Large TV and decent sized bar fridge. Good desk/table space for working on a laptop with handy power points.  I had dinner at the hotel bistro (H20) that served decent food - I had the Chicken Parma off the 'Pub Food' menu which was yummy. Also ordered room service dinner and breakfast while there. Both delivered quickly and very generous portions. Reception staff were very helpful, and hotel amenities came with free secure undercover parking and a guest laundry ($2.20 for wash & same for dryer) which was handy as I was there over a week. Coles shopping centre and local shops just next to the hotel was very handy, able to grab supplies and a cafe coffee on the way out each morning. Ate dinner at the 'Hungry Buddah' one night - very yum! Hotel is out of town, but as anywhere is easy to get to in Canberra it felt I was only a short drive away from any of the local attractions. Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Canberra. Only 'Cons' were they don't have a lift so have to lug your suitcase up and down stairs on arrival (not a huge issue!) and it was a bit noisy.. rooms are definitely not soundproof so you hear those in the rooms beside and above flushing loos, having showers and stomping around a bit, but again it was not a huge issue.. just the only negative I can think of.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_349832939~“Good room and food for low cost, near Canberra hospitals, Woden.”~i only spent one night here in basic room. The room had everything I wanted, mostly clean, although one chair had hairs and dust on it. The corridors and stairs a bit old and worn; the food in the bistro was very good, pity about the presentation of the bistro counter and blackboard which let it down. located next to suburban shopping centre which was a bit dirty, but has a good coffee shop for breakfast.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_349031756~“Necessary stopover”~We had to find a motel in a hurry, only 1 room left, on top floor, paid $129.00 for room, wasn't to bad but not as good as some we've stayed in. Shower door didn't close properly & quite noisy with trucks coming to the back dock at Coles just near our room. Also shower noises & sometimes flushing was heard from next room. Bed was quite comfy though.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_347758136~“Reasonably priced hotel for Canberra”~This hotel is located 15 minutes from the centre of Canberra, in the suburb of Curtin. It is easy to find with undercover parking. The room has coffee and tea making facilities. Breakfast was not available. The rooms at the back of the hotel looks over Coles carpark. The bed was comfortable with spare pillows. The main room had a double and single bed with two chairs and a table. The bathroom is on the smallest side. The plumbing can be noisy particularly, as in our case, when someone had a shower at 4:15 in the morning.  The price for the room was very reasonable, so stay here when we are in Canberra.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

Well done.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342035600~“Clean & Tidy”~We booked the Statesman Hotel for 3 nights , as it was near the Canberra Hospital as I had to have an operation requiring an overnight stay an was unable to drive for 48 hrs. We arrive around 1pm after driving from Batemans Bay. It was a Hot day. Our room wasn't quite ready so we waited in the reception . I took the opportunity to ask reception if they could book a Taxi for the following morning at 6:30 am. This was no trouble . 10 minutes later our room was ready. On entering the room on the 2nd floor we found a nice room , clean and tidy and comfortable . The balcony had 1 chair , the room had a small table to dine in if needed and 2 armchairs . A fridge and tea/coffee and plenty of milk and biscuits . The entrance to the bathroom had the Wardrobe on one side with extra blankets and pillows , Ironing board and Iron .On the other side was a wash basin with a good selection of shampoo's ,conditioners and body lotions. Through the door in to the toilet and shower area is a bit of a squeeze , but the shower is very large with great water pressure , a good shower. The beds consisted of a queen and a single with plenty of pillows, Lighting was adequate . The TV was a good size flat screen. So far so good. On retiring to bed that night we turned off our aircon as it was not required , however the room next door's aircon was so noisy we got very little sleep . I told my Wife to report the problem to reception while I was in Hospital which she did . On coming out of Hospital we got a Taxi back to the Hotel around 1pm on going to our room we found that it was yet to be cleaned . So we decided to have a drink at the Terrace Bar. My Wife went up to the room at 2:45 and found that the Cleaners had still not cleaned the room but were in the next room . We were able to access the room just after 3 pm . The room was Clean & Tidy except the bin had not been emptied. That night the next room's aircon was audible all night so we had another restless night . Would not stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_341616458~“Scary at first glance”~The hotel looks quite rough from the exterior and we were pleasantly surprised that our motel room was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately wifi didn't work in the room and we couldn't get access to digital channels. The balcony would have been good had it not been overlooking the pub car park. However, sufficient for an overnight stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan

review_339762680~“OK, but not at Christmas”~My room was reasonably comfortable and kept very clean. I think I would have liked the hotel much more if I was not there during the Christmas/Boxing Day holiday period. The hotel shut down its restaurant for the entire time I was there, and the shopping center behind the hotel was totally shut down on Christmas and, having no car, I went to bed hungry that night. The nearby restaurants remained closed on Boxing Day, but the supermarket opened so I was able to eat that day. The free wifi worked fine the first day then, while I could get their wifi signal, their wifi lost its internet connection. The desk clerks seemed to not care about this too much. Two of them told me that guests occasionally have trouble with their laptops. (Does anyone ever check in with their desktop computer??) They got their connection back as I was leaving. Normally, the hotel has a restaurant, bar/betting parlor, and liquor store, in addition to the adjacent shopping center. Travelers with disabilities need to know that the hotel has no elevator. I also had to leave a light on at night so I would not fall entering the bathroom as the floor there was about 2" higher than the bedroom floor.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_339086123~“Nice hotel, shame about the guests”~Staff were friendly, room was fine with good tea and coffee making. Bathroom was newly renovated and was well done. Toiletries were good quality and well stocked. Secure car parking was provided. There is a small shopping centre nearby with a Coles, a few bottle shops, cafes etc and a pretty good Nepalese restaurant which I highly recommend. Hotel location is good if you have a car. It's a short drive to a large shopping centre at Woden or the centre of Canberra and it's tourist attractions. Wifi was free and for the first day worked well but for the second day wouldn't reach the rooms. On the Saturday night drunken guests returned to their rooms making lots of noise in the corridors until 4:30am. But the Sunday night was much better and we heard no external noise. It's great value and I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_334686893~“Good value”~Wasn't fancy but ok. The bistro meals were good. The wifi was good. Secure carprak was a bonus. Staff were nice. The one and only downside was the noise from the trucks stocking up Coles at 5:30am Room servicing was good, but put out the room service request tag otherwise they don't.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_333432366~“Good value option”~Room was modern, very clean and quiet. Free parking and WiFi added to the value. Close to a small shopping centre to pick up essentials and a large second hand book store - we enjoyed a Nepalese meal one evening and a breakfast in one of the coffee shops.We were there on a couple of hot days and the room temperature was lovely on our return. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_333407807~“Small but has everything you need ”~I stayed recently with a friend  People at the hotel where friendly. The rooms where clean and made up daily, although they where small what surrounds the hotel makes up for it, there is a bistro/ bar downstairs, laundry facilities, secure parking, and an ATM. The hotel also has a coles and cafe's within 2 min walking distance.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_333183166~“Did the job.”~Two night stay. For us, would have been better if the single bed wasn't there as we didn't need it. There was very little room around the furniture so luggage space was interesting. Walls looked solid, but we definitely heard happy noises from an adjoining room.  Room was clean, reception was average. Some undercover secure parking available.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_332010981~“Great comfort”~Very clean, modern, next to Coles supermarket and Coles express. Very reasonable rates. I paid $ 119 a night. 8 mins drive to parliament house. Has a bottle shop and a dine in restaurant, also has room service. Free WiFi and underground parking.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_330582846~“Pleasantly surprised ”~From the outside we were a little worried as it's pretty much a car park pub with accom. But the rooms were clean and modern, staff all seemed nice and there was secure parking for the car.  There was no roudy noise from the pub patrons and there is a Coles right next door if you need anything. The room resembled a lot of 4* hotels I've stayed in. Nice toiletries, decent linen, had everything we needed. Shower was great too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_328523706~“Excellent Service”~Over the last two years I have stayed at the Statesman more times than I can remember. I have stayed in a range of the rooms and can vouch that in every case they have been clean and comfortable. Michelle the manager in unfailingly helpful and does her best to ensure an enjoyable stay. I can always count on a good night's sleep. I don't often use the breakfast bar but it is comprehensive and good value. Being next to the hotel bistro makes evening meals easily arranged. I highly recommend the Statesman Hotel.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_325648434~“Great value in a quiet location”~Stayed here for two nights attending nearby business meetings. Obviously an old establishment, perhaps a tad tired, but offered a charming relaxed atmosphere. The room I had was reasonably spacious and had all the usual amenities. It was on the ground floor so the view from my window was the side of a fence. Friendly and helpful reception with a fast book in. They have a great bistro on site that cook a pretty good steak. Breakfast service is friendly and a nice breakfast range. Particularly good value for money with reasonable room tariffs and other costs. They also provide a complementary mini van service for transport to nearby locations. Within the lobby they have a great atrium with pond complete with miniature bushland environment and real tortoises and blue tongue lizards. I needed a slightly late checkout which was graciously provided. Don't expect 5 star elegance or luxury but rather appreciate the friendly comfortable atmosphere of The Statesman Hotel.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_322726060~“Quick visit”~On a quick visit to Canberra for a doctor visit, this hotel was perfect. Very reasonable price, the room was quiet and comfortable, the bed lovely,bathroom a little small but who spends time in a bathroom? Location was ideal for the appointment, so I would certainly stay there again.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_322433308~“Suburban convenience”~I generally stay elsewhere when visiting Canberra but chose the Statesman because it was close to my grand children. Well appointed room, good motel type facilities, quiet even though it has a popular hotel wing, comfortable bed and a Great shower. It is 50 metres from the Curtin shopping centre with an excellent supermarket for odds and sods, flowers etc. only drawback was parking at a premium on Saturday night so get in early!~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_317646227~“Stately”~OK, it is probably over-the-top to describe the Statesman as stately but I did think it very good. It might be located out in the 'burbs at Curtin, but it is a very quiet location and surprisingly close to everything in Canberra (assuming you have a car). Parking is secure and undercover. It is also right next to a small shopping centre, with Coles, a liquor store and an excellent Nepalese restaurant.  My room was clean, spacious, tastefully decorated and well appointed with comfy queen bed plus a single, a couple of armchairs and came with a balcony. Bathroom was also fine with a generous provision of quality toiletries. The quality of the complimentary beverages/biscuits was also much better than you normally get. Wi-fi free with strong signal - my only complaint about the room is perhaps the TV could have been a size larger.  Overall, good value for money and would happily stay again.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_312565966~“An oldie but a goodie”~We stayed there last weekend and have absolutely no complaints. The girls in reception were very efficient and friendly. Our room was upstairs, it was spotlessly clean and very, very comfortable. Large bed, a comfy chair, big desk, large mirror, fridge and bright clean bathroom. All in all nicely appointed. We would definitely stay there again. The motel adjoins the hotel where there is a great bar, bistro and restaurant. We did have dinner there and it was fine. The motel is only a few minutes away from the heart of the city and as it is not on a main road it was very quiet at night.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_309587137~“Comfortable”~We stayed in a 3 bed suite. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The 3rd bed was a sofa bed. The rooms have been modernised with new wood look flooring, and tiling in the bathroom. The bar closed at 10:30 on a Saturday night so if nightlife is your goal, go into civic.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_308863411~“A nice surprise”~This hotel wasn't my first choice of accommodation in Canberra, I'd been looking at the Adobe hotel and Quality hotel but they where booked out. My first impression of the hotel wasn't very good, I was a bit skeptical I wouldn't say it looks very pretty at first glance but the receptionist was lovely and our room was very nice, it's been recently renovated so if you're looking for a very modern hotel this isn't it, but the room was roomy the bed was great and had a balcony and considering it had a bar and a shopping centre nearby it was very quite and was well serviced the three days we were there, also free Wi-Fi and secure parking . Canberra can be a rather perplexing place so booking a hotel that is well set up is important, the accommodation is at either end of the building and in between you have a bar and restaurant where we had some very nice meals so you don't have to go out and try and find somewhere to eat also the hotel is about 500 metres from a small shopping centre which is very handy Having the air conditioner on to warm the room before we got in there was a lovely touch. It is also ideally located and seemed to be about 15 minutes away from everything we did.We will certainly stay there again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_306085726~“Good location”~This hotel provided good location for a business trip in Canberra. The room was OK and the reception staff very helpful. One of the advantages of the hotel was its location. It was easy to find and there was a series of shops including a newsagent, post office and supermarket. In addition the quirky bookshop next to the Nepalese restaurant was intriguing. Well worth a visit. The Statesman also had a very good bistro at reasonable prices.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_305143811~“A Great & Pleasant Surprise”~We booked last minute and had a few reservations about the fact that there is a "hotel" attached to this property. We were pleased from the minute we arrived at reception. The booking in process was quick, well organised and pleasant and we found our way to our room in no time flat. The room was a little smallish but exceptional clean and comfortable. It was a cold day and the room was prepared for us with the aircond running at a very nice 20 degrees. The bed was firm and comfortable and the pillows were spectacular,,,,,we enjoyed a wonderful nights sleep. The rooms are quiet, there is easy access to a restaurant, bar which means you really dont need to go out if you dont want to. There is even secure car parking. This is a bit of a hidden gem and we will be staying there again. Its about 5 minutes easydrive from the City Centre~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_285397687~“Great value for money”~This motel was very clean and was great value for money. The staff were very friendly and the motel had excellent secure parking. It was in a very handy location with pub meals and a breakfast area. There was a Coles next door which was very convenient. Recommended and would stay there again if needed.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_284920652~“Very nice, spacious motel”~2 nights at The Statesman. Room was large and modern. Bathroom small but new. Strangely, the sink was outside of the bathroom! Large TV with a decent number of channels. Free wifi - unlimited, which is rare. Staff super friendly and efficient. Laundry room available. Curtin is a small suburb outside of the city. Took a bus into the city. Not a great bus service so if you are relying on public transport then Curtin is not the best base. Royal Mint down the road. Shops around the corner - supermarket, a few restaurants.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_282987679~“Great place to stay”~Friendly greeting on arrival, very clean and very comfortable. Spacious and good looking rooms. Excellent meals at the hotel bistro. Stayed 2 nights and was in the perfect location for us. Close to everything we required. Staff in the motel and also the hotel were always friendly and assistful. Will definitely stay at the Statesman when next in Canberra.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_282514413~“Good Value”~Recently stayed four night at the Statesman Hotel. Friendlyand helpful staff, great location, good price and good facilities. We especially liked the help given to us for our 102 year old friend travelling with us. Food good and reasonably priced.  Would recommend this hotel for anyone needing to visit John James hospital. Close enough to City of Canberra and easy access.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_273880232~“Convenient hotel for an overnight business stay”~The Statesman hotel is a short distance from the city centre, I found it has all that is required for a short business stay, although the rooms good do with some minor rejuvenation they were clean and tidy and very comfortable, the Bar/Bistro serves some delicious pub style meals that are washed down with a good variety of ales. The reception staff where very friendly and welcoming and the breakfast menu the following day was great for a good start in the morning, overall a very pleasant night was had with my colleagues discussing the day's events~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_272117729~“Value for money”~The only reason why this hotel is not twice the price is because it's a little way out of Canberra centre. The rooms are clean, the shower is the best (water stream, space, glass door) I have experienced for decades. The shower soaps are Australian and amazing. The bed is comfy, lovely balcony. Friendly staff. I travel a lot, and have to state that I really loved this place. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Canberra.~5~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_271861319~“excellent location”~This hotel was perfect for us. I was a patient at the National Capitol Hospital which was just around the corner and there is a shopping centre which backs on to the hotel..We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and the room had everything we needed.Would highly recommend for value for money.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_269634626~“Good Value”~We stayed here on a Saturday night in May. The price was very cheap. In fact, when we told Canberra friends what we were paying, they were rather incredulous. Accordingly, my positive opinion is conditional upon paying so little. I would be more exacting if I had paid more. The positive features are: 1) very quiet, even on a Saturday night 2) clean 3) fairly roomy 4) all electrical fittings and bathroom look recently updated 5) plenty of decent toiletries 6) empty fridge (I prefer not to be tempted!). 7) more than usual amount of coffee sachets and tea bags 8) even though we arrived before 2pm, we were allowed to access our room The hotel has a rather dated appearance, though as I said, the room was up to date with fittings. In fact, the datedness was rather charming Possible negatives: 1) the carpet in the room was one thing that hadn't been updated and definitely belongs to a bygone era 2) The pillows were very soft. Certainly not the type I would have at home and clearly cheap. All the same, being tired at night I managed to get a good night's sleep. All in all, I think this is a very decent place to stay and seriously, for what we paid it was much better than expected. I would happily stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_268451537~“Brilliant”~Clean newly renovated well maintained rooms. Brilliant shower endless hot water. Comfortable bed. Quiet location. Very well priced. You won't be disappointed staying here. The bar is a little dated, bistro food is well above average... Would be nicer if the bistro and bar staff were a little more lively.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_267827366~“Clean and compact”~Stayed here for a night a couple of weeks ago (Room 5). It must have had a bit of a makeover because I don't remember the insides of the room being 'pretty nice' the last time. The whole place has a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' type theme, which is not bad, though a bit dark. I just wish they would do something about the horrible red carpet that's been there 'forever' and doesn't go with anything! The room itself is pretty small, but otherwise un-fault-able. Plenty of bathroom goodies and lots of tea/coffee/biscuits etc to make use of. I was under the impression that our bed was a queen, but I think it was a double as I was bumping into my partner all night (maybe he was just cold...lol). The only major gripe I have (apart from the bright red light on the TV, which is the case at most hotels) is the room service breakfast I ordered. 1. I had to open the door in my jimjams to sign the order form, which didn't even have a place to sign it (why????), 2. The cereal was just in a bowl (not in a separate box or covered). 3. The cereal was 'stale', 4. The toast was also just sitting in a plate uncovered, 5. I got two butters but only one little spread (Huh?), 6. There were two bread knives and two forks, so I had to eat stale cereal with a teaspoon.... Not impressed (considering the price), and u am sure the food inspector would have had a issue with uncovered food in a public hospitality setting. Over all would stay again, but go somewhere else for breakfast.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_265917737~“Good suburban hotel”~My room was comfortable, a little dated but clean. It was next to the stairwell, so noise was a problem as people left the restaurant and stomped up the stairs, but it didn't last too long as it was mid week. Staff were friendly and helpful.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_262838789~“Clean and comfortable stay”~Short overnight stay but was very happy with the room. The lady on reception was friendly and efficient. Plenty of car parking,including free secure parking. Comfortable bed, great hot water and pressure in the shower, free wifi. Good value for money. Would stay here again and recommend.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_257002232~“Would stay here again”~We only had a very quick stay at the hotel as we were in Canberra for a surgical appointment. We arrived at 9pm and the woman at the desk was lovely, our room was spotless and well appointed. We paid $100 which was great for Canberra! We had to leave at 6:30am so didn't get to really see much of the place but the bed was to die for it was so comfortable and the shower pressure was equally as good. The walls are quite well insulated however there was a newborn baby in the next room who did wake us up for around an hour at midnight but other than that it was fine and quiet. We will stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_256154496~“A night at the Statesman”~My son (19) and I stayed the night, coming down from Sydney for a family party. We had room 8 which was modern and spotless. It is a pleasant place and we were more than pleased hence the top rating. A perfect, comfy sleep. The TV was not good but we didn't go there to watch TV. The car park does not appear to hold all the cars, so one or two late comers may have to park in the public car park adjoining.  The cream on the cake was my son left a rare T shirt in the bathroom and they sent it to us in Sydney and emailed the tracking number. All good! I have no idea about values, the twin room ( 1 queen, 1 single) was $119.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_253120511~“Basic in very convenient location”~Overall we enjoyed our three nights at this hotel, which is a motel attached to a pub. However, the motel is very quiet and also there is no noise from the nearby street. Overall the motel displays a simple, modern decor. It was renovated not long ago. One night we had room service. The food was simple, but tasty. It was delivered 10' after we had ordered it. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is spotless. Our room was not big, but good enough for us. We were out touring most of the times. The receptionists were most helpful when little problems arose (like our room had not been serviced on the day before departure). The location is the best feature of this hotel. It is 10' by car from Parliament House and 10' away from the nearest large shopping center. Near the hotel there is a supermarket and a group of stores, including one selling organic food.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_250435212~“A Comfortable Hotel”~Statesman Hotel is a very friendly place surrounded by beautiful trees and close to the shopping centre. It is not 5 star but very comfortable and homely and great value for money. The restaurant downstairs is excellent and there are some lovely walks nearby for morning exercise. Parking is safe and secure. Balcony rooms are a good size and many look out into the beautiful trees. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again while visiting Canberra.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_250146095~“Find somewhere else to stay”~Stayed here last week for two nights, (upgraded) and I use this term loosely to an apartment style room with one double sofa bed, one double bed and one single bed. There was no remote control for one of the TV's (different makes so could not use the same one), informed reception but it still did not appear. Plastic toothpick thingy left (not ours) on floor for whole duration of stay even though cleaners had been in, complained and got $56 off (one nights upgrade). View from window, drive through liquorland, classy! On the plus side, beds were comfortable, shower good, lots of toiletries, fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, fresh milk and biscuits. Nice little area in reception with turtles which the kids liked. Difference of opinion with the food from the hotel restaurant, curries were quite good but I'm sure you could find better, it's just convenient if you can have a meal and an alcoholic beverage where you are staying. Needs updating and I'm sure for the price you could find something better.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_249911059~“Does what it needs to but won't stay again.”~We stayed in the statesman hotel in a family room. The floor was dirty and still had a toothpick on the floor from the person before- gross! You did get lots of toiletries and the shower was nice.  The beds were nice but the pillows felt old and manky. We did not have TV remote for one TV and the staff could not help us. There are two entrances to the hotel. 1) through a smelly, damp and dark pub with a smoking booth, that stunk of cigarettes. 2) through the pub outside sitting area into the hotel. The best part of the hotel was the turtles and blue tounge lizards in the reception. Will not return :(~2~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_244061463~“If it's rating on food, it's poor”~We attended the statesman as it was convienant as we had many visitors in Canberra staying in the area. Let's just say I will not be returning to the hotel as the food was not to standard for the price paid. The service was not much better, when I asked to change my meal as simple as from mash to chips the waitress refused, with no real reason. Bar staff (one young guy) had friendly service, but the other women had no real customer service skills... To Crack a smile wouldn't hurt anyone. I can not comment on hotel or bottle shop.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_240201720~“Quiet and good food”~A nice and quiet place to stay.  Clean rooms, near to shops with lots of options.  Good food from in house pub.  Spacious enough, and Plenty of parking. Desirable thing which could earn more points from me.   - A microwave and A gym.~4~3~3~4~4~4~4~nan
review_240153623~“Good value”~Stayed here for one night in November. Great value. Upgraded to a balcony room with a double bed and a single bed. Room was clean and tidy.

review_232298644~“Great value and quiet and convenient location”~This hotel, while out of the main hustle and bustle of the CBD, is still an easy drive to most locations around Canberra. The hotel was very quiet (good old building with very solid walls and windows). Heaps of secure parking. Lovely bistro. The food was so yummy that we ate at the hotel bistro for both nights of our stay. Beds comfortable, and the room was clean and tidy with a spacious bathroom and shower. Reverse cycle air-conditioning ensured comfort no matter what the outside temperature was. Staff friendly and efficient. Also, only a 3 minute walk away to a shopping centre with everything you could ever need - newsagent, post office, doctor's surgery, chemist, coles etc.... The hotel also has a public bar and a bottle shop. Overall a very pleasant stay. Ideal for the traveler looking for value for money. One potential negative to consider when making a booking, this is a 2-storey hotel with no elevator. If you have a disability and can't manage a large flight of steps, make sure you request a ground floor room when you make your booking.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_231485578~“Best showers ever!”~Great find in a quiet location in Canberra...not too far not too close...but just right!

review_227404249~“Very Comfortable stay with Great Staff”~The Hotel is very conviently located close to The Main Rd through Canberra but you do not get any Road Noise. The Heater was turned on in my room when I checked in and made the room Nice and Warm, unlike outside. The room was very clean and comfortable. The Bed was great and warm. The only down point was the Fridge had been turned off and the Fresh Container of Milk would have been off. This was easily fixed and I could see how this could have happened with the Portable Luggage stand legs in contact with the Fridge Power Point. I do not drink Tea or Coffee so not an issue for me, but could have been. When I raised this with the staff the quickly offered to fix it and get me some Fresh Milk. I will certainly stay there again when next in Canberra.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_225227303~“Good Hotel with Wonderful Staff”~Stayed at this hotel for one night only, hotel room was on the smaller side but comfortable, the beds were nice so we had a great nights sleep. Bathrooms looked newly renovated, very clean. Very happy with the reception lady called Nell, she made us feel very welcome. Nell was fantastic & went out of her way to give me directions to a school event my son had to attend. Hotel next door to a variety of shops, Coles, Bakery, Newsagency, Cafe's etc.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_215884312~“Just Okay”~The Statesman Hotel advertise a free shuttle bus service to nearby businesses - on this basis I booked accom here, only to be told that the bus was not operating. They did offer to arrange a taxi for us - but we could have done this (and paid for it) from any other hotel. The bed was good, food and shower were okay, the staff and general amenities were just okay - it felt like an average motel you might find in the country - not what you'd expect 5K out of Canberra. The lady who checked us in seemed to have some difficulty pointing us in the right direction to our room! When I asked the bar staff what one of the beers was like - she just said "a beer". I'd hope for a bit more info than that!~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~2~nan
review_208307948~“Happy Ending!”~We booked online and arrived at reception. They organised our room however it was not made up. The lovely lady at reception then re-assigned us an even better room. King sized bed, balcony, new updated bathroom, lovely clean room that smelled nice, quiet location and secure parking. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. WHAT A FIND! The staff were really friendly and helpful too. We would happily stay there again.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_205411220~“Basic, Clean and Quiet”~I turned up here and was a little surprised as I had booked it online and wasn't expecting a hotel/motel and worried about noise from the bar/bistro initially. But the customer service was absolutely terrific, while it was a night early in the week I found the rooms really quiet. Small, clean and basic, and warm! The bathroom was small but the shower was awesome! I would stay here again.~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_197234856~“Not bad for the price you pay”~I stayed for one night in room 10 and it was a fairly pleasant stay. The reception staff were friendly on my arrival and pointed me in the direction of my room. Parking was very easy right out the front of the hotel. When I opened the door I was surprised to find the sink standing by itself in the hall of the room and not in the bathroom and there was a slightly funny smell in the room but other than that it seemed clean and tidy. I enquired about the hotels internet and reception printed me off a ticket with login details for the wifi (note-it says in the welcome log that wifi is available to purchase from reception, it is now free so don't let this put you off using the internet!). The bed was comfortable and the air con was powerful which is just as well as they've sealed the windows shut. I gave them a few pointers by filling in a room maintainence sheet that the hotel provided so hopefully they use this as constructive feedback and not throw it away! Overall nice stay, 7/10.~4~4~3~5~4~3~5~nan
review_196693290~“Convenient and enjoyable”~Location was quite, convenient and close to everything we needed. Room was on the smaller side, but being a small family we adjusted fine. The room, in particular the bathroom was very clean. Fold out bed was extremely comfortable.  Only problem was being put in a room next to the laundry, we were greeted with a 6:00am wake up call from the washing machines! A small inquiry to the staff about it and our problems were solved, we never heard the washing machines again. Staff were very warm and friendly, helping us with a lovely smile.  Wi-fi was very temperamental, but staff were aware of this and therefore waived the fee. Overall a very enjoyable place, run by very friendly and hospitable people.~3~4~5~5~3~4~5~nan

The location was handy to town and the zoo. I would definitely recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~5~4~5~4~nan
