review_475152801~“Another wonderful quiet stay.”~This was my second stay in three weeks. I was impressed the first visit, hence the second stay. I really appreciated the safe underground car parking. The indoor pool was the perfect temperature for an after National Gallery visit. My husband said it was difficult to decide on which of the many restaurants in Dickson to choose from, but all three were good. The one bedroom unit was very roomy, and had excellent facilities, eg, big fridge and freezer, two hot plates, and a microwave, along with a dishwasher. In the bathroom there was a washing machine. One could live here quite happily. There was no traffic noise, so we had a peaceful time here. The beds were very comfortable. Now for two downsides - the carpet in our rooms needed a good clean. And the bathroom fan was noisy. My husband hated waking me up each time he had to go to the loo during the night. We will definitely stay here when next visiting Canberra.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_474895053~“Short but pleasant”~We only stayed for the one night, and there was comfort in knowing that the car park was secure in the basement with security key card access. This is my second stay in this hotel and it does need a bit of renovation. There was a strong smell of chlorine upon entering the bedroom which emanated from the bathroom. A heater in the bedroom would have been nice. I would recommend the Studio room over the queen suite. The location was quite handy to visit Canberra City. Did not use the pool or the gym (cardio only). They do have breakfast that can be pre-ordered for $14 that will be delivered to your room in the morning.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_474275497~“Quiet location, safe and secure”~I had an apartment room which included a good-sized lounge/dining area and well-equipped kitchenette, bedroom with a comfortable king-sized bed and bathroom/laundry with washing machine and sink. The décor is definitely dated but generally clean, except for the carpet which is stained and needs to be replaced. The hotel is located in Dickson, on the north side of the city, and easy to find which I appreciated after a long interstate drive. The area is very quiet as well. The secure undercover off-street parking was a real plus, as was the fast, free wifi. The staff were friendly and efficient. Not far to the nearest shops in Dickson and easy to get in and out of the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_473290050~“Did not like the room”~We stayed in a so called 3 room Apartment, what a joke, it is only "ONE ROOM" with a cupboard between the king size bed and single bed, the carpet was so filthy walls and dust on vent in bathroom was so think it was falling off it, although the staff were nice, but the service part of the apartment was not there, we paid for this so called 4 1/2 star for two nights and I would not go there again. We checked in 5 Apr 2017 checked out 7 Apr 2017 Room 212. One can get Tinea is a contagious skin infection caused by the ringworm fungus, the vent was so loud when in operation, and walls was so very filthy.~1~1~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_463881175~“Needs badly updating”~The people at Parklands are all very nice, which is a positive. However, there are a number of negatives: 1. I stayed for 9 nights for business purposes in February 2017. Whilst my towels were changed when I requested this, at no time did any cleaning staff actually touch the bed! Not even to straighten the sheets and blankets! I've never stayed in a hotel or apartment where the some effort was made to at least make the bed. 2. The carpets in the apartment were absolutely filthy. It is clear that it hadn't seen any carpet shampoo since first installed many years previously.  3. There is a scheme where if you don't have the room 'cleaned', you can choose a reward. One night I chose a bottle of red wine, which after half a glass I had to tip down the sink. It was obviously a $3 bottle of wine bought in bulk. I tried on another occasion, where you could get some snacks and a bottle of lemonade. The snacks included a small block of chocolate, chips and some healthy nibbles. The chips was the tiniest packet of chips out of one of those school multi-packs. Basically, the money they save in not cleaning the room does not equal the $5 maximum they spend on snacks or wine. I'm all for protecting the environment, but surely they could at least spring for a $10 bottle of wine? The whole place is dated and in need of an upgrade, but the main points are that they should clean the carpets and have cleaning staff actually make the bed.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~1~5~nan
review_462813976~“Great place”~Stayed at parkland for 4 days and it was sensational, the property is beautiful, the rooms are great and roomy,the bathrooms are clean and the beds are comfy, the balconys are a very welcoming extra,we loved the place and will definatley stay again, then theres the front desk, the guy is one of the nicest people ive met, always smiling and wanting to help, lovely lovely man that makes you want to go back..we stayed in room 116.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459495512~“Comfortable, convenient and reasonably good value”~Parklands hotel/apartments is one of Canberra's older accommodations, but we found it comfortable, clean, and easy to find. We stayed for a week in a 3-bed room, and found the extra bed quite useful for sorting our belongings. Although the carpet and some fittings were a bit tired, the amenities (including a microwave oven) were quite adequate. If we opted to not have our room cleaned and linen changed, we received a bottle of wine (for maximum of 3 days) - a nice incentive, and good for the environment! The staff were all very friendly and helpful with our few requests and queries. The undercover parking was excellent, with plenty of space. Overall, we thought it was pretty good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459459780~“Nightmare from beginning to end.”~It all started with the booking. I booked one night through Expedia and then went to book another night but rang the hotel first to ensure we could stay in the same room. No problem! They would wait for booking to come through and book me in. Oh dear! This did not happen. We spent approx 1 hr trying to sort it out. We were happy to down grade. Happy to pay more. Even though the room for the 1st night was vacant for a further 5 days. Finally they took $8 for an upgrade. Oh and they guy who promised the same room "Gone to Europe yesterday" At 6.45pm we were told to cancel the 2nd night but as I went to do this I realised there was no refund. So then we were told. No we have to move rooms then. We had issues with keys and getting to the room the next day, were refused our money back from the refund. (which I had to spit the dummy to get back!). So this ruined our plans for meeting friends that day as we were late and had to come back to pick up our key for the 2nd room.~1~1~nan~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_447636929~“3 night stay”~The staff were very helpful and we found our stay very nice. It's close to everything.  We needed more room and thought we had booked a room with a kitchen and washing machine so they upgraded us for free for the inconvenience. I will definitely stay here again. The furniture is a bit tired but other than that we found the carpets clean and the whole place/room very clean.  Thanks for our stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447297937~“Quiet and spacious”~Stayed here as a stopover for one night, on previous visits to Canberra we found it difficult to get around however we found this place with no trouble. Room was spacious and clean. Decor was lovely. It had opening windows which is a must for me, and the cool Canberra breeze was perfect after a hot day travelling. Good extractor fan in bathroom, bed was very comfy. It was very quiet though there weren't many staying on this particular night, it may be noisy if they had a lot of guests. The bedroom looked onto an unattractive vacant lot but this isn't the hotels fault. Reception staff were efficient and pleasant. Undercover parking was a bonus. Would definitely stay here again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_447046462~“Bad experience ”~Terrible!  Old and not so clean rooms. Air conditioner was only for display. It was not swinging properly and far from beds. Beds are not with good quality. We were there for 7 days and for 3 days housekeeping was absent. Trash was flooding. Yaak!  They were not ready to change our room.  No views from the rooms. And creepy insects were lying everywhere on the floor outside. My child was so afraid of them.  Bad experience!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446505908~“No frills but every convenience and comfort”~Neat, fresh, comfortable accommodation with useful services such as undercover parking included, and in-apartment washing machine. Just the accommodation you need when you have several days of business in North Canberra.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444980190~“Pleasant comfortable stay”~We found the apartment very convenient and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped although the furniture in the living area was a bit tired . The bed was comfortable and it the side tables and reading light good. The bath room was a bit old fashioned but there was plenty of room to put toiletries. However the exhaust fan was very noisy. The washing machine was a great bonus as was the balcony, free WiFi and secure parking.~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_442703732~“Secure hotel with reasonable rooms”~Tidy room inside a secure courtyard which is good for groups that want a motel type hotel but still have hotel type security. Ample underground parking. The only thing is that the room's lighting was too dim for my liking as a business traveller and I felt as if I was working hard to see. The bed was comfortable and the self catering room I had was well provisioned. I was a little concerned about how to exit in case of a fire as the doors opened inwards.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_442261855~“Not 5 Star Luxury but Could be a 5 with a spruce up”~Good quiet location, short walk or 2 min drive from the free card access undercover carpark (a bonus in Canberra especially in winter) to the Dickson shopping and restaurant precinct where every type of shop, takeaway and cafe/restaurants await you. Reception was quick and efficient and my ground floor room was clean and well equipped for a short or long stay but was showing signs of wear and tear in places but nothing that was of any concern. A separate bedroom with a large comfortable bed and TV with a small but adequate ensuite covered my needs and the seperate Lounge area had a couch, another TV, writing desk with free wi-fi enabled as well as a sink, cutlery/crockery, microwave, tea/coffee etc. The outside central courtyard had several sitting areas and the indoor swimming pool looked inviting but it was closed for cleaning while I was there. I cant comment on breakfast as I had to be at work before it opened at 7am. I would be more than happy to stay here again~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_441852680~“Good except the carpet”~A fantastic stay in a well appointed apartment, perfect for our group over the weekend. The only downside was that the carpets throughout the apartment were filthy, which is a big let-down when travelling with an infant.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439113595~“Nice Quiet Stay”~We stayed in a Queen suite which had a separate bedroom and sitting area, microwave crockery etc so suited us fine. Lots of room in the suite and very quiet, even on the Saturday night when there was a family birthday party held out in the courtyard where the BBQ area is. We had no trouble getting a park even though the apartments were full. Bed was really comfy. The only issue we had was it was very hot and had trouble on one evening sorting out the a/c but worked it out for the next evening so all good. Convenient to Dickson and 5 mins drive into town. There's a guest laundry if you need it and pool which we didn't use. Thanks we'd stay again.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_438355844~“Another good stay”~This is the second time I have stayed in Parklands and, again, I was not disappointed. Our queen suite was roomy and well appointed. The bed was comfortable and, despite being on the ground floor, the room was very quiet. The hotel is well situated, within walking distance of Dickson and a range of restaurants. The reception staff was friendly and obliging. Parklands is great value for money and I would definitely stay again when in Canberra.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_436956923~“Great layout but a little tired.”~The setup of separate lounge/kitchen to bedroom was good. Well equipped kitchen with dishwasher and having a washing machine in the bathroom was a bonus! Yes the carpets are looking very stained and skirtings, entrance door and walls need repainting. So yes overall just needs a refresh.~3~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_434414732~“Very relaxing”~We stayed here for 3 nights in a one bedroom apartment, there was plenty of space to move around in and a little kitchen is there too if you choose to stay in. The bedroom has a window that you can open for some fresh air which I really liked. The shops at Dickson are just down the road with lots of restaurants to choose from and if you're here to see the sights, everything is a comfortable drive away. This hotel has a very reasonably priced breakfast to keep you going for the day, with hot and cold choices. We tried the heated indoor swimming pool which was nice and sat in the courtyard reading in the sunshine while we did some washing. There is security parking too. Everything is clean, comfortable and the right price.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433211617~“Just ok”~Hotel is in quiet location with good selection of restaurants nearby. Our 1br apartment was very well equipped. However, it was tired, dated and a little unclean unfortunately. Stains on carpet and couches were a real turn off. Dust on skirtings, trims etc. Bare minimum of cleaning done here I think. Accommodation in Canberra is expensive so I suppose you get what you pay for, but I wouldn't return.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433132265~“Nothing Special”~Tired and in need of a refurb, it wouldn't take much to get this place up to scratch. Rooms are OK but a patina of age that is evident in scuffs, marks, stains and damage really needs attention. Furniture is old, chipped, marked and uncomfortable. Bed was OK and the hot water plentiful but again, the bathroom was tired and in need of work. This isn't a 4 or five star establishment and the prices may reflect that. If you want a three star place, this is it.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_425116068~“Disappointing visit”~Check in staff are very helpful, but.... The first room I was given had no electricity so they kindly changed my room without fuss. I needed internet to make some calls but unfortunately the Internet is so poor I gave up trying to use it. This is very sad given it is advertised as free wifi. There is also no dining room as advertised so you need to walk for 10 minutes to find food. I find it annoying when things are advertised but when you get there they are not available. Check before you stay here what they actually have not what is advertised. Disappointing stay.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422334024~“Good Hotel Near Good Restaurants”~The hotel is nicely located off the main roads and with easy walking distance to the Dickson Shopping Centre and Restaurants. The room was very comfortable, clean and well presented. Reception arrival was quick efficient and friendly. The Rooms are based around a central courtyard with what looks to be very good BBQ facilities, plenty od flowering shrubs creating an inviting atmosphere~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_421983978~“locked in bathroom”~I got locked in the bathroom for 20 mins , managed to get out eventually . Then could not access bathroom ,rang reception at 9.30pm and a lady came up with a steel kebab stick to open door . Obviously this is an on going problem . Absolutely ridiculous they are too tight to fix the locks . Room was clean , but certainly nothing like the pics . Iwould not stay here again .~1~nan~nan~nan~1~4~3~nan
review_417747751~“Excellent accommodation ”~My sister was celebrating her 50th birthday so my sisters and brother in law and I booked a three bedroom apartment . It was huge we had large bedrooms comfy warm beds and a hot hot shower. The kitchen was a great size and we were able to cook up a fine breakfast . The hotel is close to a great eatery area and I would recommend Duck Nuts pub if you'd like a great meal and happy hour was 4-6pm . The staff at Parklands Hotel were so lovely and helpful . We never ran out of milk tea or loo paper. There is a heated indoor swimming pool and a great gym if you over indulge . If I get the opportunity to visit Canberra I would stay there again in a heartbeat !~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417651933~“Comfortable base to explore Canberra. Good value. ”~We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment that fully met our expectations and needs. The room was well designed and complete with a lounge and small kitchen including microwave and a washing machine. Beds were particularly comfortable. It's located in a quiet superb. Wifi and secure parking were free.  There are several shopping centres close by withlots of restaurant options.  If you have a car then Parklands is a great option to stay in whilst exploring Canberra. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417005357~“A home away from home”~Stayed for one night to watch a footy game at GIO Stadium, a short 15 minute drive away. The one bedroom apartment would be great for a longer stay, as it was well equipped with a kitchenette and washing machine. The undercover car park was full by the time we returned from the game, but we managed to grab the last car parking spot outside reception, otherwise there's street parking. Heating in the bathroom and bedroom would be appreciated on a colder Canberra night. Our access to our room was cut short when we returned from breakfast ahead of the very civilised 11am checkout time, but this was quickly fixed on a visit to reception.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413751375~“Will stay again”~I just spent two nights there and will more than gladly do it again. Clean, quiet, AWESOME SHOWER, and close to restaurants and shops. I was actually a little sad to close my door and walk away :)) Whenever I am in Canberra for business, unless there is some crazily cheap priced place, then I think I have found my abode.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_413440985~“A Hidden Treasure”~We have now found accoommodation in Canberra to use whenever we are there. Great value for money, clean rooms and an excellent staff. Cars are safely housed in a locked, underground car park. There is no extra charge for parking, unlike other places we have experienced in Canberra. Thanks so much for a hassle-free 5 night stay. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403369796~“Good clean motel”~Even though this motel isnt your brand new 5 star motel it is well maintained an clean. Thank you for a peaceful clean welcoming stay. In saying that I did stay in a motel room not the apartments so there is a fair chance the apartments are like a 5 star an newer like other guest have stated. :)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402264509~“Comfortable & convenient”~We stayed here for one night in the one bed apartment. It's cozy and well equipped with a kitchenette. We arrived at about 8pm and left early so can't comment on the facilities but there is a gym, pool and bbq area.  No room service on the weekends but breakfast available in the breakfast room. Continental only on the weekends for $14 pp.  The bed is comfy however there is no heating in the bedroom so on a night that got down to 0 degrees, it took a while to get warm. The lounge room had air con which we used because our toddler was sleeping in there. We hired a port a cot at a price of $15 per night.  Overall it's comfortable and does the job for an overnight stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400125350~“Great stay!”~Stayed with my family in a 2 bedroom apartment room. The apartment had everything a family would need. A bath, washing machine, 2 bathrooms a kitchen and separate living area. Couldn't have been happier for the great price we paid. Nice and quiet location. We will be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399117394~“Dated hotel with small bathroom”~I would agree with most of the good points stated in other reviews. However, I would rate this as an average 3 star hotel with dated facilities, small bathroom and poor layout. I made the mistake of booking a triple room assuming it has a kitchenette like all other room types. So, I would advise to check the facilities with hotel before making a booking. The reception is efficient and when we blew the fuse as a result of turning on the microwave and kettle simultaneously, we had it fixed immediately. Overall, I think it is ok if you are not too fuss about the dated facilities, but I would think twice about coming back again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_397052805~“great location - close to everywhere, venues, city and transport”~Quiet and away from noise and traffic although 8 minutes to Canberra centre and 12 minutes to Parliament House. Close to restaurants and shops at Dickson, 5 minutes to walk. Clean well kept and staff friendly. All requests and questions answered. Nice rooms with comfy beds and safe surroundings and lock up garage. Would stay here by myself and feel fine.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan

review_393043776~“Excellent place to stay for families”~Stayed for a few days and the hotel was excellent value for money. Very reasonable price, and excellent value for money. A very convenient location for us. We stayed in a studio, 3 bed apartment which was clean and well kept. All amenities are available, and they even had a barbeque (which I saw people using!). This is more like a hotel/motel so I would recommend for families as it is easier to come and go etc. There is a remote, locked underground car park and nice heated pool. The staff were cheerful and helpful and housekeeping good. I don't know about public transport because we had a car but very central to all the sites of Canberra but out of the city centre so was very quiet and peaceful.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_389300624~“A comfortable place to stay”~We stayed here one night in transit when moving from Canberra to Victoria. we were in a two bedroom apartment. Unfortunetly, we arrived relatively late (around 1815) and left early so didn't get to enjoy the room as much as we would have liked. Likes: - room was well configured, clean, tidy and secure. - free parking (also undercover and secure) and wifi - reception staff was efficient, friendly and helpful - good custoemr service! Dislikes: - If I had to pick one thing, $302 per night seems a bit steep, but nothing else really springs to mind - we had a good stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_388357628~“Impressive room”~We had a twin room, very reasonable price and really well designed (and big) with 2 sections and a kitchen area in between. Room had microwave, fridge, toaster, kettle etc which made self catering easy...though we ate out each night as there are loads of restaurants (mainly Asian options) with a short walk. Beds were perfect, decoration maybe a little tired. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_380189827~“An oasis”~We went to this hotel after an horrific experience earlier in the day and found the welcoming friendly and reassuring. The young lass at reception was wonderful. The room was clean, tidy and welcoming, under cover parking was also a bonus as it was pouring rain outside. Plenty of amenities and a comfortable bed. The 11 AM check out was a nice change and allowed us that extra hour of rest. We will be staying here every time we visit Canberra in the future.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_379606720~“Will definately stay again!”~Great apartment and very friendly staff. The one bedroom apartment with kitchenette had everything we could need for a week stay. There was enough facilities to cook every night and we were pleasantly surprised to find a washing machine in the bathroom. The bed was super comfortable and the toiletries were restocked every time our room was serviced. I look forward to staying at Parklands again on my next trip to Canberra.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_375360334~“Clean and well maintained, but starting to look a little tired”~We stayed one Saturday night. We had a 3 room suite, living room, bedroom & bathroom. The living room was spacious at the expense of the bedroom. The bed was kingsize in a small room meaning one had to walk around the bedroom door to get to the bed and the end of the wardrobe wasn't accessible due to the (necessary) bedside table in the way. The bathroom also suffered from being too small particularly the vanity unit, too small to put one's toiletry bag down. The shower was pleasant, the bed comfortable and the location is quiet.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_350099808~“booking”~Have just booked and cancelled Parklands Apartments in Canberra for 2 nights via Travelocity,was quoted $108.21 per night.Unbeknowm to me the quote was in US and AUS$,the conformation e-mail was $333.AUS$. On contacting the hotel I spoke to Nicole who was more than helpful.Once I sent her the advertisement she then spoke to her manager and they offered to match the price to $120.AUS.per night,to which I agreed and payed via credit card. I was then contacted by the hotel manager Jason who advised me that AS THE MANAGER he would not honour the booking. At no stage was I able to complete a sentence as he spoke over me all the time. A right to be heard would have been reasonable. Parklands Hotel you need to put this" manager" through a customer service program. NEVER to be a Parklands Hotel customer.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_340158878~“Very Pleasant Stay”~Got a great Crazy Christmas deal at this hotel. Wanted to go to the Tom Roberts exhibition at the National Gallery and Parklands were offering $99 per night for a queen suite. When I rang to enquire they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom apartment for the same price. The apartment wasn't big but quite adequate, very clean and everything worked perfectly. They have an indoor pool, gym, several outdoor entertaining areas and covered bbq area. Also there was secure under cover car parking. The Dickson shopping complex is a ten minute level walk away and they have the equivalent of Sydney's Chinatown with many Asian restaurants to choose from. Parklands certainly is a great place to stay and if you can pick up a deal like ours it is a real bargain!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Breakfast is pretty satisfactory.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_336740073~“Don't bother if you value sleep”~the room wasn't bad, it had everything it should of but there was a few flaws. I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms around me, and on the street and carpark. As a result I had a really bad sleep. I can hear doors being slammed and opened, even people talking in the next room. I'm listening to a baby cry in another room while i type this review. What a nice thing to wake up to.  There was an improperly installed flyscreen and now I'm covered in mosquito bites. This place also advertised a free wifi service. It didn't work, when I asked reception about this I was told it got maxed out by a school group a few days earlier. That's a pretty ridiculous excuse, especially as we're 3 weeks into school holidays. Bed was pretty uncomfortable for a 4 star rated hotel but i wouldn't be complaining about it if I wasn't so ticked off about all the other issues with this place.~2~4~nan~nan~2~nan~5~nan
review_330188896~“Noisy and tired”~Service-wise, everything in order, and comfortable enough. But the apartments are cheaply-built, and thin-walled; you hear people walking around and banging doors upstairs all night, and conversations in the adjoining rooms and hallway are a constant disturbance. As are the cars coming and going from the carpark. Room needed a good coat of paint and a freshen up, a bit stale. But it did the job.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_323328328~“Good value”~The Parklands is one of those rare finds in Canberra -- reasonably priced and handy to the shops, restaurants and bars of inner-north Dickson. My wife and I had a one-bedroom apartment. The sitting room had a sink, microwave and fridge. The apartment was clean and everything worked. The shower, especially, was a rare find these days -- good pressure for a great experience. It is probably best not to be too picky here. There were two wine glasses, different sizes. Cutlery was at a minimum, as was the crockery. But the instant coffee supplied was Moccona, not the powdered stuff. The fridge, thank goodness, was not stuffed with overpriced mini-bar items but easily accommodated a bit of butter etc and wine and beer. Supplies are available from the front deskill you didn't bring your own. All in all, a good experience.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_317650764~“Not the best”~Very small rooms the king size bed is actually 2 beds pushed together housekeeping leaves alot to be desired very dusty room floors & curtains stained scum around the top of the spa windows very dirty . The gardens are very nice & the secure parking is a bonus~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_316226203~“Nice place to look at but poor for sleep”~We stayed here on the weekend. I am reviewing only our experience, we might have been unlucky with our room I classify the quality of a hotel based on a few criteria with the most important being: 1. Is it Quiet? - Unfortunately not. We had random noises emanating from our bathroom and the fridge all through the night, some were quite loud and would wake us up. Luckily i brought earplugs so i had OK sleep, my wife was not so lucky. 2. Are the beds comfortable and clean enough? - No. Our beds were 2x singles pushed together which left a rather large gap in the middle, this was exacerbated by the softness of the mattress. I found the mattress far too soft but I accept this is subjective, however i work up with a sore neck and shoulder. and my wife spent much of the night on the sofa for the same reason. 3. Is the shower hot? - Yes it is, the bathroom was clean and we had our own washing machine. The other things that are important are: 4. is it well located and managed? - We found the location suited us perfectly. It was a short and pleasant walk to the Dickson shops along the nearby bike path and it was a great place to get anywhere in Canberra in a short time. No complaints about the management at all but for some reason the cleaners were still around until 5pm on the night we arrived. Our biggest complaint here was the car parking. There is free underground and locked car parking but there was nowhere near enough! We came back from a restaurant to find not only ourselves but 2 other cars stuck trying to find a place to park. The only option was in the 3 empty slots reserved for managers or the 2 Disabled parks or of course on the median strip outside the hotel! 5. It is safe? How does the place feel? - If we could have achieved a decent night sleep this would have been a 4 star place for us as the apartments were nice enough and roomy. Also, for some reason their wifi did not work... how is that even possible these days? All in all the sleep thing did it for us, We will not be staying here again.~2~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_314521624~“completing a training copurse”~Close to training venue shops and easy access to attractions in the city.These apartments have a great variety of rooms from i bedroom spa rooms to very spacious 3 bedroom fully self contained rooms on the top floor. Easy to access from the highway North and central to the city attractions and many restaurants in the local area~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_309600320~“Very flexible, great to deal with. Highly recommended. ”~These guys were great. We had a party of 23. Our bookings kept changing and it was never a problem.  Michelle was fantastic at the counter, friendly, always smiling and totally unflustered.  They allowed individual payments and checked off names of who paid. Would definitely return.  Rooms are very good, comfortable will all features expected.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_307989412~“Large room with average amenities”~Stayed here a few months ago with my partner and saw that a cheap place was available so we decided to check it out Pros: 1. Large room 2. Airconditioning unit provided 3. Enjoyed the local fauna and flora Cons: 1. Small shower 2. Location wise, it is quite far to the main city centre where the majority of restaurants are located 3. Parking spaces weren't plentiful so we had to resort to street parking~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_301280531~“"The local backpackers would of been cleaner"”~This would of had to been the grottiest place I have stayed in for years. I am not sure where the 4 stars came from. Our apartment was cold and damp, the kitchen floor had all the dirt swept under the fridge ( open the fridge door and there is a line of dirt). There was rising dampness in the en suite. you could see where holes have been patched through out the apartment, but had not been repainted. The towels where dripping wet after being hung on the towel rack over night. There was pubic hair around the toilet. The air con filters were black, they had not been cleaned in months. The couches where well passed there used by date, the arms where greasy and worn. For two nights it cost me $524.00! Although I made a complaint to reception and also emailed them about the apartment, I still have not heard anything back. The pictures they post on there web site is misleading, they must know how to use photoshop VERY well! I want my money back!~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_300059721~“Close to restaurants and shops”~I have stayed here previously and it doesn't disappoint. Very close to the restaurant strip in Dickson but parking is very tight in the evenings. The hotel itself has everything you wantt. It is clean and tidy - a bit dated but the price is right. I have to go to Canberra 3 days (2 nights) a week for 6 weeks and unfortunately they would not do "a deal" for me for this period so will not be staying here again. They were happy for me to risk checking internet deals each week, rather than offer me a corporate rate, just the standard rack rate. I am now staying at the Pavilion on Northbourne for the duration of my stay in Canberra. Which has a much better rate and a restaurant on site.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_293192921~“A bit too far from restaurants”~We stayed here on a freezing 3 days in July, we had hoped to be able to walk to the Dickson restaurants but it was just a bit too far in the cold weather (might be OK in summer ) the room was warm, great bed and safe parking although it was very crowded in the carpark ,(don't stay out late or you might have trouble finding a spot)~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_291583699~“Needs a good refurb and better housekeeping but the best bed I have ever slept in”~I hunted and hunted to try and find a better place than Aria to try something different on this ACT trip and was certain I had located it. It had some ups and a few downs - overall average, not hideous, but not fantastic. In no way is it modern, it is old wood furniture with nothing on the walls and my room had a big burn mark where a pan must have been placed down on the lino. I was very grateful to have a kitchen and I liked having a one bedroom that was finally not a studio to stay in. But the hotplates, no low or high as the knobs indicate, it eventually burned everything cooked on it regardless of setting. WIFI was dreadful and I had to keep on resetting the modem as it would randomly disconnect regularly, eventually gave up and tethered. Shower pressure was great and the bathroom was acceptable, even with a laundry. The pool was fantastic and even though it was a bloody freezing few days in Canberra that indoor heated pool was such a pleasure in the afternoons after work, especially having it all to myself, regardless of my gripes I would consider staying here again in winter just for that pool :). Now room service was just odd, perfectly made beds but their daily replenishment of room goods was never done properly, the tiny milk things were topped up one out of four nights and I had to go to reception and request it myself. I also cracked a wine glass and left it on the bench apologising with a note, they took the glass and the note but never replaced the glass. And they also only replenished the cookies only once, like the milk, this made me sad but the waistline happy. I prefer the rooms at Aria but this was not hideous.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~4~3~nan
review_291296499~“Close to EPIC, great service....”~The best part of my staff were The staff. When I arrived after getting stuck on the hume highway for over an hour because of snow I felt very welcomed. They were nice friendly and helpful. i asked for a dvd player the first night, and they brought it to my room even though he was obviously busy. The room heated up quickly and was comfortable. 5 mins to shops, 5 mins to EPIC. I was warned it might be a little noisy as there was a large hockey group, hardly heard a thing. I would stay here again I stayed in this hotel before, but this room did not have a kitchen sink. There was a microwave, plates, cups and utensils and even dishwashing liquid was provided but no way to clean them up. the bathroom sink had no plug, and when I asked for a plug it was to big. There was no instructions what I did with the dirty plates etc... the air conditioner rattled a bit in the room~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_289452274~“Was injured by their poorly maintained furniture with a nail lol”~Pictures are a deadset lie in comparison to the reality. Wouldn't stay here again, wouldn't recommend and wouldn't even give it the time of day. The bed is uncomfortable and is 2 single mattresses joined together, cutlery and glasses dirty, the room also had a bad odour. I sat on the chair at the table which had a nail sticking out of it which pierced my thigh. I notified reception who responded with shock but did nothing to rectify the problem, I also notified reception of my dissatisfaction over the poor quality of cleaning that I encountered - only to be told housekeeping would be notified.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_289450422~“Visiting Canberra for a holiday”~Room was not adequate for the price paid, room was filthy, queen bed was two single beds joined together, there was stains in the carpet and bedding, heater gave out a dusty smell, shower fittings were rusted ... I could go on. There are far better places in Canberra for the same price.~2~nan~nan~3~2~nan~2~nan
review_288454352~“Canberra Trip”~Parklands Apartments were really well appointed with a great layout and lots of space. The bathroom and spa were great and really clean. However, the kitchen needed more basic cooking equipment (eg a collander or a salad bowl etc). Staff were friendly and the location to the city centre was good.       ~5~4~5~5~5~4~4~nan
review_288038075~“Very responsive, great pool”~I was a bit concerned about parklands from other reviews. But after booking through booking.com they quickly confirmed my email query that we would get the bedding configuration we requested. The apartments were clean, bedding was good and the swimming pool was an added bonus. My daughter loved it even though it is July! The kitchen in the 3 bed apartment was really well equipped. We will stay again.  ~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_286983176~“Perfect place for a relaxing swim before dinner!”~Clean, well appointed and daily servicing. The indoor heated swimming pool was a huge hit with the kids. Great place to stay just outside of town to avoid the traffic noise. The self catering was a plus as it allowed the budget to stretch a little further. We will stay again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_286610682~“Pleasant stay”~Clean, comfortable beds, short drive to shops. There was confusion with my booking because I booked for 2 rooms and was only registered for one. It's a good thing I brought a copy of my booking to show reception. However, staff were helpful, friendly and easily sorted out the bookings. Overall, it was a good place to stay and would recommend to friends.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_286305490~“Caberra for 3 4 a week”~We went for a breakfast accom package The room was clean shower and hot water fantastic. Staff were friendly . Breakfast was good with plenty to eat. No bananas. Newspaper available. Internet was hopeless. Not to far out of the city.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_286245652~“A Great Little Budget Bolthole”~If youre bot offended by 80s decor, the colours peach & salmon, or some wear & tear, this is the place for you. Very basic facilities, but that's what makes it cheap & cheerful. Everything was in working order, & the place was immaculately clean.  Parking looks to be tricky - anything involving a horse shoe pattern can be a disaster-in-waiting. Next time, I'll make a point of swimming in the heated pool :)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_286200140~“very disappointing”~this hotel was very disappointing if you look at pictures add about 10 years of bad housekeeping and lack of maintenance both inside and out. We had to cover lounge before we could sit on it. Carpet was badly soiled and stained etc. we will never return and will certainly never recommend it.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~2~nan
review_285110418~“allrounder”~Great clean hotel, close to fantastic range of restaurants, not far to shopping centres, tourist parks, and galleries. The staff were friendly. The pool would be good in summer and there is FREE secure parking. ~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_284933338~“Long weekend”~Our second stay. It's not fancy but clean and fairly comfortable and the kitchenette is very handy. Very close to a great selection of restaurants. And why is this thing asking me to use 53 more characters?      ~4~4~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_284919183~“Two day visit to Canberra, ACT”~This location waa tucked away in a quiet street. The appearance of the apartments was quite modern. Secure under ground parking. Entry doors tucked in away from the cold elements of Canberra. Two room apartment that were spotless and comfortable. Nice and warm on a cold day. Small kitchenette but what more was needed. Will book in again as it suited our needs.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
