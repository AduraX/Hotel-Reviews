review_478454721~“Lovely”~We just got back today from a 3 night stay.  This place is quiet and has the most prettiest tall trees. I loved how in the morning, the fog set in and it was really pretty. We stayed in a queen bed room and it was neat, tidy and the bed was really comfortable. We had issues with not being able to get the free movies and foxtel however, i only queried it on the last night and reception was more than willing to sort it out quickly. I also struggled to get a good temp with the shower but i say this with a little humour because i have just spent the last 4 months in a city where its been so warm ive not needed to touch the hot water shower tap.  The reception ladies were lovely and helpful and we met the room cleaner (the other one was upstairs) and she was equally lovely leaving our room really clean and bed well made. There is a restaurant however we didnt go to it.  The soaps they leave are made from a company called "Soak" and i have to say were really nice to use. I have sensitive skin and loved them.  I think if your looking for quiet, low/mid budget to look at this place. I will be back. :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475451898~“Good value”~This motel is fairly new, clean and good value. Rooms are of average size but fine for a couple. Good wifi and a small restaurant. It is fairly close (short car trip, medium 10 minute walk) to the Dickson shopping area which has really developed in recent years. There you will find a wide range of restaurants, supermarket and other shops. You need a car to get around as you do for Canberra in general; one with a good GPS!~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_469726322~“Overnight Stay”~Family road trip to Coffs Harbour, stayed overnight purely to rest and revive. Rooms were ok, staff was pleasant. Breakfast was below average, would recommend eating breakfast elsewhere. Overall nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468432985~“Budget accommodation”~My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Tall Trees for one night over the weekend. It is a budget friendly accommodation option located in a suburban area of Canberra which is not far from most central attractions.  The rooms are clean and tidy however if you are looking for fancy and luxurious rooms this is not the hotel for you. I found the bed to be uncomfortable and the facilities basic. It is true that you get what you pay for.  The positives to this hotel are free on site parking and free wifi which are nice bonuses in my opinion.  I would recommend this accommodation to those who are on a budget or who don't mind where they sleep for a quick stay. The car park was full when we arrived so it is obviously a popular choice for many with the right expectations.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468161487~“Room for improvements ”~Room clean no problem but very tired looking , dinner & breakfast especially disappointing, hot food very poorly presented , poached eggs many broken, runny yokes mixed in the water not great presentation.

review_468024150~“Suburban location, noisy doors, echoing corridors”~We stayed in a downstairs queen room at Tall Trees while visiting the National Folk Festival. The site really does have amazing tall trees in its suburban street location well away from Northbourne Avenue. It was a place to 'crash' each night after returning from the music festival. Everything was ok until we decided to stay a couple extra days making a week in total and on our last night some Wollongong secondary school children had moved in all over the place. Plus teachers attempting to command them but failing. This property has very heavy doors which require sensitivity and care for others in trying to prevent loud banging. So imagine many schoolkids not caring. Then imagine three school teachers just near your room very early next morning talking very loudly and not caring when I opened our door and asked them to think of others but they didn't care either!!! The management wasn't responsive later on either. That's why we are staying elsewhere next time. Also the fact that it was a lottery to get a park when returning each night.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_466195777~“Can Do Better”~We had stayed at this motel about three years ago when it was in the middle of some overdue reservations. The web site indicated that the renovations had been completed, and as it was well located for the purposes of our visit we decided to give it another try. The paint, tiling and carpet had improved the appearance of the place, but no cosmetic renovations could improve the size of the one-person bathroom, and the addition of a large lumpy sofa bed to the room meant that circulation space was limited, and the main bed had been pushed aside, meaning that the reading lights were no longer aligned with the bed. The allegedly very fast complimentary internet did not work from the room and could only be accessed if we took our tablets to the reception area to log on, and connectivity was maintained as we moved around the motel grounds, but was lost as soon as we got any where near our room. Not much use for checking email when we arrived back at night after meetings. The pricing I was quoted at check in was inconsistent with the confirmation I had received when I had reserved, and fortunately I had a print out to show what I had been promised. Even so, the pricing was oriented to the high-priced Canberra accommodation market, and considerable higher than available at larger regional centres in the area. Servicing of the room was superficial, and rubbish on the floor when we arrived was still there four days later.~2~2~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_463957599~“Immaculate and Quiet”~If you are looking for immaculate grounds and rooms, friendly staff and love quiet this is the place for you. Close enough to everything and in a residential area with the Ainsle and Dickson shops close by. The rooms are well laid out, and the bed was great. We toured the Parliament buildings and the war memorial in our one day in Canberra. Needed at least 2 days to dom the War memorial it self. Beautiful city , well laid out and pretty.

Quite location with in residential region. Car parking is not a problem at all. Breakfast was fairly good. Staff is helpful & nice.

review_447296407~“Overpriced in poor location”~I booked this at the last minute and paid the price. The rooms are very basic and small and fronts onto suburbia with joggers and cyclists greeting us in the morning. I foolishly thought that this would be within walking distance of the city because of the name of the suburb. The staff were okay.~3~1~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_441468581~“Friendly Motel”~My husband and I stayed at this motel for 2 nights on the Canberra leg of our Trip to Australia. We loved the concept of the motel being located in a residential area. Check in was quick. The hotel itself is older and by no means "boutique" but the room (on ground floor) was clean and everything worked. We loved hiking up Mount Ainslee which is very close. Breakfast, was great. We found every member of staff very friendly and efficient. The gym wasn't yet operational but should be ready at the time I am writing this review. The only issue we had was with the hallway noise. It was disturbing. Luckily, it occurred only at night as groups were returning to their rooms and in the morning when they were leaving for the day. The rooms could use a bit of soundproofing. To conclude, it is certainly clean and functional, and reminded me of a typical North American motel - nothing special. Compared to what else is available in Canberra, this motel is perhaps just a tiny bit overpriced.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440985320~“Quiet location, plenty of parking”~For the price, this older style property is OK. Check-in was problem free, and the rooms have the standard amenities. The bed was comfortable and pillows were plentiful. Some minor details though that show careless housekeeping - a small piccolo of bubbly wine was sitting on the bench above the fridge - it should have been in the fridge, although I couldn't see it on the mini-bar price list. The items in the mini-bar looked like they'd been thrown in - all over the place. There could be more power points provided - only two above the desk, which means phone, laptop, electric jug, etc had to be juggled. The bathroom is long and very narrow, and has NO bench space at all. This is a poor design issue, and it's irritating to have to spread out cosmetics and toiletries on the desk rather than in the bathroom. There is some noise from the room above if you get a ground floor room - however ground floor is easier with heavy suitcases as there is no elevator.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~4~nan

Good location for the city, shops, attractions and my work all within a short drive. Bathrooms recently renovated and are clean and adequate. Tall showers are a winner.

review_428026915~“Beautiful room, beautiful staff, lovely locatiob”~I have to say we were worried to stay here after reading some reviews on this site. I honestly don't know how a bad review can be given. We arrived and were greeted by lovely front office staff. Our room was a family room ( queen bed with two sets of bunks as we have four kids). The rooms were modern, clean and welcoming. Shower was hot , plenty of towels. I was equally nervous about ordering breakfast having read the reviews on here, well once again nothing to complain about! We had the big breakfast and everything was hot and cooked to perfection and delivered to our room on time. The kids loved their eggs as well and said best srambled eggs ever!. Unfortunately on the last night of our stay our daughter had a blood nose and the front office staff were lovely and told us not to worry when we informed them it was on the pillows and sheets. Everyone made us feel welcome and our holiday staff delightful and we would defiently be returning when next in Canberra! It's also nice and close to everywhere we wanted to go and a really quite beautiful street location. Thanks to all at Tall Trees!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428318466~“Careful of the service factor”~I experienced issues whilst on this stay. Staff member on check in was as rude as i have come across. Issue with check in, not her fault however she did not handle it well. room was clean and tidy but on the small side but that is ok. Tried the room service one night only to find the item i wanted had run out. The replacement meal was very average. Overall as a frequent traveller i cannot recommend this hotel.~2~3~3~4~3~4~1~nan
review_425456068~“Ok for the price”~We found the place clean and tidy, albeit our room was not the size we imagined suitable for a family of four. Staff were friendly and helpful and it was no problem when we had to prematurely leave owing to an emergency back at home. ie no charge for the cancellation of our remaining stay The only unfortunate experience we encountered was in the Oak Tree Bistro on the first night of our stay. Ordered at approx. 6.20pm was advised at 7.15pm that kitchen had run out of chips which accompanied the kids meals and only sweet potato chips were available. No biggy, but they could have told us a lot earlier. Kids burgers consisted of a bun with a rissole of meat and some BBQ/tomato sauce. No salad, not even butter on the rolls. Our mains arrived at 7.45, (they had overlooked our entrée). A Ceasar salad with chicken was requested as one main. It arrived with croutons that were obviously bread that had just been fried, a drizzle of what was NOT Ceasar dressing no parmesan and very little chicken. The continental breakfast was so-so. The young guy & girl wait staff were friendly & ensured we were only charged for what we got. The food is way overpriced for what you get & I feel the kitchen/management need to pick their game up a bit in this area. Would probably stay there again, but would definitely eat out.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423712653~“Definitely not one we would ever recommend ”~This motel is definitely not 4 star but rather closer to being rated as a 2 star facility. Can't criticise the room but overall the service is pretty average.  One night we had to go and ask for towels which had been removed by the cleaners but not replaced. 3 other guests had the same issue on the same night.  The dining room is very poor. The diner menu is pathetic and the breakfast is just not up to standard. On one morning we were advised that we couldn't have tea because the tea facility had broken down and then on another occasion guests were advised that there was no butter available for toast as the motel had run out of butter?? The final and most annoying point was the feeling of being ripped off with a $15.36 Credit card surcharge when paying via our Visa card. We will return to Canberra some day but will definitely not recommend or ever book this motel again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421657459~“Very Disappointed ”~Stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night and found it possibly the most repulsive place I've ever stayed in. Our first room stank of sewerage and the air conditioner kept us awake all night. We were given to keys to another room to check the air conditioner to see if it was suitable. The air conditioner was nearly as noisy as the first room but at least the room didn't smell like sewerage. The rooms are very basic and didn't feel clean at all. The sheets were like tissue paper and the towels rough and worn. The bathroom is so small that two people cannot pass each other in there. This is no 'Fresh contemporary, elegant accommodation' as described in the hotels website and the rooms are certainly not 'sparkling or stylish' either. Please, if your willing to take the chance, do yourself a favour and dine in town. The restaurant for breakfast was laughable and we felt totally depressed even been in the dining room. Without a word of a lie, the antique looking toaster took over 10 minutes to pop and even then it wasn't cooked. All the guests there on the Sunday morning were lined up waiting for their toast and one couple waited the entire time we were seated and still didn't have it by the time we left. May seem trivial but you should at least expect this as an absolute minimum breakfast service surely. We only had continental breakfast so I can't comment on the full service. Hardly saw anyone order this though. The furniture and decor in the restaurant was disgraceful so enough to said about that. Makes me feel ill just thinking about it. This is in every sense of the word a 'budget' hotel and it's certainly nothing like the description on the website. The room rate was cheap but the website portrayed a much better environment that was reality. We were very disappointed and felt that we wasted our money and compromised our precious weekend time staying here. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421108508~“undecided”~Plus-the hotel is located in a quiet street and close to local eateries. It is only a short drive to the city. Rooms are neat and tidy. The microwave, plates and cutlery in the room are really good. Staff friendly. Minus-We dined at the hotel for breakfast and sadly it was woeful. They do not have a way off keeping the hot food HOT-The boiled eggs were stone cold as were the poached eggs as well as the bacon. The fruit on the fruit platter was minimal. There was nothing in the dining room to entice you to dine there again. It was very disappointing.~3~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_418999254~“Quiet, comfortable, excellent value”~I booked for two nights business trip.  I regularly travel to Canberra, and sought this location as it is away from the Northbourne Avenue noise and hassle. The location was an easy 20 minute walk to Civic for work. It's located in a lovely treed neighbourhood, terrific little shopping centre nearby too.  I was upgraded to the Executive room which was a lovely surprise, and a tasteful well appointed room. Occasional door shutting noise outside the room, but a very comfortable bed and i slept very soundly. I enjoyed my stay, was very comfortable and quiet, will definitely be staying there again next trip~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_418285953~“HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE”~Travelled with a group of 12. First night we could not eat in the bistro as they did not have enough food for 12 people. Continental Breakfast was included in our price. Bistro/Dining area was filthy on both mornings. Not enough staff. Second morning they had no food: run out of bread, run out of milk, didn't offer yoghurt on Sundays. Reception staff not interested in any comments Locked out of room two nights in a row. Changed room key after the first night that it didn't work, and again the second night it didn't work. Had to stay outside in the freezing cold until someone decided to help us get access to our room. They advised they didn't know they would have so many people using the dining area - well they should have know by the number of bookings they took - the carpark was full both nights.~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan

review_407629100~“Not as advertised and horrible customer service”~My family had the misfortune of staying at the Best Western Tall Trees in early July 2016. Hoping to spend the night in a nice hotel, we went by what was described on the Best Western Tall Trees website as a “4-star hotel” with “fresh, contemporary, elegant accommodation” in “stylishly renovated standard motel-style rooms in a convenient and quiet location.” Unfortunately, none of this was true. Our room (room 122) was tiny, had no shower or bath (just a curtained-off corner of the bathroom), had a view out the back of someone’s filthy backyard and a utility pole, and a front view of a wall. It did not have the “ergonomic work stations” as promised. As far as a quiet location, all afternoon it was overrun with kids yelling in the parking lot. For all this we paid over $190. When I asked the front desk for was a new room that matched the descriptions and pictures featured on the website, I was told this was not possible because the motel was full. Then I asked for a reduction of the cost of the room to something more reasonable since our room was not what was advertised ($190 is obscene for that room). I was told to speak to the manager, but he was never around during the length of our stay. I left my email address because we were visiting Australia and had no phone. He never contacted us. Only after writing to the Best Western headquarters with our complaints did we finally get an email from the Best Western Tall Trees. For all our troubles, they offered a $30 refund. Seriously? Is this how a “4-star” motel treats its guests? In large part because of our stay at this Best Western, we left Canberra feeling disappointed and conned. Previous to our stay at that Best Western, we had been at a Travelodge in downtown Melbourne, paid half the price, and enjoyed a much nicer, quiet, larger room with a great view. The Best Western Tall Trees promised much more for twice the price and was nowhere close. Just about every description on the website for this motel are lies and the photos look nothing like the room we were given. This was not the service or experience I expected. We left unhappy and since the manager seemed to be avoiding us and the front desk employees appeared not to care, we also left feeling ripped off. You should avoid this “4-star hotel” and find somewhere else in Canberra.~1~nan~nan~2~nan~3~1~nan

There is nothing particularly special about the rooms, but they are clean, tidy and well looked after.

review_390064738~“not for winter”~I stayed here with my 2 sons wanting to visit the sites of canberra - and it was a mixed bag. On the positive side, it was well situated as I had a car - would not have worked without one I believe. The room was large and very clean, the beds comfortable and . bathroom clean. The front desk and the cleaning staff are very friendly and helpful. On the down side This hotel takes lots of school groups and I was woken both mornings by them returning from the breakfast room (630am) - not the hotels fault, this may upset some people. Other than that I found the room very cold, extra blankets are available at reception. I am not sure about the rest of the hotel, but my room had one wall that was windows - and it was near impossible to heat the room. I had the reverse cycle air con on over night at 26' and it was still cold. The air con was not big enough for the space. The breakfast was for me the worst part of the whole experience - the breakfast room was cold, the food was cold (you have to give half asleep staff a pre pouched egg and have them heat it up for you.... not very nice, boiled eggs stone cold, domestic toaster leading to a line up (whilst your heated up egg goes cold again) the few pastries offered were burnt and cold! Having said all this I would go back, but only in the warmer winter months.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_389495336~“So noisy!!!”~On first impressions everything was great. Ladies at the front desk were lovely & room was very clean & modern. But when my daughter & I went to sleep it was extremely noisy. I turned the heater off (which was half of the noise) but then it got so cold & there's no spare blankets & the bedding isn't warm enough for Canberra in July. I then had to turn the fridge off as it was making the other half of the noise. Not impressed!!!!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_380421784~“Back Again”~I stayed at tall trees on my previous visit and was up to the standard of the my first visit. The staff are great and the food in the bistro was excellent. A little hiccup with the AC but was attended to quickly. Thanks again tall trees.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_376269901~“Cold room, mouldy shower, no hot water (to start with)....”~Check in efficient. Allocated a room directly facing the car park. Canberra is getting cold (May) and the room was freezing. Reverse cycle air conditioning warms the room but doesn’t take away the cold that seeps into the bed mattress and base. Renovated bathroom, glossy black floor tiles, new fixtures and shower but noticeable mould in grout in shower – needs a good spray with mould remover. No shelf space in bathroom apart from window sill nor in the shower to place anything (apart from a soap holder). Rest of room pretty standard for ‘motel’ style accommodation. Microwave in cupboard which is useful for a quick reheat of anything. Nice toiletries – surprise. Distressed to discover no hot water for shower – two calls to Reception finally resolved situation. Reception only manned until 10:00 pm (I think) so check everything before then! Mattress OK but cold night’s sleep (see note above); sheets almost threadbare and a bit rough, just a regulation blanket and needed the spare in the wardrobe. Pull the curtains too hard towards the door and there’s a gap for people to view in – peep show city – not so good on the ground floor with a bit of foot traffic past the window. Comical activity to close that gap up. Relieved the hot water was available for morning shower. Check out also efficient. Luggage stored for evening collection while I headed to work. Not much else around for eating options so a car needed to get to Braddon or Civic fringe eateries. Good option for Action bus - Short walk to the No7 bus on Cowper Street into Civic (Canberra Centre) or the Civic bus station. The streets are incredibly dark though once the sun sets! Didn’t test dining, room service or breakfast – not really interested. Couldn’t understand how the cleaners miss mould in the shower in a fairly ‘new’ bathroom. You get what you pay for. I’d pay a few more dollars for a bit more comfort which is exactly what I did the next couple of nights (elsewhere).~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_376259818~“Excellent place”~I stayed there two nights in 2015 on my way to Snow mountains from Sydney. This is awesome quiet place with so much helpful staff. Its cheap too.

review_376039045~“Cheap and tiny Rooms”~We stayed at the hotel and there is parking but not undercover and found the rooms really tiny. The bathroom is tiny and not big enough to swing a cat. The rooms with balconies out the front are bigger but more expensive $150 a night. The bed was ok and cable TV is on analogue so you need to change the input source if the previous tenant got it wrong. Be warned that you need a car to get anywhere from here as its not close to anywhere, but you can dine in at the restaurant. The nearest food and bars are in Londsdale St about 5 minutes drive away. Try the Civic Pub which is great.  There are better options for accommodation elsewhere for the same price.~3~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_375645184~“Exceeded expectations”~We purchased a groupon deal for a family room at this hotel. The booking process with the hotel was simple and pleasant. Check in was simple. We had room 219. Room had a queen bed and two single beds. The room was clean and reasonably modern with a nice large window looking out over the trees and street. The bathroom was fairly modern with a heated floor and plenty of thick towels. The bed was very comfortable to sleep in. We got to breakfast a bit after 9 am and evidently most guests were early risers. The dining room staff apologized that there wasn't a lot left on the buffet. It appeared to us to be plenty left. The staff however still went and cut some more fresh fruit and boiled my daughter 2 eggs, cooked just right. Considering we were expecting a continental breakfast we were very pleased.  I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374965394~“Cheap accomodation in good location”~Stayed here on 2 occassions during business trip. Price is very affordable and location is good close to everywhere. Bedroom is functional, nothing fancy but that's expected with the cheap rate. Bathroom is very tight and not many space for you to put your amenities. Drying off after a shower can be a challenge if you have a large frame. Cleanliness is OK but not great, on my second stay the room has not been cleaned properly. The manager was very apologetic and promised to follow it up when I provided the feedback. On my second stay a group of people made lots of noises at around 3.30am. Overall a standard no frill hotel in a very convenient location but my experience on the second stay has not been great. If you are very budget concious then this is the right hotel for you.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374632720~“Just not quite there”~This week I stayed at the hotel recommended by my work colleague as he said it was really good and away from the hustles of Canberra.

review_369454415~“Problems at tall trees motel”~The room was OK. Quiet location, breakfast was very low standard. The motel had been sold and the new owners were under going renovations. The staff at the reception area were under stress due to a very loud noise coming from the computer, they said they have been told that it won't be fixed until the renovations were finished. The noise was unbelievable, the new owner obviously don't consider the staff as being important. The cleaning staff stand outside the rooms and smoke. Not a very good look, we won't be back~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_368624880~“ACT Visit”~Once you find the hotel it is a great stay. Tall Trees certainly represents Best Western Hotel chain in a superb manner. Breakfast was excellent. Only down was the shower over the Shub being 6'3"makes these a little awkward. The heated floor made up for the shub experience.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_368015112~“The mini bar”~Check your contents of mini bar on arrival because they will charge you days after your visit, maybe we were naieve, and didn't check. As a family on a budget we carry our own snacks,BUT hey there's nothing you can do after.. they can have their $16 and loose a customer. Dont take the the family.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367065408~“Overbooked Canberra”~Why is it so hard to get a relatively short term booking in Canberra? My booking last time was at a hotel that will remain nameless but was not good. Tall Trees is much better but is still a pretty average place to stay. Room was comfortable enough, bathroom new and good, room service adequate but view there was none. Nevertheless a fair and reasonable place to stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365961227~“In the Suburbs away from the city noise”~A good 5 minute drive from anywhere and situated in a quiet suburban street. As Best Western Members we chose to stay here and were pleased we did. We upgraded from a standard room because on inspection found the standard a bit small for three days and our gear. Our room was large with four beds so we could spread out. The wifi was strong 90% of the time, enough for our needs. Hot showers, mini bar, comfy beds. Only negative was no trolleys to cart lots of gear to the rooms not accessible from the carpark. Other than that a good choice~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_363794865~“Pleasing experience”~Very quiet, clean and well presented. The only factor which I considered a negative was a very small bathroom, and no opening windows to expel hot air / vapor. Staff were very friendly, and leaving notes as required is a good feature.~4~4~4~5~4~5~4~nan
review_361372725~“Excellent value”~I regularly stay at Tall Trees for business and pleasure and find it to be excellent value. It's well located in a quiet suburban street but close to the city. The staff are very friendly and rooms are large. Plenty of parking.~4~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_361012763~“Another very pleasant visit”~Have been a bit slack in providing reviews of this motel as it feels almost like a second home. It's very nice when you arrive to be greeted by name - guess why it feels so much like home. The room was great, the location is quiet but handy to the shops and the staff were very friendly and professional. Will definitely return on my next visit to Canb.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359998555~“Good value, clean but too small”~A good motel with a few inconveniences such as impossible wifi - I gave up and used my phone hotspot as the motel wifi was poor with frequent dropouts.  The room I booked was far too small and uncomfortable for working in. I have stayed here before and had a large and comfortable room, so next time I will be sure to book a better room.  The motel is clean and comfortable and quiet. There are good shops nearby for meals.  The motel offers plenty of off-street parking.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358623901~“Correct that's it ! But not a 4 *”~Good welcome, the room ( We had a Deluxe room)was renovated in part but not all ( not the bathroom, and the furnitures who are old). The room was clean but the balcony not at all . The beds are new and clean. Surroundings are ok ( not that nice )and not fare from the center. Breakfast had nothing special !! But all the employees are helpful.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355838015~“Motels great for the uk visitor”~A good quality motel just outsides Canberra ideal for sight seeing. A reasonable price, the room has comfortable beds and a great powerful shower. a small shopping area with a pub and cafes all within walking distance.  A drive into Canberra takes about 10 minutes. We were on a holiday/sightseeing visit and thoroughly enjoyed the stay~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_354941144~“Best decision!”~We stayed here last night & Friday. We had a 6 person room as there were 6 of us adults. Really enjoyed it. Location is perfect only a short drive to everything.

Recommend it to anyone wanting something affordable and close to everything.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_351656052~“Very disappointing”~While our room was comfortable and attractive, and the location in a quiet suburb meant that we expected to get a good night's sleep, many details let Best Western down. We found straight away that the curtains wouldn't close fully (we were on the ground floor), so I had to improvise a clip using a coat hanger. Then we found that the bin still contained rubbish from the previous occupant, and the soap receptacle in the shower hadn't been cleaned fully so still had soap residue.The wifi was tricky to connect -- the login page would not appear at first, even with the help of the receptionist, and the connection kept failing so I had to keep the login details with me at all times. But worst of all, when we tried to sleep, was that the room was so poorly sound insulated from the corridor. Anyone chattering halfway down the corridor when leaving early (as people do) could be heard as if the door was wide open. Am I being fussy to expect this basic design flaw to be sorted out by a major hotel chain? Surely it's vital to have good sound insulation in a place like this -- one of the prime requirements. Finally, the night door was badly fitted so that anyone entering during night hours, including us, created a metallic screech which echoed along the painted-brick corridor. However, I can report that next morning (Sunday) someone was hard at work on it so hopefully this has been fixed. But we will not choose Best Western again.~2~3~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_351429032~“Terrific accomodation”~Spotless, all amenities great, staff so welcoming and cooperative, will definitely stay there when visiting Canberra again.

review_350672186~“Quiet, convenient, professional motel”~Room was pre-booked and available on arrival. It was comfortable, well equipped and clean. All items worked as intended and met our requirements. The optional Continental breakfast was a strong feature for us with a good selection if items. TV, phone and WiFi worked well. Off-street parking was available close to unit. Food was available in the vicinity, though a little lacking in variety. Parking was metered and overlapped dining times. The motel is close to the Canberra Visitors Centre and located in a quiet leafy area. This has become our preferred stopping place when staying at, or travelling through Canberra. We would, however, range more widely for dining in future.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_347998681~“Less than expected from a 4 star”~It was disappointing. The bed was very old and uncomfortable, the carpet was dirty with some weird spots here and there, the TV didn't worked properly. So if you're thinking on going there, I suggest you think twice.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_346397835~“Average -What the hell happened on the carpet?”~I use Best Western a lot for business and generally find them to be a reasonable standard. This hotel was Ok, but what the hell happened to the carpet in my room? What would of been a nice hotel room was turned in to something dodgy by all of the stains on the carpet. Seriously needed to be removed What redeemed my stay was the amazing vegetarian lentil patties. One of the best vegetarian meals I have ever eaten outside of my own cooking! Compliments to the chef~3~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_345728999~“Disappointing.”~Our choice was made because of location and there was a Restaurant. Alas, the Restaurant was closed on our 2 nights - Sunday & Monday - NOT stated on their Website. Then on arrival, paying for 2 rooms 2 nights, I was charged 1.65% on MASTERCARD. OK, I missed the small print on the web, but I have never stayed at a motel - and will not again - that has this surcharge. So, we all went out for ALL our meals. That was a 1st too - never stayed at a motel before without having a full breakfast. They also got the Newspaper delivery wrong both days.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_345076401~“Tall Trees great value accom in Canberra”~Excellent accommodation for the budget conscious not wishing to compromise on amenities or service. Set in a quiet leafy locale - clean, tidy and secure. I stayed in a 'Standard room" which housed both a queen sized and a single sized bed. Only criticism is that the rooms are quite compact, but the bathroom had been recently updated and all fittings and room features functioned perfectly as listed. So room size would be unlikely to bother most unless you were hoping to entertain. I purchased breakfast in the dining room which was sensational value for money and the food was excellent. All staff from the front desk through to the dining room were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them! Well done Tall Trees, I will be visiting again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_344334283~“Tall Trees”~Quiet location, clean with friendly staff. Plenty of parking and close proximity to the city and Mort St restaurants and Bentspoke pub.

review_343477550~“Good value accommodation in Canberra”~This is a quiet motel in suburban Canberra suitable for families or those with a car who don't need to be near the centre of things. I was travelling with my teenage son and although the room was a bit cramped, it was fine for two nights and we didn't spend too much time there. Main criticism is with the wifi which was included in the room rate. The user name and password were both complicated and impossible to remember, particularly annoying as we had to keep logging on every half hour or so when it dropped out. Wifi was particularly slow as well and I couldn't send one email with attachments. Continental breakfast was adequate but cereals lacked variety. Rooms clean and bed comfortable but some oil on bathroom door to stop it squeaking would be appreciated ! Hot water in shower was a bit erratic as well. These are picky things but generally I felt the motel was pretty good value for low budget travel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343380597~“Great sray”~Very clean, and the staff were friendly and very helpful. Rooms were a good size for a couple and three that share a room was still very comfortable.

review_343235433~“Great place to stay in Cnberra if you are with a 6m old baby”~I was very sceptical after reading reviews about BW Tall Trees on trip advisor. However, rooms are big, baby cot was provided and food was good. Especially breakfasts, they are healthy delicious and well presented. I mean they even have protein balls and nut trail mixes there... Or gluten free options. In terms of location it's located close to everything. 3 mins drive to war memorial. 5 minutes to Canberra shopping centre. We loved there so much that we have extended our stay for 1 extra night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342977171~“Quiet location not to far from centre of Canberra”~I booked using a prepaid travel voucher which I had inadvertently left at home. The voucher saved us over $65 on the advertised rate. Upon arrival I spoke with the receptionist who was more than understanding and offered the use of the desktop computer and printer to access the on-line voucher and print a copy free of charge. She provided clear directions to our room and the location of the restaurant for breakfast next day. Could not rate her service more highly. The room although modest in it's size provided enough space for two adults and was consistent with the tariff. We could not fault its cleanliness. There was a two seat lounge, flat screen TV (foxtel), R/c A/c (very quiet) and the bed (queen) was very comfy. The bathroom, was very contemporary, there were sufficient stocks of soaps, bath gel and separate shampoo and conditioner and the shower had good pressure and a shower head they gave a great flow, without running out of hot water. One of the better showers I have used. We went for the continental breakfast which offered a very good variety including cereals, fruits, 3 juices, pastries and toast and an espresso coffee machine. There was no need to pay the $8 extra for the cooked breakfast. It was a welcome relief to receive free WiFi for up to 3 devices (3.5gb limit per day), a service that should be standard but is quite often not the case. The WiFi speed was very good compared to other places I have stayed. I would definitely stay here on my next trip and recommend to others.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_342698335~“Family room in Canberra”~Staff were friendly & we had a great stay. We arrived late and they were accommodating with after hours check in.

Housekeeping went over & above for our  family, offering extra cooking facilities to make our stay more comfortable and easy with kids. I definitely recommend staying here. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342499055~“Better than average”~Stayed one night as a couple. The room was quiet, and the place was clean. The room looked recently renovated. The location is in the suburbs of Ainslie, away from the main road and not within walking distance of anywhere to eat. On the plus side that means it is quieter as long as you get quiet neighbours which we sort of had! The room we had, a queen, was on the small side for us though it is not that unusual I guess for a motel. The bathroom in our room wad particularly small with hardly any hanging space. Plenty of car spaces. Did not have that much interaction with staff but they were pleasant enough. Did not have breakfast. Nothing particularly memorable which meant it was ok, and fine as a motel. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339340923~“Tall Trees quiet January stay”~This is my 2nd time at tall trees. I knew this was a school excursion style motel, but I wasn't really expecting to get a school room in the front corridor, last time I had a nicer external room. It was dark and pretty basic. My main disapointment was that after booking for two nights I thought I'd like to stay three. I spoke to reception on the end of the 2nd night to inquire for availability and price. As I had a two day rate as it was, he offered me a slightly reduced price on that two day rate. Which was good. Next day when I went down to book and pay a different receptionist said the room was available but for the one day rate. I told her what I was offered the night before but she didn't want to budge. I didn't like this or the tone of voice. So I packed up, booked another hotel online immediately and left. Someone else deserved my money more.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339333166~“Not 4 Stars as claimed.”~Avoid Room 140 and 142, no draft seals under door so you end up with cockroaches in your room. Hair in bathroom. The sofa bed when open blocks the only fire exit the room is a fire hazard. Bathroom window is sealed. The air con can not be adjusted so you risk getting ill from it. Noise from upstairs kept you awake at night, no sound proofing. No staff after 10:pm tried the phone it was after hours call centre. We needed some fly spry to kill the bugs invading the room. The staff were unhelpful the next morning. I felt very vulnerable with no security on site after 10:00pm and people looking in cars in the car park checking if cars were unlocked. I was denied being allowed to speak to a manger, I said I would post my feedback on line and the staff member said go ahead and shrugged her shoulders and mumbled something very impolite.. Breakfast did not arrive as promised and was not cooked when I arrived at reception at 7:30am. I was advised I would have to wait another 30 minutes because other breakfast were ahead of me. On the form I did ticked the 7:00 to 7:15am time slot, I was threaten police would be called for non payment of my breakfast that did not arrive. I would of expected the reception to call the night prior to advise breakfast is after 7:30am and some more information the site has no staff after 10:00pm~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_338241952~“When is a bath not a bath?”~When it looks like a bath, operates like a bath but is in fact no bigger than your average shower recess!  We were really disappointed having particularly books an executive room and specified a bath for New Years Eve to find that the bath in the miniscule bathroom would only just fit one slim adult sitting down with legs bent and then not very comfortably . When I enquired at reception about the size of the bath I was told the reason was that it was an old motel. We have stayed at many motels of the same vintage and they have good size baths.  Check in was agonizingly slow as they had computer problems but the manager was friendly and courteous.  Apart from the bath the room was spacious and comfortable with a good size fridge (though packed with mini-bar stuff). Though for the life of me I can’t understand why the standard rooms have a microwave but the exec rooms do not. Maybe something to do with the perception that if you can afford an executive room, you will eat out or use the mini-bar.  I would also advise asking for a room on the street side rather than the car park side as people coming home late were really noisy. I acknowledge this was NYE but it think it could apply any weekend night. Also not much advantage to a balcony overlooking a car park.  An Ok motel but I wouldn’t stay again.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_337387394~“Any good experience was negated by apoor reponse to a potential room breach”~The hotel itself is fine and good value for money and mostly quiet. However one particular issue has to be said. On a previous stay at 2am or thereabouts I was awakened by a male stranger who tried to enter my room three times. I finally and firmly persuaded him that this was not his room. I was obviously shaken about what could have happened - and he was drunk. I was told the next morning by the front office staff the room had been overbooked by their night call centre. The matter initially was handled poorly and without enough 'horror' if you like at what had happened. I was offered a refund. However nearly three months down the track I had still only received half of my refund. I asked politely five of six times over the phone and a couple of times in person as to why my full refund had not been proccessed. To be told it had. It wasn't until my stay over Christmas that the manager said that 'he didn't know how he had missed it' (the remaining refund) a response I had seen earlier on a tripadvisor response about how he had missed calls from someones request to respond to his/her complaint. Clearly this 'forgetfullness' is unsatisfactory. My potential 'intruder' experience highlights the main problem of this hotel in that there is no staff after 10.00 pm. All calls after this time go to a call  centre but as to how to deal with any issues there and then at the hotel ie my situation, noise, issues with the rooms, plumbing etc is non existent except through the call centre. The hotel says 4 **** and it is clearly not that and should be deemed a comfortable though security poor 2**. Not having one staff member at the hotel after 10 pm is clearly a cost saving excercise at the expense of guest safety. It is a shame because the hotel rooms are modestly comfortable with good beds but that is not good enough. I have also pointed out to one staff member who at times can be sour that 4**** means exactly that and the least a guest would expect is not to encounter sour or an abrupt manner.  I would like to give the hotel a three rating but the security issue and some poor hospitality manners means it's a 1.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~4~2~nan

Although the internet is very slow. The staff were friendly and helpful. I liked the alternative breakfast with a good selection of healthy foods at a reasonable price. I certainly recommend this hotel for its friendly staff and warm atmosphere.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
