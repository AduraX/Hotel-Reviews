review_476642459~“Well loated”~We stayed in one of the apartments with four other friends  The apartment was large enough and well suited for us over the long weekend. 2 bathrooms and four bedroons gave us our own space but enabled us to catch up and enjoy our company. Well located in Kingston to shops and restaurants in walking distance. Good for families, couples or work visits. Will go again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473507924~“A tired property”~I stayed only one night, however would not stay again. The room itself was quite spacious however very tired. The bathroom was not that clean and the exhaust sounded like a plane taking off, with the ceiling panel lifting as it operated. The rooms themselves are all over the place and I had to walk around the pool, up stairs, through a car park and up more stairs before I got to the room. Lighting in the public areas was not great and so I didn't feel that comfortable, especially at night. The checkin staff were friendly enough, but not really engaging. Wifi was patchy depending on where I was in the room.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_470201860~“Great Stay”~I stayed at the Pinnacle apartments last week because I was unable to book my preffered hotel, but was pleasantly surprised from arrival to departure. I was greeted on arrival by a lovely young man who made check in a breeze. He was very helpful and gave me some wonderful recommendations about the abundance of restaurants near by. The room itself was clean and spacious, lovely modern bathroom and comfy bed. I will definitely be staying here next time I'm in Canberra.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469989159~“Filthy Apartment at a four star rating! ”~I booked this apartment as it was rated four stars. On arrival it looks pleasing and tidy but when walking up the stairs to the apartment my family are greeted with cigarette butts on the stairwell. On opening the door we are greeted with filthy walls, kitchen cupboards and stains on pillows. Grossed out is an understatement. I have spoken to Adam at reception who offered to replace the pillow covers and an hour and a half later still waiting for these to turn up. Disgusting accommodation and left with feeling too scared to sleep under the sheets. See my pictures of the walls for clarification.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469975419~“Good for a family”~A group of friends was meeting up for our annual get together and we booked 2 bedroom apartments for the group. Pinnacle is in a great location in a beautiful tree lined street and we enjoyed the local restaurants and Silo's cafe. The rooms were well fitted out and comfortable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467995025~“Good value”~We've stayed at Pinnacle apartments twice now and both times has been great. Good location, good rooms, comfy beds, great shower pressure. My only thing was that they need to wash the blankets between the sheets more.. When the sheets separated from the flat and top sheet the doona/ blanket had hair all over it and made me uncomfortable sleeping in the bed for the rest of the time.. Also our rooms were not serviced and we had to get new towels our selves. Apart from that all was well.~4~nan~nan~2~4~nan~2~nan
review_466689689~“Great stay”~We stayed at Pinnacle for almost a month. Check in was smooth the staff were very professional. The 2 bedroom apartments were great for what we needed. Al and the cleaning staff were super friendly and helpful. Very central and close to lots of awesome cafes. The only negative I have is the wifi needs to be upgraded as 90% of the time you couldn't even load Google. This was mentioned to the front desk but not followed up. Highly recommend and we will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465110978~“Great stay at Pinnacle Appartments Kingston - Canberra”~Two nights stop over in Canberra. Stayed at the Pinnacle apartments Kingston. Good location close to Kingston and Manuka shopping centres. A large number of good restaurants to choose from.  Had a one bedroom apartment, spacious and very clean. Will stay here again next time I visit Canberra~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464873653~“Adequate for a one night stay”~Firstly I would like to say the staff at the front desk were absolutely wonderful. They were friendly and professional. Check in and check out was a breeze. The apartment itself was a bit concerning. The sofa was well beyond its used by date. It sunk so much to the point that it was painful to sit on for more than a few minutes. The cleanliness was also questionable - we saw dead bugs and hair around the apartment. Our four bedroom apartment (which is supposed to cater for 8 adults) ran out of hot water after two quick showers. Other had to wait to shower after a few hours which is not ideal. The location of the apartments were really convenient and the added parking was a bonus. I probably wouldn't come back here again if I had a choice unless the apartments were upgraded.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~5~nan
review_460298198~“Would not stay here again”~The room on entering smelt like urine. There appeared to be dried blood on the lounge room wall, some sort of bodily fluids on one of the couches and stains everywhere on the carpet and walls. There was a pool of water constantly on the floor of the bathroom that I was never able to figure out where it came from. They appeared to roll up my used towel and put it back on my bed, only every second day or so actually replacing it. I never once in 11 days noticed that they cleaned the toilet or shower. The screens on all windows and doors were ripped, and the curtains I don't think had been washed since the appartments were first opened which I can only assume was over 20 years ago. I will never stay here again.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_455053909~“Good apartment and location but so many stairs!”~We are here as a family of 5: 2 adults and 3 kids, 5yo girl and 1yo twins. I'll start off with the positives. We are in a 3 bedroom apartment #67 - the unit is very clean, the furniture is suitable, the kitchen is fantastic with a dishwasher and fridge. The free high chairs are a bonus. Also the floors are extremely clean! The balconies are not clean. The rooms are ok, it's got 2 floors so stairs, tricky with crawling babies. The floor upstairs creaks a lot so that it can be heard in both upstairs bedrooms, makes it tricky to sneak into the kids' room to cover them up. The single beds upstairs were really uncomfortable for adults however my 5yo slept very well. Extra blankets are nice, would be good to have a few extra pillows. The windows in the bedrooms have block out blinds, which are great but don't go all the way to the ground so light comes in underneath. There's air con in the 2 bedroom upstairs and in the dining area. No aircon in main bedroom which is why we slept upstairs. The spa bath is tricky to get the 1yos in as it is a corner spa bath with a glass door. It's a narrow opening and a deep bath, again 5yo had no trouble. Overall the unit was very well set up for a family. Lastly I'll mention the reason we are checking out today after 1 night and not staying 3 nights like we planned. There are many stairs and no lifts in the complex. I'm unable to get out of the unit without my husband (he's here for work) with the twins as I can't get the stroller out of the unit due to stairs. I appreciate that this is a unique situation to people with 2 kids who can't walk but anyone with mobility issues or who is unable to lift/carry kids or bags would not be able to stay here unless they had help. Lastly, we wanted to use the pool but again in our situation it's not possible or safe to do so. It's a small pool with a tiny bit of space around the pool. There's no way to get a stroller in there, so can't contain the crawling kids, no where to get changed, unless we all head back upstairs to our room, with 3 wet kids. Also no toilet near the pool that we could see. So we are checking out today and heading to the Novotel which has a lovely pool and a lift, but granted much less space. Feel free to ask any specific questions.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453465527~“Weekeend stay with family in 3 room appt.”~Good facility overall with secure acess and parking. Appartment and facilities clean and enjoyable.

review_453353926~“Convenient Kingston location - prices vary widely across booking services - more comfortable than lux.”~Location convenient - walking 2 blocks to Kingston shops and restaurants.  Apartment dated but comfortable with basic furniture and kitchen utensils/plates for a short stay - 2 queen bedrooms plus apparently a sofa bed sharing one bathroom.  Front desk helpful at time of booking to request bedding configuration different to web options. Free Wi-Fi slow Free on-site parking is tight (small spots) and on a first in basis as not quite enough though street parking available. Surprisingly appeared to be partially serviced every day with beds made and new towels through not vacuumed etc. Shop around on price. Good for family or group for short stay when mostly out and about.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_451178690~“Great location, ok price, ok rooms but very average overall.”~Nothing is too far from anything in Canberra but these apartments are pretty well situated near restaurants, shops, parks and main roads to get in and out quickly. We had a three bedroom apartment with all the amenities that a family needs while on the road, kitchen with everything to cook, washer, dryer, kids upstairs and balcony to have a quiet wine after the sun goes down. On the downside the place is pretty tired and needs a facelift. Our room wasn't unclean but it was far from what you expect in a hotel. Cobwebs in every corner most of them with decent sized spiders, tatty curtains falling apart from time in the sun, bird poo caked on the balcony where they had obviously removed a nest from above but not bothered to clean away the evidence, etc.  Oh yeah, the WiFi was crappy too. Upstairs people sat on the stairs to get a better (lets call it usable) signal. Sorry for the harsh review Pinnacle but it isn't hard to keep the rooms in much better condition.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_449444482~“Good location, comfortable stay”~We ended up booking a deluxe 2 bedroom apartment after changing our booking. Although the apartment was not particularly deluxe, it was spacious and on the ground floor. The beds were comfortable. The location was good, as we could walk to Kingston restaurants and Kingston foreshore. Staff were helpful. My companion had a problem with a light not working, but she did not mention it until we left. Our room was near the pool and was a bit noisy at times. One afternoon we were sleeping, and a staff member came into my room with fresh towels. Presumably he thought no one was there.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_448740496~“Cosy and Spacious Pad”~This is a great place to stay if you are in Canberra for a short vacation.These apartments are situated in a quiet locality and is a short walk from close and other stores. The rooms are cosy and well furnished and equipped. The open living room and kitchen layout give a feeling of speciousness. The hotel staff is friendly and accommodating.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_447957792~“Disapointing”~My wife and I stayed 3 nights. The reception manage would not even make a good "Bell Hop" in the USA. He could not provide any carrier for our luggage and when I asked him how to get to our room with our suitcases he promptly replied "walk". There are no lifts in what appears to be a 3 story building. On entering the unit I saw the state of the carpet, dirty and worn. However, the lounge chairs were a disgrace. Filthy and when I turned the cushion seat over it was even worse, I would say its been a long time since it has been cleaned.In my opinion a charity wouldn't accept the lounge suite as a gift. The room telephone was not working and to contact reception I had to make an out call on my mobile to talk to the office. The TV needs tuning as it was emitting noises, the curtains were hanging off the runner. When we checked in on Christmas eve we were not told that our room would not be serviced and after returning to the unit it was as we left it. Although the unit is supposed to be serviced a notice advises to take our rubbish to a bin down stairs. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~1~nan

review_446670464~“A little tired but comfortable enough”~We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment. Beware the under cover carparks are incredibly narrow, door damage is guaranteed. The guy on reception hates his job, and will be so condescending you will want to flatten his nose. The apartment was comfortable, a good size, but a little tired. Its due for an update. The apartment had no toilet paper. A quick call to reception, and they delivered it 3 days later. (after 2 more calls, and a chat to happy pants in reception)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_433851566~“Long weekend in Canberra”~Stayed in a two bedroom apartment with my wife and another couple. Apartment is in a great location with a short walk to shops and restaurants in Kingston. There is also a pub around the corner and it is a short walk to shops and cinemas in Manuka. There is plenty of undercover, secure parking. The apartment was modern, clean and spacious. The bathroom had been recently renovated, the shower was roomy with plenty of hot water. Bedrooms are a little cramped but beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was plenty of toiletries, washing powder and dishwashing powder. Apartment has a pod coffee machine and pods were provided, a nice touch. Communication with Pinnacle was excellent, emails answered promptly, requests handled quickly and efficiently. Both the reception staff and cleaning staff did a good job during our stay. I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429494092~“Canberra spring”~Fantastic location, just one block from Kingston shops with plenty of cafes and restaurants and a short drive to main attractions; reception staff efficient and welcoming with extensive opening hours; secure parking with some under cover; apartment a bit tired inside with chipped crockery, dishwasher dispenser catch broken and plaster loose around some power points; high awkward step over to shower/spa although bathrooms generous and well appointed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429474291~“Very low rental with a few warts that need to be considered”~If working TV remotes and air conditioning in all rooms are important then this accommodation is not the pinnacle. Having said that I paid $220 per night for a 2 bedreeom unit on a Floriade weekend which was definite its point of differentiation. The lack of air conditioning would be a challenge during Winter or Summer however Spring and Autumn should present few challenges.  As with any organization some staff are helpful and some are clearly auditioning to be Sydney shock jocks. I would stay again given its pricing policy.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424212376~“Pinnacle apartments Canberra”~Stayed 2 nights. Clean and comfortable. We had a 3 bedroom for the 4 of us so that we could have 2 bathrooms. It was a 2 level apartment with 2 bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. The air con on the lower level was not very effective and looked quite shabby. Otherwise quite ok. Close to the lake and all attractions as well as the Kingston shops and cafes.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422304985~“Awful”~Pinnacle Apartments were extremely disappointing. The moment we entered the room, we looked around. Then left. It was extremely depressing, dusty, disgusting and dirty. The oven didn't work and the beds were not very inviting. It was so bad, that we left and went around Canberra looking for another hotel. Luckily, Hotel Realm was extremely accommodating and Pinnacle refunded every cent.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_421960100~“family accomodation”~Customer service was better than most 5 star hotels I have stayed in across the world. Things needing fixing or replacing were done within minutes.  3 large bedrooms, large living, kitchen and separate dinning areas. Air con in all rooms. Very comfortable beds. Walking distance to shops & restaurants. Secure parking. Quiet location. Close to city centre. Apartments are progressively being refurbished. Free WiFi. I will definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_421930767~“Exactly what we booked. Going back.”~Nothing is too far away in Canberra but this was located an easy walk to shops, amazing coffee and restaurants in both Kingston and Manuka. Also very close to the football oval. The accommodation was as we expected from the photos. You could say the rooms were dated but we knew that. What was in the room was more important for us and it had everything you could want. Beds were very comfortable and a choice of pillows available. Kitchen well equipped. Washing machine, and dryer were old but worked. There is a swimming pool but was a tad chilli at the start of spring. TV in lounge and main bedroom. Apartments are cleaned and stocked up daily. We had a 2 bedroom apartment in the school holiday peak. Paid $1600 for 7 nights. We would stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419650900~“ID warning”~Warning, they demand your drivers license or other official ID and they photocopy it. Along with your credit card details this is a dangerous mix for ID fraud as you will no longer have security control of this information. Refuse to allow them to copy this or simply go elsewhere. I personally found their demands quite offensive as accommodation was prepaid and there was no pre-warnings. I allowed them to view but not copy, but it was an uncomfortable and awkward moment.  Apartments ok compared to what is available in the area. Good restaurants nearby. Unfortunately they chain lock all the pedestrian gates in/out of the complex forcing you to exit/enter via main entrance, resulting in you walking an extra block to get to shops/restaurants.  Travel to canberra often for business. Won't stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419014650~“Great family apartment ”~As a family of two adults and four boys it's not always easy to find reasonably priced and spacious accommodation but we thought the three bedroom apartment fitted us marvellously. Great cooking facilities and easy walking distance to local shops and eateries. Reception were friendly and helpful and after booking on booking.com I needed a room with four singles which they graciously swapped on arrival. I would definitely recommend these apartments to families.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417785137~“A few days away from home whilst renovating”~Good clean 2 bedroom apartment, good facilities and services daily. Walking distance to restaurants, pub and club.

review_411596495~“Great location, tired apartment ”~For the price you can do better around this great location. Someone will refute what I'm saying but it's my honest opinion.  I know the bathrooms are being renovated, that's nice, but of no help to us! The 80s bathroom & very poor water supply were disappointing. When booking, ask if you're in a renovated room. Was -2 overnight when we stayed. Very, VERY cold living room with only a 4panel oil heater to heat the room (which all it did was take the chill off basically). Freezing! Also be aware you must do all dishes, wipe down kitchen etc or they charge you with a cleaning fee.  What you see online is not necessarily what you will get, photos are great and clearly of renovated rooms - not our experience with ripped filthy curtains, old (& not clean) oven/kitchen area, bathroom etc.  Shop around folks!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_407699270~“Weekend in Canberra the worst appartments ”~Sad and tired. Website photos belie the fact that this is not a pinnacle of anything . Maybe a quarter way up but definitely not what we were expecting. Bathrooms had towel rails coming off the wall. Cracks and paint off in the toilet. Air con only in lounge room. Small radiators for bedrooms. We had booked late checkout at midday prior to arriving and went out for breakfast on our departure day, only to receive an ago phone call at 10:30am to tell us we had to get out. No apology when we proved that incorrect. And they cutoff our car park entry at 11am so we had trouble getting back after brekkie. For the price we could have definitely done better. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403839583~“Comfortable hotel in a nice area”~Nice apartments with large living area. On site parking. Gym is not too bad. Has a pool but did not use due to cold. Close to Manuka shops which has some nice shops are restaurants. Walking distance to parks and Lake BG. Kids loves this place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402505880~“Great location”~Ideally located with walking distance to Manuka shops, Kingston shops & Manuka oval and a short drive to tourist attractions like questacon & the new & old parliament houses. We stayed in one of the renovated 2 bedroom apartments which are clean, comfortable & well appointed. Only negative was the lack of a milk frother on the pod coffee machine, meaning we had to heat milk in microwave - luckily there are plenty of excellent cafes very close by. Definitely recommend and will stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Roomy, warm and a short walk to Kingston with great food and specialty shops.A cleaner name' Al' was wonderful and assisted with extra towels and supplies - a delightful lady!

review_392703508~“Convenient, easy access”~Stayed overnight on a trip down to Questacon and snows. Apartments were easy to find, clean and had all the mentioned amenities. Had multiple heaters in the building for those cold Canberra nights. Undercover parking is good but spots were abit narrow for bigger SUVs. Great value and allowed for 1 night stays. Cant fault it. Would I stay again? yes I will.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_392381203~“Had everything we needed”~I'm not going to beat around the bush, but the room we had is somewhat dated, and could do with some maintenance. Other than that, it has modern appliances, full kitchen, aircon and stand alone column heaters for those cold Canberra nights, and days. Close to everything, but then this is Canberra, everything is close to everything. Most importantly the room was clean and tidy, with a housekeeping visit each day to replenish the necessary consumables. Only downside for me, was the lack of an elevator to access upper floors. This wasn't too much of an issue as we were able to get a room closer to ground level. Secure undercover parking. We also had a laundry in our room, and the WiFi access is free.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_391877622~“Ok Accomodation”~We stayed in a 4 bedroom. Shame they are on the top floor with no lift. They also have poor heating in bedrooms and very uncomfortable beds.

review_391640555~“Dirty towels & bodily fluids on the couch”~I stayed here recently with 4 friends for a weekend away. Whilst very spacious the state of the couch and towels provided was disgusting. There were very suspicious white stains on the couch and green & red gunk on the towels provided for us to use. After complaining to staff on reception about the couch stains we were informed a bunch of teenage girls had been in there the night before and that they agreed the stains looked "very suspicious" the staff member than said "I wouldn't be sitting on that" offered no resolution and advised us to sit on the ground. After showing photos of the towels left there for us to use with the green & red gunk on them, we were delivered new clean towels only to unfold them and find that they to were dirty. On complaining again about the "clean" towels just delivered we were advised that they had now ran out of towels and we were not able to get anymore. I will never stay here again nor will I recommend it to anyone. Nobody cared about the lack of hygiene in this apartment and nobody offered any resolution to the issues. To make matters worse we were also advised we could check in at 2pm, so we proceeded to do so, and then advised that the room was t ready and wouldn't be done until 5pm and "we were lucky it was even ready at that time as there we other rooms still waiting to be cleaned"  All in all it was a terrible experience and a very poor level of cleaning is performed at these apartments. Worst money I have ever spent for an apartment. Evidence attached of the couch and towels.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_391273374~“Good comfortable stay”~I read the reviews on these apartments before booking n I was a bit apprehensive. But honestly I couldnt complain about the apartment we had. Clean, quite modern, all the amenities one needs eg, washing machine, dryer, clothes rack, toiletries, towels, hair dryer n even supplied a face washing cloth! (alot of places Ive stayed at dont n I like to have one).  There is also a self contained kitchen with microwave, fridge, kettle, toaster etc. so you can self cater (we didnt).  We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment on the 1st floor. These apartments were in very close proximity to restaurants, cafes n local shopping area of Kingston. (@ 5 minute walk n less than 1 minute drive).  Close to all points of interest eg. @ 10-15 minute drive to Parliament House, War Memorial, Questacon (to name a few). My only complaints are: 1. Large ledge to get over to get into the shower as it is a shower/spa bath. So becareful as you get in n out cos u just might slip! If you're tall you wont have a problem lifting your legs over into the shower area! 2. The car spaces are quite small n not alot of room between vehicles especially with inconsiderate drivers who take up 2 spaces or park right on the line!!! Its also first in first served.  I would recommend these apartments. There is a bit of work going on in July 2016 with renovations n updates, but this didnt seem to hinder/interfere with our stay.  Would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_387356230~“Spacious three-bedroom apartment”~We knew when we booked that we would be on the third floor and that the property has no lifts. With my creaky knees, I wondered how I would cope. But the apartment is worth the climb. There was plenty of room for us, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus a sofa bed. It is a bit dated, and the sofa bed was a bit dusty when we unfolded it, but we thought it was charming. There was plenty of storage, which we appreciated. And the in-room washer and dryer were a great bonus! Kids loved having a balcony and stairs. Only downsides: floors creak in one of the upstairs bedrooms. One of the wardrobes upstairs had some torn up paper in the top shelf (probably previous occupant's). And one of the stove's burners is cracked. But overall, we enjoyed our stay. It was so close to the city centre, and the area is quiet (we heard none of the construction noise despite leaving the unit midmorning). Reception and housekeeping staff were very friendly. Would love to come back.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_385196399~“Dated and impractical ”~I stayed for a couple of nights in June 2016. I will start by saying the staff are amazing.  I stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment that sleeps 6 plus additional on the sofa bed. Although the rooms were clean they were very dated and in need of repair. The curtains were ripped, door screens broken and removed, bathroom tap in desperate need of new washers (tap continued to flow and i reported this to reception) and the toilet roll holder was only just hanging on.  Apart from the repair issues there were a couple of practical ones.  **there is no elevator, so be prepared to carry your bags up stairs. In my case it was 6 flights. **there was only one T.V which is only a little bigger then my desktop computer screen and located in the lounge room. **if wishing to use the shower in the main bathroom, you will need to step up and over the rim of the spa bath which is very high and quite tricky when you are wet. Issues out of management control: a apartment complex is currently being built across from one side of the apartments meaning noise drom 7-4. All that being said, it is in a great location with fantastic restaurants and nightlife located nearby. Would i stay again? The stairs have put me off.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_379500420~“Great apartments and location”~Very roomy, we had a one bedroom with full kitchen, lounge with sofa bed, separate dining area, bathroom with washing machine and dryer and a balcony. Only complaint was that the air conditioner used for heating was very noisy so had to switch off after it had taken the chill out. Bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Television in the bedroom as well, there is not much that was missing from this apartment. Car parking is available at no extra cost. Ample eateries close by. I would come back to stay here without hesitation. Also has free wifi~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_376399355~“birthday weekend in canberra”~Really good value for money, great location. Very spacious apartment and nice and clean. Very happy, reception even called me after our stay to tell us we'd left some shoes behind to see if we wanted them before they chucked them out.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_375324128~“Nice apartments in a good location”~We travel to Canberra about twice per year and generally stay in Kingston. Pinnacle apartments are large, comfortable and clean. Everything worked (a/c, wifi (free), parking etc) and the lounges/sofas and decor all good. This was our first stay at Pinnacle and liked it so much we booked again for a trip next month. Only negatives were minor - the high wall into the shower over the bath, a small screen TV (good selection of premium channels) and noise from the upstairs neighbours around 11:00pm~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_372737645~“Great location”~We found the facilities excellent, we were travelling with friends and it was nice to have plenty of room in our two bedroom apartment to sit and relax and also liked the fact we could eat in if we chose given the fully equipped kitchen. Loved the secure parking. Within walking distance to eateries and bars.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_372539921~“In need of renos”~The Pent house suite i stayed number 26 or something was 2 level top level apartment with 5 flights of stairs to go up no lifts, the pent house requires renos with holes in the walls, dated rooms, furnishings, bathroom, small TV, uncomfortable sofas, dated kitchen, a open space outside deck that is baron, i didn't like the spa and shower combo too dangerous for me. I didn't like the cramp car park in the lower level but thats ok i figured i park on the top level with more space to move, will i stay again possibly in the future maybe, probably in a renovated apartment i just thought this pent house 4 bedroom apartment felt less home like with the lack of furniture in the living area. Stay here for the hip to spot area of Manuka, Kingston and Griffith close to Parliament house.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_371152084~“Great location.”~Clean, good value, close to restaurants, bars, shops and supermarket. This is a great place to stay in central Canberra for either families or groups of friends/colleagues. Secure parking and friendly staff in a well equipped apartment.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369780590~“Average”~The location is great, with a lovely shopping area a 2 minute drive with lots of lovely cafes and cinema. The person at reception was very rude and cranky. The apartment was good and spacious, however you had to be a high jumper to get in the shower. There is a small corner spa bath and the shower is in the bath. If you have any mobility issues at all you would not be able to use the shower. I'm 5 foot 10, my knees and hips are ok and I only just made it in. If I had taken my mother with me there is no way on earth she would have got in the shower. I don't know if all the rooms had the same set up but I would ask before I book if I were you ( unless your young and agile)~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~2~nan
review_368948833~“Noisy, wifi is like dialup and aircon doesn't work!”~Stayed in this place, expecting something good, given the price. Although advertised as with air con, it only exists in the sitting area, not in either of the two bedrooms and all it did was blow hot air, not cold as requested. The bedrooms face a moist street, so leaving the windows open was not an option. Everyone coming and going in the place can be heard, with doors slamming in the stairwells. You get a code for "free" wifi. Too bad it is so slow it took 30 mins to open one google map. No choice but to use my mobile data instead. Car parking bays are also very small, with only inches between each car. Never mind how much I hate staying in motels, I think it would have been a better option. Pinnacle? I think not, think the bottom of a deep gorge.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_368321387~“Disinterested staff”~Very disappointed with our stay. We were there for the ANZAC weekend and knew it would be busy....We had a ground floor apartment which was fine. However the main tv reception was terrible...not able to watch any Foxtel channels due to pixilating!! Some one came in and looked at it and said I.T. would look at it...nothing came of that. When we gave our list of issues to Adam he showed little emotion and no apology! Our list was: One couch that was the sofa bed had no foam or inlay to stop people sinking into the bed frame...Adam said that's how they come from the store!!! I have seen many sofa bed couches and have never seen one like that! Lamp in main bedroom broken. Hot water in shower would randomly become scoldingly hot! Dangerous! The shower door didn't close properly and water ran down onto the floor. Inadequate crockery for 4 adults. Noisy young people staying for music festival and don't think anyone spoke to them about their behaviour and pile of beer bottles around the tree at the front of the apartments!  I think the biggest issue we had is that we (4 of of us agreed) that Adam could care less about the issues we mentioned on our departure! I'm not staying there again!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367107545~“Good location but tired apartment.”~We met up with family from sydney for a long weekend. After a mix up with the room they confirmed our booking. We were on the third floor and with no lifts was an effort with luggage in and out. The apartment itself was clean and tidy but could do with a refurb if they want 4 star. Very convenient for restaurants in kingston and a nice park 5 mins walk away for the kids.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367039730~“Noisy worse than a backpackers”~We stayed here 24th April 2016 and paid $294 for 2 bdrm apartment. The rooms have no sound proofing and all i could hear all night was the upper level gate opening and closing and people talking upstairs/next door and banging doors. Awful had no sleep. Only compensation was i didn't have to wake up for Anzac Dawn Service as I was awake already. Had 3 technology remotes but only i TV so not sure what others were for. Doors to bedroom didn't close properly. Very disappointing.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365511719~“Spacious apartment close to amenities”~Clean and spacious apartment close to cafes and shops and the playground at Telopea park for the kids. Quiet location. The only negative was the noisy fan in the toilet. It has a timer type button so you can't just turn it off.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365283893~“Family Friendly Easter Getaway”~Pinnacle Apartments was the ideal location for our family Easter Getaway for Grandma, Mum and Dad and the kids. With a roomy two bedroom apartment with cooking and laundry facilities we could all unwind over the Easter break while staying at a venue with a quiet relaxed village vibe. Just around the corner from Kingston shops, it was an easy walk for our morning latte's before starting a day of catching up with family and seeing some of Canberra's best attractions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365180513~“Comfortable quality at an affordable price.”~Pinnacle apartments won't win any prizes for being the plushest of apartments but they are comfortable, spacious, free car parking and cleaned daily (which was a pleasant surprise) as well as restocking the "luxury items" (tea bags, coffee, soap, shampoo etc.) on a daily basis. There are plenty of electrical sockets but there is a lack of USB points available due to no modern digital equipment (analogue TV and no stereo). Dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer are also supplied with required powders so no extras need to be purchased (not a great out lay but one less thing to worry about on holiday).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_364013857~“Family Weekend Away”~Great apartment, nice and roomy, neat & tidy. 2 bathrooms which was awesome. 5 mins from the city so good location, close to shopping (IGA) etc. Self contained with everything we needed on hand. Will def stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_361932744~“1 night in Canberra”~great facility close to everything, large rooms with everything you could need. We had a spa in our bathroom but the jets didn't work. great place to stay for a family of 6. Was a short drive to all the tourist attractions and shopping and restaurants a short walk away.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_361381389~“Reasonable place to stay”~Reasonable location and apartments. Quite cold in July, as the only real heating came from an aircon in the front room, whose heat didn't reach the main bedroom. But clean and well serviced overall. Friendly and helpful staff.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_361371732~“Great location, average accommodation”~Shabby lounge, no plugs in bathroom or kitchen and we booked a four bedroom apartment for three nights....2 queen rooms and 2 rooms with two single beds each. When we checked in they said it was one queen and three rooms with the two beds in each...same number of people can stay but not what we booked. When I complained they said I should read the small print and it was subject to change...never had this happen to me anywhere else. If you book your rooms to suit you, you should get what you pay for. Very slow wifi.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_359663213~“Noisy near the carpark”~Stayed here for three nights over the Easter weekend in a row bedroom apartment. Well appointed with a full kitchen, bathroom, laundry, dining and living area. Overall the apartment could do with an update especially the bathroom which has a shower over a corner spa and is quite difficult to get in and out of. The cleaner came each day to freshen towels and empty bins. The other main complaint was that our apartment was over the top car park and was extremely noisy. Others guests could be heard coming and going at all hours so our sleep was disrupted. Other rooms may not have this problem though.  The location was close to the Kingston shops (one block away). Also quite close to Manuka shops. Reception was quite helpful in recommending restaurants nearby. We would probably stay here again but request an part meant away from the car park.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359525939~“a good fine”~The 3 bedroom apartment provided an extensive lounge room and the bedrooms are more than adequate. The facilities are fine but are getting a little tired. A great location within walking distance of tourist attractions on the south side of the lake~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359214713~“Comfortable, clean but short stay only”~Stayed here Easter 2016. We had a 3 bedroom apartment, 4 adults, 2 teens 2 nights. This is the noisiest place I have ever stayed. All apartment face a central parking area so it echoes. The screaming kids, doors closing, keys dropping, even walking up stairs echoed thru. No parking had to park on the street. I would hate to imagine it in Christmas holidays when full.  The room had squeaky floorboards, couldn't be downstairs and hear the TV with kids upstairs. It was clean and well appointed, had everything you need and wanted. Good size rooms, bed comfortable. But the noise drove me insane, inconsiderate parents who don't control their screaming kids. The bowl in which was a car park echoing noise thru every room, squeeky floors, possum or freddy Kruger in the ceiling made me disappointed.  Otherwise the location, the facilities and the actual apartment where all fine. Wifi not great, couldn't get signal strength, not enough to parking at peak times. But would be fine when not full.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_357743008~“Good for families”~Clean modern rooms. Great shower well equipped kitchen. Plenty of space in the living area. Very comfy beds. We would recommend for families. It is also very close to attractions ie markets Kingston restaurants and cafes. We'll go back again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_357687263~“Canberra balloon festival”~Location was ideal in the Kingston area, plenty of cafes and IGA store, close to the foreshore and Old Bus Depot markets and glasshouse. Secure onsite parking and fully self contained kitchen and laundry facilities in bathroom~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356862078~“Strongly recommended when you are in Can”~I have been to Canberra twice. In the first time, I felt it is a good place to live, quiet and not far away from the parliament house. On February, my parents and I travelled to Can again. At first, I decided to live in a city apartment (I cannot tell you what the name is), that was a nightmare, and I decided to move out and back to Pinnacle the second morning. At my second night in Canberra, we really had a wonderful stay in Pinnacle. So I strongly recommend, if someone want to live in a quiet place, you can choose this one.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_355914937~“A PLACE OF MUCH INTEREST”~I recently attended a two day conference in Canberra. I chose to stay in the Kingston area as it was close to the railway station as I arrived by train and was well serviced by bus to the city centre for my attendances and a $30 taxi ride to the airport for my intended departure by hire car which is the only place in Canberra from which you may hire a car on a Sunday.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_354222434~“apartment in great location”~Spacious apartment with kitchen in location close to restaurants and shops. As we were friends traveling together we appreciated a separate toilet to the bathroom. As it was a really warm weekend the pool was refreshing plus it was great to have air conditioning in our room. Overall a comfortable apartment with plenty of space and secure parking.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353949650~“Worth the trip”~I had 20+ people in my apartment for a hens day and it was great! Spacious and lovely! The security staff were really nice although the reception staff member wasn't at the desk very often. I rang a few times and went down and no one was ever available~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352705065~“Good Value,Good location”~We were 3 couples on a mid week 3 night stay in a 3 bedroom apartment #61. It's on the top floor so a 3 story walk up which didn't bother us unduly. Good exercise but not for the disabled. The place was clean and tidy. Main bedroom bathroom on the living level and two bedrooms with bathroom upstairs. 2 x single Beds in each room with quality linen. I think our bathrooms may have been renovated. Kitchen lounge dining downstairs adequate but 2 x 2 seater lounges not really adequate for 6 adults but I read they are to be replaced. This is walking distance to both Manuka and Kingston shops and a little further on a walk to the cafes on the waterfront lake. Great location. Secure car park with plenty of spaces as it wasn't busy but I imagine when completely full it would be an issue. It was good value and I would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352246130~“Tired but ok”~Its in a good location and has good amenities ie pool etc however the rooms were pretty run down and to be honest we expected a higher quality unit based on price. Furnishings and kitchen very dated. The place was busy with what looked like sports teams. Not sure if that's the norm. Lots of alternatives around Canberra.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_349304140~“Ho hum ....”~Despite booking 6 months in advance, we ended up with a bottom storey room which was dark and dingy - they were heavily booked with sports teams, and maybe the upstairs rooms were brighter. The room was clean enough but nothing special. Staff were helpful (after a reminder) when locating the missing clothes airer from the room. The entrance to the complex / office is not readily seen from the street.  For the price, I expected more, however perhaps that's Canberra's pricing structure, and this was my first visit. I would try somewhere else next time.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_348354707~“Spacious apartments in good position”~Stayed in two bedroom apartment for one night. Very comfortable and safe apartment within walking distance to Manuka shops and restaurants. Furnishing little dated but sufficient. No WiFi available. We were lucky to have GPS as the place is not easy to find with the little map provided.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343897605~“Great Apartment”~We booked through Travel Zoo for a short stay in Canberra.  We booked the 2 bedroom apartment #31 and it was perfect. Clean, spacious and if we could have we would have stayed longer. The kitchen was well equipped and the beds in the rooms we comfy.  The laundry facilities in the apartment would have also been great for a longer stay but we didn't require them. We had a shower bath which included a spa bath.  Would stay again for sure!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343896170~“better than we thought”~The apartment was really roomy and spacious. The quality of the fittings were excellent. the bed was so comfortable,it was the best nights sleep we've had. It was a shame to leave, I hope to be back. If you were to try and pick a negative, it would be that the top floors were serviced by stair wells, not an elevator. in saying this, it was not too much an inconvenience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343892751~“Great place to stay for a family weekend”~A good hotel location wise, almost every attraction within 20 minutes. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Kingston shops with about 20 different type of restaurants and cafes. The room (a 2 bedroom) was a little unclean and the plumbing was god awful but with a nice pool and lots of friendly families around it was a hit with the kids. The dryer stopped working but it was replaced within a few hours. Excellent stuff. Finally, the guy at the front desk was exceptional, he was very responsive to assistance for a new key (which we ended up not needing) and getting our dryer sorted. Thanks again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_343696269~“Cancon visit”~This was a returned trip to the apartments we like it as the rooms are clean a good size free wifi close to Coles and walking distance to great restaurants and cafes and a pub. It has a pool and all rooms have a spa. Close to a lot of the main attractions in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343441701~“Stay somewhere else”~Booked a 3 bedroom apartment with a group of 4 guys and even though we were confirmed for 5 beds, the apartment we were given was only 3 double beds. One of the guys tried to sleep on the sofa but couldn't sleep well and pretty much ruined his weekend. Many other problems with this accommodation also. Staff unhelpful, promised a call back and a refund and this didn't happen. Stay elsewhere.~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
