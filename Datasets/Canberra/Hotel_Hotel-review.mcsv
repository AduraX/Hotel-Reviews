review_477844409~“Aesthetics over functionality ”~Passing through when we decided to splurge on a night at a hotel. After reading reviews from other guests it was worth a shot. The reception was hard to find but the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are set off in different directions and nestled on top of a cinema which show the latest movies. The room itself was nice as we had chosen the "creative room". The negatives we found were the over head shower wasn't working and the milk in the fridge had ballooned out. Hotel staff were apologetic on both issues. The hotel had room service with a quircky menu. Would have been nice for more regular and basic foods like bacon and eggs or pizza.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477291644~“Style, comfort and service”~Our stay at Hotel Hotel was brilliant. The location was perfect, the staff awesome and the valet brought our car up whenever we needed quickly, so quickly we didn't get a chance to sit in the comfy lobby flicking through the library. The room was just stunning! And the cocktails a joy. Plenty of places to eat just a short walk away if Monster Kitchen is not your thing (or you have a fussy 7 year old with you). And you can take an awesome walk along the lake if you like or grab a bike. It is just brilliant.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476925589~“A unique and exciting hotel”~I was absolutely taken aback by the concept that has been applied to not only the hotel but all aspects of my stay. A organic and environmental twist had been applied to the face of my stay, open grain textures, smooth supple leather and an open fire greet you at checkin. My room carries the timber and leather feel as well as some warm furry blankets and by far the most comfortable bed I've slept on in a while. The toiletries and mini bar also allow you to forget you are in the nations capital with their organic natural origins. This is carried on downstairs at the Monster restaurant, with a nearly Heston Blumenthal scientific application of gastronomy to your meal. Breakfast was no different and as I sit here drinking my freshly juiced OJ awaiting my buffalo mozzarella, figs and bruschetta meal, I recall that upon checking out the staff reminded me that they would be happy to look after me on my next stay with a phone call booking. It may be something that is always implied upon checking out but I already knew I'd be coming back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476713291~“Nishi apartments”~These apartments are pretty cool and located in New Acton, so plenty to do within the immediate area. I love the whole environmental concept with use of natural air flow instead of air con. The only issue is that the apartments back onto Parkes Way which means leaving the door open is very noisy all night, not a problem if you're not staying in summer. Other than that, the apartments have everything possibly needed with retro style furniture and great design. Hotel Hotel is great for a drink or two and other places are walkable if you want to go out. Great staff and service. Would definitely come back.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476653558~“Modern hotel with a twist”~Located in the hip and trendy NewActon precinct, Hotel Hotel shares its address with the striking Nishi building housing apartments and commercial spaces. The first thing that grabs your attention as you enter the building has to be the awe-inspiring, instagram-famous, timber plank staircase. Designed by March Studio, thousands of pieces of recycled wood (2,250 to be exact) embrace the lobby, decorating the walls and ceilings in irregular patterns and it is surprisingly mesmerising to look at. Hotel reception is located upstairs next to the hotel’s restaurant, Monster Kitchen & Bar. We arrived early and left our luggage with the hotel before headed over to A.Baker for a light lunch. The hotel has four different types of rooms, Cosy, Original, Creative and Meandering. The Meandering Room that we stayed at is the largest of the lot, albeit slightly oddly shaped (as the name appropriately suggests). Taking inspiration from the iconic Australian shack, the design of the room isn’t your typical hotel room, think exposed concrete, wood and faux fur. Artificial lights flood the room as the only window in the room provides a view to the internal rainforest courtyard. If you prefer bright, airy hotel rooms, the Meandering Room perhaps isn’t your cup of tea. The most impressive part of the room, in my opinion, is the incredibly sleek, spacious bathroom, with his & hers vanity and double rain showers. Full sized Aesop products are provided for you to slather your body with rich, creamy moisturiser filled with invigorating scents of orange and lemon rind. Taking a relaxing bubble bath in the enormous polished concrete tub might just be the best thing you can do for your body and soul after a long day exploring the city.  In addition to several food and drink outlets (including Max Brenner for some seriously good chocolate treats), a Palace cinema, and a hairdresser, the hotel has a ‘library’ next to the reception and there are plenty of quaint and cosy nooks for guests to sit back and unwind. If you are feeling active, you can get on one of the hotel’s bicycles and easily explore the surrounding area.  Hotel Hotel insists that it’s a place for people people, and I couldn’t agree more.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_476340037~“How a modern hotel should be!”~I stayed with my partner in one of the apartments - I had been keen to stay here since visiting the hotel a few years back, and it didn't disappoint. From the moment I made the booking over the phone, the staff was always professional, friendly and attentive. This goes for all the staff, including in the bar and restaurant. We chose the apartment because we wanted something a little larger, and the room was larger than expected. It was well appointed - from ground coffee in the kitchen to designer appliances and kitchenware, to the Aesop products in the bathroom - it was a perfect balance of minimalism and comfort and a breath of fresh air compared to the sterile chain hotels in that price range. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The views over the lake were nice, we stayed on the 7th floor, and the location in the city was perfect. The iPad in the room was a nice touch, and the internet was excellent. The food in the restaurant - probably some of the best in Canberra!  Had an absolutely amazing stay and I can't thank the staff enough.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_475677333~“Quirky hotel”~Very convenient location next to ANU and good view of the river. Modern and comfortable. Took a while to figure out how the lights in the room worked. Reception however was not efficient and did not deliver on promise to try to do an early check in. Breakfast should have been included in the package, and I would have preferred a quicker buffer, rather than the slow a la carte.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475160719~“Apartments and Hotel rooms - watch out for the difference!”~Warning - there are hotel studio rooms and there are apartments. The apartments don't have air conditioning and don't have room service!! Not sure how that can be classed 5 star! We've stayed at the hotel before and the vibe and new restaurants around Acton are great. This time we stayed in a one bedroom apartment and instead of air con they have 'cross flow ventilation' from the front door to back balcony except our room was in the corner so no front window, so no ventilation. And even if they did, it was 30+ degree days and being pregnant and with a toddler it was impossible to stay. Grateful the front desk gave us a refund for the rest of our stay and we moved to another hotel with air con!~3~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474041876~“Birthday getaway”~The interiors of the lobby and foyer are so pleasing to the eye, You can see why it won world interior of the year. The "original" room is well designed and a great minimalist feel to it. I found requesting extra towels and toothbrushes though an iPad handy and service staff exceptional. Very friendly and prompt. I didn't have to wait long at all, a pleasing experience compared with other properties. We also ordered breakfast to the room and same experience, friendly staff and very quick, food was good. We did get a birthday treat with a complimentary hand delivered bottle of red, which was a great surprise, but I did also order flowers from concierge and was advised that flowers would be in the room by check-in, but I had to follow up on the request and was promptly delivered to the room, did not spoil our weekend. Would have liked more time to borrow the bike and ride around town, but opted to hang out at restaurant for a snack and enjoy company. Wait staff are friendly. Check-out was great with one of the staff engaging my wife in genuine conversation, which was great to leave on a positive emotion, great for a long drive.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan~nan
review_472521952~“What a great designer boutique hotel...!!!”~I'm writing this, sitting in a very comfortable mid century chair, surrounded by off form concrete walls, chip board features and a sea grass papered ceiling - and it's wonderful! From the moment we checked in (a little early as my was isn't feeling great) we instantly felt at home. Maybe because we're both Architects, but we felt an instant connection to this place. Yes - the corridors are dark, and yes - the light switches take a while to work out, but this place is amazing for a hotel. It occupies the lower two floors of an otherwise larger complex, and is all the better for it as there's a real relaxed vibe about the place, not just the hustle and bustle of a hotel. There's plenty of dining options around, and from what I've had so far they're all pretty good, mid range, fresh and interesting places. I had a Yabby Jaffle (non Australians will need to look that up!) and a beer for room service dinner, and some great poached eggs and avocado for breakfast. With my wife not feeling great, we've pretty much been camped out in our room. The bed is probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in, with a perfect mattress, just the right height pillows (but there are other options available if you need) and the right weight covers. With the air con on, we both slept like babies. Before we fell asleep however, the room lighting was perfect - relaxing, dimmable yet perfect for a little bit of work that needed to be done (however suitable power outlet locations aren't really this rooms strong suit). The bathroom was dark, relaxing and with a good, hot, reasonable pressure shower. Aesop products everywhere too...!!! The room was a little noisy, but given it's on the second floor that's understandable. We're headed home tomorrow, without my wife having seen much of Canberra (as she's not feeling great). I think it's likely we'll be back, and when we do, we'll definitely be back to Hotel Hotel!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_471787421~“Unique Space”~I arrived early to the Palace Electric Cinema & stumbled into the foyer/or entrance of Hotel Hotel. Wow I was blown away by the unique style & use of wood! Awesome. I decided to explore & ended up at the bar Monster while I waited. If felt like you could be anywhere in the world.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471544843~“Truly inspiring and beautiful place to stay”~This a a truly lovely hotel. It's a bit urban, industrial and arty. Rooms and apartments are really thoughtfully laid out, and beautifully decorated. The restaurant/bar area downstairs is very relaxing, and if you are peckish late at night, I can recommend the Yabbie Jaffle, really good! Staff are very helpful, you can ask anything and if they don't know the answer, they will find it out for you. It has a gym, and yoga classes. You can hire a bike and cycle around Lake Burley Griffin which is right next door.. There are many Canberra attractions within walking distance. There are four levels of room, and one to three bedroom apartments. Lots of fluffy towels and Aesop soaps, shampoos and conditioners. Good Wifi is free. Parking at a reduced rate at Wilson carpark underneath hotel. I loved it.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471483082~“Weird name, quirky hotel”~Wonderfully done hotel, very modern, good size rooms and quite comfortable. The rooms have iPads as info points for weather, alarm etc which is quite different but helpful The reception area and restaurants are not massively large yet full of character and warmth. The hotel is walkable distance from the business centre but then Canberra isn't very big either.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan

review_470975663~“Wish I could live there”~What a great hotel. Buzzy foyer with the cool crowd in place. But if you want peace, the rooms are quiet, serene, stylish and comfortable.

review_470763016~“Very very disappointed”~We were there for a weekend - one of us stayed on for a couple more nights for a conference. Disappointed from the start. Long check in. Underlit hallways, rooms without a decent chair, table or desk. A scruffy footstool and a recycled cafe table instead. It gets better, air conditioning failed... as did the minibar. Had a puffy milk container which we avoided. Had to open the window onto a motorway to cool down. As the hotel was fully booked we could not be moved. However the night housekeeping staff was very apologetic and courteous and brought in a Dyson fan. I could have bought the Dyson with the savings if we had checked at a place that was less overpriced and pretentious. Miles away from any amenities. Parking charged every time you left. The concept of multi entry rate has evaded this hotel.  We would have moved if we could. In fact checked out a night early. Frankly want our money back. This place sucks. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470426386~“Unique hotel with beautiful decor and quirky vibe”~The is a great place to stay in Canberra. The decor is luxurious but also quirky, you don't feel like you are in 'any old hotel'. The service is friendly but not as attentive as you might expect in a boutique hotel. Especially in the Monster bar/restaurant area. Rooms are a generous size and everything is new and luxurious.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470421738~“Best hotel EVER!”~Hotel Hotel is beautiful. Truly a special place to stay. Takes the pain out of business travel and makes it feel like a holiday. You HAVE to have the eggplant with smoked goats curd and the homemade crumpets are to die for!~5~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan

review_469966883~“Great modern hotel”~We stayed for two nights in March and enjoyed the visit.  It's a modern design/interesting design and different to your usual standard hotel.  - Nice decor - staff great - food and wine good - rooms great - bathrooms great - close to city centre (easy walk) - great views of Parliament House and lake (at least from our room) The only reason we didn't give it a five: - parking not great (especially if the cinema below or restaurants around are busy!) - shower/hot water takes ages to come through if you are an early riser - stupid light switches/system in bedroom (button punch randomly until the light you want out or off happens!) Recommend if you need a hotel close to the city centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469048154~“High Hopes, Low Outcome”~had really high hopes for this place. Good reviews and all.  Rocked up and the temperature was about 40 degrees outside and it felt like it inside. There was an issue with the booking.com booking, which I got the blame for, even though I had all the booking information. Got there in the end.  Staff with socks and their Birkenstocks. WTF. All the trends, taken way too far. The room was like a plywood box. The restaurant/bar was ok. Although 6 guests across 3 rooms were not treated like the staff wanted them to be there.  Bed was comfy. Shower leaked across the whole bathroom. Room was very noisy and had no outlook other than a main road. The room was clean, so that is always good. Better places to stay in Canberra.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~3~nan

review_467386743~“One of the funkiest and coolest hotels!”~If you like different but comfortable and pretty, this is your hotel. From my point of view, Canberra is not one of those places you visit several times in your life, but when you do, you want to do it well. My partner and I had the fortune of running into this gem and had the best time ever. It's a delight for your eyes, especially if you're into photography. The rooms are small but nice and linen is A+ class. Everything is actually. Even the toiletries are Aēsop branded. The restaurant downstairs is a MUST as well but you need to book a table because it's one of the hottest spots in Canberra and it's always packed. I will always stay here whenever I happen to be in Canberra.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467099455~“Careful what you pick”~This place has two offering. Aircon rooms and What is called Eco rooms with no aircon. I booked through the hotels combined app, saw the pics of what was the air con rooms however did not check the fine prints that the booking button took me to the tiny apartment with no aircon. Tried to change but no rooms available. So have it a go. The Good - staff were fantastic. Room on the 9th floor was small but clean and well presented. Walking distance to museums and some great eating places. The not to great - no air con, which to be fair is advertised on their site but I never after all these years thought to check as it is just expected. Cross ventilation means opening the balcony door however the traffic noise is just too load and continuous to leave it open. One chair on the balcony, 2 people...hmmm. Breakfast was ok.  Conclusion: great concept but not for me. Sorry.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467075911~“A Hotel to Challenge the Norm.”~Lots of mixed reviews about Hotel Hotel, either you are going to love it for its fresh approach to the hotel experience or you are going to hate it because it challenges the traditional view of what a hotel should do. Personally, for us, we found that a fresh approach keeps things interesting. Centrally located, free bikes to ride around the lake. A Cinema downstairs. Great and exciting food menu. The curry egg sandwich was a stand out from the bar snack menu. My only advice, their approach to apartments means they don't come with air conditioning. We moved from an apartment to a hotel room because of this. Otherwise, this challenges the senses and make for a refreshing stay in groovy area of Canberra.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_466436697~“Trendy hotel in a quirky Canberra neighbourhood”~Stay at Hotel Hotel for 5 nights for work and it is a great little hotel. If you're after somewhere a little more hipster than the average Canberra offering, then this is your hotel. Great set-up and Monster downstairs is perfect for evening cocktails and/or dinner. Some cool little cafes and bars across the road, and even a cinema within the complex.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_465949753~“Quirky but great”~Fabulous room. Love the architecture and finishing touches. Staff were very professional and friendly. Definitely value for money. Only bit I didn't like was the limited options on the menu at Monster which includes room service options. A few regular meal options woukd be nice. Too exotic for my taste. I think a few mainstream options should be included. One doesnt always want gourmet.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464609375~“Flash Over Substance”~Well, I'm in my seventh month of living in hotels, and this is my least favorite place so far. The hotel touts itself as an artistic endeavor and aesthetics definitely triumphs over comfort here. I don't love the visual style of our apartment, but it's the fact that all of the furniture is so awkward and unusable that makes it a fail in my book. The chairs in both the dining room and living room are strangely shaped and impossible to sit in (no couch) so we stay to the bedroom. We would have been better off just getting a room at a normal hotel where there is traditional hospitality. This place provides no service at all. Our oven was broken the first day and they sent someone out to fix it three days later. We're here for two weeks and will get no service on the room. We're expected to take out our own trash, with no bags provided and no instruction on where to take it. The few things provided (body wash in the shower, salt and pepper) were all down to the bottom dredges and are empty now.) When we asked the front desk if we could have them replaced, they claimed that was our responsibility as well. Yeah, I'll get right on filling up your salt shaker. Staying here is like staying in a museum where they expect you to be grateful to be allowed entry, but for an enormous entry fee per night. Give it a pass and stay literally anywhere else for better service.  *On a bright note, the breakfast was divine and the staff in the dining room was actually friendly and made you feel welcome.~2~1~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan
review_464190085~“Try something different”~Return visit to this eco friendly hotel and we were not disappointed. New Acton is a precinct which is a small vibrant community hub, many cafes and restaurants, a cinema complex, hotels, bicycles and a great location, fifteen minutes walk to the CBD. If driving be sure to have your parking ticket validated at reception for a 50% discount at the onsite public parking station with direct elevator access to your hotel hotel room. This accommodation takes up the first two levels of the "green" Nishi building. Staff are friendly and attentive, only too happy to explain the vagaries of the electronics in your room, mechanised blackout blinds, lighting, bedside telephone and iPad.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463568635~“Dissapointed ”~Having stayed at the hotel before I was pleased my room was ready upon check in. The room is facing inward and VERY dark and small. However the real issues has been service, the room felt ' not ready' when I got in . I requested someone else collect laundry but 2 hours no one shows, I asked for more hangers ( 4 is not enough) 1 hour wait to.umpack. then laying on my bed and someone let's them self In and says oh are you a guest? They were checking room was ready for occupancy yet I had been checked in ( room was not ready) . I call and complain to manager and ' duty' manager says sorry and 'the' manager will call me , that was yesterday and nothing to date! Also had to have someone check AC and they said leave it and I should ' kick' in , it didn't but when I hit a button in the bathroom it came to life . Won't be back again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463437798~“City Slick”~This is a really impressive place to stay in Canberra (I stayed here two nights for a conference). The hotel obviously wants to make a statement with its decor and design, and it does, but that might not be to everyone's taste. It's quite dark and minimalist, which to me came across as sleek and sophisticated. The staff were all really professional and did their job extremely well. The bed was comfortable. The wet room shower could have been a bit stronger but the toiletries were clearly top end. It was really quiet too (a bit disconcerting at times for me - I had to put the TV on to keep me company) but lots of people want peace and quiet from a business hotel. And it's really well located - walking distance to the Australian National Museum, Lake Burley Griffin and the restaurants in the centre of town.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan

review_463125402~“Mosaic Room Restaurant”~Ate dinner in the Mosaic Room in the ground floor of the very modern Hotel Hotel. The artwork and fit out in this building are amazing. The mosaic piece on the wall in the room was excellent. Throughout the building were examples of recycling with the mix of concrete and timber. The food was spot on and the meals were enormous.  Entree, main and dessert were a modern twist of classics.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462134969~“Hip, green and comfy”~I stayed at Hotel Hotel for four nights in February, 2017. I was in one of the one-bedroom apartments on the 11th floor, overlooking the lake and Parliament House. My first impression of this place was the stunning design. It's not your average building in any respect, with some terrific ideas in the use of wood and concrete.  My next impression was the hotel's commitment to low energy use. Lighting is low (in the lifts especially) and there's no air conditioning in the apartments. Rather, guests are schooled in how to make the most of natural ventilation and the ceiling fans, and I must confess, even though the weather was hot for most of my stay, this was not a problem. The apartment is well designed with modern kitchen and furnishings. The bed was very comfortable and there were lots of books on the shelves in my room, ranging from classics to pulp. A nice touch. Two problems. The balcony faced the road which during peak hours was extremely noisy. Fine when the doors were closed - excellent soundproofing - but keeping the doors open to assist the natural ventilation meant this was a problem in the early morning. The other problem was that despite a fantastic restaurant (Monster), the hotel doesn't provide room service to the apartments, only to the hotel rooms on the first two floors. Breakfast and other meals in Monster were very good and there are other great restaurants nearby. Not so close to a supermarket though, especially without a car, so I didn't get to use my kitchen. Wifi was free and it's great to see Australian hotels FINALLY catching up to the rest of the world and no longer charging outrageous fees for internet connections.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462131223~“Perfect wedding night hotel”~My husband and I stayed at Hotel Hotel for our wedding night. The hotel was close to our reception venue (Parlour Wine Room), so it made for a perfect choice. The room (Meandering Room) was gorgeous, clean and tidy and had everything we needed. Staff were friendly and quickly helped us during check-in and check-out.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_461037244~“Wow!”~One of the trendiest hotels i've ever seen. We indulged and booked the Meandering Room - the bathroom was well worth it!! A bath in the centre of the room, with a walk in double shower. Aesops bath gel, shampoo, conditioner and moisturiser had us smelling fruity and fresh. The lights dim, i was beyond relaxed after 3 bubble baths and didn't want to leave the room.  The bed was lovely and comfy with 2 tvs in the room, an iPad and speaker system. The decor is quirky and they've played on textures, which makes every bit of the room interesting.  The service was very friendly and accomodating. Requesting late checkout took us to 12pm (free of charge) which meant we got our money worth in the room and didn't have to rush for a 10am checkout as normal.  Would definitely stay again!!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460829843~“If only I had worn my Commes des garcon jumpsuit...”~Certainly the trendiest hotel in Canberra, if not Australia, and while I appreciated the quirks of the layout, decor and amenities, somehow the sum of its parts was less than the whole. I stayed over early December in an accessible 'Original Room' which was a bit of an incoherent mish-mash of modernist, eco-lodge and nanna-chic styling. A bit like the rest of the hotel really. The room was on the top floor of the hotel - i.e. the second floor - and overlooked the entrance and the highway. It was somewhat noisy, in spite of the double glazing, and the air-conditioning struggled to keep the temperature down. Fantastic bathroom though with generous, full size Aesop toiletries bolted to the walls. Cannot fault the service, which was overwhelmingly young and achingly hipster. A number of times I sat to wait on one of the couches in the lobby area - which seemed to merge with the Monster Bar and Restaurant - and was brought water almost immediately. The hotel restaurant cum bar serves a first rate breakfast (and Sydney priced cocktails), although I'd probably give it a miss for dinner.~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_459017851~“Best hotel ever!”~The general appearance of this hotel sets the precedence for others. The air and cool vibe is backed up by really good service and polite employees. Not stuffy and very prompt service. You do need to book for dinner and breakfast - we squeezed ourselves up on the bar for dinner as we learnt the hard way!. Food was amazing. Dinner and breakfast. The watermelon and pomegranate breakfast was the prettiest breakfast I've ever eaten.  The rooms were as expected - cooling was good - given it was 43 degrees outside. The power did go off in the bathroom in the morning during my shower - must have been the heat - which was a bit scary in a dead dark room. Had a really good sleep - with good amenities.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_458807316~“Make sure you book everthying you could want to do before you arrive...”~A potentially great hotel that has been spoiled by some poor planning and greedy management. The first challenge is accessing the hotel. The main entry in on a busy link road with just a 3 car slip way to stop. For the entire time of my stay all three bays were take, so good luck with that. Next problem is parking. A problem in Canberra, I hear you ask? Well the hotel has not 'purchased' any bays, so you have to compete with the general public going to the cinema, and restaurants in the complex for the few available bays. Most of the parking is reserved for apartment residents or the other businesses in the building. Only the hotel rooms have air conditioning and they are all on the lowest 2 floors. Larger rooms are internal so very quiet but also dungeon like. Standard rooms are very compact and have limited views but due to proximity of major roads are noisy despite double glazing: take ear plugs. If you plan to eat any food at the hotel or have a drink at the bar you essentially need to have a reservation: that, or be prepared to queue, wait a while or eat/drink standing up in the hallway. If your idea of a relaxing weekend is to decide to have a drink when you feel like it or not set your alarm in the morning so you can have breakfast when you like, then do NOT stay at this hotel. If you are happy to plan to have pre-dinner drinks at a reserved table at 17:45, dinner at 18:50, after dinner drinks at 20:45, breakfast at 07:55 - all booked, then go for it. Basic problem is only one very small bar/restaurant with extremely limited seating which seems popular with non-hotel guests. Service, when received, is very pleasant, apologetic, but seriously leisurely. Small gym. Note none of the larger, apartment rooms have air conditioning.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_458807023~“Beautiful hotel, but service stops it from being 5-star”~Stayed at Hotel Hotel for a weekend getaway with a good friend of mine. We wanted to stay somewhere unique and luxurious, and the architecture and decor really lived up to expectations. The food at the hotel restaurant, Monster, was tasty without being exceedingly memorable. What really let's the hotel down, is the mish-mash of surly staff, particularly in the restaurant. While the staff member that checked us in and one of the waitresses were friendly and attentive, most of the staff we encountered acted as if they were doing is a favour rather than they wanted to help us. It really holds back what could be one of Australia's great destination hotels.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458015372~“Considered elegance”~Hotel Hotel makes me want to go back to Canberra just to stay at this establishment. We stayed in the Meandering rooms, lovely large rooms with considered spaces and design. The bathroom alone is the size of a regular hotel room. Getting back to the room in time for a relaxing soak in the bath with the Aesop products was a must at the end of a busy day and the bed was by far the most comfortable I have had in any hotel ever.  This establishment is unique, service was exceptional, the attention to detail is apparent everywhere, there is nothing regular about Hotel Hotel.  The rooms may be considered dark I found it added to the ambience, the mini bar has interesting treats and the tea and coffee on offer are superb.  I really did love everything from the clay walls to the revived retro furniture. The monster bar offers some great choices in wine and dining and has plenty of places to settle in and enjoy the vibe. I will definitely be visiting again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_456605622~“Grunge style , friendly staff.”~Stayed at Hotel Hotel and enjoyed the experience. Staff were very attentive and bed was unbelievably comfortable. Price was reasonable for a quality establishment. Monster kitchen was a pleasant surprise for both dinner and breakfast. The dinner menu was extensive and our selections were well cooked and presented. Worth a visit if you are in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456532799~“Another Great Stay.”~We had another great stay at Hotel-Hotel over the Australia Day long weekend. As always, the staff are friendly, helpful and attentive, and the accommodations are second to none. We had breakfast most days at Monster Kitchen, try the poached eggs with dukkah, only venturing out to Mocan & Green Grout for one of the mornings. The bar menu is exceptional, and the seasonal cocktails are delicious. The relaxed atmosphere of Monster Kitchen & Bar will make sure you never want to leave.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_455525935~“Hotel Hotel - THE place for people people”~I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Hotel, and my experience was a remarkable one. Upon walking into the reception area (which carries through to Monster Kitchen & Bar) it is evident a lot of thought has gone into the overall concept of this hotel. Arriving at the front desk, I was greeted by Ebiyan from the concierge team. He took care of my bags, valet parked my car & was readily available to action any request throughout my stay. There was nothing this man couldn’t do for me-seriously good service. After the pleasant & quick check in process I was directed to my room, which was nothing short of exceptional. I have attached some photos, but these do not do it justice. The bathroom, in particular the bath, was just amazing. The bed was so comfortable and the view of the interior private garden was lovely. The room layout was functional, with well-considered décor giving the space a luxurious feel. From a design point, the room could not be faulted. This excellent attention to detail was noted throughout the whole hotel, from the foyer, dining & bar space, right down to the room itself. To the front office manager, Raven. Your individual attention to detail is world class. Thanks again to you & your team for a memorable experience. Nevermind ‘a place for people people’, hotel hotel is THE place for people people!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455289106~“HOTEL HOTEL - top place to stay”~Hotel Hotel located in New Acton Cultural centre offers top accommodation, facilities and location. A variety of room styles are offered and reception staff are very friendly and helpful. Monster bar and restaurant is highly recommended- food is modern, fresh produce and caters for all taste buds. Service could be more attentive but very polite. Great location - walk or ride free hotel bikes to galleries or lake side ramble. You can even take in a movie at palace cinemas located on ground level of hotel Enjoy the energy and positive vibe.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_455055939~“Amazing Design Hotel”~I'd been wanting to stay at Hotel Hotel for a long time, so was super excited when an opportunity to visit came along. Great design, of course. We stayed in a creative room. It was a nice room, with plenty of space and an amazing bed.  Regrettably though, it was an internal room on the first floor, so there was very limited natural light. I'd ask for an external room if I were to stay again. Great location in the arts and cultural precinct, and handy for a run around the lake in the morning (not the whole way though of course!)  Dinner at Monster was great!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454936424~“Quirky hip hotel”~We stayed 1 night in the hotel section and not the apartments. Stayed in one of the larger rooms which was arty and reasonably spacious. Bathroom was spacious too. We had a rollaway bed for our teenage son which fitted in easily in the room. The hotel would be serving of 4.5 stars if not for the few things that would have made the whole experience more enjoyable. Better lighting in the room was really needed. The room has a dark, arty vibe and while it's quite cute, it's hard to find things in your bag when the brightest light feels like it's on a low dimmer setting. The bathroom was west facing and using the bathroom in the afternoon was uncomfortably hot in summer. The alarm lights were situated right over the bed and kept blinking thru the night (as it's supposed to) but did make it uncomfortable to sleep with.  The reservation process was good but the check in process was so slow and we ended up waiting nearly 2 hours. The staff at front desk did not speak clearly or loud enough and at first, I thought it was just me but subsequent customers had to lean over and keep asking for the details to be repeated. Front desk staff are the first impression hotel guests receive and it was not the experience I was expecting or hoping for.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~3~nan
review_454437658~“Edgy, arty, central - expect the unexpected”~Find yourself saying 'i can't believe how much Canberra has changed!'.  This Hotel is edgy, arty, central, and entirely unexpected in sleepy Canberra.  We found the staff to be excellent , attentive, happy, and obliging. We valet parked the car, and there was no trouble having it brought up at any time. The hotel is decorated in some funky different art, with low lighting in the rooms, and good views during the day of the lake (where we were anyway). The food at the restaurant downstairs is very good. We also enjoyed hiring free bikes for a little ride around the lake.  Highly recommended for those wanting to experience next-level accomodation in Canberra.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454432406~“Very Hip”~Love the design of the hotel from the lobby, the monster restaurant and the cool room decor. Exposed concrete in bedroom and clever modern bathroom layout. Rooms on second floor looking into the fern atrium are a little dark - great for sleep ins. There was a noisy motor of some kind in the bathroom that started about 1030pm - too late to call maintenance so just shut the bathroom door which quietened it down. Service was mostly good but maybe a little understaffed on the day I stayed. Meeting room downstairs (mosaic room) very cool with interesting art. A little bit of kitchen noise but overall very good venue for small groups -15 to 20 - presentations. Only had breakfast in the restaurant but was very good food. Free wifi throughout the hotel which was reliable all day - nice change from many hotels where you need to keep logging back in. Very quick check out. Would stay again and definitely recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453927894~“We loved this hotel”~We had a great stay at the Hotel Hotel. We loved the decor, edgy design and sustainability of the hotel. We loved our Cosy room which was great for a short stay. We loved the food at the Monster kitchen which was excellent. We loved the location and the fact that we could walk to all the places we wanted to visit in Canberra. We loved the fact that there was an excellent cinema in the building. We especially loved the staff who were always friendly and willing to help with a smile on their faces - you got the impression they really enjoy working there. In short we loved everything about the hotel, and would be happy to stay there whenever we are in Canberra.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_453273033~“Hospitality and style at it's finest”~I think that your hotel is fantastic and really quite unique. The styling is really wonderful and completely comfortable. We loved the ferns outside of our room and the blind down blacked out the room for a really cosy sleep. The service by your staff was second to none, they were very attentive without being overly attentive. The tasting plates we enjoyed were created beautifully and portion size was perfect. Really amazing taste sensations and we finished our meal comfortably full. This was my first time in Canberra which I found to be a beautiful and creative city, Hotel Hotel complements this beautifully and I have recommended you to all of my friends back in Melbourne. Congratulations on creating a fine hospitality experience. Thank you. Ian.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_452693070~“Cool Place”~This is such a cool place. Designed to have the current quirky fashion so it has a wonderful ambience, and is in one of the cool areas of CAnberra - New Acton. I have stayed 4 times and loved it. I would recommend the meandering room which is large has a wonderful bathroom area and a lounge area to chill out. It does not have a view but the decor replaces that.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan

review_452025650~“Not bad but better options out there ”~Good points:  The room was pretty funky and nicely decorated The staff were very friendly and helpful There is a restaurant and cafe downstairs which does pretty good coffee  Location wise 10min walk to city shops and bars I wouldn't say the hotel has some major negative points although being that the cost was relatively high compared to some similar hotels and air b n b: The hotel only covers the 1st and second floor so don't expect a view. The key cards to get in didn't work a few times  Only free to air tv, no on demand or movies.  $200 damage deposit for 2 nights not noted when booked, taken on arrival and returned after a few days. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452014829~“Good points and bad points”~We stayed here 3 nights in the heat of summer. The good: Cosy clean modern air-Cond rooms  Friendly front desk Prompt valet parking service Great location near city Close to movies, restaurants, cafes  The bad: In room fridge is just a cooler - unable to cool a bottle of wine. Confusing array of buttons beside bed - accidentally left "don't make up room" sign on one day. Very dark corridors and lobby, with iron handrails protruding out - easy to bump into - trying to be chic but annoying and potentially dangerous for someone with impaired vision. Took 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee at bar - and it arrived cold. Avoid.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450340162~“Design excellence extraordinaire”~We had a lovely long weekend in this stunning, cutting edge, hotel apartment. Every facet of the design had been thoroughly thought through and the wonderfully happy staff were extremely helpful. The well appointed apartment had everything & more than we needed. The feeling of space & efficient eco design, made for a very comfortable stay with stunnuning views to Black Mountain. The New Acton precinct has a real vibe with great bars, food & nightlife and a great central location.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_450314365~“Great Stay”~We stayed in the Original room, it has all the comforts and amenities you need - little armchair settings and massive bathroom, view onto the lake, you can relax and have breakfast in your room without feeling cramped. Lighting was moody, but unlike some other reviews, I found there were heaps of light switches to provide ample lighting! Concierge was polite and we borrowed bicycles to cycle the western and central circuit, perfect location for Canberra's main attractions. We left our car in the Wilson carpark for 3days/2nights and it was only $34. Their library space/ Monster restaurant downstairs is another great spot to chill at!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_448776250~“Very good”~This hotel is beautiful externally and internally. Stayed in a meandering room which was spacious, well appointed and had a very comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom (albeit was a tad on the dark and moody side). Restaurant is pretty good though service not ideal (see separate review). Also in the same precinct there is a movie theatre, a few good cafes and cocktail/wine bars which adds to the overall attraction. A touch isolated but that is just the nature of Canberra, things are spread out, and the other things in the precinct make it less of a problem. Staff were overall friendly though I did think the concierge service could have been slightly better informed/more helpful. All in all very good without being absolutely stand out impressive. Would stay again as it was good (and Canberra options are somewhat limited).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448459711~“Wedding anniversary ”~Quite enjoyable, the hotel lobby was spectacular and the local area had plenty of attractions. The room is dependent on sunlight for lighting, so it was a bit dark at night. Within walking distance to lovely restaurants.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447970553~“The look ”~Very modem industrial look hotel in good location closed to CBD  Room neatly appointed but partner found it difficult to get enough light to do makeup.

review_446357970~“Quirky but very good!”~A recent 3 night stopover with another couple to visit the History of the World in 100 Objects uncovered this quite interesting and welcoming hotel. Check in was easy with a parking area available if the car needs to be left while the paperwork is completed. The process itself was managed by courteous and efficient staff who were friendly and very helpful. First impressions are important and these set a high standard for our stay. The hotel is centrally located and generally very good with some rooms having lake views. We chose to take the cheapest room option as we knew we were going to be out and about quite a lot. The clean, modern and comfortable room with an internal atrium "view", while not large, fully catered to our needs. There are larger rooms available at higher prices. The hotel furnishings generally at first sight are very different to what might be expected ranging from art decor to quirky, cool modern. Quite interesting and once experienced, quite welcoming. Breakfast was excellent and reasonably priced as was our meal at Monster Restaurant. We found the car parking arrangements quite good with no problems at all during our stay. All of the staff at this hotel with whom we had contact were courteous, efficient, friendly and helpful in a most unusual but friendly environment.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_443629873~“Ok I guess... but 5 star??”~Really struggling to see 5 stars for this place. For starters let's not talk too much about the first allocated room, looking "inside" to the courtyard. Small room and only one very small window: those with a background in custodial service will find it oddly reminiscent. Anyway, the otherwise charming concierge Chappy took us to a room facing the road and lake, unlike others I had only very minimal noticeable road noise and the room is better. But let's not get confused... it's actually a pretty small rooom and, while I'm sure your designer was looking for chic/edgy/industrial etc I found the design more cheap/ unfinished and actually pretty claustrophobic pretty quickly. No desk and minimal storage. There is no pool facility in the hotel.  There are no in hotel movies to order and no DVD player provided.  There is a iPad provided but I don't see the worth to that, if I wanted room service it's easy enough to do it on the phone so it's a pretty specious benefit. Maybe I'm supposed to be impressed that it's all whacko new age technology provided, but, for 5 stars.... I would have preferred some ice and some spirits in the claimed mini bar (has some beer and wine). The iPad didnt work at all until they got around to finally registering us as guests and if that's your solution to wanting to watch a DVD late at night I'm struggling with that. The gym is actually a small unsupervised room with a larger number of gym equipment stuffed into it, so I've seen better gyms in places that are more deservedly 3/4/5 star... Granted the bathroom is a very good size and the excise of an actual bath just gives those of us with Falstaffian habits a good amount of room, so good on you for that. I didn't eat much at the restaurants but what I had was fine: value for money, well that was a bit borderline. I also didn't find the car parking arrangement all that great. It's claimed to be a 50 pc discount but needing to go to the reception to get the car out every time I needed to head out got tiresome very quickly, annoying as I thought the website suggested it was actual hotel parking, if you see my point. And there was only a half dozen spots left when I got back in on Saturday night so otherwise I guess you park on the street? The staff are certainly young and all very good looking.... to the point of a reviewer below but I found the service a bit distracted, certainly one person seemed more interested in continuing her chat with her coworker than seating me. But others were better to be sure, so maybe it depends on who you get. Would I stay again, for the 260 a night I paid.... no can't see that you'll get me again. Perhaps it's just set up for the younger crowd who want a cheaper stay in a city hotel and aren't used to hotel rooms feeling quite a bit bigger. And marvel about the winning architecture and funkiness in design. I just wanted a room that didn't make me feel I hadn't made bail (again).~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~3~nan

review_440841408~“Disappointing”~Booked in based on reviews and web photos. Hotel is only on first and second floors - only apartments on high level despite illusion created by photos (as possibly above). No views of lake unless you want to be blitzed by highway traffic in front of your room. Wanted a drink in the bar - glass of chardonnay $17 - I asked "anything for $6" - no! Very disappointing. Ended up requesting an inside room to keep away from highway traffic. Staff good. Rooms clean but expensive for what you get. Rydges much better! Very sorry I did not stay there. Parking $17.75 a night in public park.~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_440494601~“Our car was egged from within the building”~The apartment was very comfortable with quality fittings and consumables. A little noisy at times from the central atrium. Large comfortable bed. Good cooking and laundry facilities within the unit.  Location is not very central to main shopping areas, but a nice wine bar,restaurant and supermarket are close by.  Our one big gripe is that we have a disabled parking permit and are allowed to have extended parking on the street. We parked overnight, with our permit clearly visible, in a 30 minute parking area in front of the hotel. In the morning we found that our car had been egged overnight, front and back windows. This could only have been done from above, within the hotel. When asking the parking attendant next morning for a bucket of water and detergent to clean the car he did not offer to help, only commenting that we should not have parked there, even though we are allowed by law to do so. It would seem that he had some knowledge of the event.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_440455519~“Stunning ”~Oh I love this Hotel.  I love everything about it. The design the style the ambience The art. There are nooks and spaces in this Hotel that don't always make sense that seem out of the way that are unusual but how more wonderful it is because of them. There is so much to take in that one could initially feel things have just been thrown in hoping it will work but on closer inspection you see how very clever it is. Are the hotel rooms the most luxurious or prettiest or spacious I've ever been in? No But they are just perfect all the same.  Quirky is a word that springs to mind but I think it's much more than that Hotel Hotel is fresh and it's alive. Would not consider staying anywhere else whilst in Canberra. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440189765~“Quirky hotel”~Quirky hotel, close to sights of Canberra. Staff were excellent, rooms very comfortable and always an upbeat atmosphere in the lobby.

An interesting hotel with a good mix of modern concrete and wood with comfortable beds, chairs, soft furnishings.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_439363545~“Hip, eclectic, well thought out, definitely recommended!”~Hotel Hotel is achingly hip, super welcoming, and a visual feast. Concierge and check-in staff gave a good impression - efficient yet friendly. The foyer is a delight - lots to marvel at (that staircase!) - an inviting space to sit and eat/read/chat/drink.  I had an original room. Excellent size, well equipped, very comfy. I particularly liked the super deluxe throw rug and the wonderfully restored lounging bed. Oh and the atrium - a fern fairy garden!  Room service (from Monster Kitchen) was super fast and delicious. Hotel Hotel has a gym, bike hire, a small library, a hair dresser, and Palace Electric is downstairs. The whole New Acton precinct is lively and worth exploring.  Downsides? The hotel is very dark (mood lighting) which may not suit everyone. I also had a problem with Monster Kitchen. I ordered a coffee...and it still hadn't come after 30mins (!) so I left to buy elsewhere. Disappointing as room service, also from Monster, was so prompt.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_439091698~“Quirky comfort and welcoming staff”~I love books and loved that there was an eclectic selection of books to browse through in the studio apartment I stayed in. Loved the balcony with the view over the lake to Parliament House and watching the hot air balloons in the morning. The furniture was a mix of vintage and quirkily crafted and the staff are delightfully friendly and welcoming. All of this with the bar and restaurant at the doorstep, so able to enjoy a late night cognac. Won't forget the time I sat around the round fireplace drinking Prosecco with a bunch of grandmothers who had come to Canberra in their efforts to free refugee children from detention.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_438641797~“Funky but oppressive and dark”~Hi wife and I stayed in a "creative" room. It was kinda like a long narrow concrete bunker, with just a small window at the far end. We were on the first floor and inward facing, as a result there is very low lighting indeed, even during the middle of the day. After 24 hours (of a 2 night stay) we both felt "heavy" and desensitised. We left 1 night early partly because I wasn't feel well (not the hotels fault).  However, we loved the design of the hotel, the lobby is stunning, food good, with excellent service. Ammenities in the room, and comfort of the bed both great. I suspect we were unlucky with the room, but recommend you try not to have an interior facing, 1st floor room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438382573~“Funky cool home away from home.”~My concern about being too middle aged for a funky cool new hotel were unfounded. Be prepared for modern architecture and new ideas.It is fun.The front lobby, dining area, and seating around a fireplace or the bar is like walking into one expensive huge rambling shared house.And just a friendly. All it needed was a shaggy dog or two and beanbags.Ok -- maybe a St Bernard or Great Dane. When I arrived the modern music was a tad too loud to hear what Reception was telling us but that was the only time over five days. Walking down accommodation corridors with various woods and surfaces, is a bit like walking into a ski lodge. It feels snug and safe.Enjoy the modern funky chairs, pictures, lampshades and decor. The beds are very comfortable indeed.Great modern facilities such as the Aesop toiletries, i-pad for hotel info, large shower and big towels, electrically operated window blinds. Easy walking distance to several restaurants and cafes in New Acton,lake walking/cycling pathways and the adjacent cinema. Valet parking may seem expensive but was comparable to nearby parking stations and meters and this service was always easy and efficient.Dinner and breakfast is a gourmand's delight. Worth the money. Ring hotel direct to check rates. I'll be back for all future Canberra visits. This is the closest I've experienced as a home away from home and was a special experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_436269965~“Everything fantastic is at your door step”~We stayed at Hotel Hotel for 3 nights. We were upgraded to a hugely spacious 3-bedroom apartment on the 15th floor which had a view of Lake Burley Griffin and the Telstra Tower. In the morning you can watch a hot air balloon float over the countryside. The apartment was spread across two floors – one bedroom, one bathroom and a complete laundry was downstairs (although there is no clothes airer which would have been handy), at the entry level. This bedroom had a view also of the Telstra Tower. Upstairs there was a study nook, a kitchen, two bedrooms (one with access to the balcony and the views, the other with no view to speak of other than an atrium) and two bathrooms for each bedroom, plus a large comfy lounge area. Unfortunately, none of the three bathrooms in the apartment contained a bath – only showers provided. Given that the hotel promotes bike riding it would have been nice to have had a soak. Aesop bath products are provided but no moisturiser – handwash, shampoo and conditioner only. Hair dryers are provided and tissues. Lots of towels but no change of towels during our stay and also no cleaning of the apartment per se. Only one TV comes with the apartment. This was located in the lounge room, which could be an issue for certain groups and whoever occupies the bedroom downstairs. There is no full length-size mirror in the apartment but you get an iPad and a Bose bluetooth device for connectivity.  The apartment has a balcony which is accessed from the lounge room and the main bedroom via sliding doors. Air flow and temperature is controlled via further blinds and sliding doors on the balcony. This set-up gives the apartment its eco credentials – however – we found that when the balcony and the lounge doors were all open – we were greeted with some very loud road noise and also pollution from the traffic below. So I think this place could be rather hot when summer comes around.  Decor is very cool and funky. Interesting eclectic pieces. Sleep pillows are nice and comfy – as were the beds. Location wise – Hotel Hotel is prefect. We walked to the Australian Museum via the lake – that took about 20 minutes one way. The next day we walked into the city – that took about 20 minutes too and we walked home via the War Memorial and that took about 25 minutes. Surrounding Hotel Hotel are plenty of places to eat and there is also a Palace cinema.  My husband also borrowed a free bike from the concierge and road around the entirety of Lake Burley Griffin. Note the free bikes don't have gears. For the three nights, we parked at the Wilson Car Park which is under the hotel. We had our ticket validated by the concierge, so parking cost us about $17 per night. Fantastic value. I do recommend staying at Hotel Hotel. The apartment is really comfortable (just a few slight improvements could be made for it to become awesome) and the location is just great.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_435953139~“My favourite hotel anywhere in the world”~Hotel Hotel is the bomb. It's stylish beyond measure, the staff are friendly and accommodating and the New Acton Nishi presinct has loads of excellent places to eat, an art-house cinema and is walking distance to the lake and Civic.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
