review_477838039~“Excellent place to stay”~The Hotel was conveniently located for us and there was always a space available for our car. The staff were always smiling and friendly during our stay. They said to see them if we had trouble finding a car park.  The room was a single room with a king bed. Room was very modern and clean.  Definitely include the breakfast in your booking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477826887~“Impressive ”~Recent renovation shows. Room, particularly bathroom, was excellent; very modern and well appointed. I ask for two main things in a hotel- good bed, good shower both passed with flying colours. Good breakfast. The only major complaint is the 10.00pm closing for room service- fortunately when I checked in at 9.52pm the receptionist assisted in ordering dinner before chef went home.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477603122~“well refurbished”~Stayed here 5 years ago and the old girl was looking the worse for wear. They have refurbished and added another wing and it has much improved. Old rooms are still small but now in much better condition. Breakfast, well if I had my time over, I would skip. Staff very friendly. New light rail will be on the doorstep by 2018. 10 minute walk to Lonsdale Street pubs and clubs.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_477052203~“Fabulous Canberra Hotel”~We were extremely happy with our choice of Canberra hotel for our stay over Easter. The hotel has been completely refurbished and is very comfortable. We booked a King Suite which was lovely. Our only complaint was the high temperature in the breakfast room. It was far too hot. Breakfast is included in the room rate and was a very enjoyable buffet. We would love to stay here again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476353335~“Lovely hotel”~Stayed here on two separate nights with my nine year old son. Check was easy and friendly. All the staff we encountered were friendly. Only ten minutes or so from the airport. We had a standard room the first night, and when we came back a few days later a junior suite. Both lovely but the suite - wow!!  Buffet breakfast was included. Quality was fantastic and range the usual cooked offerings, cereals, fresh fruits and danishes. Flat white coffee ordered separately was yum! Gym is small but quite adequate for a work out. Beautiful pool, could be a tad warmer.  For the price, I would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476022570~“Lovely”~We had a wonderful stay. Clean, bright and comfy! Only concern with our room, we returned back after a full day exploring and found our door open!!! The cleaners hadn't fully closed our door when leaving, it needed pulling to securely close it. We did explain to the receptionist on checkout without much concern on their behalf. It is a secure building but we weren't happy with lack of any apology  We love hotels proximity to the CBD and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Canberra~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474493873~“A Great Renaisance”~A family wedding in the capital lead us to book a night at the Rex and we were not disappointed. Not only does it offer great value for money, but the whole complex has had a generous makeover. Whilst the rooms are not large they are well appointed with a big flat screen TV, and a well laid bathroom with walk in show. The staff at reception are welcoming and attentive, and breakfast offers a great variety of well prepared food choices. All in all a great value option for anyone wishing to stay in Canberra.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_474451980~“The Reviewer's Lament”~I may have to hand in my Hotel Reviewer’s Badge because I couldn’t fault the Rex, or its staff.  Rooms were large, modern, functional and functioning, and very comfortable. Room size easily passed the suitcase tests, there was an Olympic sized shower with water-pressure sufficient to blast off the barnacles. Déjeuner was a comprehensive range of all things ‘breakfasty’ in a comfortable setting. Staff were professional and polished. I did see some pretty happy looking people leaving the hotel restaurant but otherwise it’s a short, safe walk down to Lonsdale street where all manner of restaurant cuisines and budgets can be found. Just one small thing..and it didn’t really impact me at all. There is construction work going on around the hotel. Over the road they will someday build the Canberra light rail (as if!) and there is other work going on outside the hotel. The staff seem sensitive to it so I heard no noise and wasn’t disrupted.  Wish hotels were all like this although that would take the fun out of writing reviews.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473107899~“Clean place great breakfast!”~Good location niceooms and very good buffet breakfast! Also has a gym to stay fit! Enjoyed the city, need a car to get around. Great restaurants and lots of history. Went to Parliament House and really enjoyed the war memorial.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473029392~“Back again”~Returned to the Rex along with other friends in a mini bus from interstate. Stayed in the hotel this time. Again did not disappoint, rooms lovely, breakfasts all you need, and the restaurant meals delicious. Ended up eating there most nights, with friendly Freddie and Fifi behind the bar. Had a little problem but the most delightful Giaurav and Victoria at reception sorted out, in the most courteous manner and went out of their way to resolve. Have never had hotel Reception people in any hotel in the world do this for us. Will hopefully return again one day.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471788916~“A little RENOVATED gem in Canberra.”~Stayed in Canberra for a fortnight - over four hotels. Tried to stay here the longest.  This was a surprise package. Loved the hotel. The lobby was fresh, beautifully furnished, inviting.  The room (and lifts, corridors etc) have all been renovated. Clean. Welcoming.  The two rooms I stayed in were smallish but sufficient. Loved the decor. Everything worked and had quality fittings (cabinetry to powerpoints to glass glasses). The bathroom was excellent, clean and functional. The Morrisey toiletries were superb.  The bed was brilliant (supremely comfy). The room had its only full adjustable A/C. The only challenge was limited parking and unsecured WiFi which is a security issue which they should consider fixing asap. I loved the stay (if not already obvious) and I will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_470766127~“Always a pleasure to return”~We were unsure how the renovated Rex would be like. We were pleasantly surprised. Most renovations somehow are a mixed blessing. Not here. It was an improvement all around. Quick checkin. Easy car parking. Very friendly reception staff. Rooms clean and comfortable. Restaurant has great food and has great ambience.  Great included buffet breakfast. We were considering of scoring it 4 out of 5. But after our experience at Hotel Hotel, Canberra subsequently scored it a 5 out of 5. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469776836~“Wedding accommodation ”~My husband and I stayed two nights in a king balcony room. Room service was on point, staff were kind and super helpful.

review_469068902~“comfortable apartments”~We stayed two nights in a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment, with undercover security parking included which was a big bonus, The apartment was spacious, quiet, with a fully equipped kitchen, The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms more than adequate, The apartment was spotless and the staff very friendly. We tried the restaurant for dinner one evening and we were pleasantly surprised by the menu. The food was wonderful and the comfort level astounding. The only very small complaint was the sofa and chairs in the sitting room of the apartment. They looked lovely but were on the uncomfortable side. Could definitely recommend.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469002619~“Five Star Touches!”~We stayed at The Rex Hotel for five days in early March. What a surprise package at a very reasonable price! The location is perfect whether you are there on business or holiday. A walk from the War Memorial or the Parliament Precinct, nothing is far away. The hotel itself has clearly been upgraded. The rooms are spacious, very clean and super comfy. Huge wall-mounted flat screens and tea/coffee facilities in every room, freshly laundered crisp white linen and fluffy new towels...the room facilities are great. The Reception Staff are fantastic. Very professional, super efficient and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. The Foyer has a lovely, relaxing lounge feel with newspapers and fresh water available 24/7 and guest umbrellas conveniently located at the doors. Beautiful fresh flower arrangements are clearly an additional adornment to an already attractive Breakfast Area. The breakfasts are "The Best". Continental or fully cooked, pastries, fruit, juices and a wonderful "natural honey blade" that drips fresh honey every morning. I haven't seen that outside a five star plus establishment before. All the nice touches for a quality stay are here. There is a good gym and swimming pool too. All in all we were reluctant to leave our room at The Rex for home! It really is so comfortable. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_468679201~“Neat, great staff, A++”~I stayed here during a conference that was happening inside the hotel, upon check-in the staff were very friendly and helpful, room exceeded expectations and was great. The breakfast was really nice, recommended!~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468231688~“Stayed in the appartments.”~Clean, comfy, quiet, fast wifi, spacious, great pool. Breakfast good. Would recommend for business trip. If I could fault anything (and this is the same with many hotels) the rooms could be modernised by providing access to Netflix / Stan / Skype etc on TVs rather than the dated Foxtel box. Also phone charger / alarm clock / speaker to enable play of music. However this is minor and I would definitely recommend this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467742121~“Its a good place to stay”~We stayed here recently for four nights with another couple. The hotel was easy to find on Northbourne Ave coming from Sydney and 5 minutes drive from the city centre. We found the hotel to be very quiet so no road noise from the busy avenue out front. Rooms rates were very good and not expensive at all, for four nights anyway. Rooms were a good size with good king bed and comfortable pillows. Bathroom contained everything you would expect and the shower was hot and strong and uncomplicated to use. Our stay included the buffet breakfast which was simply great. All the usual suspects for hot and cold tastes and the best poached eggs I have had in a long while.  The foyer area turns into a bar area towards the back and was a pleasant place to have a pre bed drink. All staff that we encountered were happy friendly and very willing to help which was great. My only gripe was parking. There appears to be plenty of spots available to the side of the building and for the first two nights finding a spot wasn't an issue. However, the hotel hosted two conventions over the last two nights and no spots were available at any time during the nights. I imagine all the convention delegates used the paying hotel guests spots. I appreciate that the hotel is improving their income but the lack of parking for their paying guests when the conventions happen is ridiculous. The staff were very helpful in suggesting alternative places to park but I was not about to park my car in the next street or even the adjoining building. I eventually was able to park near the entrance door but this probably made the entrance more congested. I don't know what the answer is but the hotel needs to urgently address this issue to ensure that their paying guests are not inconvenienced. So much so that when I come to Canberra next I will be enquiring whether the hotel is hosting any conventions during my stay. If so I will look at other hotel options. That one issue aside, I enjoyed my stay and whilst it is an old hotel it has had a good refit recently and was very comfortable.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467428744~“Nice and Comfortable”~We stayed here three nights and were in one of the basic rooms . This was quite comfortable with a king bed and new bathroom. Certainly good enough for a few nights. The breakfast was very good and the staff friendly. The swimming pool was 20 metres and good for a bit of exercise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467114049~“Re - Furbished Room Ok”~First stay here and had and easy check in. Parking outside of hotel free , but not under cover or security gated. Got a good price and the room was newly refurbished with modern fixtures. Liked the bathroom and bed. Also had a great steak in the restaurant.  Value for the price, and is ok.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_467109831~“Quiet Comfort”~This was a comfortable hotel set on one of Canberra's main roads. Despite that, our room was quiet and the air conditioning worked well quietly keeping our room cool in the heat of a Canberra summer. It was clean and staff were courteous. The breakfast room was sometimes crowded but the wait period was never too long.  Our room was comfortable, rates were affordable and the restaurant dinner menu was varied and service was good.  All in all, a lovely weekend at the Canberra Rex, even better when the light rail arrives in 2018 which will take guests right to the CBD and shops.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467074083~“Nice hotel / shame about the breakfays”~Loved everything about this hotel except the wait for breakfast. We gave up as there were 5 or 6 groups ahead of us waiting so even though it's included in the price I get really annoyed having to sit it the foyer of an hotel waiting for a breakfast table.  Maybe it was a bad day - I'll certainly return as it was a great reception on arrival, great room, quiet, great location.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466717917~“Quality hotel for reasonable price ”~I booked a room here last minute on a Saturday night. We got upgraded from a studio room to a crown room on arrival which was amazing. The room was huge with a sperate living, bedroom and bathroom area, 2 TVs, clean, comfortable king bed, fridge and coffee facilities. The hotel also came with a fabulous free buffet breakfast. They were very busy when we arrived around 930 for breakfast so we did have to wait for a table for 10min in the lobby but the staff were very lovely and we could help ourselves to coffee and tea. There was free parking included, a few bays undercover and most outside. Free wifi. Walking distance to civic. Would definitely recommend this quality hotel for a reasonable price.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465656838~“Great place to stay”~We loved the Rex. Handy location, super friendly and helpful staff. The room was recently refurbished and very clean. Breakfast, which was included, was wonderful. We also ate at the restaurant one night and were very impressed with the meal.Use of the pool and the gym was included and it too is a great set up. Building work was still being undertaken but the disruption was minimal. When we return to Canberra we will stay at the Rex again.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465408427~“REX THE GENIAL KING OF HOTELS”~2 night stay on Business. Breakfast included in cost. Surely one of the best Hotels in Canberra, not meant to be 5 star, but offering good efficient service from a very friendly staff. A popular Hotel with locals for Family and Business events, which makes parking somewhat of a problem on weekend nights. Only real practice downside is that Room Service is only open around dinner time. It's a tech savvy hotel. Wi-Fi quite good and using the large room TV as an extra computer monitor, not a problem if you brought an HDMI Cable with you. It was an old hotel and the new renovation is very good. Bathroom amenities are quality, as are the basic tea and coffee set up in your average room. Breakfast was a real treat with the staff only to pleased to help and from an early hour. Bed unusually comfortable. Room Cleaning quiet and detailed. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465389850~“Old Hotel gets a New Breath of Fresh Air”~I stayed at the Canberra Rex hotel for 4 nights in late February 2017. Being one of Canberra's original 1960's hotels, I was a little concerned that it would be showing it's age, but I need not have worried. The recent refurbishment has been done very well, and even though it looked somewhat architecturally dated from the outside, once inside the hotel it was extremely well appointed and comfortable. I stayed in the 3rd floor, (room 328), in a reasonably sized standard room, with all the accouterments that expect in a modern hotel. The king-size bed was very very comfortable, good selection of channels on the TV, and excellent pressure in the shower, what more could I ask for. The only downside I experienced was the poor quality of the wifi signal in my room, which was not the case when I logged in from the reception of the conference rooms. I made use of the hot buffet breakfast, which had a good selection and quality of food, and the staff were exceptionally attentive and well mannered. Overall a very comfortable and relaxing stay, perfect for a business traveler.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_464665184~“Very pleasant hotel, lovely stay”~Stayed 1 night in King Room which I thoroughly enjoyed. Room incl bathroom was very clean, sheets crisp, bed comfy, large tv, bright light if needed and clean mug (I loathe a tiny cup). Bathroom toiletries nice. Room had everything I wanted, wifi ok, only exception was no flavoured tea sachets and biscuits were the type found in motels. Breakfast was tasty standard buffet but cooked food not warm enough, although clean and tempting. Hotel located 10 mins walk from Canberra Central shops. Would definitely stay again~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_462793178~“Very comfortable”~We stayed here for 2 nights. The room was comfortable and clean. The bed and pillow were super comfy. The balcony was small and had nothing to sit on if you wanted to sit out, however it was overlooking the next building and so not desirable to go out there anyway. The parking is a bit tight. The breakfast was enjoyable and the staff friendly. Overall, we had a good stay and would stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_462602148~“Old Canberra hotel refurbished.”~Visiting Canberra for the Versailles exhibition. Hotel was convenient for getting around.  We had a room overlooking the back carpark and storage sheds and was noisy. Parking is limited and is used by non residents as well.  WI/FI connection very poor.  Only 1 chair in a double room which really irks me. Furnishings dusty and bathroom waste bin needs a good scrubbing. Breakfast offers a wide selection but the cooked food needs to be hotter and the bacon cooked better.It was practically raw.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462503890~“Being Refurbished”~The Hotel is undergoing a process of refurbishment which is being done to a very high standard., We had a suite which was superb, large, light and airy. The breakfast and evening meal were excellent and very much value for money. The location was perfect, on the main road into the City and an easy walk to the centre.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_460246904~“Beautiful Rooms let down by service”~The Pros: The rooms are beautiful, the spa was great and the bed was very comfortable. The Cons: I wrote to the hotel in advance letting them know it was my 29th wedding anniversary hoping they might upgrade us or do something nice for us but when we arrived they did nothing for us, not even a bottle of wine in the room. They didn't even mention that it was our anniversary. I had asked for an early check in. We arrived at 1pm, but were told the room would not be ready until 2pm, so no early check in then!! I asked if we could use the pool in the mean time and was told no, we had to wait in the lobby! Terrible! Breakfast was not included as promised and there was no alloocated parking, so when we arrived back from dinner that night we had to park on a dodgy street near public housing! Worst of all they charged me $150 deposit, and it is STILL sitting on my credit card and effecting my current available balance. Would not stay here again. Go to the Hyatt--much nicer and much better service!~2~2~2~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_458761364~“A bit disappointing”~We stayed at the Rex for a one night break. This property has been overhauled and is very tastefully renovated to former glory. We had a suite which was very spacious and quite new. However! A few things I must mention: a few bad stains on our carpet; rubbish left in drawers and cupboards from previous guests! ; aircon very poor for a large room; no mini bar. We paid around $246 for this, so not too impressed. We used the restaurant which was quite nice, but the waiter had a very drab personality and could do with a bit of training. Pool was nice and is located in the apartment building next door. All in all, a bit disappointed! But this place has great potential.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456326603~“No problems”~Nice place.  Very clean, efficient check-in, nice rooms, and a sensational breakfast.  Parking is easy, and it's close enough to the centre to walk pretty much everywhere. The view from our particular window was less than stellar, but I can live with that.  Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456044389~“Good hotel.”~We stayed 2 nights here on a trip up to Sydney. The hotel has been recently updated and there was still some work going on but this was hardly noticeable. The King room is not large but is well equiped. Breakfast was included and this was a full buffet which was very nice. There was plenty of parking onsite but might get a bit tight if the hotel was full. The Braddon shopping precinct is a short walk away and if you are eager you could walk into the city centre. The pool is in an adjoining building so you need to leave the hotel and walk down the ramp to the next building. There is a free public transport bus that circulates the city centre and the nearest stop is about a block away.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455744922~“An overnight in Canberra”~We needed an overnight in Canberra on a road trip between Melbourne and Sydney, because we didn't want to miss the Versailles Exhibition at the National Gallery. Canberra Rex was an option we were a bit wary about, knowing it's location and age, however we were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel has been renovated (not quite finished, some final touches in public areas still to come but no problem), and the rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom a decent size, with good linen and toiletries. Road noise was not even audible. Parking on site was easy. Reception was efficient and trouble-free. Breakfast in the dining room was comprehensive and tasty. Price was reasonable. We left very satisfied, happy to recommend Canberra Rex to others.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454669129~“Nice hotel”~We stayed for two nights at the hotel. Got a good deal ringing direct which included buffet breakfast.

There is no reason not to stay at this hotel again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_454207364~“Mother & Daughter trip (adults)”~I was worried about staying here as I had not heard a lot about it BUT I was pleasantly surprised!!! We stayed in the spa suite and it was AMAZING!!! My mum loved the hotel and she is hard to please ;) The hotel was well furnished, clean and quite! The bath was roomy and would have been perfect for a couple. The staff were friendly and helpful - We could not fault them. The breakfast buffet was great, it had a wide variety, for example I had the yogurt and there were plenty of toppings and they were all fresh and delicious and I saw two athlete types digging into bacon eggs and toast galore! The location is good if you're driving otherwise not very close to anything. Also we were able to buy our gallery tickets from reception which was very convenient. On the flip side I would not recommend staying here if you wanted to swim in the pool, it's in another building, and it's small and indoors. Overall I can't wait to stay here again, it's the perfect hotel for a weekend getaway! I imagine it would be nice to stay here in winter as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Well, I could compare only with the 'motel' P******** down the road and Rex wins a few levels up! Everything here is almost perfect: pool, interior, quality of apartment, level of comfort, service, pool, etc. Definitely, my preference in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_451332672~“Comfortable & clean...great location”~My family & I stayed here for 5 nights. Apart from its great location which is walking distance to the main shops, it is well kept & clean with friendly staff at reception.  The two bedroom unit we stayed in unfortunately only had the 1 shower but 2 toilets. Great balcony with district views but lacked any outdoor furniture which would have been nice. Good gym and a fair sized indoor pool but nowhere to sit or put your belongings around the pool. Access to free secure parking is great with lift access direct to the apartment.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_450649497~“Lovely new rooms, and excellent breakfast”~I have stayed at the Rex many times over the years, and love the recent renovations. The rooms are still spacious, but very modern and well designed. The staff as always are friendly, very helpful and made our stay most enjoyable. The best part is, the location. Close to Braddon and the city centre, easy walking distance. They also include breakfast which is in sharp contrast to most other Canberra hotels who charge extra. Highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_450303968~“Clean and Comfortable”~I think I am like most travellers is that when you stay somewhere you want it to be clean and have friendly helpful staff. The Rex has all of that in spades. Stayed overnight recently on a motorbike road trip. The staff were very helpful from the start and noting was an issue in regards to accomodating my additional requests given I was on a bike. From assisting with the removal of the luggage off my bike to suggestions on where to park within the hotel area to keep my bike out of sight. The room was spacious and clean. Really clean. The beds are very comfortable to the point you will wish it were yours at home. The room rate included a breakfast which was both hot and cold foods and plenty of it. Being located on Northbourne Avenue it is close to some of the more popular attractions and some trendy cafe areas Canberra is now becoming popular for. I will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450270840~“Summer at sojourn ”~Early January in Canberra is taken over by the spectacular Summernats car show. We managed to get a King room for the weekend at the Rex which is on the main drag into town from the Showgrounds. The Rex has had a refurbishment and update since we last stayed here. We had a nice quiet room and weren't disturbed by the cars at all. Hot buffet breakfast was included but the staff had a hard time keeping it full with a full hotel.

Only problem was building was being renovated which was noisy early and making parking inconvenient so check if repairs are complete~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_447321805~“Great Hotel in a good location”~Very clean hotel with all new amenities. Very helpful staff and quality services. Rooms are clean and well spaced. Free breakfast is perfect and newspaper is free. Location is appropriate to our plans and liked the stay well. Only thing that disappointed us was that the backrest on top of sauna bench was broken earlier and not noted by the housekeeping staff and rectified. Staff ensured they will be fixed and will not be charged on us.  Make sure you also plug in your device to power as the wifi will reconnect every 2-3 minutes and device will get hot too. Hope they rectify this issue. Otherwise a great hotel to stay while in canberra and very polite staff. Will definitely stay next time.~4~nan~nan~2~nan~4~4~nan
review_446533851~“Magnifique ”~The entry of the place is stunning. We can see luxurious and comfort in everywhere. My room was better than i was expected and the staff are very polite and helpful. If I come back to Canberra I will definitely stay in Rex hotel again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_445999587~“Overall a great two night stay”~I booked a 2 bedroom apartment as the function we were attending was being held at The Rex. Great location! Apartment more than met our needs, very clean and excellently set up. Slightly disappointed at no split system in the 2nd room. Also slight annoyance at the parking - we were allocated 2 car spaces with the room which we needed, went out for dinner and on our return our spaces had been taken, this required a visit to reception to sort out where we could park. Not the fault of the place if people choose to ignore designated parks however annoying just the same. Overall we would book in again any time we are in Canberra!~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443886889~“Perfect for the business traveller”~I recently stayed at the Rex for two nights whilst in Canberra for business. The room, though small, was perfectly clean and had all I needed for a good night's sleep - comfy bed, warm doona, individual air conditioner, alarm clock, plug ins for chargers etc, and lovely shower with good quality soaps and shampoos. Breakfast was tasty and very adequate. Staff were friendly and more than helpful to a first time Canberra visitor.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443370896~“Great clean stay”~I had heard different reviews of this place but our stay did not disappoint.  The rooms were clean and modern, and the revamp seems to have been done to a high standard. We stayed in the suana suite and also the deluxe suite. Both were excellent. The beds comfy, the showers hot and the service was great.  The breakfast is awesome. Plentiful, fresh and a lot of variety. We also had dinner here and the meals and service was excellent. My only criticisms would be the noise, the walls are thin so you can hear quite a lot, and the cocktails offered.... they are not what I consider to be a cocktail...very average. Parking was ok, at least it was free.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442768164~“Rex, you are slipping back”~We have stayed at the Rex many many times, stayed through the noisy alterations and up dating badly needed and last visit (late November) found our room excellent comfortable, free wifi, restaurant good and price reasonable but this visit on 7 December a far different experience - the car parking was nil, nothing and we had to park on the street some distance from the hotel, the room was small and the bathroom no where to place items while showering, shower broken, soap holder in shower nil so one had to place shampoo etc on the floor - not very good!  After returning from a pleasant chinese dinner we decided to have a quiet drink in the lounge - the bar was not open (it was 9.20pm) not good for any hotel to close the lounge bar so early - there was no where else to sit and have a drink. All in All we were very disappointment with this hotel who also wanted to charge us extra when we booked 1 double room and one twin room (3 people) for the twin room, after some discussion the twin room was charged at the normal rate. Our room had neither note paper or pen nor any information about the hotel facilities usually supplied. A good breakfast was included and this had not changed, but oh what a let down.~3~2~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_442719070~“OK for an overnight”~There was no alarm clock in our room, I set my phone alarm however the battery died during the night...we were lucky the rooms are not so quiet and the noise from cleaning staff in the hallway woke us.. Bed was very comfortable, toiletries were nice. The room was very small, I would recommend booking a room with a balcony.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_441852474~“Very nice Hotel ”~Rex is a perfect hotel. Rooms are specious and clean. Breakfast was amazing! Gym and pool very clean. I would definitely stay at this hotel again! However I don't think I can afford it if work won't pay for it ;)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439581124~“REX HOTEL REVIEW”~Rex Hotel in Canberra is fine just for short stay though they have very old style Television ( base level channels), No micro wave in the hotel , No proper couches in the room, no kitchen facilities. pretty boring break fast everyday with the same menu.  As several government colleagues commented that they would not stay in the hotel second time~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_437955375~“Quick one night stay”~All good; would love to have been offered a full breakfast for the price:) Very central to the main shops in Canberra. Nice size apartment but the lounge was unusable! Needed a spot for the snoring half to be sent...~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~5~nan
review_436490059~“Three days in Canberra ...is enough..”~We stayed at the Rex whilst attending an Exhibition at the Racecourse venue. Our room was excellent at first viewing but had a number of 'quirk's' that let it down. They have used a glass screen between the bedroom and the open plan bathroom. As the bathroom has no natural light a night light and fan came on when you open any door to the bathroom lighting up the bedroom and waking up the wife. The good sized lounge has lots of wasted space that could be better used to make the fridge/kettle area larger. There were a number of coach groups using the hotel which made the breakfast room come restaurant look like a disaster area most of the time. The one Sauvignon Blanc on the wine menu had run out and did not reappear three days later. The 'hot' breakfast food was cold. The staff were nice enough but the overall feeling was of a shortness of staff. The nearest areas of the city for food/drink were a good walk away through a disused housing estate. After hundreds of generally positive reviews around the world overall I would give this one a miss.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_435265122~“60's charm in Canberra ”~One of Canberra establishment hotels looking to reclaim former glory. Good hotel, out of the town a bit. So $10 taxi to get into the city. Very good quality and for my suite a sauna in the room! I would stay here again. More like a boutique hotel than a chain.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433429272~“City Visit”~A great motel within walking distance of the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was small but modern, clean and very comfortable. We had a room service meal which was pleasant.The buffet breakfast was good.We stayed for two nights and would recommend The Canberra Rex Hotel.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_433115175~“pleasant stay”~Stayed for one night in a room with comfortable king size bed. The bathroom had a good shower. There was a warm greeting from girl on reception. Enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. It was a comfortable walk to local restaurants, as well as Canberra Centre which had a range of shops and Outlets.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_433066831~“Ursula & Roger, Pottsville”~Noisy, extremely loud 'doof, doof music' vibrating through floor/walls, a party held by long term tenants until midnight, complained twice to night manager, we were told it was a private function, nothing to do with the hotel! This is not acceptable to short term paying guests, apparently police were called to shut down the party. These hotel apartments appear to have long term (owners & rentals) combined with short term guests which clearly doesn't work. After raising our complaint regarding the party & lack of sleep to both the night staff & to the front desk staff the next day, we were assured management would get back to us, however we heard nothing back from the hotel management...As guests, we paid over $1,200.00 to stay in these apartments, very disappointing, we paid a lot of cash & shouldn't have had to suffer or be subjected to loud music & parties, just terrible! Would not stay here again.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~3~1~nan
review_430757435~“The website makes it look good, not quite the same up close”~The place is undergoing a well needed makeover. The food lacks flavour and the service average. The rooms 2 1/2 stars, over priced. Toilets on the ground floor of poor standard and hygiene is lacking.~3~2~nan~2~nan~nan~2~nan
review_427981899~“stylish and comfortable”~A one night stay but definately will be back!- as it ticked all the boxes and had friendly staff.We enjoyed the full breakfast the next morning and the apartment was well appointed with the level of accomodation we like -2 large lcd tvs and reverse cycle ac king size comfy bed and roomy bathroom.Thanks to Luke on reception who has the people skills to make your stay welcome -yep this is one to book if your heading for the nations capital- so dont look anywhere else!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_427460393~“Fabulous Wedding Reception”~Attend the Rex convention centre for a family wedding this month and everything from a visitors perspective was fabulous.

review_426217419~“Not value for money.”~Good things, The rooms were refurbished lovely, very clean and stylish. the spa and bathroom were really nice and clean. Bad things, the bed was hard, the room had no tissues at the price we paid having to use toilet paper to blow your nose was a joke. The parking was shonky and i was surprised to find my vehicle intact in the morning. The staff were not helpful and rude we had to call twice after waiting nearly an hour because we lost all power to the Tv's and the disgruntled staff came in and ended up giving us another room as she wasn't sure why they were all off either, she made inappropriate jokes to my husband. So room change at 9pm. other room was same as above-but no teaspoons for the coffee. We needed some cutlery as we ordered out and the reception sent my husband to the bar to line up, 15 mins later and after being bumped into by rude waitstaff with no apology he finally had some. No mini bar in the rooms. no luxuries like robes etc that similar hotels in the area offer for the spa rooms (which are 1/3 less of the price and include a kitchenette, parking and washing facilities). The room next to us were still partying at 2.30am, slamming doors and being loud, the rooms are not very soundproof. Breakfast was cramped, poor selection and really not enjoyable, eggs were sloppy and the bacon was cold. Overall we were very disappointed in our stay, we don't get away too often but managed to have a night away for our 10th wedding anniversary. It was very disappointing, we won't be returning.~2~1~nan~2~nan~nan~1~nan
review_425782087~“Pleasant Stay”~Stayed here for three nights on a work trip. Staff were great. Hotel was pleasant. Room was cozy but comfortable. Good location for walk to Braddon nightlife or Civic. Would recommend. Reasonably priced too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424884742~“Superb”~Room was modern and clean. Bathroom huge. Breakfast was good. Close to everything. 10 minute drive from museums and a 10 min walk to the most trendy area for restaurants, bars and a new shopping centre. Can't fault it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424575324~“Nice, comfortable hotel”~This is a nice, comfortable hotel with good service. Location isn't the best, being a good 5-10 minutes walk from restaurants but Canberra is a bit like that.  Staff were all very pleasant and helpful the rooms were a good size, comfortable bed and clean. Internally, the lobby and rooms appear to have recently been refurbished so is quite modern.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_424556579~“This review could have been bad”~We arrived at the Rex in Canberra, 2 adults & 2 kids (7&9) pre booked and pre paid only to find that they had absolutely no record of the expedia booking.  What annoyed me was that I was the paid up guest & they were making me stand at the desk & wait whilst witnessing them play the blame game with Expedia because the hotel didnt list their room types on Expedia. I didn't really care whose fault it was.  However, once I had voiced my concern we were given a beautiful, clean, warm, modern two bedroom, two bath serviced apartment. We couldn't have been happier.  The pool was great as was gym and parking. One thing, quite ridiculous I found, in most hotels, kids under 12 eat free breakfast with paying adults, this doesnt happen, as a result we spent up in a local cafe.  Canberra Rex, manage your inventory properly next time and dont blame the booking facility, I would also suggest leaving these discussions of eorkplace fails to the office as opposed to in front of paying guests who just want to go to their room.  All in all a great place to stay but be ready in case there is s issue with your booking~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422221550~“Newly renovated in style”~We stayed here as part of a group. The staff were very friendly and down to earth and went out of their way to help. The meals they served were extremely good; better than expected. We had a Buffett for two nights and a 3 course on the last night. All went as good as expected.  The room got serviced every day and had all the mod cons that are required. Clean and comfy beds with multiple pillows. I would recommend this stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421997711~“Beautiful refurbishment. ”~Enjoyed our stay in a refurbished suite. It was well laid out, beautifully furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was also very reasonably priced.  Small issue with a leak below the bathroom sink, but staff were quick to get onto it.  The only downsides was the sensor lights in the bathroom. Not being able to turn these off (until they went out by themselves) was a slight problem. We had a baby we were trying to get to sleep, and could not get the room dark. Also, breakfast was not worth the time. Food average quality and range. Staff could not keep up with the guests. Included for free (as was parking), but go elsewhere.  However, I would still be more than happy to return and recommendations.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421306952~“An Amazing 3 night Stay”~It was my First time staying at the Rex Hotel in Canberra, and although Skeptical at first, it did not disappoint! I stayed in a spa suit, and the interior and detail of the room was impressive displaying an unexpected hint of luxury that was above the norm.  The service was very good and all staff were very polite and helpful both at the front desk on check in & in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Next time i come to canberra, The Rex will be my Hotel of choice!!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_420685435~“Perfect 1 night stay with a hint of luxury”~I stayed at the Rex for one night and although a bit pricey, it didn't disappoint at all. It's a very modern looking hotel located just outside of the Canberra CBD. The reception staff were very helpful and very professional. The room was quite large and the bathroom was very modern and very clean. It is worth highlighting the hot buffet breakfast, with a huge selection of food and very high quality. The hotel is in Northbourne Ave and there is nothing else around it but other hotels, apartments and large companies so you will need to drive to Canberra CBD for restaurants and night life.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_419714862~“Just OK”~We stayed at the Rex for one night as we travelled through Canberra. The room was modern and clean, the staff were friendly, and it was great to have a carpark onsite. It was fairly cool overnight and the air conditioner in the room worked great as a heater. Unfortunately there were a few items that let the hotel down - the shower-head did not fit the mount on the shower (so had to be held), the wifi (which was advertised as free when we booked) did not reach our room at the far corner of the hotel, and the power plugs in the room all had a bright blue LED built into them which lit up the room while trying to sleep (not a major, but not ideal at 3am!)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417300580~“Outstanding service ”~I stayed at the Rex Hotel for my first time last month for a week while on business and am thrilled I discovered this wonderful Hotel as I now plan to return regularly.  Right from the moment I arrived the friendly staff were only too happy to make me feel welcome. I celebrated a birthday while I was there and was made to feel incredibly special. The staff truly went out of their way to make the stay memorable. I have not come across customer service like this anywhere else. The hotel itself and the rooms are uniquely stylish and very comfortable and the breakfast buffet has a variety of quality and delicious options. I couldn't be happier with my entire experience.  I'm pleased to find a home away from home when staying in Canberra!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417008430~“A great find”~We stayed one night at the centrally located Rex Hotel and were upgraded to an apartment in the next door complex.The rooms were modern, bright and airy and well appointed. Beds were super comfy with loads of pillows; tea, coffee and milk were also provided.We ordered room service and were really impressed with how delicious it was. Every staff member was polite and friendly. Car parking was undercover and secure.A great buffet breakfast - a good selection without being excessive. Absolute value for money and I'd definitely go back.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_416807216~“A week at the Rex”~Overall we enjoyed our stay. We travelled to Canberra for a conference, and the Rex was close by. We enjoyed our stay (good facilities, comfy room (although the door key, instead of an electronic card was unusual). All the staff were friendly and helpful - most contact we had was the meal and wine section (breakfast and dinner) - the manager Simon explained that they are changing and updating the whole area, and we noticed positive changes while we were there. We look forward to our next vsit to see the planned improvements - and how they work out.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

review_413432947~“Perfect”~Been to Canberra many times, first time at Rex...not sure why I waited so long.

review_412478547~“Spacious room”~I needed an overnight room, late check-in. Friendly staff, room was spacious, quality room and furnishings at $180 a night. Air conditioning was good whilst it was summer time. Breakfast downstairs on the lobby floor was good.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410264047~“Mixed”~The Rex is a Canberra institution. I'd hoped that with news of a renovation that they would embrace their history & go for a mid century theme for the update.  They have not. Although it is still in progress, the colour & fittings selected are just standard hotel fare- boring.  Wifi was horrible- in 2 rooms on the 3rd floor & didn't even work in the lobby in the morning of my stay.  They've chosen "Peter Morrissey" toiletries yet the tea is still Lipton, milk small UHT single serves & the mini bar was empty.  Room Service was nice- friendly, good portion but menu is highly priced ( $13 garlic bread) and the clean up of trays was not done overnight so I walked to breakfast dodging trays.  Breakfast spread was decent and it was included in my rate.  Staff were all nice and the room was comfortable. But for a business stay, unreliable wifi is a big turn off.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408089158~“Nice Hotel, moderate price, great staff”~Needed a room for a night on a trip back to Sydney from the Snowy Mountains and thought we would spend a day in Canberra to play tourist.  There were renovations within the building, looks like they are doing a complete makeover, we were given a free upgrade to a suite.  Everything was very nice, the rooms, the staff, free parking, breakfast.  I would stay again.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_401893096~“Modern decor, comfort plus”~Two bedroom apartment was brand new & almost everything there to make your stay comfortable. Great kitchen, well equipped with pod coffee maker, microwave, 2 drawer dishwasher. Washing machine & dryer plus extra toilet. Comfortable beds with good quality linen. The one bathroom is a let down. Good sized shower but absolutely no where to put your soap etc.....everything has to go on the floor. Not enough hanging hooks for clothes or towels & not happy putting them on the toilet lid. Staff were great & very accommodating with any special requests. Supplies replenished daily including washing powder. Most road noise from the busy Northbourne Avenue was muffled due to good quality glazing. Outside table setting on balcony. Overall a good choice of accommodation in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401190208~“Gorgeous Apartment ”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. The apartment was brand new and absolutely gorgeous. Couldn't fault it!

review_400148857~“Don't stay here whilst work is being carried out”~Although the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and in general the hotel is clean and modern it really should be closed while renovations are ongoing or at least some kind of warning. No heating in the rooms, lifts not working and no restaurant. None of this was mentioned when checking in. There were 2 small noisy portable heaters in the room to make up for the lack of real heating plus we got stuck in one of the lifts twice along with several other people. There is obviously a lot of work going on with this hotel but it would have been nice to have been told either by communication or when checking in.~2~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_399372754~“Wedding Night, Disappointing stay!”~We booked into for our wedding night and the night of the reception last year in October. No acknowledgement, that it was our wedding night even though it was informed during the booking. It was an exhausting day for us and we were planning to have a late morning which was interrupted by a big noise. There was a massive construction going on and it felt like someone is drilling just above your ceiling. It was unbearable plus it was at 6-7 in the morning. Later that night, another long day and we told the reception about the noise. He said the construction on our side of the building was mostly done and there might be no noise from tomorrow. After 4 hours of sleep again we woke up to the noise of the construction. If only we were informed about it earlier. Water was not available in the room, had to order from Room Service at $3. Breakfast was good though.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_392007730~“Nice room but there are hidden costs (be careful and thorough)”~The room was nice, tidy and modern as advertised. But when we turned up at the reception, the staff tried to charge us extra for our 2 young kids (3 and 6 years old) - beyond and above what we already paid through the Booking.com. Even though after reaching through the booking.com, the total cost Booking.com provided didn't seem to be the true total cost of our stay. The key point is to be careful when booking this accommodation through booking.com because there will be hidden costs for your kids! Also the hotel was under a big renovation and many advertised facilities were not available. This was not at all mentioned in the booking.com website or the hotel website. This false information created a bit of last minute work at our end to alter our plan.~3~nan~nan~1~nan~4~3~nan
