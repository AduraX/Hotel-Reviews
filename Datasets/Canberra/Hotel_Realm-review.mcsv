review_478396089~“Great service in an excellent location”~The staff was great. We appreciated being upgraded to a suite which was superb. The 25m lap pool is awesome and surrounded by a fitness area as well as sauna/hammam/jacuzzi. Several bars and restaurant can be found within a couple hundred meters. We love to walk and CDB is only~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478163946~“A wonderful hotel”~We stayed with our two children in a one bed suite. The room was generous, clean, comfortable and well appointed with a great selection of (free) in room movies.  Convenient location with a lovely outlook. The service was wonderful, all the staff were so welcoming to us and our children and went above and beyond. One of the reception staff even went to the shop and bought puréed baby food for our baby as the restaurant couldn't do it! Very surprised and much appreciated. Nothing was too much for the staff.  Only downside is the very limited room service menu. Not a problem if we weren't travelling with kids but made it harder to get the kids fed and into bed.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478143860~“20th Wedding Anniversary ”~Great location, lovely amenities. Friendly staff. I recorded in the booking 20 th Wedding Anniversary but it was not acknowledged so a little disappointing. Went to the Ostani restaurant and it was very good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476966704~“Quite Average.”~We stayed two nights at this hotel a week ago. The room was comfortable and pleasant. We and other guests had problems with the use of the lifts. When called, they took a longtime to arrive and frequently bypassed our floor. There was no service to our guest room after the first night. When we asked for the room to be cleaned, the bed covers were merely pulled up, no fresh towels and rubbish bins unemptied. A final request late in the day produced results. On Sunday evening, the only place in the hotel to eat was a second rate "coffee shop".  There was nothing in the experience which would make us want to return to this establishment .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476756777~“Quite nice”~I had a nice, wide room at the Realm Hotel. Convenient, nice, not particularly luxurious but totally ok. The hotel in general has a nice look and staff are kind and professional. I'd suggest it to a friend.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_476413014~“Can't wait to return!”~This was our first stay at the Hotel Realm. We have usually stayed at the Hyatt but the accommodation is considerably more generous here. We really enjoyed our time at the Hotel Realm (three nights). The location is great, close to Manuka for great restaurants and shopping and to other attractions such as the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery, which we had come to visit. Good view from our apartment across to parliament and a generous balcony from which to enjoy it. We stayed in an atrium apartment which was very spacious. It had two bedrooms and bathrooms, one set at each end of the apartment, separated by a large lounge/dining room. There was a separate kitchen, with washer/drier. The apartment had three televisions, which made everyone happy and a good selection of channels, including Foxtel, and free movies. What more could you want? Beyond all of the practical elements, the apartment had a really nice feel to it, was well furnished, with a huge, comfortable sofa. The showers had really great water pressure, consistent temperature. The housekeeping staff attended to your room whenever it was convenient for us over the course of the day. If we were in the room in the morning, they came in the afternoon once we were out. We were really impressed with that. So why only a four star? A few issues that just kept the Hotel Realm short of the five star for us, easily resolvable though with a little effort. While most of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, the lady on reception on check-in was frosty and unwelcoming. Not what you'd expect. The information given regarding car parking was rushed and unclear. A smile would go a long way to making guests feel welcome. Reception is generally slow to answer phone calls. One call timed out, our longest recorded successful wait was 9 minutes (you'll grow to hate The Blue Danube on wait). It can be quicker to go downstairs in person. Room service meals were luke-warm every time. This was reported to Reception who were very helpful and promised to investigate and get back to us. We never heard anything. When this issue was raised again on checkout, we discovered a follow-up had happened and we were told the heating lamps for room service delivery weren't working. Not really good enough for a five-star hotel. The room service menu is very limited - basically, burgers and pizza. If you are out all day, you don't always want to eat out. It should be an easy fix to extend the menu. Breakfast and room-service apparently comes from Buvette, the hotel restaurant. The food was okay but nothing special. There are, however, plenty of alternatives in nearby Manuka. Regardless of the above, we were very happy that we booked at the Hotel Realm and would recommend it. We certainly intend to return on our next visit to Canberra.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_475942176~“Stylish hotel”~Great location to Manuka oval and boutique shops and eateries! Very trendy and stylish hotel. Easy check-in with polite & friendly staff. Rooms are clean and stylish.

review_475652205~“Consistently good”~We have stayed at the Realm a number of times and have never been disappointed. On this occasion my husband and I were upgraded to a suite which was huge! To my delight there was a kitchen with a washer/dryer, a huge plus when you are travelling for three weeks. The bed was very comfortable and pillows great as well. We had some in room dining which was excellent, with nice selections on the menu. There are plenty of dining options surrounding the hotel as well. A great place to stay in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473257840~“Fabulous suite, fabulous value. They've got everything right at Realm”~I had a friends 40th at Ostani downstairs, so decided to book a room for the night. Upgraded to the 1 bedroom suite for an extra $20, which was an excellent move. The suite was very spacious, spotless and tastefully decorated with a view out towards parliament house. Brilliant food, great facilities. Definitely in the top 10 places i have stayed around the world.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473133356~“Luxury stay”~Two nights in a one bedroom apartment. Luxurious bed and lovely linen. Kitchen in room and nice big fridge. We also partook of the buffet breakfast. The biggest disappointment was the floor surfaces in the room and the stained carpet. Overdue for a make over. Walking distance to Manuka Oval and Manuka shops. Easy to find if travelling from the South Coast. Free parking was good as well.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~5~nan
review_473001141~“Perfect for family of 4”~I would recommend this hotel.  First time here with two kids 6 and 9. We booked an atrium room and it was perfect.  Living and dining in the middle, then parents section with walk in robes and enormous bathroom. Kids on the other side with king bed and their own bathroom. Nice to open the windows and sit on balcony even if view was of offices.  Breakfast across the road at maple and clove was great. Big grass section fit kids to run on. Got an amazing blow wave and massage at kundalini too.  We ended up getting bikes delivered fir the day as the hotel prices were 20 dollars an hour. And it was a great way to see the place.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472536051~“Bucket list visit . ”~Has been on our bucket list to visit Canberra so we were pleased and appreciative when our adult children and their families gave us a gift voucher to The Hotel Realm . This hotel is situated in a leafy suburb with parking available . A couple of small problems , it was difficult to drive out of the parking station as we were told to " key in our room number each time you leave " , the receptionist should have told us " swipe your room card each time you leave " Luckily a driver coming out behind us knew the system . Also need to swipe your room card as you enter the lift or the lift door won't open when you reach your floor . Had to return to reception to find this out . Just small things but would be appropriate to explain them to the guests when checking in . The suite we were given was spacious and had nice touches like a coffee machine , complimentary water , discount voucher to Buvette restaurant . Although we didn't use or need them , there was a washing machine , dishwasher , microwave in the kitchenette , great for families or road trippers .Room was clean but just a couple of small touches would make it perfect . The balcony area was neglected with cobwebs on the roof and outdoor setting , the floor and windows and door of this area also need a good clean . The carpet in the suite and corridors looked stained but maybe this is an underlay problem . It needs attention as it spoils the appearance of the modern decor . Liked the hanging decorations in the Atrium . The gym ,pool and spa area was impressive . Had dinner and breakfast in Buvette restaurant -excellent service , friendly staff , nice food and ambience . Checkout was handled efficiently by pleasant receptionist. Packages seem to be reasonably priced with lots of extras included.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471991828~“Friendly luxury”~We stayed for three nights whilst visiting the Versailles exhibition and were very happy with our accomodation and with the exceptional service. Our check in was quick and efficient but when we arrived at our room it looked in to an internal courtyard, which we weren't happy with. We called back down to reception and Tahlia, on reception, had us moved to a better outlook within five minutes. We were really happy with the prompt response and the fact that Tahlia did it without any fuss. Later when we returned from dinner we tried to use the iPod dock but it wasn't working. Once again a call down to reception and Jin came up to fix it. Once again really prompt and friendly service. Nothing seemed too much trouble for the staff at the realm, making our stay very relaxed. We stayed in a suite which was really well fitted out with amenities. You could easily stay here for a week or more and want for nothing. You could eat in or go to any of the fabulous restaurants surrounding the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel if visiting Canberra~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_471240325~“Large suite was quiet and comfortable”~Realm was a good find for us. The suite was large and well thought out. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The place was sparkling clean albeit a little bland but most welcome after Sydney's grunge.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470991920~“Had a meal st the Realm restuarant”~Very pricey for what we had. Meal was overcooked and burnt on edge. Wouldn't go here again. Not good value.

review_470697840~“3 star Hotel at 5 star prices”~I booked this hotel as I was told there are only two 5 star hotels in Canberra. The Realm being one of them. Unfortunately the hotel rates a 3 star. Upon arrival the reception staff were friendly and efficient however the room given had a dreadful chemical smell, so strong not even opening the balcony doors helped. The carpet was dotted with stains throughout the suite ( Yes, I booked a suite opposed to a standard room) as we couldn't stay in this room and cop the smell I asked for another room. Again reception staff were helpful in changing rooms. Sadly the new (not improved) room was again tired, small and smelly. The stains are ingrained in the carpet, dirty scuff marks on the walls and what is with the extra large candle holder in the bathroom with no candle? The pillows need replacing, they were flat, not what I expect from a 3 star hotel let alone a 5 star, plus there were stains on the bed linen.The kitchen wasn't exactly well equipped having 1 teaspoon, 2 forks and 5 knives? The location is good and the surrounding cafes lovely but this does not make up for a expensive 5 star price on a 3 star hotel. The Realm may have been fantastic in it's hey day however it is now tired, grubby and dated. When you pay for a 5 star experience to get 3 star quality, you cannot expect to be happy about it. It put a damper on what I wanted to provide in a special weekend away.~2~nan~4~nan~1~nan~4~nan

review_465403496~“Torn”~Hi Joel, A group of family and friends stayed at Realm on Friday and Saturday night. We were very impressed by the hotel, the service and our stay. However, two things have occurred which we are extremely concerned about. Firstly we left a bottle of Bollinger Champagne in the Room 229 Fridge upon departure. I called the same day and asked Hotel Services to hold it for us, they were very kind and said it would be at reception for me. We went twice to collect at reception and to be told it was never found. In addition, the valet team parked our car and apparently notice a flat tyre (which was not flat upon arrival), your team were great, had the tyre changed and ready for us first thing Saturday morning. Needless to say, I was impressed. However, in the glove box were a collection of unopened birthday cards for me from family members and friends, some containing cash and vouchers. Sadly all my birthday cards are now missing. Again, the only thing I can assume is either the hotel staff or the person who changed the tyre now have my birthday gifts and cash. Sadly, what was an amazing stay has ended particularly badly.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465181186~“One of the best in Canberra!”~Check in easy and pleasant. Parking directions were clear and concise, however, Mary on front desk offered us valet parking for $20 a night which we decided to take up-thanks for the smooth check in! The hotel lobby seemed a bit stark, but the rooms were well appointed and breakfast in Buvette very good. This hotel is close to the National Gallery and other attractions which we found convenient. There was a wedding event on at the time so the bar area was fairly busy, but the hotel had a pleasant atmosphere. Some great facilities associated with this hotel-the new gym is worth exploring-seriously good. Overall we were impressed with Hotel Realm's offering-highly recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Our room was immaculately presented with its own kitchenette, washer/dryer, beautifully appointed bathroom and its lounge separated from the bedroom by a freestanding wall/wardrobe. We loved our room. The service was fantastic. We ordered room service the first night: our meals arrived quickly and were delicious. We used the gym, lap pool and spa and had lots of fun doing a couple's workout in the free weights area. Breakfast was delicious too! We will definitely be back to enjoy a few more sumptuous cocktails at the Buvette Bar. Looking forward to returning!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_463870787~“Good location but definitely not 5 star”~Very good location close to parliament house and many main attractions. Convenient and secure underground parking which seemed quite plentiful. Spacious one bedroom room and third floor. Inward facing so could look straight into opposite rooms but very quiet. Good flat screen TV and movie selection. Rooms service super-quick first night but then very slow lunch following day. Gym, pool good although opening times at weekend not generous. Problems: very few staff, often called reception for 5-10 minutes before telephone answered. Carpets and flooring very worn and slightly dirty in common areas. Fridge beeped continuously every time opened and for 2-3 minutes when closed. One lift out of action for entire stay and one remaining lift very slow and would randomly do up when you wanted to go down or vice versa. Bar noisy and poor service despite lots of staff with a huge amount of noise form continuous sporting programmes on large screen TVs.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~2~3~nan
review_463654257~“Good stay”~We stayed for one night only in a king room. The bed was comfortable and had all amenities including an espresso machine, although the decor was spartan-looking and very clinical and cold. The shower was roomy but needed a few hooks or something to hang our face washers on.  Reception was efficient. Parking was very good. Free internet was certainly a bonus. What's with the floor in the lobby and bathroom? We couldn't work out if it was linoleum and it looked scuffed and in need of a polish. Looked more like a public hospital ward floor, not one in a 5 star hotel.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_463314856~“Great hotel”~When I arrived I got my room immediately (early arrival) from the very friendly receptionist.

review_461360478~“Do not stay here. It's a horrible place to stay.”~It is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed at.  Room was dirty, many items missing or broken. Porter came to assist but couldn't fix issues, promised to come back but didn't.  Reception didn't answer their phone a single time out of the 3 days we were there. Called them around 10 times until phone rang out on different days at different times and it always rung out. Had to go to reception to ask for towels and shower gel. Only to be told by the receptionist that the porter want allowed to leave reception, so I was left waiting in sweaty gym cloths waiting for it. On the last day I shared bath towel with my husband as we only had one and phone was not answered again.  They were drilling early morning and late at night and lied to us about it. Met the workers in the lift during our stay and they told us they were drilling. Reception and porter said they did not drill. So were woken up at 7am when we were supposed to have a nice weekend away. There were so many things that they did wrong. They were rude to is and we were left with a very bad feign in our mouth. I have never complained before, despite travelling to 50+countries but thought this was so bad that I wanted to let management know how the staff behave when they aren't there and to give them a chance to rectify this. Their response was very unsatisfactory, only said it must be a one off thing. But it wasn't. No staff member wanted to be there, they even told us they wanted to go home. They lied to us. Did not help us when we asked for help. And the place was dirty. In fact, so dirty that we took pictures and sent to management. Again, they did not acknowledge that they had done anything wrong. and not once did he acknowledge that they've done anything wrong.  It was dirty and dusty. Vents were grosse and carpet would not have been vacuumed properly for weeks. They were also full of stains. Even found pubic hair in she bath tub! It was so disgusting. Key card for parking never worked and internet connection kept dropping out, so did the movies on TV. Blue error screen kept appearing, and TV would not work once you turned it on and off again, One of the things that the porter didn't know how to fix and did not arrange for anyone else to fix either. I could go on and on and on, but you get the gist. Do not stay here. It's a horrible place to stay.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~1~nan
review_460186198~“Disappointed ”~My wife and I stayed at the Realm Hotel, Canberra, to take up their package, combining accommodation with tickets to see Versailles at the National Gallery. Their online booking and email follow ups was excellent and timely. On Tuesday they advised us that our room was ready for occupancy at 12.00pm, wonderful customer relationship  At reception we were given an envelope containing our ticket vouchers for the NGA plus a voucher for a free antipasto and cocktails, excellent  We enquired if we had to book the restaurant, no not required, we then inquired about the complimentary parking -"just go around the corner, turn left..." We followed the direction to be confronted with 3 options, public, private and residents, which one?? We returned to the front desk and then was told to go to the public and take the ticket  We did all that then confusion set in - at the lifts we had a choice "East Hotel" and "West Hotel", nothing about the Realm We chose the "West Hotel" lift and once inside the lift car we noticed the sign "Realm Hotel" we sighed in relief The room was great, good bed, good pillows and black out curtains, we could not complain about the room  But in the mini bar no fresh milk - for a 5 star hotel that gave us notice that our room was ready, surely fresh milk could have been put into the mini bar instead of the UHT milk provided in back package accommodation! On going to the restaurant we were told it was booked out (Valentine day), contrary to the front office saying it was not necessary  For a 5 star rated and expensive hotel we were bitterly disappointed and will need some convincing to return to the Realm Hotel  Front office on departure were very good, not the same staff when we booked in ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459878341~“Although on a package visit we could not have received better service and attention”~We were fortunate to visit upon a week-end and were upgraded to the "Executive " Floor.

review_459537938~“Let down by service. Again.”~The Realm calls itself "the finest five star hotel" in Canberra. Yet its service is far from five star. Despite an email and follow up phone call a week in advance, the hotel failed to recommend dinner locations. Not even a "sorry, too hard" call. I consequently spent the early evening walking miles to sort something myself. First world problem, yes, but far from five star service.  Today's failure comes after repeated disappointments, some posted previously, from this regular hotel guest who wonders what it takes for Hotel Realm to get in touch with him , makes things good or lift its game. Maybe everything just comes too easy when you run a business in Canberra.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457988038~“Buvette Bliss Package has it all”~We recently had a Staycation at the Hotel Realm, and indulged in the Buvette Bliss package. We had a lovely suite with a balcony. Champagne on arrival, a 2 course dinner at Buvette and a late check out, of noon the next day. Service was great and the staff at the restaurant were attentive without being annoying. Although the menu isn't huge, the food was interesting enough to be a bit different. The wine and cocktail menu offered a large selection. We had dinner at 7 on a Friday, which coincided with the Ostani Bar (which was next door) Happy Hour, so it was a little noisy. Because of the late check out we opted for Breakfast in our room. There was a large choice, and we enjoyed our selection of Pancakes, and a Full Breakfast on our balcony. It was a great little get away.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457759339~“Hotel Realm”~I stayed for 2 nights recently and first off I'd like to say that the breakfast staff in the restaurant were amazing and provided excellent service. However, I wasn't really impressed with the overall experience.When we arrived the rooms were not cleaned properly. We found hair and fluff all over the bathroom and entrance floor. The timber that is placed across the bath tab had dust and was not wiped cleaned for days/weeks. The balcony had water dripping off the common pipe that ran down and we also found it was not cleaned well. Mop strings on the floor. We could not use the balcony because it was wet with the dripping water. We requested extra wine glasses and moisturiser twice and that never arrived. We had late check out as part of the Luxury Escapes offer but our room key card locked us out at 11am. The staff at the bar OSTANI were slow with their service and it appeared that they were more interested in getting their bar work done than serve customers drinks. More staff were around organising the bar than serving customers. Breakfast was really good and the staff were very good with their service and organising breakfast for the guest.~3~nan~2~3~nan~nan~3~nan

The hotel staff were friendly and helpful at reception  We asked for ideas about places to eat and the young man printed off local guides to assist us Our room was on the 2nd floor and was a suit with enough room for the 2 of us to relax without falling over each other.  Hubby was able to have a sleep and i could watch tv without disturbing him. The kitchen had a washer and dry and we used these and were very pleased they were there. A coffee machine was provided with pods and there was also quality t2 teabags provided  The bed was wonderful and firm and i gad a great nights sleep  Breakfast was in the main restaurant and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Lots of food and no rush.  The hotel i booked with watif and got a great price. The hotel gave me a further discount  5 out of 5 for the realm. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456320423~“Refreshing and Relaxing”~We stayed here on a Luxury Escapes package for 3nights. We weren't sure what to expect as it was in a quieter, mainly business area. Usually we stay close to city centre. However we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is in walking distance to the National Art Gallery, Old Parliament House plus many other attractions.  The staff at check in were very helpful and pleasant. We were given a lovely suite with separate lounge and bedroom and the pleasant surprise of a huge bath. A small kitchenette was also an added bonus. We had several meals at The Ostani Bar which were reasonably priced and a large serve. There are several quality restaurants close by. Some BYO, but beware the corkage is $18 per bottle. All in all a very comfortable few days. Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_456260319~“Quiet, well appointed and value for money”~We spent two nights here and booked a suite, with a separate lounge and kitchenette. The rooms are extremely well appointed, with loads of drawers and hanging space. The bathroom was enormous with quality products. Housekeeping even replenished the vanity kit, which rarely happens even in top hotels! Had we needed to do some washing there was even a washer/dryer. This kind of room would be ideal for longer stays.  We had breakfast at Buvette both days and it was nice without being spectacular. I found Heinz apricot jam as the only option on the first day quite disappointing. It was just cheap. I would have liked a quality muesli or granola option, as all the cereal options were branded varieties. There was a gluten free muesli and a selection of gluten free bakery items. Our second breakfast had much better jam options from Bonne Mamman, which was the kind of quality confiture that should be supplied. What about an Australian brand such as Beerenberg - which would showcase Australian products to the international business travelers who use the hotel?  Overall, it was a good stay and I would come again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456119051~“Some jarring notes of disappointment”~My wife and I stayed in this hotel over a long weekend, having chosen this accommodation based on its convenient location and good reviews. In general, the hotel was a good choice; a modern building with suites that provided more than adequate room, well presented, clean and comfortable. The staff at reception were unfailingly helpful, so that we could expect to enjoy the stay. However there were a number of issues when we experienced a less than professional approach to customer service, that left us with the feeling that staff were not properly trained in processes and servicing customers. I'll list these here so that readers can form their own view as to whether they would be relevant to them: Carpark access to hotel: the hotel offers a large on-site basement carpark that provides convenient access to lifts that provide direct access to the appropriate suite level; but the doors from the carpark to the lift foyer are manual push/pull so that manoeuvering luggage is a challenge Breakfast: there is no latitude whatsoever offered for the availability of the self-service buffet breakfast; admittedly we arrived 5 minutes after the stated closing time, but found that trays of evidently fresh food were still in the buffet area; when we asked to serve ourselves, were told quite forcefully that breakfast was finished while staff were still attending; I selected a plate whereupon the trays were rushed away from under our noses Minibar: The minibar was quite sparsely stocked with the usual beverages, but on none of the days that we stayed was it restocked Access key: During the three days of our stay, the access key failed twice so that we needed to visit reception for a replacement; on the second occasion we were told that all the rooms were having issues, and to take care to not keep the card in our wallet nor near a phone...which we were not warned of when originally at reception Business Centre printer: on the morning or our departure we confirmed that we could use the business center to print our airline boarding passes, only to find the printer to be unresponsive when attempting to print the documents; again, the staff were very helpful in assisting us to work around the issue, but it would have been better if we had been told of the issue beforehand, or a sign had been placed at the printer Bill: it was as well that I checked the bill line item by line item; we had been incorrectly charged for minibar items that we had not used, and for a breakfast that we had not taken; as always, the reception staff were polite and helpful, but this was the final instance of issues that really should not occur at an establishment that presents itself as the top 5 star accommodation in the city. Despite these issues, or maybe because I will be forewarned, I'll consider staying at this hotel on any future occasion that we visit Canberra, as the overall presentation and ambience of the hotel is excellent.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_455833918~“A very pleasant hotel experience visiting Canberra”~After a lot of online searching we booked a mystery deal through Wotif to visit Canberra for 3 days, our mystery purchase turned into a real success with accommodation booked at the Hotel Realm. Upon checkin we were offered a upgrade for a good price so took advantage and it was a winner, a beautiful suite with every mod con that you can imagine. Everything about this hotel was 5 star, the service, the gym, health club, pool, the staff and the underground parking which was included in the price. Green & red apples were available at conceiarge and fruit fused icy cold water also available. A Nespresso coffee machine & T2 tea was a nice touch. Would definitely go back to The Realm anytime.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455776086~“Disappointing”~Normally stay somewhere else but thought would stay here as I had heard good things, sad that it didn’t live up to what I heard. Arrival was fine, the guy on the desk was friendly and helpful. Entering the room, it had everything we needed and it looked clean and comfortable. We returned to the room late on the next day to find the room hadn’t been serviced, I rang reception and was told nothing could be done now, I told the girl that I was informing her of the situation and could she send up fresh towels. It was disappointing but I really didn’t require a service as it was late. The following morning, I went to reception to make sure our room would be cleaned on our second day, the guy who checked us in was there. He asked if I was staying in the right hotel as I wasn’t registered???? I said ‘You checked me in’. It was found that I had been checked into another room in the system. He assured me that my room would be cleaned on that day. Returning to the room that afternoon, discovered again that it wasn’t serviced again. So down to reception again. I got a Duty Manager this time and stated the situation, he offered me a service that afternoon and housekeeping came to my room but questioned me why I wanted a service, I had to state the room had never been serviced for the two days of my stay. Not confident that the system was going to work, before leaving the next day I went past reception to make sure it would be cleaned while we were out, and the lady assured me it would be this time and it was. My disappointment come from no follow up between the staff. The first time I rang, didn’t someone question, why is someone calling from a vacant room saying it wasn’t serviced? and nothing was left to say clean this person’s room the next day??? Then I was assured that my room would be cleaned and it wasn’t and I had to ask twice to make sure it was.  I worked in hotels so I know things can happened, but for the same thing to happen twice was a little sad to see. Also the water pressure in the shower, was bad and also the temperature would change while having a shower. When staying in a hotel a good shower it a must. We were located a room on the third floor, it had a very nice across the city and mountains but it was also the end of the building above the restaurant/bar with live music, the music stops at 11pm but just beware if you would like a quiet room. On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_455761436~“Its got everything you need as a traveller to feel relaxed and comfortable”~My wife and I spent 3 nights in a lovely spacious suite at the Realm whilst visiting exhibitions and other sights of interest as part of a Luxury Escapes booking. The Hotel is one part of a large hotel and restaurant precinct. We enjoyed the following: -large light filled rooms with modern decor -spacious kitchen including a microwave -washing machine and clothes dryer -large confortable bed -access to free movies on 2 widescreen TVs -excellent buffet breakfast - complimentary drink vouchers for each day redeemable at the Ostani restaurant\pub -free wi-fi -responsive and helpful staff -secure underground parking -bicycles available for hire -convenient location for visits to Galleries etc -choice of multiple quality restaurants adjacent to the Hotel -within walking distance to restaurant precinct at Kingston Foreshores~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455585094~“Great hotel in the Nation's Capital”~I stayed at Hotel Realm for nearly 6 months while I was working in Canberra. This is one of the best hotels in Canberra. The staff are really friendly and made an effort to try and make my stay as comfortable as possible and make me feel welcome every week. They pay attention to detail and are very helpful.  The rooms are very well maintained and clean. Some of the rooms over great views over Parliament House. The location of the hotel makes it easy to get around. There are buses running along the street right outside the hotel. There are a number of restaurants on site that offer a wonderful dining experience. Or you can take a short walk to Manuka where there are more restaurant choices. So you will never be short of food choices. The hotel also has a pool and a gym.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455529362~“Just the ticket! Loved it, you will too...”~We bought out stay on Luxury Escapes and couldn't have been happier with what we received. Great service, spacious rooms, comfortable beds and an industrial chic that makes for a memorable stay. Particularly like the balcony on Level 3. Didn't like the garbage pick ups (or a sound very similar on Saturday and Sunday morning). The Eco Health Club that we used twice was seriously well equipped and our package included parking - directly underneath- that was so convenient. The other thing that gave us confidence was the appearance early on of a number of Qantas crews. If it's good enough for Qantas, we knew we'd be happy and we were. Ostani, the bar downstairs, was a good addition and nicely done but three was nothing earth shattering about their pub grub. Nice place for a beer though all the same. Wouldn't hesitate to come back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455528956~“Great place to stay ”~Hotel Realm exceeded our expectations. Super comfortable and spacious room with a balcony where we spent much of our evenings after arriving home. Great, friendly service and a terrific health club in the basement. We would stay there again. Very relaxing holiday.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455299767~“Great value package”~We were looking to see the Versailles exhibition and looked for a package deal - what the Realm offered was exceptional value including tickets to the exhibition, breakfast, parking, movies, wifi, cocktails and antipasta.  Staff were wonderful, we selected an upper floor room and ended up in one of the executive suites - needless to say we could not have been happier with our stay and would definitely stay at the Realm again when in Canberra~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455135350~“Very enjoyable Canberra stay”~Very nice modern hotel. Our suite was mid level. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, sitting room, verandah. Very comfortable. We had free parking, free internet, movie/sport channels, buffet breakfast. We also had drinks at the bar, and ate one meal in the restaurant downstairs. My husband swam in the swimming pool. Location on National Circuit very convenient to our friends in Forrest and going to National Art Gallery etc. Hotel and staff were all excellent. Lovely stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454357001~“Great location with great sleeping quality”~We traveled for leisure and found that the location is perfect - close to capital hill with onsite secured parking which means lot of places are within walking distance. Staffs are nice and smile and the restaurant is great too! Inside the room, it has great variety of tea as well as coffee machine which giving us a great start of day to continue our road trip to Sydney. The Atrium Two-Bedroom had wonderful decor, bathroom for each bedroom and plenty of space, plus comfortable beds for both apartment and hotel room - real 5 stars and really enjoyed it. The only downside for us was we were having two room - one was the Atrium and the other was the hotel room. Even the staffs were kindly allocate us on the same floor, however, the hotel room and apartment were separated and accessed by two different lifts - we need to go down to the ground then go to other lift which made us having a bit exercises - but with nice Christmas deco and friendly staffs at the lobby we certainly not hesitate to doing so.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_454146030~“Hotel Realm -- Hotel Winner!”~24hour reception -- absolutely lovely and helpful staff. Bus stops into and from town located about 20m from the front door. Bar and food downstairs very, very good. In all - Luxury (and I only booked for a basic room). My travel companions had a suite, so much more room to spread-out. I was very happy with my room and didn't wish for any more space. And a tiny thing that is important to me -- Great Shower!!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_453912967~“Excellent quiet stay”~WE had a lovely quiet room , breakfast buffet had many healthy choices , bistro downstairs was lovely for evening meal and we enjoyed doing laps of the indoor swimming pool. Location good , we could walk to national gallery of australia.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_453747563~“5 Star - I don't think so”~Quite disappointing - the room was adequate, spacious, with comfortable bed and sumptuous pillows. That was the good things. The fridge had dried milk stuck on the shelves. The minibar was not replaced once during my 5 night stay, in spite of me asking for it to be and receiving assurances that it would be. Arriving back to my room after a day's absence, I was dismayed to find dirty glasses and a bin not emptied. The food was acceptable, although I didn't have any breakfast, I phoned ahead for coffee to find excuses as to why it wasn't ready and they had the order incorrect as well. Air-conditioning was very difficult to manage, OK for probably most of the year, but when I was there it was very hot - and I had a few quite uncomfortable nights. Also - I would think in a 5 star hotel, the bedside clock would be set. it was not and I managed to work out a way to set it using my old iPod. Luckily I had it with me, otherwise the bedside clock would've been useless. I would expect a Hotel of this calibre to ensure the clock was set after each checkout.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~2~3~nan
review_452534995~“50th Birthday ”~First class from beginning to end. It was my husband's 50th birthday weekend we stayed in a beautiful 2 bedroom apartment. As we walked into the room there were balloons ,beautiful basket of fruit and champagne with a hand written card from the staff.  A big thank you to Alex and Miguel for all there help and kindness in making my husband's birthday so memorable.  We have booked our next holiday for july and can't wait to return. This hotel deserves six stars.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452466369~“Weekend stay”~Fantastic room that has everything you would want for your stay. Kitchen with microwave, dishwasher, nespresso machine and washing machine. Large room with foxtel in both bedroom and living area with nice TVs. Check-in was quick and efficient. The let down for us was the service. Housekeeping did not service room even though the 'make up room' light was switched on at 11am (we returned to room around 8pm). I informed reception and they sent some coffee & water. The following morning we used express checkout, however when I received the emailed receipt, additional charges from another account were on our room bill. I informed hotel and the next day I received a refund without apology. Parking was easy, and free with our room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452236904~“First class hotel - recommend a suite”~We stayed in January. We have stayed in many hotels in Canberra. This was a good one. Clean room (suite) with very good bathroom facilities. Top notch. We got the room for a good price. Breakfast was pretty good. The location is excellent. Parking went smoothly.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_451803257~“Great stay”~The Realm is one of, if not the best motels we have stayed at in Canberra. First class all the way, the staff could not be more obliging and the rooms were of an excellent standard. 5 stars across the board.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451639659~“Classy and elegant - the best in Canberra”~We had previously stayed at the Burbury apartments in Canberra (which, like Hotel Realm, is a member of the Doma Hotels) but this time we thought we would try a 2 bedroom apartment at the Hotel Realm. Not many 5 star hotels offer self catering apartments, so we were very pleased to see that Hotel Realm offered 1 and 2 bedroom apartments which particularly suit us as a family. The reception staff were efficient, friendly and accommodating. The only criticism (if I had one) was that they could have given us clearer instructions to get into the car park - which is of course a minor detail only. The 2 bedroom apartment is absolutely huge - with the 2 bedrooms on each side of the apartment and the living area in the middle. Our apartment looked across to the Little National Hotel and a vast empty plot (covered with grass) - while not a spectacular view, it was very open and quite enjoyable sitting outside on the balcony watching the sunset. As the hotel is located in an office area and we stayed between Christmas and the New year, the area was very quiet (and in fact, rather deserted!) As requested, our second bedroom was configured with 2 single beds. Both bedrooms had an ensuite bathroom. In fact, the second bedroom had a separate dressing area as well. The bedrooms were very quiet at night, and the beds were very comfortable. The curtains were thick which mostly kept the room dark at night (important consideration when you have young kids!) The bathroom was stocked with Appelle products, which is a nice touch. I love Appelle products because they smell beautiful and are all natural. Both bathrooms are a good size (with double basins) and one of the bathrooms also had a bath (again, an important consideration with young kids). The kitchen was very well stocked if you are minded to cook your own meals. However, the hotel is surrounded by a number of very good cafes and restaurants so there is no problems wiht getting a good feed. Free wifi was provided (as you would expect of a 5 star hotel). There were a range of movies (many new releases included) available free of charge. What I would suggest as an improvement is an inclusion of a Bluetooth speaker. What we also appreciated was the inclusion (in the rates) of a car parking spot in a very large underground secure car park. We would definitely come back here to stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451566856~“Family stay mid week”~Stayed in 2 one-bedroom suites. Absolutely fantastic lay out and VERY spacious. We had a generous size bunk bed added to one suite and there was plenty of room. Kitchen and bathroom very nice, Hotel and rooms very modern.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450916300~“Lovely suite with lots of extras”~This was our first visit to Realm. The online check in worked well (and allowed us to select a 2pm checkout for an extra $40) and we were sent a text to say our room was ready at 11am on the day of our arrival!  We stayed in Suite 319 which was a large suite with separate bedroom, fabulous kitchenette/laundry (microwave, dishwasher, washing machine, coffee machine & T2 teas plus very nice section of snacks for purchase) and separate bathroom with shower and separate (and deep!) bath with lovely products. Bed was super comfy with great pillows.  We had a private balcony so were able to enjoy fresh air overnight, and with chairs and a table we had a morning and afternoon cuppa out there each day as well.  Staff were all helpful and efficient. The breakfast hostess is lovely and the buffet selection is extensive.  My favourite part of the whole hotel was the lap pool - 2 laps (1 dedicated to lappers) at an appropriate swimming temperature and spotlessly clean with a lap timer at one end and a clock at the other - so rare in a hotel and so appreciated!!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_450871509~“A Comfortable Stay”~We stayed here in two rooms with my elderly mother in December 2016. The beds were comfortable, the rooms a good size and the bathroom clean and also a good size. We were out of the hotel most of the day and only had tea at the restaurants so I cannot comment on the food at all. It is a little costly but it was a more comfortable stay than many of the other hotels in the vicinity.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_450845609~“Not exactly 5 Star but still great”~Exceptional service from staff, especially compared to Burbury Hotel. Only issues were with the cleanliness and functionality of the business centre. Keyboards were absolutely filthy and the printer was not working.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_450649596~“Not a 5 star performance”~This is a solid 4 star hotel but I'm not seeing it as a 5 as promoted. It just didn't have the extra touches I would expect of a true 5 star hotel like super fluffy towels and perfect housekeeping. Small but annoying things detracted from the 5 star rating like no mini-bar prices being provided in the room.  The hotel is a bit soulless. We had a one bedroom suite which was roomy and well appointed. Balcony was a good size but with no cushions for the wire seats it wasn't very comfortable. The kitchenette was small but adequate. Bathroom was great. Really disappointing was the fact that half the precinct's restaurants weren't open. For us this was one of the main reasons we booked here, and without all open, the area was quiet, lacking any atmosphere.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450573563~“Modern luxury”~Would highly recommend Hotel Realm for anyone visiting Canberra for work or leisure. My room was modern, very clean and luxurious with an amazing bed. Loved the T2 tea selection in the room!! The hotels restaurant/bar downstairs has a great atmosphere with an open air section perfect for an afternoon drink. The hotel is within close distance to Manuka and just a short walk up to Parliament House. My only criticism is the towels used in the bathroom were of poor quality. You'd expect high end plush towels, instead they're scratchy and cheap... They really let the bathrooms luxury feel down and need to be replaced.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_450556185~“Wonderful rooms with a view”~Had an overnight stay here, large rooms. Very friendly staff, great view with a nice setup.

review_450537199~“best hotel at Canberra ”~We stay at the Realm this time and we are really satisfying to stay. We stayed at the one bedroom suite and very spacious and have everything we need. Breakfast buffet is also good. Because January is the off season so we paid low. It was good stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450343809~“Beautiful Hotel”~Beautifully styled hotel, one bedroom apartments are quite large and well appointed. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Onsite free parking came in very handy. Close to Manuka and Kensington shopping and eating venues.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450298945~“Good for a short get away”~Headed to Canberra for 3 nights and enjoyed the hotel. Restaurants in complex are excellent. The bar is very busy and noisy and well patronised by locals as well. Suggest you book the restaurants you want prior to arrival to get a reasonable time. Reception and concierge are efficient but not fussy. Quiet achievers. Hotel staff were ok however room service is poor/slow which was surprising. I ordered a bottle and it took 45 minutes. No glasses. Then the wrong ones arrived anyway.  However.  The place is clean modern and top floor suites very comfortable. .  Breakfast and coffee are excellent.  I would suggest good value in a great convenient location. No views though.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450175282~“Wonderful Staff and great comfortable rooms”~Large Suite with well equipped kitchen (including clothes washing machine). Super large balcony - very comfortable king size bed. Staff were so personable and helpful. Free car parking underground was so convenient. Close to Manuka shopping. Only one restaurant/bar Ostani was open in January (quiet time but seemed very busy). Lots of locals drop by for drinks after work so quite buzzy. Indoor Lap Pool and spa available -we didn't use but it looked inviting. WiFi was free and fast. Definitely recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_450088783~“Super suite”~A quick getaway to our favourite capital city, this time staying in room 341, which was a very generous size apartment with king bed.  If you needed to spend an extended amount of time in Canberra this would be an excellent place to be-  Lots of wardrobe space, separate kitchenette with microwave, coffee machine and if you needed one, a dishwasher.  I have a passion for opening windows enjoy some fresh air, and thankfully there was no noise from outside to spoil the effect.  There was a nice balcony to enjoy the sunny morning and plenty of sofa and table space for dining or doing a crossword.  The bathroom was spacious and included a deep tub for that much appreciated relaxing soak.  The breakfast buffet was generous with lots of choices, I loved the fact that the poached fruit was from seasonally available stone fruits.  Staff at the Buvette restaurant were smiling and efficient.  We had a great time here and would not hesitate to return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449491774~“Lovely hotel, excellent service”~Stayed here as part of a package, included accomodation, tickets to Versailles exhibition at NGA, breakfast, & cocktails & antipasto platter. Great location for galleries, museum. Very comfortable large room, spotlessly clean. Good king size bed & good pillows. Bathroom good size, great shower, quality complimentary grooming products & lots of towels. TV playing up, maintenance person arrived within 10 minutes to fix it. Excellent room service menu. Staff polite & helpful at all times. Amazing breakfast buffet, huge choice of delicious hot & cold items, fresh juices & items very quickly replenished when running low. Hostess very helpful & pleasant. Room well stocked with tea, coffee etc, fresh milk readily available when requested. Staff called taxis for us & were very helpful. An excellent place to stay, highly recommended. We will certainly come here again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_449431617~“Nice Rooms central location”~Nice large room with comfortable bed. There were no towels in the room on arrival but this was quickly dealt with by reception. The hotel is well located to Kingston and Manuka providing a range of restaurants to choose from. There is a tapas/bar on the ground level which can get a bit noisy if you are looking for a peaceful stay - but on the other hand, it provides a lively place in an otherwise very "sombre" (pubic servant) location.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_448196574~“Nice hotel but poor service and staff lacking in knowledge”~The room and facilities were great but a big let down by poorly trained staff. Firstly, the check-in staff had no idea what he was doing.  The room was not ready at check-in time. I had to wait till 3pm before I could check-in. Directed me to the wrong set of elevators. Gave me the wrong directions to the National Museum of Australia. He also refused to offer me free breakfast that was advertised for Dec2016-Jan2017 (as noted on the trip advisor page). I had to pay $50 for two. The housekeeping staff did not replace teabags and coffee. I had to walk outside to the cart in the hallway and ask the staff for it. The hotel also seems to have one of the two elevators set on service mode for staff use, making elevator service very slow, given that there is only one left for guests. This is just inexcusable for a premium hotel.~3~nan~4~nan~5~nan~1~nan
review_447386433~“Great experience as usual”~We have family in Canberra and we celebrate Christmas in Canberra. We usually stay at the Realm, our preferred hotel (stacks better than the Hyatt). We usually get a 2 bedroom suite, which is great. We were not disappointed this time - the furnishings in the suite had in fact been improved to create more room and more of a luxurious feel. The service was great even on Christmas Day! The suite was cleaned and towels replaced. An happy stay as usual. Keep it up, please!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447349715~“Air con doesn't go below 22 degrees”~Nice, functional hotel. Except the air con doesn't go below 22 degrees which is a problem if you like a cool room when sleeping. Despite the staff's assurances it should go down to 19.5 degrees it doesn't! I know as we tried multiple rooms. Would not recommend this hotel for a summer visit therefore, winter would probably be ok.~2~nan~4~2~nan~nan~2~nan
review_446378355~“Good experience”~This hotel has great potential. It has five star touches but is definitely not a five star experience. For example things I would consider five star are the extras like the mattress quality, the linen, bathrobes, bathroom amenities etc, and these were all top notch at the Realm. However other things like the cleanliness of the room were not. They either don't have enough housekeeping staff to meet demands or they don't have a manager with an eye for detail because there is definite room for improvement.  We stayed in one of the suites with the kitchen. It wasn't dirty by any means but it was a bit grubby, just dusty here and there and the bath had hair in it from the previous guests. There weren't enough towels and the water bottles weren't replenished. The actual suite itself is fabulous and is huge. The bed was one of the best I've ever slept in and the bathroom was beautiful. No complaints about the decor and the staff were lovely. It is just the finer details that this hotel misses the mark on. If I was the housekeeping manager I would be checking every single room before a guest checks in and I felt like they do a very rushed job here. One other thing. The breakfast cafe which is also owned by the hotel across the street is terrible. Rude staff and disappointing food. I probably would stay at the Realm again as the bed was super and the staff were great. I would just hope the rooms were better inspected.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445695855~“suite stay? a bit of QA would have made it really pelasurable”~my family and i stay at this hotel often, and largely the hotel lived up to previous enjoyable experiences. music especially jazz is one of our loves and it seems that the TV menu although showing a radio enabled function flatly refused to produce any sound (no the mute button was not on -TV function worked as usual). there were no hand towels and they seemed to skimp on the face washers. trite though this may sound, it would have taken a bit of the edge out of the other issues we were dealing with at the time (the reason for our stay this time).~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_445140358~“Almost fabulous”~We stayed three nights in a suite on a Luxury Escapes package which was great value. The room had a real luxury feel and was very spacious. We had a huge bedroom, a living room and a small kitchen with a washer/dryer. Both the bedroom and lounge had large wall-mounted TVs. The bathroom was beautiful and had a bath. My only issue was with the shower head which I couldn't change to a finer spray, but was fine. The bed and bedding were perfect. We really appreciate sitting outside and the room had a good sized balcony. The furniture was good quality and the rooms and decor well designed. The location is good for what we were doing.  The notable problem with the hotel was the state of the common areas, namely the hallways and lifts. Over the three days they were consistently dirty, something which is easily fixed. The use of lino tiles in some areas was also a mystery to me. They have the look of a public hospital built in the 1970s and were an awful colour and very scratched. Breakfast was included and was excellent. Again there were a few areas that were less than clean such as the coffee machine. My feeling is that the manager/s have no real system for checking on the public areas daily.  Overall, it was excellent value and we really enjoyed our stay. Hopefully the cleanliness issues will be remedied. It's not that hard.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_444350387~“Hotel cancelled 3.5 hours before check in”~Having looked at the Realm online, the facilities looked great and I was really looking forward to my stay. Unfortunately, the hotel cancelled the reservation 3.5hours before check in citing that they were overbooked. The hotel then offered me a stay in a lower starred hotel for the same price and didn't seem to acknowledge the inconvenience to me. Whilst the hotel may look impressive, they don't seem to be able to offer 5 star customer service. Disappointing!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444126070~“21st Birthday party”~I had my 21st Birthday party at this Hotel. The event management staff were extremely unhelpful, disengaged and downright rude at times. I was extremely disappointed with the level of assistance provided and would not recommend them to others.  Once the event had been paid for we had no further contact from them arriving on the day of the event to a room that had not been cleaned and was incorrectly set up despite the provision of a floor plan seven days prior. The Event Manager was not even present on the day nor were we given any contact details to address the issue on site. We were continually provided with mis-information around costings for food and services and our expectations were not managed nor met on the night. For example – They tried to charge a cakeage fee per person for display cake/cupcakes and drinks package cost for children. They also provided inaccurate information around food charges and provided a sub-standard chocolate fountain that was not what we had been led to expect in their on-line advertising. The banquet staff on the night did their best to address some of our concerns but not before many arguments by which time I was quite upset and stressed and this impacted on my enjoyment of the evening. Following the event I contacted the hotel and raised my concerns. Despite numerous email traffic and phone calls, any concerns we raised were either dismissed or blamed on other third party providers. This venue has inexperienced events management staff, poor client service pre and post event. They have little respect for the customer and their sole focus is on money. Not to be recommended.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_444091776~“Hotel Realm”~Recently stayed with my family at the Realm and it was as usual a pleasure to stay there. Facilities, location and staff are always excellent. Restaurants in the hotel offer great variety. Close location to other restaurants across the road.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_443885911~“Great hotel but make sure this location suits”~This is a great hotel -modern, spacious rooms, free wifi, Nespresso, excellent breakfast, great lap pool, free parking on weekends, lovely staff and well priced It is in a bit of a dead-zone for the weekend in Canberra -you will need to drive to most restaurants, shops and attractions. It is about 5 mins run down to the lake for a jog~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~5~nan
