review_478478253~“Perfect spot for family weekend away”~We've just returned from an Easter break at the East Hotel and it was FABULOUS. Our two bedroom apartment was perfectly spacious with two bathrooms, sitting area and full kitchen & laundry. Tonnes of room for everyone. Dinner at Agostinis on Friday night was lovely and breakfast in the quirky Muse cafe (browse books and eat - love it) perfect. Location is excellent with Manuka shops a two minute walk away and Kingston shops 5-10 mins walk. Kids loved the extra special treat of an Easter egg scramble on Sunday morning. Staff were lovely - all in all a ripper of a place!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478317912~“3 days in Canberra ”~East Hotel is a friendly and well run establishment. The rooms are spacious and impeccably clean. There are various dining options on site or for short walk to Kingston there are many more choices. Manuka also has a host of dining experiences. This is our second visit to East and we will be sure to return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478076833~“An excellent Hotel apartment and friendly staff.”~We stayed four nights over Easter in a one bedroom apartment. The Reception staff were so helpful and accommodating. The room was excellent with a quality bed and bed linen. The kitchen was surprisingly well equipped. There are some nice touches such as an apple and candy bowl in the lobby. Secure parking was excellent. This is now our hotel of choice in Canberra.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_477322437~“Good but could have been great”~Fantastic apartment with modern decor with a really comfortable bed. However there were large stains on the sofa, on the nets and on the carpet. I spoke to reception about the stains and he said someone would spot clean - nobody came.  For a modern hotel I was expecting a Bluetooth speaker and phone charger (like at Hotel Hotel). I found the male reception staff to be inexperienced and not particularly welcoming However I would definitely stay here again~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476993229~“AHEAD OF TREND - GREAT CONCEPTUAL THINKING”~East provided a really great ahead of trend experience. There was enough to do within the hotel, so that going out was an option, but if you did leave the hotel you were right in the middle of the lovely areas of Kingston and Manuka. The Appartment was fantastic, Agostinis is one of the best Italian restaurants we have been to, we are not Italian, but visit Italy yearly, so thats a big call. All the staff were attentive and relaxed and the great attention to interior design was perfect.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan

Comfortable bed and well laid out bathroom, large living area with couch and table and chairs. Gym was great... equipment is quite new and works well. Service was very prompt and efficient. Car parking = $10 per night Will definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475501458~“EXCELLENT BASE FOR A FAMILY GETAWAY”~Stayed here three nights in a family suite (adjoining one bedroom with studio) on the family fun package. Massive credit to East Hotel for thinking about families as guests...we felt most welcome and the kids are well catered for. East Hotel is also really well located close to the Manuka shops/cafes/Coles which is good for families. Bottle shop across the road which is good for parents! Our two bedroom setup was very spacious, three tv's, two bathrooms, laundry and the kitchens well equipped. My only issue (and why this is not rated 5 stars) was that the king bed was extremely firm...too firm that it was uncomfortable for us, nearly like sleeping on the floor. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Plenty of undercover parking. Tip....a drink at Joes Bar whilst keeping the kids in line of sight on the Hotel's free Apple computers is a real treat.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_474386185~“An excellent hotel in all aspects, service,facility's, rooms and restuarants. You could live in and no need to leave.”~Arrived late afternoon, had difficulty parking outside to check in, but used hotel car park with easy access to reception. A very large room for 2 persons with small bar area to eat in. A choice of 3 restaurants made it a difficult choice, but settled for MUSE which combines an excellent bookshop. Casual dining with excellent menu and each dish we had was a credit to the chef. Also an excellent local and imported wine list. A very pleasant night.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474376742~“Great hotel, great vibe”~Great place to stay in Canberra, walking distance to Manuka and Kingston shops and restarants. Great new pizza restaurant just adds to to the feel, with the cafe and bar already there. Staff friend lay and accomodating.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_473947657~“Home away from home”~This hotel turned out to be a surprise. The facilities are terrific, I wish had found it earlier and on this occasion, stayed longer. The new restaurant, Agostini's has significant teething problems but the food is excellent.~4~4~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_473667989~“Great hotel, amazing service”~East Hotel has a great vibe, and the rooms and service are fantastic. We were traveling with a 7 month old, and the staff helped immensely with the type of room we needed. Having kitchenette facilities is great, but don't expect to want to cook much with wonderful meal options right in the lobby. Great pizza at Agostini's and Muse was perfect for breakfast each day. Walking distance to major attractions. Love this hotel!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473437950~“Another great stay”~A beautiful modern hotel with the addition of Agostinis restaurant and Joes Bar has seen it grow to an all purpose venue for accomodation, leisure dining and drinking as well as the addition of modern conference Facilties for corporates~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_472822478~“Excellent hotel in great area”~We stayed here for two nights to attend an exhibition at the Australian Gallery. The hotel is in a great location and close to plenty of restaurant choices in Manuka and Kingston. We were pleseantly surprised with the spaciousness of the room and in particular the large bathroom. Everything is thought of, robes, excellent toiletries etc. Comfortable bed, quiet (apart from the cockatoos!). We did have breakfast at Muse but were not impressed. Slow service and when my husband's muesli arrived it was without milk or a spoon. Unfortunately Joe's bar was closed on Sunday and Monday when we stayed so couldn't try that. We did dine at the Italian restaurant which was okay, but again the service slow and inexperienced. Mind you, we have found this at virtually every place we have eaten at in Canberra. Must be a "Canberra thing, i.e. slow and vague". However would be more than happy to stay at East again and have already recommended the hotel to friends.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_472779511~“East Hotel”~The staff were friendly and courteous staff. The room was spacious, nicely decorated and clean. Location of the hotel was excellent for me. Restaurant and bar were very good. I will be staying again. I recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472580873~“Best hotel in Canberra by far...like home”~This is by far my favourite hotel in Canberra. It's in a good location between Kingston and Manuka so plenty of great options for food. From the moment you walk into this hotel the staff are excellent. I've been coming here 3 years now and it's gotten so popular I am booking in as early as possible sometimes 4-6 months in advance as this place does book out. The hotel and rooms have great colourful decor and interesting artwork and photography. I love the lobby lounge area. The rooms are studio and apartment style with great toiletries that smell amazing. Oh my gosh the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. If you don't want to leave the hotel For food there is a good choice of restaurants at the hotel - I recommend Joe's or room service is also good too.  If you need a gym the hotel has a small but functional one which is fine for me. The best thing here is that you feel like a valued guest.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472554754~“Exceptional Amazing Superb Terrific”~That's what EAST stands for. From the moment you arrive you are treated as a very special guest.The service was superb. We booked on-line and were upgraded to the Versailles Package which included free tickets to the exhibition and free parking. Then we received a voucher for drinks at Joe's Bar and if that was not enough, we found two complimentary piccolo sparkling in the mini bar. The suite was terrific. Modern, large, spotless and very well appointed. Joe's Bar was amazing. The atmosphere and decor was beautiful and the menu just right. Muse restaurant was exceptional. The menu was as eclectic as the bookstore theme and the offerings varied and very tasty. This is the place to stay when in Canberra.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_472545343~“close to Manuka restaurants”~From the car park, check in, the room itself (a one bedroom unit), east hotel was great. The unit came with a small laundry and a clothes airer - nice not to have to use the dryer. Kitchenette seemed to have everything. Bathroom was excellent - great design. We stayed 3 nights and were utterly delighted.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_472522255~“Fantastic”~East Hotel goes beyond it competitors in making sure your stay is everything you could hope for. The rooms are modern and spacious with every need catered for.

review_471288312~“Comfortable, clean and quiet”~Everything functioned as it should, staff were unobtrusive and efficient. Special mention to Justin on the front desk for being totally on the ball, very helpful and he clearly enjoys being effective in his role.  Rooms were more spacious than we'd anticipated, beds comfortable, and the linen was lovely. Only suggestion I'd make (and this goes for every hotel in the world) a well lit mirror is a great aid in make up application, and I'm sick of carrying one with me when I travel.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_471192784~“Happy 80th”~This hotel is perfect in everyway. The room is spotless, the facilities excellent and toiletries top quality. The staff are very friendly and helpful.Free inhouse WIFI.

review_470720605~“Great hotel”~We were lucky enough to get a voucher for this hotel which included tickets to a exhibition at the Art Gallery. We arrived early and the room was not ready but they gave us two complimentary drink vouchers for the bar. The room was large and well equiped. The King bed was comfortable. Small balcony looking towards Manuka Oval. Breakfast was included and we ate in the coffee shop, not a buffet but we ordered from the menus. Manuka shops just up the road. Manuka pool, a 1930s outdoor 30 mt.pool,is only a few hundred yards away. Alas it closes during the winter but it is a great pool. We would stay here again~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

The beds are comfortable in the rooms have a balcony which we thought was nice~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470171581~“East Hotel Canberra”~East Hotel is an excellent choice of stay when staying for more than a night or two in Canberra. Facilities of kitchen and washer and dryer make life so much easier. Rooms are spacious. Service is friendly. Joe's restaurant is excellent and so too is Muse, the spot for brekkie. Secure parking is also a plus.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469610993~“Great hotel with fabulous studio rooms”~No hesitation in saying this is a great hotel. Very modern, very stylish, well-designed, decorated and thought out. I stayed in an East Studio and quite simply you could live here - permanently. With a wonderful, comfortable bed, the bedroom is simple and tranquil. The shower area is spacious and spreadout. You have a big lounge area and a balcony with chairs and table. The studio also includes a kitchen, but not a kitchen like some aparthotels with the odd pot and pan, it has everything you need, including washer and dryer. The whole Studio is divided up very nicely and gives a huge amount of space, making for a very relaxing experience. The common areas such as the lobby are equally spacious and well thought out. With a wonderful breakfast served in the Muse cafe, which along with Joe's Bar also serves customers not staying in the hotel as well, giving a nice sense of the hotel being part of the local area, not a fortress for guests. If you need/want it - a great gym as well with lots of space. Staff were always nice and helpful. Overall, a great place to stay and highly recommended.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469484056~“A few days in Canberra”~My husband and and I stayed in the East apartment, And can recommend it highly. Had all the amenities and luxury to make our short stay a pleasure.

review_468677079~“East Hotel - a breath of fresh air in hotel accomodation”~The hotel is centrally located to all the major attractions and is ideally located to take advantage of the new dinning precinct down on the lakes edge in Kingston. Reminiscent of the Darling Harbour set-up but still a way to go to match that. However, it is a good start and over time and local patronage should be a nice place to head for a meal. Hotel is also handily located to the Kingston shops and restaurants strip just 400+ metres down the roadso easy walking.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_468467785~“Top notch ”~Top notch. Accomodation, Food, Staff, Location. We didn't want to leave the hotel.  On arrival we were upgraded to an apartment with a balcony. Tick.  Joes Bar is a great spot to relax and enjoy a snack. Muse is great for breakfast and dinner.  Their new Italian restaurant is so good we booked in for a second night.  All the staff are very friendly and professional. We especially thank Reception staff for their help when I was unwell ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468467593~“Love this hotel”~Groovy, funky and very central. Loved our room, the facilities, the outlook and the vibe, and it was quiet at night. Will definitely be back.

review_468394209~“Great hotel”~Wonderful two days staying at the hotel. Very central to Kingston foreshore where there are great restaurants catering to all tastes and central to Canberra sightseeing. The only annoying problem we had was actually getting into the hotel where vehicle access is via the rear street with poor signage indicating it is the carpark to East Hotel.~5~3~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_468384262~“Great place to stay”~We enjoyed our stay as usual and the staff are very welcoming. Room 403 was very good and the balcony is great. One thing, being from Victoria and not Rugby fans, the lack of AFL on Foxtel and so much rugby, could be better. Conveniently between Manuka and Kingston, so many choices of restaurants.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468197646~“a short break in ACT”~Our stay was wonderful. We were close to our family in Kingston and there were plenty of places to have dinner. The locality was perfect for going to see the sights. The apartment was well-equipped and the bed was comfortable.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_467360038~“Very nice”~The staff was very professional and pleasant. They gave us vouchers for the bar and I thought that it wouldn't be that great but the drinks were good and the calamari appetizer was well done.

The staff was very accommodating I would recommend anyone to stay there and I would stay there again without hesitation.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Wonderful fresh bathrooms, coffee pods in the suite with a comfortable bed, good gym for a hotel and is in perfect distance to either Manuka shops, Kingston shops and maybe a 15 minute walk from Kingston foreshore.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464700032~“Can see why it is number one on TA”~East is easily one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. From the friendly and always helpful staff to the chocolate freckles on offer in the foyer East has thought about the whole traveller experience and got it oh so right. The room we had was spacious and comfortable although I was not a fan of the pillow. My wife had noticed you could order other pillows so at 1am, not getting much sleep, I rang down to the desk to see if I could have a softer pillow. I swear it arrived about one minute later.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464148326~“First East Hotel experience”~It was our 3rd visit to Canberra but first for my dad, and it was a pleasant experience. Was glad that although there were a bit of confusion during booking, I still got the package I wanted, which was overall excellent value for money. The stay was really good and the breakfast at Muse is nice.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_464012728~“A not so pleasant experience in an otherwise nice, very clean, modern hotel”~Travelled with another family. We were warmly greeted on our arrival. Staff are all friendly and do what they can to please guests. Our apartment was extremely clean and modern. I loved the long bench in the bathroom ample space to spread things out. The kitchen is well equipped with pots/pans/utensils. It even had washing machines/dryer.  The response time is very efficient compared to other hotels. e.g. requesting for extra towels. The children were tired so we decided to call for room service. Adults can relax while the children played the X Box games provided. The meals were delivered from the Italian restaurants downstairs. Sadly my husband found a piece of glass in his steak which later was told was a piece of hard plastic. During dinner, our lights went off twice (only our apartment, there were lights in the corridor outside) and had to call for assistance. Again someone came to our rescue fairly promptly on both occasion but that had ruin our evening, our friends decided to go back to their own apartment and I went to bed early because I couldn't be bothered dealing with lights going off for the third time. They gave us some credit to compensate for the incidence but this has ruin our experience.  We also tried 'Muse' the modern Australian restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it was sensational! We all enjoyed the breakfast albeit the luke warm latte. It was also very noisy was hard to chat. Overall it is a beautiful hotel and the staff are very attentive and courteous. If it wasn't the 'twice black out' and the 'plastic in the steak' incidences, I would have given this place 5 stars~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_463859193~“Loved it”~We love staying in boutique hotels. This one is perfect. It does help to have a car. It's close to lots of restaurants and the side of Canberra where you have easy access to Parliament House and the galleries.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463608087~“No1 Hotel in Canberra”~We've stayed at a lot of hotels around Australia and this one has my heart. The finishings are immaculate everything is just what my family & I look for in a hotel! We also booked through their website and got complimentary parking, drinks and wifi! Also as it was my partners birthday New years Eve they brought him up a bottle of champagne and he spent most of his night in the bath! They were also very courteous and brought a crib up for my little one I didn't even ask how pleasant!  10/10 for staff, drinks and overall experience!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463607990~“Another great stay”~We visited the Versailles exhibition this past weekend and chose to stay (for the third time) at East Hotel. We were a party of ten and all stayed at East and all were very pleased with the hotel and the hospitality. Four of the five couples were upgraded and we all received complementary parking.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463568005~“One of the best hotels I have stayed in for a very long time”~The hotel was absolutely delightful. The rooms were very well decorated and the pod coffee machine was a life saver for my daughter. Location was very good and lovely and quiet. I would recommend the hotel to any person looking for a good quality hotel with very comfortable rooms for any visit to Canberra.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463555490~“Must stay in Canberra”~From the moment we arrived we were greeted in a warm,friendly and professional way. The hotel is very modern with lovely deco. The rooms are really lovely and ours was very spacious and super clean and very well equipped.The hotel is in a very central position for sightseeing or whatever your doing in Canberra. The staff were really lovely and we would highly recommend anyone to stay here and we will be back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463289843~“Very Saturday”~Following a days drive from Brisbane - Canberra it was a comfort to have a luxurious hot shower with great pressure & to fall into bed with crisp sheets & no divets that old mattresses get. Although we didn't use the kitchenette. It looked to be well stocked.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463218912~“Excellent Hotel”~I stayed in the East Hotel for two weeks while on business. It is a modern and clean hotel with friendly staff that is and close to the foreshore, restaurants, and shops. It is also in relatively close proximity to museums and memorials.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463076750~“East hotel”~terrific staff, hotels and rooms. no complaints and cant wait to return. the rooms were clean and spacious, cutlery and crockery was all great as well. terrific quality bathroom products negates the need to BYO~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463059709~“Another great stay”~Been to East about 5 times now and it is always reliable. Apartment rooms are spacious, clean and have every amenity needed. The washer/dryer came in handy this stay. Great location, great staff, easy parking/access. Sometimes hard to get a booking but no surprise given the reliability and consistent quality of East.~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_462840556~“Great Choice of Hotel in Canberra ”~We booked at East based on the great online reviews; it lived up to the reviews. The whole hotel is funky and new, foyer has free lollies and fruit, Mac computers, lots of couches etc. Staff were excellent to deal with. We were upgraded to a luxe studio which was large, nicely furnished, had a balcony, kitchenette, coffee pod machine, spa bath and a very comfy bed. We booked directly through East's website so received free parking, wifi and 2 free house wines at Joes Bar. Joes Bar was fun on a Saturday night, we didn't eat there but it has a good vibe. We hired bikes on Sunday morning for a nice ride around the lake - I would definitely suggest booking bikes as ours were the only ones left when we picked them up at 9am. 5 minute walk to restaurants and cafes at Kingston, 15 minute walk to the Kingston foreshore with many more restaurants, pub directly across the road, Coles around the corner - all in all the hotel is in a great location. Easy drive to all key Canberra sites. If you're looking for a great dinner check out Ottoman Cuisine - it was only a flat 20 minute walk from the hotel! We will certainly stay at East on our next trip to Canberra.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462828009~“Weekend getaway”~Very hipster. Modern and yet retro. Very clean. Has breakfast. Bar was designed beautifully. Good location. My experience was flawed by the details.  We got three different stories of what was included in the breakfast. Breakfast staff seemed very laissez faire about service. The bar staff was similar.  Our key cards had to replaced a few times. The gate for the car park would not open with our key card. And at 7:30 am on Sunday another guest knocked on our door looking for another guest.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461860907~“Excellent”~The hotel was great in all aspects, easy to find, check in, park etc. The rooms were very clean, comfortable & spacious. The architecture and interior design is artistic and stylish without trying. The bar, cafe and foyer "excellent". ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461700365~“East Hotel Best in Canberra!”~East Hotel provides a wonderful experience! From the spacious rooms, with kitchenette, in-room laundry, and comfy beds to the small but excellent gym, and the friendly on-site Joe's Bar, everything about the East is meant to please, and it does! While not in the city center, it's location in the Kingston neighborhood means there is plenty of shopping and restaurants within a short walk. I will definitely look to stay at the East whenever I am in Canberra.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461359332~“Untitled”~Great location for events at manuka oval and close to restaurants at manuka, Kingston and Kingston shores. Staff friendly , room beautiful and clean. Muse restaurant yummy! Close drive to galleries etc~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_461341428~“Just cool and easy.”~The staff here look after you very well. The rooms are great. The bar is cool. The food is good - no really good. We were working off site but were given access to spaces we needed for work last minute as a special request - and it was given with out fuss and generously. Thanks. We are coming back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461325228~“Good hotel but needs restaurant”~The. East is one of the good longer stay business hotels for space and relative convenience Good facilities but why not more free internet? The lack of the restaurant is really impacting this rating though Joe's bar does not compensate for a fully fledged restaurant and room service is limited compared to other hotels Looking forward to the new restaurant.....very soon I hope~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461256770~“Fantsastic, Modern and chic hotel”~East hotel is easily Canberra's best hotel. The staff are fantastic, its inn a great location and the rooms are modern and clean. I stayed for 6 weeks while I was waiting for my apartment to be completed and I was very impressed. The food at Muse and Joes bar is lovely too and room service was always efficient. I highly recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461086425~“Great for kids”~This was our third trip to the East Hotel with young kids (who keep begging us to return). The location is great - between Manuka and Kingston and walkable to both plus the new foreshore precinct on the lake. And it's not just the super cool kids cubby house rooms with their very exciting bunk beds and games that keep us coming back - the service is really great, the decor is hip but comfortable, the rooms are well equipped with everything you need (washing machines and dishwashers etc) and the lollies and water at reception are also a great pull on the kids. The bar even gave our kids free drinks when we went there to redeem our adult free drink vouchers. Well worth a stay! We love it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461033978~“Lovely Kingston stay”~Had two nights here and would return - it's a fresh, funky place with excellent service.  On check out our parking was deemed free ($10/24hrs normally) - a nice touch, to add to the other nice touches: help yourself lolly jars in the foyer, a coffee pod machine in the room, lots of free magazines and newspapers, two good eating options at the base of the hotel.  Three little negatives: 1. they advertise they have an extensive movie collection - which they do- if you want to pay for it. The payment isn't listed anywhere until you're just about to order. 2. Wifi isn't free. Seriously?! It's 2017. It should be. 3. The bathrooms are too open plan. No one wants to go to the toilet and have their travelling partner hear them.  Other than that, it was reasonably priced and all the staff were very happy to help. I understand they have cool kids rooms too, with bunk beds, which would be fun for travelling families.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460995013~“Best kept secret in Canberra”~Trendy hotel with great vibe - highly recommend a stay here for business or leisure. Large rooms with mini kitchen. Hotel close to fab shops and restaurants of Manuka and Kingston. Staff professional and friendly. This is my new 'go to' hotel in Canberra~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460377801~“A superb hotel”~Studio apartment had everything needed. Excellent fitting out. Very comfortable. Quiet at night. Bar. Food. Bookshop all great. Very good value. Easy to travel to city locations. Staff very friendly. Wouldn't bother to look elsewhere next time~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460238582~“Everything we needed”~We stayed for two weeks and found the suite comfortable, well-appointed, and impeccably clean and fresh. There are so many details -- refrigerator, stove-top, oven, electric kettle, toaster, washer/dryer, all in great working order. The staff, both at the front desk and in housekeeping, are pleasant and helpful. I had breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants, Muse, and enjoyed it, but with both Kingston and Manuka shops (including grocery stores) and restaurants in easy walking distance (5-15 mins) I most frequently went out to eat. With such a long stay it was very convenient to have laundry facilities right there in the suite - even laundry detergent was provided. The hotel gym was useful, not huge but not tiny, nice and clean, with a couple of treadmills, a row machine, dumb bells, a weight machine, etc.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459849622~“East is Best”~Our third visit to this hotel. It is now definitely our 'go-to' hotel for this destination, we tried several others but nothing compares. Good sized rooms, clean and modern, great beds and linen and the hotel is quiet too. The car park underneath the hotel is very convenient and not too expensive. The hotel is walking distance to all the restaurants and shops in Manuka, which is an added bonus. Definitely recommend this hotel.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
