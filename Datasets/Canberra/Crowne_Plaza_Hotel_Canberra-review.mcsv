review_478465369~“Great Service & Location”~I always stay here when I go to Canberra. It is in a great location only minutes from plenty of restuarants and shopping. It is also right next to to the Canberra Casino. The staff here are fantastic and always really helpful and nothing ever seems like too much trouble. The rooms are spacious and nice and clean. A great place to stay when in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_478060686~“Unbeatable location Great Staff Good Hotel but in need of renos”~We stayed at this hotel during Easter break for four nights with family and booked a twin queen bed room.  Firstly some good points which would make me come back:  1. Unbeatable location - 3-4 minutes walk to the main restaurant and shopping strip .. internal access from hotel lobby to Canberra casino. Even if driving, most of the attractions are within 5-8 minutes drive  2. Courteous staff 3. Great breakfast however hot breakfast options for vegetarians could be improved - we bought a breakfast package at the time of booking which turned out to be very cheap.  Things which put me off: 1. Carpet of the hotel room was dirty to an extent where I didn't let anyone walk bare foot on it. As a matter of fact the carpet across the whole hotel needs replacement.  2. Parking fees were steep at 20.00 per day  3. There was minimal human hair on both our beds .. we chose to just sleep after cleaning it ourselves as it was already close to 2300 and the kids were sleepy.  On the 2ND day of our stay, housekeeping was not done and we came back to the way we left the beds .. once again we made the beds and went to sleep however had to ask for the towels to be replaced.  4. Hygiene of a place is something that I cannot ignore. As I mentioned a few points above regarding dirty carpets human hair etc., this is something that put me off completely. I spoke to staff and they advised the hotel was looking at being refurbished sometime next year. Unless this happens we are less likely to be coming back to this hotel.  5. No USB charging ports  6. Bathrooms need significant upgrade  Overall it can be a great hotel if all the issues are addressed. I would not categorise this hotel anymore than 3.9 because it is a nice hotel however is outdated  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476658243~“exceptional staff service”~we checkin on good friday which was fully booked. Allocated a room with handicapped bathroom requested a room change and was politely advised that rooms fully booked but will changed room the next day which was handled with politeness and we were kept informed on the progress . Reception staff especially Mr Lucas Ziera were professional , concierge well versed in all areas, buffet breakfast well catered for and good value.

review_476653325~“Nice spot”~Package included breakfast but once at breakfast was told had to pay extra for my son. Good range of food to choose from at breakfast. Close to city center, restaurants and shops. Parking was an issue as we were told to park in the convention center parking lot and walk back with our bags. Not sure why we were told this as I ask concierge and he said no just park down stairs. Parking costs $20 day extra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476262156~“Very Average”~Family of 4 on the Saturday evening, checking in was nice and staff were friendly. The carpark we were told it was $19 per day with unlimited drives in and out, we end up paying $40 because the staff forgot to give us parking card. The room was a disappointment because it was very small, the sofa bed wasn't made up and we have to ask to be made. The way they made it was very poor. They have mould in the bathroom on the ceiling in the shower/bath tub, I told the receptionist and she was apologetic about it all. The receptionist and hotel gave us a bottle of wine and the Easter egg for the kids was a great touch so thank you.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475998023~“Nice, clean, helpful staff”~Close to the CBD, lake and war memorial. Bit of a walk to main restaurant area (15min), the in-house restaurant is expensive and had a limited menu. Breakfast selection and quality was amazing. Purchase cost is expensive but if you pre-purchase at reception for the duration of your stay the discount was substantial (around 35%) and it brings it under the average hot breakfast cost at a cafe. Staff were extremely helpful and the maintenance of the hotel was good. Has carpark is in basement and can become full if it is busy, overflow parking is provided around the corner which is a pain in wet weather~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475746885~“Nice stay over Easter long weekend ”~We booked a room with 2 queen beds. Room is ok, although the bathroom was very small and looks like it can benefit from a renovation. The buffet breakfast, included in our deal, was tasty. There is underground parking for additional fee.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474387293~“Great room ”~Happy with our stay over the weekend. We didn't eat there as it was quite pricey, eg breakfast $30. Bed was good, room quiet with good blockout blinds. The staff were average and the bathroom could definitely do with an update. Pricey for what you got but that is Canberra.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473960099~“Nice size room ”~We recently stayed at this hotel as it was the main partner hotel for the Australian Running Festival. The room was a great size and always welcome a bath after a tough run. Unfortunately the service let the hotel down a bit. Mainly with the room cleaning side of things. It was always serviced very late in the day which made it hard when you needed to chill out before the run the day before and after the run. A few comments were made that as a partner hotel to the race maybe consider putting a bus to the start line available to runners.  Overall good food though and lovely room~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473290953~“Great hotel, dated bathroom”~Hotel was great. Room good size and like the orientation of the bed. Bathroom dated and shower in bath. Reception quick, courteous and professional. Great buffet breakfast and excellent coffee. Stay in room not facing atrium.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_471992970~“One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in”~I stayed here for 4 days or a conference. The room was very comfortable, Red Salt restaurant was great both for dinner[one of the best well-done tenderloin steak] and the buffet breakfast. The location was great. It just didn't have an indoor pool and a 24H gym[There is an outdoor pool and a gym though].~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_471822598~“Nice rooms in a great location ”~Professional reception and concierge service. Rooms were larger than I expected and quite cosy. Comfortable beds and pillows, bathrooms somewhat dated but satisfactory, sufficient closet space. Rooms tidied efficiently daily. Didn't dine for breakfast but did have a function at the glebe room which was serviced well by the wait staff although the food was only so-so (often the case when having to serve a whole room simultaneously I know). The location is fantastic and glebe park next door was a welcome place to relax in the outdoors. More pricy than others in the cbd but worth it in my opinion.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471777746~“Room ok, dinner not so much”~Stayed for 2 nights at the end of a parliamentary sitting week. Check in was quick and efficient and staff member offered the free IHG club sign up to get the complimentary free wifi which was great. Room was not as modern as I was expecting and I think the rooms have seen better days. Nothing specifically wrong with it, I suppose I just expected something beyond the multitude of basic 'business' hotel rooms I have stayed in over the years given the price being charged. After a tiring flight into Canberra was thinking about getting room service, but saw the $5 service charge for someone to ride the elevator to carry the plate to my room rather than my table and decided to sit in the restaurant. Ordered the twice cooked Berkshire pork belly which I think was about $35. Not impressed. Two pieces of 1" wide pork belly approx. 2.5" long topped with two off-tasting scallops; 3 asparagus tips; a couple of mini carrots; 2 sickly sweet glazed cherries and a smear of jus, that's it, for $35........ lucky I ordered a side dish of (ordinary) steamed vegetables otherwise I would have left even more hungry than I did. I thought of getting a dessert but wasn't happy to hand over $16 for a range of run of the mill options. Instead, I popped outside and walked to the mini mart and grabbed a couple of chocolate bars to get my sweet fix for $4. Had two double beds in the room. A king or queen bed would have been nicer to give the room more space but not a big issue. Bed was comfy but the pillows were too high and spongy and not to my liking. I couldn't find a hotel manual in the room so don't know if they have a pillow menu but would be nice to have a range in the cupboard for guest choice. Bathroom was average with the toilet behind the door which was difficult to navigate in the middle of the night without turning the light on. Minibar was average with the usual overpriced snacks and drinks and complementary instant tea/coffee. Checkout was quick and efficient. Overall stay was adequate and happy to recommend room for business travellers.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471765254~“Perfectly acceptable ”~Stayed here to attend a function at National Convention Centre - the closest hotel to NCC (essentially co-located without being same building).  This is a perfectly functional and acceptable hotel - ideal for NCC functions. Not sure I would stay here for a family holiday though.  Internal "atrium" style architecture- so slightly noisy for some rooms located over open bar and dining (despite "low noise area" signs).  Rooms comfortable. I had a twin (double) room. Good quality bed and decent pillows. Blinds, not curtains, on windows.  In-bath shower with hand rails. Average quality soap and shampoo.  Didn't dine in hotel but restaurant and bar looked pretty good.  On a business trip? Would recommend. Family holiday? There are more comfortable digs around.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470198315~“Another lovely experience ”~This was our second visit. We had a lovely, quiet room overlooking the park. Friends had suggested other places to stay so we checked them out. Crowne Plaza's location is unbeatable and we love the view. We will return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469542281~“Versailles exhibition in the Nation's Capital. ”~We stayed here for a weekend in order to see the Versailles exhibition. I am so pleased to write that this hotel's location is excellent. It took a ten minute cab ride to the National Art Gallery and there were also cabs ready to pick us up once we'd had enough time to view the spectacular exhibition. The breakfast buffet was well worth it: pancakes, omelettes, fresh fruits, Danish pastries and muffins, sausages and other types of delicious cured meats. The coffee was equally satisfying and we wouldn't hesitate to return here for more.... The only issue we had was the bathroom; it's dated and needs to be replaced. It's also very tiny and when we rang to discuss the issue with a duty manager no one responded. I eventually spoke with someone the following day and was led to believe that all the bathrooms are the same. This simply means that the bathrooms need to be renovated, as in every other aspect the room was modern and the space was well utilised. There was plenty of space and the view of the park was lovely. The convenience of a safe is always handy and the wardrobes were more than adequate. The positioning of the TV set was also well considered and thankfully there were plenty of power points in easy to reach places. So overall excellent.  We'd definitely return here. The airport is also not far from the hotel, although be aware that there is a flag/tariff added to the overall cab charge from the airport. This does not apply to cabs going to the airport.  For the lovers of shopping Canberra Centre is less than five minutes walk from the hotel and there is everything there from food (fresh food, take away and restaurants) supermarkets, jewels and clothing pieces. I'm sure that there are other shops too but they're my favourites. Just look up the website. So do not hesitate to stay here. It's well worth the trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468919660~“Excellent location”~I booked here as part of a conference - what a nice hotel. City Center has interesting shops and eateries within ten or fifteen minutes walking -fairly well lit, and I felt secure even as a solo female seeking dinner eell past 9. The big conference center isn't quite as close as expected but still, an easy walk even in heels. Apparently you can go indoors through the casino but that did not feel comfortable.  The rooms themselves were comfortable and well stocked, though I regrettably ate one of the pricey breakfast bars on a rushed mirning only to find it was stale. The staff were really friendly, and helpful with directions and transportation. I would be happy to stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468414801~“Great Hotel, Great Value”~My friend and I stayed for one night in March 2017. We were in room 312 which is a twin share at a cost of $210 (Australian dollars), which included breakfast for both of us. We found the room to be clean and comfortable. There was plenty of space to move around. Everything was clean and there were no obvious faults or repairs needed. Likewise, the bathroom was clean, tidy and in good repair. I particularly liked the large shelf which easily took all of our "girlie" things. The view from our window had treetops and the beginning of one of the parks so we found it very pleasant. We also found that the noise was minimal and we both had a very good night's sleep in very comfortable beds. We chose to dine in our room. We both had the tenderloin steak which was cooked to perfection and was very, very tasty indeed. The meal presented well and tasted just as delicious. The room service staff were friendly, helpful and our meal arrived on time. We had breakfast in the Redsalt restaurant the next morning. It was a standard buffet as is to be expected in Hotels everywhere, but the staff were helpful and efficient, the restaurant was clean and the tables were spaced apart so there was ease of movements. The Chef cooked us an omelette each and mine was very tasty. We did not need the car parking, nor did we use the other facilities of the Hotel. We arrived late afternoon and checked out the following morning but what we did see and use was of high quality and high standard.  We would be most happy to stay here again and would recommend this Hotel to all.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_467696794~“A great place to spend my reward points!”~I booked in & was upgraded. My room overlooked the parkland & being a quiet city one could easily imagine one is in the countryside. The bed was comfortable & the office space excellent. The bathroom was clean & well stocked, but looked a bit tired - time for a reno I think. I had 2 good light breakfasts, but the cooked brekky looked very inviting. I dined in my room on 2 nights & was not disappointed.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467180886~“Positives and Positives”~Hotel - Lounges, Flat screens, papers, restuarant and impressive view of the internal accessible balcony access to hotel rooms all combine for an inviting and impressive foyer. The corridors to the rooms are an open design looking over the large internal hotel reception, restaurant. Best design I have seen.  Hotel Room - Apart from the large room it's the little things that count. Hotel supplies shaver saved me a trip to the shops. Large, spacious and comfy bed. Bathroom a little dated but on par with other Canberra hotels. Gym - One of the most equipped gyms I have ever seen in a hotel! Well Done! Has it all including classes and free. Distance - only a five minute stroll to main restaurants and Shopping centre. Less to Myer, DJ's, theatre and mall. Plenty external coffee shops and cafes within less than a minute. Did not obtain parking price so will need to enquire.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467155416~“Great service ”~Well located hotel, clean room. Reception staff were a whole other level of wonderful. They went above and beyond.  Breakfast buffet was good, although crazy busy on a Sunday morning.  For the cost of the room it feels like free wifi should be included. Hotels internationally all offer free wifi. It's strange how limited it is in Aus.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467013323~“Best Location, but average otherwise !”~This hotel is in the best location. Close to Shops & Restaurants, just an easy flat walk. Service the hotel was good but not great. It does seem (at least to me) that there are some serious issues in the Crowne Hotel chain at the moment. The beds were comfy and the actual housekeeping was good. BUT, I really didn't like seeing piles of laundry in the corridors every day, very untidy and disorganised. I really cant say much for the food in the place either, Our rate actually included breakfast but upon checkout they still wanted to charge us for it :-( I also would NOT recommend breakfast, especially if you were expecting HOT food. Unfortunately the staff (& obviously management) do not know how to operate their equipment even their toasters were completely setup wrong, singeing is NOT cooking. Keeping food hot is helped if you actually turn the warmers on. Breakfast service was terrible, Dont order mushrooms unless you want them raw. Would I reccomend this place, Actually yes, but room only.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_466663033~“Mmmm, i suppose it was good.”~Used my points for a rewards night, it was okay.

review_465750135~“Good quality, location and price”~The Crowne Plaza is in a great location just a short walk from the Canberra centre shops, restaurants, etc. the hotel is modern, has very helpful staff, and the rooms are spacious enough for a few night stay. The bar and restaurant are both good and the gym while a bit dated has all the equipment you need.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465746174~“Great Location Great Service”~We stayed at Crowne Plaza Hotel, Canberra for almost 2 months and our experience was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone for following reasons: Great Location: Walking distance to Canberra center mall with all the cool shops and restaurants. Crowne casino just next door. Public transport just outside the door Next to very well maintained park In the heart of canberra Great Service: The staff is excellent and the room service is superb. Thats why SINGAPORE AIRLINES have contract with this hotel for their staff members. All SINGAPORE AIRLINES crew stay here for their stopover. Rooms are big and spacious with excellent WiFi connection. Smart TV's with almost all the channels available. The person who helped me the most is the manager of the hotel named Ninan Mathew. He supported us throughout our stay and even helped me with sorting out my rewards points issue two weeks after I left the hotel. I would recommend for you to ask for him and excellent service is almost guaranteed. Other staff members were also helpful and would go above and beyond to help you out. Can't say enough of the service....Great service! Facilities: Secured Carpark Excellent WiFi Services throughout the hotel Free fruits Excellent restaurant with some awesome menu Gym, Fitness club Kids Play area (If I remember correctly) Secured room pass (Can only access your level with your room pass using lifts) Peaceful ambiance Downside: Little bit on expensive side but with all the above mentioned perks - WORTH IT. Highly recommend to everyone.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_464605452~“Good location ”~Location is good, so close to the centre of Canberra. It's good for a business travel. The only drawback is the swimming pool is outside, everything else is good. Some of the rooms is park-view, which is wonderful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

My room was very clean and comfortable except for the bed which was a little too soft for my liking. The amenities are very good in the room and in the hotel in general. I think the only thing the room could be faulted on is the bathroom which compared to the rest of the room was a little tired. Overall I had a good stay and would recommend this hotel to anybody.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_462344087~“Inconsistent service”~We had decided to make the Crown Plaza our regular stay hotel, as we have been happy in the past. Unfortunately this visit was a let down.  Pro's. - The bar area has improved and the staff more professional. Our room was clean and I like the configuration. The hotels rooms, especially the bathroom are showing their age. But our biggest disappointment was breakfast both mornings. Sunday was the worst, we had to wait some time for a table and when one became available it was wiped down with dry napkins, so much for infection control ! Food stations were not refreshed, bread and butter plates were absent and used plates were left around the clean areas. Both mornings we had to request items. I look forward to making fresh juice, after placing the vegetables and fruit in the juicer, what came out was this thick sludge which was completely undrinkable. The staff were completely overwhelmed and could not provide a nominal service. I'm sure managers could work out that 9.30am on may be a busy time and roster accordingly. We heard other guests complain about the situation.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_461285816~“Stayed for a 20 day business trip and would come back for a weekend away”~This is the perfect hotel for exploring Canberra, as it is only a short walk to the central area full of shopping malls and cafes, it is also about a 15 walk to the War Museum and Anzac Avenue, as well as being adjacent to a nice park - perfect for a coffee.  The hotel itself has large rooms and a big gym to use with a swimming pool. The food is great, and I looked forward to smashing the breakfast buffet every day - and even had the room service a few times which I recommend the steak. Remember to also sign up to their loyalty program, as you can collect points really fast and score yourself some great deals.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_457999563~“Crown Plaza – Good Spot”~Stayed at the Crown Plaza in Canberra at a corporate rate of $180 a night. Just a few minutes’ walk to the city centre for shops, bars, restaurants etc. so a good location. Reception was smooth, parking also smooth but at $20 a night. Room was as expected, well appointed and a good size with a TV that I could work. Bathroom was also a good size but somewhat dated and with a shower in the bath tub – tricky if over 40. Had drinks in the in-house bar. Expensive as you would expect but very pleasant spot for an ale or two – quite enjoyed it.  Overall would I stay again – yep.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan

The hotel rooms are modern and comfortable and the staff excellent. I have stayed for both private and business visits and never disappointed. The lobby bar is a great meeting spot.

The rooms were nice and over looked the park. Staff were accommodating to have both of our rooms near each other. The let down were the bathrooms which were in a major need of renovation. The other was the pool. It didn't feel relaxing at all.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455071212~“Central Location in the CBD”~The hotel is very conveniently located in the Canberra CBD close to public transport and the main shopping precinct. One good feature is that the hotel is away from any busy thoroughfares and there is no traffic noise to speak of. The property itself needs to a facelift as the facilities are starting to look tired. The carpets look worn out and the front counter area appear to be a little dated. The area at the rear at the property where the restaurant is located had large weeds growing into the paving bricks which is a real shame as the area would be great for having a meal or refreshments during the summer the months. In this regard you will find the rooms clean and the hotel staff appear to take pride in the presentation of the rooms which are spacious. I also found the hotel staff attentive and very good customer service. One final point the air-conditioning is somewhat temperamental and the temperature has two settings - freezing cold or very warm. All in all however a satisfactory place to stay.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_453379468~“Comfortable place to stay”~After 13 days of cruising we returned to Sydney and rented a car from Auto Europe at the Pullman Hotel. Everything went smoothly with the car rental, so off to Canberra we go. We spent one night in the Crown Plaza Hotel. The bed was comfortable and the room was large enough. However, I think it is time we start complaining about having only one chair in a room. Don’t people travel in pairs? So why not put in two club chairs? Sorry but I am not comfortable sitting on the bed to watch TV. The hotel was not up to the standards of other Crown Plazas I have stayed in but suitable for one night. Paying a hotel to park your car makes me a bit unhappy why not just bury it in the room rate? Breakfast was good. Now were off to Melbourne.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_452912714~“Canberra NYR”~Conveniently situated with a short walk to bars and restaurants but also peaceful adjoining the park.

review_450906784~“'Two Beers in the Bar'”~Our recent visit to the Crowne Plaza leaves much to be desired! We visited Canberra to see the 'Versailles' exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia, but the Summernats event placed pressure on Canberra accommodation. We apparently had the last room available and it was very bad value for money. The room was small, but had a pleasant park view, and the bed was comfortable, but I was horrified in morning to discover the towel I had used after my shower had a brown stain. The housekeeping leaves much to be desired and the hotel in general is looking quite tired. The food also was a disappointment. The heavily advertised 'authentic Spanish Paella' was a very sorry disappointment and consisted of a few prawns floating in a rice sludge. In the morning, the breakfast was the same with food and utensils strained to the limit. But even worse, the floor was sticky and the walls dirty. We were there on a Thursday night and had trouble finding something to do in Canberra. The Concierge did his best to assist, but the best he could suggest was 'Two Beers in the Bar'!~2~1~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_450557413~“Good hotel in the central location”~We booked this hotel for an overnight stop on the way back to Sydney from Melbourne. The hotel is situated in the central location, just few minutes walk to Canberra main shopping centre with lots of shops and restaurants.  The room was large and the beds (we booked twin beds) were two queen size beds and very comfy.  Unfortunately, there are some small things that could be improved: 1. When we checked in our room, there was only 1 set of coffee cup and water glass. We have to ring the reception twice for it. 2. The bathroom is very dated and needs renovation. The basin tap was very loose and wall tiles got a bit of mold.  3. Buffet breakfast was not refilled promptly. We went down to the restaurant at about 9 am and more than half of the foods ran out and were not yet refilled, we have to ask the waiter for it and waited a little while. Also the coffee machine was broken.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_450301472~“Weekend Away”~Due to issues with Expedia not booking our hotel correctly, we were left late on Saturday afternoon with no accommodation in Canberra on the weekend of the Summernats event. Eventually we made our way to the Crowne Plaza where an extremely helpful receptionist was able to arrange a room for us. Despite being over our budget we decided that we would stay, the alternative being sleep in the car.  The check was efficient and hassle free and the room (upgrade provided) was what you would expect from the Crowne Plazza.  On our way out for dinner we noticed the restaurant in the hotel, Redsalt, was offering "authentic Spanish Paella" for $29, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss. All I can say is that maybe we should have missed it. Upon ordering the waitress informed us that several customers had commented how good the Paella was, so that was decided we would give it a go. What was served resembled something between a risotto and rice pudding and bore no resemblance to Paella as I recall having or cooking in the past.  To say that it was a disappointment is an understatement, especially as we had just arrived from Lakes Entrance where there was an abundance of fresh seafood. I could recommend the hotel for location, price and staff, but would suggest walking into town for dinner, there are plenty of options less than a 10 minute walk away.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449795468~“Excellent experience”~We stayed overnight at this hotel and were impressed by a number of things which made our stay enjoyable. Check in was quick and efficient and the staff friendly. I am an IHG member and was given free wifi access and late checkout. Our room was a park view double and although facing the car park entrance, it was quite sound proof except at night where we heard some loud drunks in the park. This was not the fault of the hotel of course. The beds were extremely comfortable as well. The hotel is very close to the restaurants in the area and good for business and family groups.  The room itself was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was a bit old but it was clean - which was more important to me rather than appearance. We ordered room service and it was surprisingly good value and very tasty. We did not try the restaurant as the room service was so good. Check out was again efficient and the front desk staff exceptional.  I will return to the Crowne plaza the next time I am in Canberra.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_449766798~“Nice suprise”~Nice clean rooms, recently refurbished, very polite staff, good location and an impressive breakfast buffet and good fitness centre. The only thing that I think that could improve is the lift to the parking area.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449741007~“Crowne Comfort”~A wonderful, comfortable stay! Although there are parts of this hotel and the design that could do with a modern refresh, the chain and management has done a great job at ensuring it does not impact your stay or drag the ambience down. The rooms are clean, extremely comfortable (including the Canberra necessity - a warm snuggly bed to sink into) and have all the things you would need for an enjoyable stay. I also loved being able to wake up to a view of the park.  It was a very nice surprise to find a welcome bottle of wine and chocolates in my room (even though it was my first stay) and the service was outstanding - check in and out were a breeze despite it being quite busy!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_449453258~“break”~We came for a break Crowne was fantastic from arriving to our room. We weren't happy with room as it had blinking lights no maintenance on duty so Shanny at reception upgraded us to another room great service. We ate at the restaurant food was great their coffee was superb. The only negative is pool area as the Crowne was booked at 80% their was only 6 lounge chairs around so many had to sit on concrete around pool as its peak summer and very hot you would think they would upgrade a little last time their was 10 years ago and nothing had changed around pool area.Hopefully our next trip their in summer it will be better .~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_449397526~“One night stay”~We stayed at the Crowne Plaza on our way through to Queensland. We had 2 queen beds (i think) in our room and the room was still spacious. We ordered room service and the food was great. Didnt have much interaction with staff but what I did have was friendly and courteous.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449384711~“Fabulous Location”~This hotel houses the local Casino, which seemed quiet most of the time. We stayed here for a conference as it is fabulous to walk through a direct walkway from the hotel to the conference centre. The location to shops and restaurants if fabulous, being a short 5-10 minute walk away. Rooms are a little tired and quite average in their layout. Reception were welcoming and friendly. Not a bad choice, especially on location.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_449056626~“Average hotel”~The location is great and so is the front desk service but so many things could be improved! We were here for 2 nights and we didn't get our room serviced. Ran out of milk, had to go to reception and ask for more. The bathroom is really old fashioned and needs some renovation. It's also really sad to see a homeless person sleeping outside your window in the park. I also used the health club facilities and some of the equipment is really old and rusty. The pool was quite dirty too.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_449021142~“Very tired hotel/poor service. ”~Having stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions in the past we had preconceived expectations. Unfortunately our expections were not met. The level of service at this hotel has dropped. When we checked in we had to have 3 attempts at getting a room key that worked. On one occasion we were escorted to our room by the concierge and let into the room using his room key, with the promise he would return with new room keys. He never returned.  The rooms were never serviced until late in the afternoon, after 5 pm. On one occasion the bathroom was not cleaned, bins were not emptied, carpet not vacuum, only the towels and sheets were changed. On another occasion the room was not cleaned until we complained, and then the staff grudgingly cleaned it complaining loudly that this was not her room. Another issue was personal hygiene of the staff cleaning the room, the body odour was so strong we had to flush the room afterwards to clear the odour. The restaurant, while charging $32/head for the breakfast buffet, could at least ensure they do not run out of food or plates, etc. We had to wait while plates and glasses were replenished on several occasions, as well as wait for food to be replenished. The juicer was broken. We attended the New Years Eve buffet dinner at $120/head. No atmosphere at all, no decorations, no background music and staff that we had to constantly ask to fill our glasses. When we commented on the lack of service, we were told, sorry the staff are not doing their job. While our room (331) was pleasant and comfortable, the bathroom needed maintenance, the sink leaked from the water hose, the toilet was constantly leaking from the cistern into the bowl, which meant it was constantly refilling. I think this is the last time we use this hotel. It was far below the standard expected, and considering we use IHG hotels in many countries in my opinion this hotel does not meet even a 3 star standard.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448742952~“Shame about the service”~Stayed at the Crown Plaza Canberra for four nights, during this time the room was only serviced once. Cleaners came round after 5 pm , had to ask for clean towels twice . Bathroom looked a little tired.,Location ideal for Canberra city centre . Rooms good size , shame about house keeping.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_448688973~“Very good stay”~Well priced and great location, good staff and very pleasant stay during festive season, Kids room is certainly a plus point for this hotel, Fruits and lemon water on arrival was also very refreshing,~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_448667787~“A Great Place to Stay :)”~We recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza. It was a lovely hotel, our room was neat and we had a beautiful view of the park. The beds were really comfortable. The foyer area is lovely as well, comfy couches to sit on. Breakfast was included in the price we paid, it was delicious and the omelettes we ordered we one of the best. The only thing they could work on is the pool, it needs a little attention. Possibly introduce a facility where we can order drinks to the pool. They do have the option of ordering food to the pool but no drinks. They were so friendly and gave us a super early check in of 9am and we checked out at 12pm as well. We would definitely stay here again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_448647444~“Adequate ”~This hotel is not a 4 star as it is inconsistent. We stayed for 1 night and went out of Canberra for 1 night and then returned for 2 nights. The cleanliness of the room was not very good and the bathroom amenities were not fully stocked. The buffet breakfast is poor and at 9am most of the food was almost empty. I had to wait 45mins for an omelette to be cooked as the restaurant is understaffed. The positives of the hotel is that The staff are friendly and the location is central so we walked to the War Memorial and into town and around Lake Burley Griffith. Do not expect too much at this hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448317754~“Room was good but service not what you expect from Crowne”~Firstly our room was very clean, and hotel in general was clean except main foyer there was a broken Christmas ornament broken on a counter ornament was taken but no one bother to wipe up all the pieces left that looked like glass. Pool size for such a big hotel is not very big luckly it was overcast and raining but i can imagine on a hot day that pool area gets quite full with i think only has 6 lay down chairs for a hotel with 6 levels??? We had trouble with our keys had to go reception 3 times finally someone came up. Called reception twice for a rollaway bed, asked for the room to be turned down nothing was actually done all they did was give me 3 bath mats why do i need 3 bath mats???? And hand full of amenities??? But all just thrown onto the counter where the coffee machine was. Restaurant downstairs was good for breakfast but the do need more chef's on egg station as there's long wait 1 chef cant do it all! Besides the location and my room being very clean there's not much else.  I would think already paying for accommodation you shouldn't have to pay for parking $20 a day? And there was a sign saying parking full please see valet but when i got my car there was plenty of spots and people leaving not sure if you do this so people pay more for valet parking??  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447687896~“Clean, friendly yet clinical”~Easy to find, friendly & pleasant interactions with staff. Room was good size with a great park view but aircon didn't seem to function properly. We went to the after Christmas sales & after leaving the room & leaving the card in the slot to keep things running the room was still warm & stuffy. Concierge came up & reset it. It worked better but not excellent considering it was 32 degrees outside. Didn't try the restaurants or room service so can't comment. Parking ample though that's extra. So for this stay it was just a comfy room with view. Only stayed overnight as on a 'road trip'~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447686886~“Good food, service needs a polish.”~Dined with my husband for a date night. We ate the shared lamb - it was gorgeous. But what threw me was a sort of very casual, unprofessional and b-grade service vibe that simply didn't match the whole Plaza feel. I can't specify anything, but the polish just wasn't there as I would expect with these prices ... might be time to give the wait staff some fine dining training !~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447592641~“It is good but should be a little bit better.”~We stayed here for one night and used points to book 4 rooms in this hotel. The hotel is OK and you have to pay for parking with a little bit tricky to get in and out. Since we made reservation under 2 names and both are Platinum members so we checked in 2 staff at the front desk. The one I had she is not friendly at all and when I mentioned I am Platinum member she seems not happy about it !!! My friend had the other guy seems very helpful and friendly. We asked for compliment and got only 1 free drink. Later, I told a different front desk since we have 4 rooms, he gave me another coupon and another one for my friend. The rooms are fine with 2 queen beds but maximum only for 3 person. The bathroom looks old and small. There were no free coffee in the room. The odd is if you pay by credit card you have to pay extra fees even you use IHG credit card. There are many nice restaurant and a shopping nearby the hotel with walking distance.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_447414715~“Never again”~I booked the Crowne Plaza for a one night stay with my two children as we were visiting both the Versailles and 100 Objects exhibitions (both of which are excellent). We didn't end up staying. I want to say that our family has travelled extensively in Australia and overseas and have generally received good service wherever we have gone. Never have we had an experience like we did yesterday at the Crowne Plaza in Canberra. Upon arrival at 2.15pm we were told our room wasn't ready and would be around 30 mins. This wasn't great, as I had advised our arrival time of between 2-3pm when I booked but we made the best of it and had some lunch while we waited and were offered some free drinks. When finished we went to see if our room was ready, but it wasn't. The staff were apologetic and offered no charge for lunch. We waited some more and went to ask again and it still wasn't ready. By this stage I was annoyed as we were only in Canberra overnight and if we had been told on arrival it was going to be so long would have gone to see some of the sights rather than waiting in the hotel lobby. At around 4.15pm with no update or any indication of when the room would be ready I asked again only to be told that it would be another 20-30 mins. I then decided that we had waited long enough and organised alternative accomodation. I went up to the counter and explained that I had called a rival hotel who were more than willing to accomodate us immediately. Surprisingly, I was asked to wait to speak to the manager, was told our room would be free and was available immediately. Needless to say, by this stage, I couldn't care less what the hotel was offering and after confirming nothing was needed from us went to the second hotel where we were checked in and were in our room in 15 mins. Not sure what was happening on this day which led to this disaster but I do know we weren't the only ones kept waiting. This is not ok when people are on a short visit to a destination and it's not ok to keep a parent and two kids waiting this long in a hotel lobby. There are plenty of other places to stay for the price that this hotel charges and we won't be back.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_447223110~“Canberra weekend”~Selected the Crowne Plaza for a weekend in Canberra. Have stayed there previously and was not disappointed. Rooms were upgraded.

review_442269113~“Business hotel”~First time visiting Canberra and it was nothing much to say about it.  Staying in this hotel for a couple of days. The hotel has a casino next door. It was a modern and minimalist hotel. The service was straightforward. Be prepared to ask the receptionist for toothbrush and paste, disposable shaver and other amenities as these are not provided in the room. Be prepared for travelers from Indonesia and European countries to bring an electrical plug adapter as all the hotel has not yet modified their electrical plug with the international one, which is quite unfortunate for a four star hotel in a capital city frequently welcoming international visitors.  The room was clean. The internet was very good. The breakfast offered various continental and healthy menus. The hot water for showering had good pressure. The bed was nice and comfortable. Overall nice stay, except for the electricity plug.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_441891483~“Average and tired”~I stayed at the Crowne for a week at the end of November 2016 whilst in Canberra for business . Now I must confess that I had intended to stay elsewhere in an apartment. However on arrival in Canberra I was informed a plumbing issue meant I had been checked into the Crowne as a replacement .  I stayed in room 207. Clean, tidy and equipped with a large bed, flat screen tv, lounge and a business desk and chair. Wifi available, bar fridge, safe, iron and iron board. (Hairdryer as well but not useful to me ). Bathroom was clean enough, but shower in a bath, really, in this day and age of health and safety? I can manage but I would think a challenge for elderly or less able folk and perhaps the young. Reasonable fitness centre and pool. I suggest avoiding breakfast, save your money and go to a close cafe for breakfast, plenty nearby that do a better cheaper job. Bar at the hotel is fine, dose a good happy hour during the week. I found the room to be noisy (air conditioner) and the bed uncomfortable ( seemed well used on one half). Staff friendly. Overall tired and in need of a face lift.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441821973~“Good 4 Star accomodation”~Stayed overnight in Canberra at this Hotel. They helped with early check-in and were very accommodating to our small group of four. We had 3 connecting rooms which were clean and comfortable. The rooms and the public areas are a bit tired and will keep the hotel in 3.5 - 4 star rating. Staff are pleasant and helpful. Location is excellent~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_441701599~“Burgerless burgers”~I would not recommend the burger from room service from Crown plaza Canberra as it doesn't don't actually include a burger. Stodgy roll, lettuce and mayonnaise only. Astonishing. First time for everything.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441650461~“Lacking hospitality”~Booked this place as conference accommodation when my regular (East) was full. The price was eye watering($500+ per night) . I've been in Canberra more than ten times this year, staying at East mainly. Unlike every other hotel I have stayed at in Australia over the last few years, the CP provides no toaster etc to prepare your own simple breakfast in your room. The receptionist mumbled that a toaster was a fire hazard - not sure how all those other places manage, but they do. The room was ok, a bit shabby in places esp. the bathroom which looks very tired, with a cheap shower curtain, stained and mouldy silicone and chipped tiles. The toiletries are cheap, the blow dryer ditto, and worn. The fridge is big enough only for their mini bar offering, no room for anything of your own, unless you unload the thing; a poor quality small plastic kettle, and not even a plain, complementary bikkie to have with a cup of tea as is the practice most other places - just a giant cookie as part of the mini bar. Service so so, with calls to housekeeping going unanswered, no hotel or Canberra info, or any info at all, in the room, including info on in room dining and hotel facilities.  The location is ok during the day, close to main shopping mall and a lovely park. However after hours, the pedestrian mall is a bit lonely and there are people around who make you feel a bit uncomfortable. It is very convenient to the Convention Centre. There's good eating in nearby Braddon and Civic. It makes an interesting comparison to East, which is less than half the price, is new ( bathrooms, lobby, furniture etc), has engaged and warm staff, a larger basic room, a variety of restaurants and pubs and Coles a pleasant walk away, and provides toaster, microwave, quality accoutrements and toiletries, decent size fridge in even their basic hotel room. The sleep quality is very good at CP and the view from the sixth floor was good. It was very poor value, and even at a cheaper rate, is lacking in so many ways, I would not return.~2~1~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_440973327~“Great central spot - very good service.”~We had a 4 night stay at the Crown Plaza - our first visit to Canberra. The hotel is well located on the restaurant / shopping side of th river. The governent buildings and places of historical interest are on the other side -- about a half hour walk. The room was very clean and comfortable. The air con system was one of the best I've used. Door were quiet - a very peaceful stay. Service was excellent - anything we asked for was delivered in record time! Would definitely recommend and stay again!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
