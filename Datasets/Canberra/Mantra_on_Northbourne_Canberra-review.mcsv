review_478363197~“Short stay”~Very friendly and helpful staff. Room nicely laid out and clean but could use a safe. The bathroom design needs more thought, particularly with the positioning of the toilet up against the shower glass and wall. Good to have space in the fridge, as most hotels overstock with mini bar, this had room for our own supplies. An easy walk to The City Walk and buses. Good food at the restaurant with friendly service and reasonably priced. ~4~4~4~4~3~4~5~nan
review_478356622~“Disappointed”~Expected alot more than this for a 4 star rated property, room standard just a 3. Main reason we stayed there was for the 4 star rating and the indoor heated pool. We have 2 children who wete looking forward to this, when we went to pool it was not heated thus kids unable to swim. Overall very disappointed with this place and would not stay here again.~3~2~4~3~2~3~4~nan
review_478346028~“Great rooms, great location”~The Mantra was a surprisingly pleasant place to stay at a very reasonable price and right in the centre of the city. We were walking distance to all pubs and restaurants, and not to mention the mall as well. We were surprised to get two rooms in one, as we were there with 5 people. Both rooms were very well equipped and clean and tidy, and had everything we needed for our short stay. nothing negative to say about our experience. The staff even pointed us towards a free parking area for overnight when we couldn't afford to pay for parking for too long. We ended up parking in the $12 hotel parking lot anyway, however it was just very nice to see that the staff were considerate enough to let us know of the free areas. We loved being so close to town, especially since we were all having a coup of drinks. an excellent location for stays like this, just make sure you keep your prices as affordable as they are and you will do very well!! We didn't try your restaurant, however, your menu was very appealing! we will have to come back another time and try your lovely food. Thank you for having us.~5~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_478332736~“Canberra Stay”~The room and staff were fantastic. The unfortunate fire alarm being set off by a patron impacted on our sleep. The restaurant provided a wonderful meal which was still available to us after 8:30pm. Staff in the restaurant were also very good. Parking was plentiful and easy to access in our Isuzu MU-X.~4~5~5~3~5~5~4~nan
review_478131941~“Review of stay in april”~Very unhappy with the fire alarms and lack of communication. Kept our babies up most of the night and no communication around what was happening. View we paid for was horrible and very unhappy to have to pay for the parking.~2~2~4~1~3~3~3~nan
review_478085956~“Good central location”~Good location, handy to central Canberra, and an easy 30 min walk to the Austn War Memorial. Our room facing Northbourne Ave a bit noisy at times, but can live with for a short stay. Rooms clean and easy, our 1 bedroom apartment good size, and convenient for us.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_477926423~“A prefect set-up for families”~The one bedroom apartment was perfect for our family, with lots of room for our toddler to move about. The hotel had no problem providing a cot (though slightly thin and wonky, but we fixed it up with some pillows off the bed, and did report it at the end of our stay). Also, the underground parking at $12 a day was perfect. The self-catering kitchenette doesn't really need to be stocked with such a lot of mini-bar items, as I had to spend the first five minutes putting everything high up on a top shelf out of little hands reach.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477825769~“Great Location and superb property”~I stayed at Mantra on Northbourne for two nights and was delighted to get an upgrade to one of their one-bedroom apartments. The layout or design of these rooms are quite amazing and gives you a lot of space and light in the room. You don't feel restricted and are able to carry out your routine tasks the same way as you would at your own place. It was a great value for money deal for me.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_477590571~“Very central”~Location is good. Self catering too for those quick breakfast. Kitchen had all all the key stuffs you need. Had a dishwasher and washing machine and dryer which came handy with kids accidents. Also had supply of soaps for the machines.~4~3~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_477588963~“Great location with reasonable rates.”~The staff were very friendly and helpful, bed was fabulous and room size good. Check in procedure was very messy with cars blocking the carpark entrance, but it was the Easter weekend so maybe that is not generally a problem. The pool and sauna areas were disappointing; very small and pokey with access by dingy stairwells, it didn't spoil our stay as we didn't use them but if a pool is a priority then this was not the best one.~3~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477560196~“Mantra at Northbourne”~Great location. Great size rooms. Our room was quite noisy on a Saturday night (4th floor) as street noise was quite audible. Some pretty dirty blankets were provided with fold out bed, other than that the room was clean and well maintained.~4~4~5~4~4~3~5~nan
review_476989791~“Perfect spot, perfect location, best staff!”~We stayed in Mantra during our wedding week in Canberra. Front desk staff are amazing and will do anything to help me during my stay. Not only super friendly and helpful, their customer service skills are above and beyond my expectation. Special thank you to Elyse Heslehurst the Area Conference Coordinator for all her help from making our hotel bookings so easy and willing to help me with all my questions as I m not very familiar with Canberra. Highly recommended and definitely will stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476958460~“Great location and friendly staff”~very close to central canberra but parking can be problematic as either street parking or underground parking, both of which must be paid for. rooms comfortable but bring your own pillow. i would definately recommend this hotel to others~4~4~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_476729590~“Great location, friendly staff - adequate room”~Thank you to all your lovely staff who were so friendly and responsive to our queries and requests. We also found the location to be excellent, close to the Lonsdale St cafes and the Canberra Centre. Our room was clean and plain, equipped with what we needed, but nothing luxurious. It was on the small side, and the beds were very hard and uncomfortable. We requested extra doonas to place under the fitted sheets to make them a bit softer.~3~3~4~2~3~4~4~nan
review_476711372~“Not great for the price”~This was recommended as a family hotel. Other than having ample space, I'm not quite sure why. The furniture is grimy, like a dorm room. I didn't want to sit on the couch with my bare skin. Pregnant, I could hardly get in and out of the sofa, I was sinking to the floor. Our cleaning service was average - half the dishes not washed, trash missed, milk not replaced from mini bar. Out of date, and out of touch costs-wise. Admittedly we were there over Easter, I'm sure the price reflects that, but for $300+ night it's definitely not worth it. We stayed at the East hotel a month ago, and I'd much rather recommend that establishment, particularly for the fee. I rarely respond to feedback forms, but this had to be said.~2~1~4~3~2~2~3~nan
review_476669457~“Canberra at Easter”~Brilliant location for central Canberra with spacious rooms. All you need for a great stay in a modern hotel.

review_476604220~“Weekend away”~Good quality service . Team, specially sophie at the reception very smiley and helpful. Shower need little bit a refreshment,otherwise room is big enough.

review_476359660~“Lovely Easter”~We stayed one night at this hotel and overall I can recommend it . We enjoyed the room ( a bit dated but still lovely and clean), pool/sauna and the breakfast. Setbacks were a bit uncomfortable sofa bed which is fine for children and a delay in refreshing the breakfast self service table ( too many people came for breakfast at the time ) .I will stay there again. very polite and friendly staff .Thank you Mantra on Northbourne~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_476267247~“Old room, bad dreams”~We stayed for 2 nights but didn't enjoy our stay at all. The room is a bit old - kitchen, TV station and bathroom were classic. The room has no view but next building which blocks out the light. The bed was comfortable though both me and my husband had bad dreams both nights. The energy just felt a bit off.~2~1~4~1~1~3~4~nan
review_476228193~“Too expensive for such a room”~Don't mind paying more for comfortable room. Extra bed made up in living room not good. Head side too low. You feel dizzy when you sleep. As regular customer, this is the worst Mantra I ever seen. My colleague not happy. I feel ashame for offering Mantra.~1~1~4~1~1~4~4~nan
review_475997918~“Easter Break”~The room was spacious and bed comfortable. Huge bathroom that nees an uograde as the fan did not work. Only one chair in the room which is annoying for two people eg sitting at the desk which is large enough to facilitate two laptops. Lighting very dim and a bit depressing. On the positive side, frienfly staff snd ideal location.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_475954268~“very disappointed”~breakfast was a waste of time and money, the breakfast food offering was scraps at best day 2 breakfast was effectively a $26 cup of rotten peculated coffee (not even espresso) way to spoil the whole stay room (1 bed apartment) was large but dated~3~3~4~4~3~3~3~nan
review_475694630~“Friendly staff and good location”~Overall a nice hotel good location and the reception staff always helpful. The city maps handed out at reception are ok but not very professional a bit cheap. Only other negative was that the bed in room 719 is not comfortable it feels like the mattress requires to be replaced.~4~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_475519363~“A pleasant stay”~A good comfortable place to stay; conveniently located the CBD and all the facilities we desired. Staff were friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast was acceptable/good (warm plates for warm food would be a significant improvement) a wider selection of fruit would be desirable (and for me fresh banana would be very desirable!). Better range of plain food options on dinner menu desirable.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475424062~“Mantra Northbourne”~Pleasant, tidy facilities well local located with excellent staff. Couldn't be more helpful with directions, knowledge, and general care and attention. Really good shopping and great cafes and restaurants in easy walking distance. Easy access to all the important sites of Canberra with good public transport at the front door. Would recommend every time!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475398695~“Great location, Quality accomodation”~I had a surprise trip to Canberra at very short notice. The Mantra were able to fit me in at very short notice (a few hours) and provide me with a quality room at a good price. The location is just about perfect with only short walks to the places I needed to go~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475115550~“Hire a cleaner”~This hotel is in desperate need of a decent clean. Checked out after 1 night as the room was mouldy and filthy. The cushions on the bed were badly stained, and the oven ehhh...and the hairdryer was faulty. Not the best Canberra has to offer.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474856766~“Spacious, comfortable, great location”~A comfortable and very spacious 1br apartment at a reasonable rate, an easy 10 minutes walk from Canberra Theatre and the rest of Canberra city. The rooms are beginning to look a little dated (especially the bathroom), but extremely clean and well-maintained. Front desk staff are exceptional - efficient, friendly, welcoming. Bed was comfortable without being exceptional. Very little traffic noise on level 8. Parking reasonable at $12 per night - plenty of spaces and pretty good access (some spaces tight, but lots to choose from were wider).~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_474850297~“Over night stay”~Very helpful with check in, room was good for mum and me. Restaurant wasn't open on Sunday, lucky already had plans to go. We went to marble and grain next door. Breakfast at the hotel was so yummy :)~4~4~5~3~3~4~4~nan

review_474808776~“Comfortable stay”~Stayed here on the 7th of April room quite dood slept comfortably, as a previous reviewer noted the car park is tight and needs car to use. We came down to breakfast around 9 and some breakfast items needed refilling, that took some time so breakfast was not as good as expected. Would stay here again~4~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_474803864~“Average”~This hotel needs to attend to their maintenance program more regularly. While the location was good, the room had items that were not working. Mattress cover poor, plastic tub chairs around table were appalling!~3~3~4~2~3~3~3~nan
review_474562669~“Excellent because of the staff & location - infinitely superior to many competitors.””~Staff that we had dealings with were excellent -up there with the best in the country. Whoever chooses & trains them should be congratulated. Restaurant, car parking & cleanliness were well above average for this price point. Rooms are showing their age & renovations done are of good quality but more needs to be attended to in regards to quality of repairs.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_473944070~“SOKAY ”~Took the secret deal on Last Minute as all the reasonably priced rooms in our locale were booked.. So paid $210 a night plus $12 a day parking for 4 1/2 stars.. Not cheap. Felt like I was staying in 3 star cabin.. At least didn't have to pay for the balcony.. The room was adjoining a separate lounge/ kitchen with cooking facilities and dishwasher. Great, I go away so that I don't have to do dishes.. or cook.. the out dated bathroom, complete with shower over the bath and a screen not long enough to stop the water going everywhere.. yuck.. washing machine and dryer complete the romantic feel and only face washer between two.. fabulous weekend.. Not and BTW don't order the $14 cannoli.. matched the bathroom! Service, check out and ambiance downstairs fine. However burger bar underneath our room on 7 th floor full of noisy drunks until after 1 am..~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472521702~“Canberra convenience”~My room was a 2 room apartment that I scored thru a special deal. I most definitely got value for money. The hotel is conveniently located a short walk up from Civic, as well as the few eateries in Braddon. If you wanted to, you could have walked to Dickson about 2 km away. Once the tram is completed, this will be a viable option for more choice in places to eat. My few complaints are words of caution more than anything. I came by plane, and unfortunately there is no shuttle bus. Taxis are readily available but it will cost you around the $35-40 mark. I knew I was getting a special deal, but no where on the web page did it tell me about breakfast included or excluded in the price. Because of the vagarity, I brought my own, which was just as well, because the expensive breakfast was not included. I have read other reviews and a: parking isn't free (which is rude); and b: wifi is also a cost - which I find bizarre in this current century: and disappointing. Which is a shame because the counter staff could not have been more helpful and a true asset to the hotel; and the room was spotless and well serviced each day. Mantra please pick up your game regarding your webpage, because you are letting your high quality staff down. Having said all this: yes, I would consider returning to the hotel for its convenience to downtown, the university (15 min walk) and CSIRO (30 min walk).~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472312269~“Loud music”~Nice modern room, very clean and good location. There was a loud party across the road started at 12 and went till at least 2am. Car park a bit tight to get in and out of. Overall nice hotel but loud on Friday night.~4~4~4~1~4~5~4~nan

review_472216140~“Good place to base yourself for. Weekend in Canberra”~comfortable 1 bedroom apartment. Ours was on the side so less traffic noise but overelooked by building next door so wouldn't use the good sized balcony! Staff helpful - Booking.com had messed up the booking and initially we were given a room instead of apartment, but staff were able to change us. Nice and helpful reception staff. Apartment very clean. had to ask for milk though, to make tea.~4~5~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_472006520~“"Hot" breakfast food was cold and rooms were stuffy”~While the staff were great, I found that the "hot" breakfast food items were served up cold or only slightly warm in the buffet. The mushrooms were very cold. I found the room to be very stuffy with poor air circulation, which meant that I was not able to get a good night sleep for the 5 nights that I was there.~3~4~4~2~3~4~4~nan
review_471812321~“Great position”~Excellent position close to the CBD and public transport. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room was clean, roomy and our bed very comfortable.

review_471313310~“A Comfortable Spot in the Heart of Canberra”~My partner and I stayed at Mantra for two nights in late March 2017 and found the one bedroom apartment very clean and comfortable.

We will be staying here again as it suited all our needs.~4~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_471281400~“Well looked after”~We had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this motel. On our second night we couldn't turn off the shower tap which created a very bad dripping noise. We mentioned this to the service desk staff the following morning. They were unable to fix the tap on that day, so we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment which was very nice and unexpected. Good service. Thanks~4~3~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470795525~“Overpriced 1980 style with good location”~This is a 1980 style hotel appartment which is overpriced . The wifi is not included with a high price bracket. You are not guaranteed a car park as a hotel guest. Car park costs $12/night. The Room as a old dingy bathtub converted to shower. The utensils provided are filthy. The tea/coffee provided is cheap with no quality. The couches were smelly and not been cleaned for ages.~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_470737031~“Clean rooms in a great location”~Our stay was very pleasant with courteous staff and clean rooms. The location is fantastic, you're right in the middle of town but far enough away that the creatures of the night won't bother you. A little on the expensive side for what you actually get but overall I can recommend this hotel to anyone putting that little bit extra value on convenience over quantity.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_470723834~“Friendly staff, great room”~I always receive a warm welcome at the Mantra on Northbourne and the staff are very polite and attentive. A great place to stay, and could not be any closer to the city with a short walk to shops, restaurants, gyms and entertainment. ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_470233528~“4 Star Hotel - not sure how”~In summary, by category Booking: Smooth, easy, helpful. they said my 1BR apartment room would be serviced DAILY. The staff on site said, and did, otherwise. Check in / Check out: Relatively smooth Settling In: Wifi did not work. There were 3 of us in reception with our laptops, with connection problems. Dear Mantra Management, train your staff or get it right. Restaurant: Good for dinner. Breakfast - well when the menu says say mushrooms and hash browns; and they are NOT provided; I wonder whether the Mantra really care what they tell guests. Facilities: Wifi: cut out 4 times when I was there over 6 days and had to be reset I gave up in the end. Swimming Pool and Gym are good but you must use stairs. Bathroom: dated, washing machine on blocks and my main concern was there was NO anti slip mat in the bath/shower. Dear Mantra Management - you risk a breach of WH&S with these sub-standard, UNSAFE, shower/bath combos.  Room Service: Got my order wrong several times; then my dinner went cold. Any requests to cleaning staff I don't think was understood because they didn't seem conversant in English. Customer Service: It seems the front end staff try; but my guess is procedures, processes, systems and training are more of a hindrance than a help. As a guest, I shouldn't have noticed this, should I? Recommendation: There are plenty of other places in the SAME suburb that do better on almost every category at FAR LESS the price.  I would guess the Avenue would be a better choice; I certainly KNOW the Canberra Furnished Apartments are. Yes, they are in the same suburb - less than 100 yards away. Dear Mantra Management: please get your act together because for over $300 per night; I won't be sending my staff there.~2~1~nan~2~nan~nan~2~nan

It was Canberra Day, so the restaurant wasn't open, but the staff provided some nearby alternatives, and a map.~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_468650455~“Weekend to visit the Versailles Exhibition”~Very convenient to city centre. Helpful, friendly & knowledgeable reception staff about local events & restaurants. Were upgraded to one bedroom apartment which was very spacious & clean, bed comfortable. Buffet breakfast was delicious. Would definitely stay again & would recommend to family & friends.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468402634~“Short stay at the Mantra”~In Canberra for 3 nights - chose Mantra as in walking distance to shops and restaurants, Breakfast was ok but not outstanding. Hot food was mainly warm - cereal etc was as expected. We had dinner in the stock restaurant one night and it good value. The room was spacious and comfy, but the wall between the end room and ours were paper thin - we could everything that was said and when they used the shower it was like being under a waterfall - it was so loud especially at 1 am. Parking underneath was good value. Overall we had a pleasant stay.~3~3~4~3~5~5~5~nan
review_468213305~“Enjoyed our stay”~Everything was most satisfactory. Would happily stay here again Room was clean and tidy, bed OK, shower good, nice and quiet. It was Canberra Day,so restaurant was not operating but plenty of alternatives within easy walking distance~4~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_468173149~“Weekend Catchup”~Staff were very friendly and helpful, hotel is very convenient to restaurants and shopping, off street parking was a little squishy but great to have access to. Bathroom bench was a little narrow. But a very enjoyable stay overall~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_468166267~“Canberra catchup”~Very pleasant stay. Great location as we wanted to walk to restaurants. Don't like the extra car parking charge. Apart from that all our requirements were met. Apartment was an unusual setup but in the end worked very well.~4~4~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_467966547~“Pretty nice place to stay ”~I was here on a business trip and found the staff friendly and accommodating and the rooms tidy and nicely furnished. We had a conference in the rooms downstairs and found it to be roomy enough for the 60 odd people we had there and the presentation facilities were good. The only issue I had was the amount of food they supplied for conferences. All three meals (morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea) were not nearly enough for the number of people, and food quickly ran out with people still hungry. That could be significantly improved but everything else was good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467961967~“Room was OK, Hotel restuarant was below average”~Room was clean and acceptable. The restaurant service was slow and the food was not consistent. It took about 15 mins before we could place our order, then another 30 mins before our food arrived. We ordered a main lamb neck and it was very small, like an appetizer. So we ordered a second main, a stock burger. However it was not the same as the stock burger another person on the table ordered. It was served with a charcoal bun instead of the brioche bun~3~3~3~4~3~3~2~nan
review_467927448~“Family stay”~Very pleasant stay, good location. Staff helpful. Location is close to cafes and restaurants.  Car parking was tight and probably needs a bit better management of free space.  Didn't eat at the restaurant but room service was good and prompt.~4~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_467713955~“Mantra on Norhbourne”~Stayed for 3 nights in one bedroom overlooking rear of the apartments. Very convenient and friendly staff. Didn't use the gym but did have a look in and seemed to have good equipment. Pool was too full of kids. Only issue was noisy and not very effective air conditioner in the bedroom.~4~5~5~3~4~4~5~nan
review_467083892~“Let down by food”~The room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The staff friendly and helpful. The food had much to be desired and this included room service and the breakfast buffet. This is not suited to short business trips where there is no time to dine out.~3~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467055581~“Mantra”~I stay at Mantra when i travel. The staff and rooms were good. The only thing you need to change is the top of the ironing board. Great iron dirty old cover for ironing board in room 101. This needs to be changed.~4~4~4~3~3~4~3~nan
review_467035494~“Spacious Rooms for the family”~We stayed for two nights in a 1 BR apartment and it was great. We had lots of room and the facilities were great. It's in a convenient location and has parking on site. The continental breakfast was nice (but over priced). I'd recommend it to families and we'll be back for sure.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_467034650~“Mantra Canberra”~Good location and close to City Centre. In House dining was great and reasonable cost. Staff were very helpful and even provided a Razor as I left mine at home. Rooms a little dated but very clean and comfortable. Onsite parking for a reasonable cost was a bonus.~4~4~5~4~3~4~4~nan
review_466697391~“Happy birthday suprise”~It was lovely to have an upgrade to a suite will definitely be back the service in the restaurant could have been better we ended up leaving after 15 minutes as no one had been to our table even though there was only one other couple there the rest of the staff were excellent~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466687975~“very comfortable central location- good value except for payment for wifi access. @”~This was a great stay. The detriment was the payment for wi-fi access. Such a charge was extraordinary in this day and age when all around the world wifi acess is part of the service expected and desired of hotel/motel and airbnb accommodation. Australia.Grow up!~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466685155~“excellent hotel”~upon arrival we had a mix up with our room , we called reception and we immediately upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite on the top floor nothing was too much trouble . Our room had a full kitchen and a washer and dryer . We had breakfast at the restaurant which was also great we really enjoyed our breakfast.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466657655~“Ticked all the boxes”~We were in Canberra for a wedding & were looking for somewhere that was close to the church & reception. The hotel ticked all the boxes. It took minutes to walk to the city centre for shopping & dining.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466651219~“Dodgy pool and breakfast”~Rooms were spacious which was great for families but nothing else was family friendly. Paying $40 a head on top of the room price for my 5 and 7 year old was rediculoys. Then charging $15 for them for breakfast as well. Really disappointed.~2~2~5~2~4~4~5~nan
review_466623078~“Versaille Package weekend”~We really enjoyed our stay at the Mantra on Northbourne. Our room was great & the hotel staff, especially at reception, were very helpful. Our breakfast was included but we found the lack of fresh fruit disappointing. Overall a delightful stay & will definitely be back.~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_466620903~“Short walk to everything”~Neat and tidy. Buffet breakfast right downstairs. Pool and gym onsite but awkward to access. Staff very friendly and obliging. Short walk to city shops, cafes and restaurants. Bus stop out the front. Good!~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_466400914~“Mantra on Northbourne -WOW!”~Apart from the reasonable cost, my family found all the staff friendly, courteous, considerate and very helpful. The rooms were spacious and the beds sooo comfortable. I have happily placed Mantra at the top of my holiday accommodation list.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466185566~“Reasonable location but otherwise not up to standard”~This place is only a short walk into the centre of town (10 mins) and is located in a street close to several restaurants and bars. The rooms are reasonably large and come with a small kitchen. Those are the plus points. On the downside, the rooms are quite old and tired with several niggly maintenance issues. The soundproofing could be better. There is a small TV in the lounge room but nothing in the bedroom, so you can't watch TV in bed. Overall it was not up to standard for the price point and I can certainly say that I have stayed in much better hotels in Canberra than this one.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_466181767~“Credit card costs and shampoo supplier”~To take a fee for using a credit card is annoying traveller from Europe. A small matter but annoying as well. Elder people need glasses when opening the shampoo tube because of that silver paper on the tube. Change your supplier of shampoo.~4~5~5~3~5~5~4~nan
review_466142182~“Sporting weekend in Canberra”~First time at Mantra on Northbourne but have stayed at other Mantra properties interstate.  If you want reliability that you'll enjoy your stay, stay at Mantra.  Breakfast was a little disappointing and overpriced.~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466011444~“Good Hotel conveniently placed”~The hotel is well placed in the main street of the Capital. Its pricing is reasonable, it has a good eatery on the premises (nice dinners and breakfasts available). Parking is available under the building, but is limited, first-come basis (extra cost). Our room was particularly large, but that may not be the norm (???)- and it had all the facilities we could reasonably require.~4~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_465954139~“First time customer”~Great room- clean and spacious. Breakfast Buffet offered many and varied choices. Delicious food and the same with room service. Staff were professional and friendly and the location was very central.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465934443~“car parking”~I Would have appreciated complimentary car parking rather than additional cost. The under padded doorstop in the bathroom preventing the door from banging into the laundry tub managed to stub both our toes. In my case it ripped half my toenail off making walking uncomfortable for the rest of our trip. Apart from this, great location, great room, awesome views.~4~3~4~4~5~5~5~nan
