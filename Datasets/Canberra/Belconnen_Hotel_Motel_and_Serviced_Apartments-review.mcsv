review_470026191~“An excellent place to stay! Close to central Belconnen.”~Belconnen Way Hotel Motel provided an outstanding stay for the three days we visited Canberra. We stayed in the 'small two bedroom unit' at a cost of $155/day. The facilities were excellent! The kitchen was small but had a sink fridge and microwave. The cupboards were stocked with crockery, saucepans and a frypan and portable cooktop allowing those wishing to prepare meals in the unit to do so. The beds were extremely comfortable and both rooms were spacious and uncluttered. The entire motel was well maintained and clean. Office staff were very polite and attentive. Parking appeared to be hard to find - until we discovered a basement parking area with plenty of space! The only real issue I had was wifi access. Despite saying it was available in the hall and office area I did not get any signal in the hall (who wants to sit there anyway?) and I wasn't inclined to go downstairs...~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461048047~“Clean, comfortable and friendly staff”~Stayed at this motel for 2 nights in a small 2 bedroom unit, on arrival the staff on reception were extremely friendly and advised of all the shops and services within the area. Room was clean and spacious with a kitchenette. Bathroom was small but clean and great water pressure. The rooms were really quiet and comfortable besides a couple of drunk people arriving back in the early hours of the morning and talking loudly but that's beyond the motels control.  All round the motel is slightly outdated but you can see they are doing renovations at the moment and it will look great once it's all done. We will definitely be back to stay again~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457405998~“One night in an emergency”~You get what you pay for. This is a very tired property in need of some love and attention. The room itself was clean but very basic. The hallways, lift and other public areas were sad and in need of a good make over. They felt grimy. On a very busy weekend it was the only place with a vacant room the area. I understand why. Its either a budget buy or a last resort - pun intended.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452892420~“good stay”~Centrally located not to far from city, war memorial, parliament house etc, have stayed hear before and found rather average, this time round found renovation work completed at administration and room with balcony on level 2 very nice and modern with kitchenette, very clean and great service at front counter with good off street parking,small shopping centre with Woolworths, restaurants and fuel station right next door, Soccer club right next door with pokies, reasonable meals/ drinks, bottle shop also at street level below soccer club.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_440418109~“Comfy Place to Stay Near Belconnen”~The Motel is located about 5 minutes from Belconnen. We stayed in an economy family room (room 100 on the 1st floor). The set up of the room was basically a large open plan space that contained 1 queen and 2 single beds. There was also a sofa, dining table, office desk (quite generous size for a hotel) and a kitchenette (microwave). The room was quite spacious. Our room was located at the front of the hotel. I was initially concerned that it might be noisy fronting onto Belconnen Way, but it was very quiet there on a Saturday night. The Hotel itself is not new and the decor in some of the common areas reflects this. However our room was very nice and looks like it had been refurbished in the recent past. The bathroom was quite up to date with slate (or maybe faux slate I'm not sure) and white tiles throughout. The furniture also was modern and in good condition. There is a small shopping centre next door and the Hotel is attached to an RSL club (or similar I think). So there are likely food options nearby. We were visiting a friend in Belconnen so we ate there (only 5 min drive away). The check-in and check-out process was smooth and the staff were pleasant. While not luxurious, the room we had was clean, well appointed and importantly for us large. I would definitely recommend this Hotel if needing to stay around the Belconnen area.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_438688501~“Not good at all”~I'm surprised this hotel is able to stay open. One of only a few places with vacancies during a parliamentary sitting week probably says it all.  The room, fridge does not work. Couch is made of light brown vlyn like what you would fined in an 1990' falcon taxi. You sink in it tit but not in a nice way.  The tv is only approximately 24 inch and is connected to a shoddy connection which didnt pick up any ABC channels and after three hours seemed to then only on the other channels with a fair amount of jiggling.  Bath room door is nothing more than a badly torn plastic style concenterner door u would see in a caravan. Shower is also extremely tiny. With a broken hair dryer. Light cover above sink is smashed.  No hotel information book in the room. It's 2016 and there is no wifi at all, not even a pay one. I would never recommend staying here, I only did due to needing accommodation at the last minute.  Stay away.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433419740~“Mixed feeling about this place”~Well... mixed feeling about this accommodation. We lived in a small two bedroom apartment. The staff are very friendly and I feel that they're trying their best to give their guests a good experience in staying but they're just missing out on a good standard. But the rooms and facilities are just dated.  The utensils in the drawer are uncleaned and the wash liquid given was diluted with water, making it hard to use.   Bathroom is pretty small, the tower rack is immediately above tissue roll, which means that the tower is constantly contacting the tissue. In the kitchen, it provides electric cooking pots and stoves, but there is a sign where it says if the fire alarm is triggered then we need to pay $1500 call out fee which is ridiculous when the smoke detector is right next to the kitchen ceiling, and I'm very hesitant on cooking now.  I think unless the owner is planning to sell the motel, it requires a complete upgrade.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431946986~“2 night business trip”~Needed accommodation close to the university of canberra and little available during a parliament sitting week. First time at this particular hotel and wont be the last. Staff were friendly, woolworths, service station, takeaway food all within 100m.  I was upgraded to an apartment room which was a great room. Nice and clean, bed was comfy, foxtel movies and kitchen facilities.  Right next door to the Belconnen Soccer Club so if you wanted to eat or play the pokies i guess that is handy too. No compliants, it's not 5 star but it's not 3 either. So if you are looking for something clean and comfy without spending a fortune then this hotel/motel hit the spot.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_431419673~“Great location”~Awesome staff, very helpful with location of restaurants and attractions. Walking distance to food and supermarket. Self contained apartment fantastic. Would highly recommend this place. Even though the place was great, they were doing some renovations. Not the hotel's fault but had another guest that decided to make a very loud phone call in the guest area on our floor late at night.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_428957853~“Comfy stay at a good price”~Stayed here with a couple of friends for a night. The were no problems at all with the room. We were extremely satisfied with the size and price of the room. The rooms in some parts e.g. bathroom are a bit basic but overall clean and comfortable.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_422667545~“Very affordable and comfy stay”~Came here for Floriade. Not very far from Commonwealth park and rooms were very comfortable. Bed sheets, Toilets and other amenities were very good but best part was customer service. Not to mention prices were affordable during floriade season. Stayed for just 1 night but was very relaxing. Will come again.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_417050895~“Football game ”~Stayed the night to go and see Penrith Panthers play Canberra. Couldn't get good internet connection in the room and the parking wasn't as good as we excepted, and that why we booked that place because we noticed the free wifi in room and free parking which wasn't much of.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415878943~“Clean comfortable and ok”~The room is exactly as I remember it 6 years ago. Clean, comfortable and ok  Customer service was mostly good too - but if I'm asking for a taxi at 6am the next day wouldn't it make sense to ask if I wanted to check out/finalise the bill now too? Or let me know reception wouldn't be open til 7am rather than let a sign do it.  The restaurant was nice - the young ladies serving were wonderful.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_414485608~“Outdated”~Very friendly helpful young lady at reception...but hotel very outdated and bit smelly. Some rooms that had been vacated but not cleaned had theirs doors left open all night and day so you could see unmade beds etc each time you walked past ...wouldn't stay here again~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399425387~“Home away from home”~Having a new family member in Canberra means that we have been visiting frequently. We have stayed in many of the rooms and suites in Belconnen Inn and each time have been well looked after.  Nothing is too much trouble and staff has been accommodating with the demands of the different members of our party.  When we have stayed in a suite the location near the Belconnen markets is wonderful, for a supply of fresh local produce and a larger shopping mall is just down the road. There is also easy parking after a long drive and access to many of the activities available in Canberra.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_395352537~“Fine by me”~Stayed a Thursday night in room 204. Renovated and clean. Comfy bed, clean linen. 204 overlooks the road. I wasn't there for the view but if you're looking for a sleep in you may be disturbed by the traffic noise caused by the morning commute, but quite outside that. The property is next to a registered club and bottle shop. Raffles of a Thursday night. Bistro was standard fare. There's a small Woolworths about 100m away also.  All in all a good place and no need of the car once parked.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_394182966~“Comfortable, clean and convenient”~The staff could not have been more helpful. The room was very clean and the bathroom was lovely (renovated). The location was excellent in that there is a small shopping centre nearby which has a supermarket, pharmacy, excellent cafe and take away Chinese and Pizza. No need to get in the car~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_393827414~“Would not suggest going here ”~We booked this as a two bedroom apartment however there was no door between bedrooms and the second bedroom was part of the kitchen. In addition the door to the bathroom was broken meaning the bathroom was open directly to kitchen and bedroom areas . Also the chairs were broken, so no adequate seating ,the light fittings needed replacement bulbs making the room dark. When we commented on these issues we were told this was what family accommodation was about!  The carpets in the hall were dirty and the glasses in the apartment were quite dirty as well. This was very bad value and not what we understood we were booking . ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_364300364~“served my needs as close to Calvary Hospital”~I was extremely disappointed with the room, the pictures on their website certainly were not the room I was in, plus the room smelt extremely musty as if it had not been used for a long time. Daily room service to me means your bed is made and bins are emptied, but this did not happen at all........the blankets were just pulled up. Very disappointed. The positives were the staff were very friendly and helpful...it served my purpose being close to the hospital.~2~nan~4~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_361046992~“Better than expected”~Basic motel but had everything we needed, clean rooms, comfy bed, TV. Bathroom was tiny but adequate, Didn't have any problems with noise. Staff friendly and very close to Soccer Club for a good meal. Value for the price paid.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_355455675~“Worth the Extra to Take the Premium Room”~Let's face it there are allot of good places to stay in Canberra and the market is quite competitive. We decided to stay here as it was close to where our dog was staying with a friend. The location is near a club and bottle shop and Hawker shops which is a descent centre with a good woolworths. We choose the premium studio room and I would recommend it as worth the extra $ 20 we paid on booking.com. The room was newly renovated spacious with small kitchen and large modern shower and good A/c it was very hot in Canberra. The only thing that let the room down a bit was the saggy bed, I was with my 6 year old son. So for the price we paid good value and we cannot complain about anything major.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353768873~“No internet or great reception on iPhone. ”~We booked this hotel room over others in Canberra because of free wifi and free parking. No free wifi and hardly any reception on our iPhone and when wanting to get on the internet we had to go out of the room into the hallway. When we did go and tell staff they didn't do much.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_339716698~“This is a dog/pet friendly motel, and as such, offers comfortable accomodation for a family and pets”~Located 7 k from the CBD next to Woolworths, and a soccer social club, neither of which case any noise or disturbance/traffic problems. 1.5 k from a water park, and "off the lead" dog parks within an easy walk, its a great location if you are travelling with the family pet. A nice grass area to the rear is ideal for that pre bed walk for the pet. Beds are a little hard but ok, the hotel/motel is clean, and the staff friendly and helpful. Ask for room 403 if you have a dog. It looks isolated and too close to Woollies, but once you are inside you will find it perfect.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_336805169~“I'm disgusted that my parents paid $165 to stay in this hovel.”~My parents have stayed at this hotel once before and were happy to come back. This time however, the place seems to have really gone downhill. The positives. It's within walking distance of Hawker shopping centre, which is handy if you need food, petrol or groceries. It offers the option of pet-friendly accomodation and the room my parents were placed in was quite spacious. The negatives. There are many. I helped my parents unpack their belongings into the their room and assumed that while it looked dated and tired, it seemed clean. We were later to discover that looks were deceiving. Unfortunately we can't have pets in our apartment, because I would've had them stay with us instead. The $165-a-night room: - Appeared to be a converted storage space - what the? - 2 of it's 4 walls faced the hotel driveway so there were slamming car doors and noise from hotel guests all night - There was a request on the rules list in the room that guests keep the noise down - so why weren't people doing this? - The rules also stated that if guests set off smoke alarms they would need to pay the $1500 call out fee - why put cooking facilities in rooms at all if your smoke alarms are so sensitive? - As well, why place a stove on carpet? Are you WANTING the smoke alarms to go off and cause fire damage to your carpets? - The rules also stated (there's a theme here) that guests must wash their own dishes and would be charged if they didn't - not really the spirit of 'hospitality' I'd expect for $165 a night - The pillows were yellow and stained under the pillowcases - surely hotel staff could clean and/or replace items once in a while? - Taps were coming off the wall in the shower, and tiles were cracked - Tiles were covered with black mould - a health hazard - When turned on, the water spurted at the ceiling and dripped back down into the shower This room was NOT worth the $165 a night that my parents paid. I'm disgusted and unimpressed, and will be warning all of my family, friends and colleagues about the dismal state of this hotel. My parents complained to hotel staff, but no resolution was offered. If you're thinking about staying in the Belconnen area, I'd advise you to choose different accommodation.~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_336753503~“Disappointing”~We stayed at Belconnen Ways pet friendly accommodation, a dark dingy room right at the reception of the motel. Cars stopping slamming doors to all hours of the night. Take your own pillows theirs were stained and needed replacements, the stove was on carpet, we were worried about making toast or causing any problem that would set off the smoke alarm as the guest had to pay for the fire brigade to come to check the problem, $1,500!. The shower not only rained down but rained up to the ceiling, the toilet had a continual flushing problem if flushed and the grout was filthy in the shower recess. $165 for the pleasure of the experience with no offer to compensate. Consequently we were out the next morning as soon as possible and left a list of the problems with them.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~1~nan
review_324486196~“Great room”~Stayed here for its proximity to family we were visiting and the low prices. We had to book a premium studio apartment bedroom which was only $150 (bit more expensive than the motel rooms but they were booked out). Staff were friendly when checking in and the process went smoothly. We were on the first floor and the room was fantastic! Staying at a motel I didn't expect the rooms to be so big and modern (I assume these were new rooms). The bed was comfy, room wasn't noisy, had a good balcony, kitchen and the bathroom was great! For the price and size of the room I am used to paying $300+ coming from Sydney. If you don't mind paying a little bit more I'd recommend to get the premium studio apartments as they were great! Would stay here again for my next trip to the ACT.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_321154195~“Efficient”~I found this to be a fairly basic but decent low-rise hotel. Nothing remarkable except that I always had very good encounters with the friendly and helpful staff.  It is on the outskirts of central Belconnen and a short drive to Canberra Uni (or a long walk), though with a car it's really not that hard to get anywhere in Canberra quickly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_310907144~“Regular customer”~I have stayed at this hotel every year for the past few years when attending Canberra for a social event. The staff have always been helpful and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable as usual. The location for me is handy with a sports club right next door that also serves very good meals and has a nice atmosphere (not party central). I would recommend this hotel to others travelling to Canberra and will be booking here again next year when I go there.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_310367897~“Convenience in Belconnen ”~I stay here due to convenient location to office and have stayed here many times. Breakfast is often included in the stay and is good value. The rooms are basic and as expected for accommodation of this type. The hotel staff are helpful and always pleasant. Bit disappointing that the restaurant is now closed Sunday as there aren't many options in the area without access to a car.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_308790187~“Convenient Location”~I needed a Motel in a convenient location (visiting a nearby relative) and I chose this one as it was economical and located in a small shopping centre (Hawker). The reviews I read were mixed but I took the gamble and the Motel exceeded my expectations. It looks rather run-down from the outside and indeed is somewhat dated and 'old' inside, but our two rooms were clean and had everything we needed in them. There is parking available although the underground section was dark and dingy and I elected to park on the street level due to safety concerns and had no problems. There is a soccer club adjoining the Motel with poker machines, meals and a bar so that could become noisy but we had no issues at all and we enjoyed a quiet drink there ourselves. There are several cafes in the small shopping centre including Rock Salt where we had a lovely breakfast for two for $28. There was an excellent bakery where we purchased a huge Danish for another breakfast for $4.80. The Motel itself does not do meals but can provide continental breakfast packs for a charge. There is another takeaway in the shopping centre serving burgers, pizzas and the like and also a Chinese restaurant. There is a Woolworths supermarket as well and a petrol station and post office - so convenience is the name of the game at this Motel. Our Queen rooms were slightly different from each other but each had one Queen bed and one single bed in them, TV, tea/coffee making facilities (free milk and biscuits as well), iron, and the larger room had microwave and sink. We were on the 2nd floor and did not experience any problems with noise even though the rooms were definitely 'old'. They provided soap, shampoo and a hairdryer. My only complaint was a rather stagnant smell coming up from the handbasin but the shower recess etc. were all quite clean. I would definitely stay there again. There is free wifi in the Motel but I didn't try it out. My visit this time did not entail sight-seeing but the roads in the vicinity were good and we had no trouble accessing the airport in approximately 30 minutes and were about 10 minutes from Belconnen Westfield shopping centre which had all the shops you are ever likely to need although you do have to pay for the parking there.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

And have to say, if you had a group or family it was very good value. $150 for a 2 bed apartment with queen in main and 2 singles and small couch in the other. Also had a kitchen so you could cook your own. The shower was very small, but not really a big deal. The couches could definitely use an update as could the TVs, but it was comfy enough and good value for Canberra in a "sitting week".~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Whilst the room was a little dated it was clean and comfortable. We were very appreciative of being able to have our dog with us and I guess this is part of the trade off. The price was great too.

review_237499865~“Doggie bliss”~It has been 5 years since we travelled with a dog and if this hotel is anything to go by things are definitely changing. They advertised pet friendly rooms which in the past meant the humans basically got to stay in a kennel for the price of a motel room. Not at Belconnen Hotel/Motel. You get a very clean serviced apartment on the ground floor and are treated like a valued customer. Ok the building is not brand new and some decor, trim and fittings are a little dated but it is still a nice place to stay as it is very clean and tidy with undercover parking. The staff are friendly and helpful and it really isn't that far off a 4 star hotel but with the advantage of being able to have the four legged family member in your room. Our dog felt like royalty marching through the entrance foyer like he owned it. A quick tip on food though, if you like good food you may find it best to give the 'Solo Bistro' next door a miss. Very handy but when you get Salt & Pepper Squid served covered in sweet chilli sauce you quickly realise something is amiss. That has nothing to do with the motel though.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_236482426~“OK place for a stay in Canberra”~We stayed in their 'Motel Room' which had a double and a single bed.

It is conveniently located with the local wooworths & local shops / bakery/ cafe a short walk away. It is easy to travel to local sightseeing spots such as the war memorial (about 7minute drive), Gold creek village (about 10-15mins) and other local must sees! Free parking is an added bonus. The only noise was from the main road (but even that was quiet!). Looking foward to coming back again! Highly recommend the premuim apartments as it is self catering.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_232627236~“The best thing about this place was the location.”~Stayed here for 6 nights while doing the "touristy stuff" with my daughter and her friend in Canberra. We stayed in a Queen "apartment" with connecting door to kids' Queen/single combo room. Good location, easy to reach from airport and both City and Northern activities, e.g. Gold Creek Village. Free parking. Very close to a Woolies, Shell service station and a couple of places you can grab a quick family meal, but don't expect gourmet dining. Reasonably quiet because of the solid brick walls, although these couldn't really muffle the arrival of a herd of wildebeest later in our stay.  Although reasonably clean upon arrival. housekeeping consistently failed to clean kids' side of connecting-door apartments; they never made their beds, missed mine once and never cleaned up the kids' kettle tray. A bit of a cheek, when they ask for your "co-operation" in washing your dishes yourself.  My 11-year-old found a used condom under her bed when they moved the beds to create a "play space"! Not a good reflection of the cleaning quality. The hotel/motel itself is very dated (1970s), although they have been renovating bathrooms etc., but although my (queen apartment) bathroom had been renovated, they failed to get rid of the mould on the ceiling or the walls. The kitchen appliances are ancient and the 2-plate electrical plate had 2 settings: "off" and "pathetic." It took half an hour to get a pan of water to boil! Do NOT attempt anything heroic in the kitchen. The front desk staff are helpful, friendly and approachable. The one who was on duty when we reported the condom had a smart remark for us, (don't try to make light of lapses in hygiene!) and seemed unapologetic. Everyone else (especially Cara) was fine. The wifi is free, which is unusual for an Australian establishment. Bedding and towels appeared clean upon arrival, although they were never changed during our stay.  I would only stay here again if they fire the cleaning company, complete the renovation, and update the kitchen appliances. One star is for the location, and the other is for the front of house staff.~2~nan~4~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_222334724~“Great location”~A group of 8 of us stayed here for the Canberra/Dragons game in August. We traveled from Sydney and Wollongong for the game and found this place as a central location. We were advised that we could arrive at 12pm which was great as we could get ready. We actually didn't arrive til 1:30pm and the room was still getting cleaned. Reception said it was fine to leave our bags in the room and head to the game. We walked into the room to have cleaners yelled at us to leave and that they weren't ready yet. We explained the situation and they rudely allowed us to leave our bags.  Otherwise, the rooms were nicely furnished and a TV in each room was great. It was advised that Foxtel was on all 4 tvs but it was only on 3. No oven in the kitchen wasn't the best and we easily ran out of plates and glasses as we were a large group. Woolworths right next door (but no plastic bags so had to carry all food - not sure if this an ACT thing or just this one). Struggled to understand how our heater worked and it blew cold air all night long even though it said 31 degrees. We eventually got it working the next morning but was too late.  Will stay again when we travel for future NRL games.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_222304467~“Single night stop”~Room was warm, comfortable, clean and spacious. Was a bit surprised to find only one blanket on the bed, There were no spares in the wardrobe, but there was split air conditioning so room was warm. Some furnishings were a little dated but of a good quality.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_218733533~“Pleasantly Suprised”~I was a little bit nervous pulling up as it looked old and rundown from outside. I checked in and was advised that I had one of the newly refurbished rooms which was great. The room was very spacious in size. The bathroom much bigger than regular hotel rooms as well. Very clean, comfortable bedding. It took a while to get the air conditioning right, Canberra is freezing at this time of year. Plenty of parking available. Only a very short walk to the supermarket, restaurants and chemist. Very easy drive to the city~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_216548632~“Will stay there again”~We stayed in a standard queen room on the ground floor for 2 nights. It was quite spacious and very clean. The carpets looked new, the bathroom seemed recently renovated with modern fittings and our bed was very comfortable. The heating ( for July in Canberra) was just perfect. Whilst we were told they were "full" ( and we were quite close to the entry foyer) we weren't bothered by any noise from any of the other rooms etc and slept very well!.  The staff were very pleasant and the location was less than 10 mins drive to where we wanted to go each day ( the AIS to watch a National Volleyball Tournament) and right next door to a small shopping centre with supermarket and a few restaurants- a prefect location for us. (including a great little Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant)  We plan to be heading back to Canberra again in July next year so we will definitely be booking here again.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan

review_214910163~“Beautiful, large, well equipped room! ”~We stayed in a PREMIUM STUDIO APARTMENT (121$ per night)  It was very recently renovated beautifully. The bathroom was brand new, modern and spacious. The queen bed was exceptionally comfortable, we were able to cook in the kitchenette ( cooktop, microwave, and sink) and there was a supermarket around the corner.  There are obvious areas in this place that have not renovated, but if you look past that and book the right room, you will have a lovely stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_202016183~“Nice although cooking facilities are a bit limited”~We stayed here in a two bedroom apartment for more than a week and it was fine but sometimes challenging with a young child. The door handles are not suited to to standard child-proof protectors (once you put the protector on, it's difficult for even an adult to undo the door at all!), the glass top coffee table is a constant risk and we had to confiscate the lamp in the bedroom and hide it so our daughter couldn't get to it. That said, the fact that it's an older style place suited us fine - it meant we weren't endlessly worrying about any small marks our daughter might have made. The staff were excellent - friendly and extremely accommodating and helpful. The cooking facilities were a bit limited, perhaps reflecting that it's an older place. There's a microwave oven and an electric frying pan, but only a little portable two burner cooktop. There's also no dining table and not enough space to have one. Instead, there's chairs around the breakfast bar, which was fine when it was just my partner, myself and my daughter, but not so great when my in-laws were also with us. There is a washing machine and dryer at the end of the corridor, but you have to pay to use them using $1 coins, so you need to make sure you have plenty of change handy. A big plus is that it's located right next to a Woolworths and the Hawker shops which include a bakery that makes nice pies and very nice red velvet cupcakes, a good takeaway place, a restaurant, a chemist, a post office and a lovely little second hand bookshop, amongst other things. There's a play area for kids, but it's a bit limited. However, there are a couple of parks nearby, but the only one suitable for a young child is on the other side of Belconnen Way, through the pedestrian underpass and follow the path down. Overall this place is fine - nothing startling, but nothing to seriously complain about either. If you're visiting Canberra, this place is not particularly close to either Civic or the Manuka/Griffith/Kingston area (where the restaurants and cafes are). However, it's an easy drive into Civic down Belconnen Way and Barry Drive and on the way you can check out the Botanical Gardens and the Telstra Tower.~3~3~3~4~3~4~5~nan
review_200396504~“Clean, comfortable, quiet”~I picked this motel almost 'at random' and drove in 'off the street' after I found my original choice seemed to have closed. The girl on reception was cheerful and helpful (come back if you need more milk, more towels, etc.) The room was clean, comfortable, reasonably spacious, quiet. It's located adjacent to a Woolworths supermarket and a small shopping centre, and there is a bottle shop a few steps away. I was told the next door Soccer Club has new caterers and the food was now good - so ate there the first night; the 'seafood basket' must have been the worst meal I have ever eaten. I would have thought cooking a seafood basket was cooking 101, but what arrived was just greasy, overcooked, had an unappetising look, and the seafood seemed anything but fresh. So I got a take-away pizza from the local chicken shop the next night - which was fabulous, and cost 1/2 of what I was charged for the club meal. So the motel is highly recommended, the adjacent club is not.~5~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_199369370~“Cheap & Comfortable - older style hotel...”~Nothing fancy about this place - but it is comfortable, clean and good value for money. We stayed here as it was close to friends nearby. It has Hawker shops out the back which is convenient and a drive through bottle shop in the complex.  The hotel is dated with its decor but if that does not bother you it is an ok place to stay. Room had everything you needed incl foxtel. Staff were all very friendly and helpful too.~3~4~3~4~3~4~4~nan
review_198320762~“Premium rooms are quite comfortable.”~We stayed in a premium room for $175. It is a very satisfactory room with good space, well equipped kitchen, but nothing extraordinary. Good room lighting but no bed lamp, no shower cap supplied, good towels but no spares supplied. Presumably we could have asked for more but didn't bother. The standard room we looked at where friends were staying was smaller and darker.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_197608236~“Comfortable older, motel with flashbacks to the 70's”~Stayed 2 nights in a standard room. Room rate was $143/night which included WiFi which worked well. The hotel is on a corner street in Hawker, Belconnen, sitting with the local soccer club so inexpensive meals are close by. There is parking on site which appears to be shared with the club patrons. The hotel dates to the early 1970s and still retains some early charm which was about function. The decor is older, clean, wood finishes, smaller rooms for the occasional traveler. We stayed two nights, felt rested. Staff were helpful, and efficient, if you like your privacy, you won't be nagged like at bigger hotels. If you're after a cheaper no frills stay this is the place.~3~3~3~nan~3~3~3~nan

review_190221241~“Confy and Handy”~We went to Canberra to stay for a couple of days and stayed at the Belconnen Hotel. The service was pretty good and because we went with our pet we had for us a big apartment. It was spacious and beds comfortable. When we arrive was clean but through our stay it was not clear if the house keeping (vacuum and beds) was done every day or every two. Still the ladies helped us with an excellent cleaning the days they did. Woolies is just at the side so you can get your stuff and city and its highlights are not far away.~4~3~5~5~5~3~4~nan
review_188958512~“Overnighter Dec 30 2013”~I saw there are some average to negative reviews and was nervous about our booking so I was a bit surprised that our room was large, clean and tidy and so I wanted to at least provide some balance.. OK its not the Hyatt but then it doesn't charge Hyatt prices. We had our wee dog with us and so finding anywhere that takes pets is not easy but this was great value in our view. TV worked, AC worked, fridge worked and had fresh milk for a cuppa, shower worked and the place was clean. Cheers Jiggser~4~5~3~4~3~4~4~nan
review_184092126~“LOCATION dictacted the choice”~We chose the venue only for the location close to family members we were visiting.  Were allocated the older outdated decored rooms with three beds - queen and 2 singles.  Very small but adequate for the three of us for 2 nights only. It was clean but no milk in fridge. Corridors upstairs were very dark. Thought the cost was very costly for the standard of accommodation. However, we were only 5 minutes from visiting our family so can't really complain.~3~2~4~4~2~4~3~nan
review_178658343~“Comfortable and clean”~The staff are friendly and accommodated our needs travelling with a trailer. Rooms were spacious enough, clean with comfortable beds and had all the facilities needed, we stayed in interconnecting rooms with my teenager and we were all very happy to have our own TV. The hall decor with the antique furniture was beautiful like staying in a manor. Great to have a shopping center on the doorstep with choice of eateries, supermarket, very quiet bottle shop and service station all within walking distance, very convenient. Would stay again if in Canberra. Thank you~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

Cigarette burns in the carpet... list goes on! Not to mention they dont even turn on the lights in the way too dark (rather creepy axe-murderer) hallway. Want to die a horrible and gruesome death then stay here the night!~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_167297854~“What part of "RESERVATION" don't they understand??”~We booked and paid a deposit for a newly-renovated 3-bedroom apartment in January 2013, traveling in a party of 6 with a teenager and three young children. We were already unnerved by the general surroundings when we arrived (a bottle shop right next door) and were even less impressed when we entered the dark and unwelcoming lobby. The worst was yet to come ... The front desk then casually informed us that the apartment we had booked (and paid a deposit for) was not available. The reason? The current guests had decided to extend their stay and the policy is to allow an extension even if the room is booked for incoming guests! I was utterly flabbergasted, and wondered from which planet the operators had come from. After fruitless protests (and an unwelcome helping of attitude from one of the front desk staff), we were shown an "alternative 3-bedroom" which actually consisted of two tired, run-down adjoining units. We had no problems declining and left. Thankfully, we found alternative (and much more pleasant accommodation) at the Belconnen Premier Inn. Though it cost us more, we were determined not to patronise this place, given they do not even understand the concept of a "reservation". The attitude of the front desk staff just made the whole experience that much worse. Whatever you do, do not even think of staying here ... ever.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_166873366~“Better than expected.”~This is great value and the cleanliness, service and location exceeds others in its category. The guest lounge areas are great for groups travelling together or for kids to stretch out. The supermarket and few cafes are 3 minutes walk away so can easily grab breakfast supplies. My room faced the main road but across a green space and was really quiet... Actual slept better than some other hotels ( once turned fridge off) with more stars...no noises plumbing or load doors.~4~5~5~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_153141824~“Don't bother, the place is a disgrace! Way over priced”~Stayed only due to location to family and the facg they had done renovations but will never bother again. We stayed in one of the new apartment style rooms but very dissatisfied. They had 3 housekeepers doing the one job, yet it was still not done well. Beds not made each day, and when they were, just pulled up over untucked sheets. Towels not changed and left dirty. Resupply of apartment amenities and condiments not done (unless u wanted UHT milk, that seemed to get replenished even if not used - I counted 15 capsules in the fridge on the last day). Not given appropriate number of towels, crockery or utensils for people in the room. Bathroom cleanliness disgraceful and many corners have been cut with their renovations to 'save money' at the detriment of the final product. Whole hotel has a 'funky' smell.  Why bother doing up a few rooms and leaving the reception, entrance and main halls old and dingy. Even after we asked for additional linen and towels they still didn't give us what we needed. Housekeepers took no pride, care and showed no initiative to look at what was actually needed. Reception staff clueless and hotel manager rude. Beds extreme uncomfortable and mattresses have lost all their comfort. Queen mattress had no sturdiness on the sides so just wanted to roll off the sides, and the roll away we needed felt more like a hammock and had no support. For the price paid I would expect a much better place. I'll never stay again and have already googled and found better and cheaper options in the area.  This hotel obviously relies on its regular 'tradie' guests to stay afloat, cos no one in their right mind would stay here out of pleasure ~1~1~3~nan~1~2~1~nan
review_144992133~“Not recommended unless you need to be in Belconnen”~Booked a stay to visit relatives in Canberra. Motel was dark and old looking with a very very slow elevator. The rooms were clean but in dire need of a revamp and new appliances. The staff were friendly overall and helpful when asked any questions or requests. Location is close to a mall behind and also a liqour store next door which is a bit unnerving. Reading from previous comments I can understand how things go missing in this location. If I was to visit Canberra again, I would rather live somewhere closer to the CBD and have to drive a bit further out if visiting friends or relatives.~2~2~3~3~2~3~3~nan
review_143324863~“DON'T DO IT”~OMG it was so incredibly unclean. The outdated slow lift stank. Dark, rank and old. On walking in the room it was obvious the double bed was completely sunken. There were visible large crumbs around the table and unidentified lumpy stains on the carpet. The black valance around one single bed had unidentified dribble stains. The double sunken bed valance had mould stains right across one side. The tap in bathroom had a huge amonut of raised silicone, like it had been done may times. The cleaners should be fired and a health inspection undertaken. The receptionist had mentioned on arrival that the old functions rooms had been made into rooms and opened three weeks ago so we asked about them on complaint of the condition of our room and had to pay the extra fee to stay in one of them. Although to our relief the room was new the feel of lack of care was planted. The new Room was ill furnished with no where to really seat, the curtains did not extend across the whole of the window and the craftsmanship seemed bodgy. The door stop did not work, all the lights randomly turned on in the middle of the night, the bathroom tiles were finish wrong, the powerpoint was in front of the pole for the desk/kitchen bench/table and the sign requesting you do your own dishes and straighten the bed to keep costs down was at this point belly laughable.~1~1~2~nan~1~1~3~nan
review_137311069~“Never again”~I stayed for work over 2 nights. They were in the middle of renovations. The room smelt like sewerage. The amenities were filthy I wanted to make a coffee and went to fill the kettle with water and saw that the kettle was dirty and brown on the inside. I advise staff who were apologetic and changed my room. The location was not the best either - I woke up with empty beer bottles in the back of my ute. ~1~1~1~1~1~1~3~nan
review_132853676~“Motel and manager both disgraceful”~The first night of my stay the $3000 hard top was stolen off my ute. Managers response to request for video footage or supposed security patrols? Over the years many things have been stolen off the cars, even cars themselves. I was not informed of this. Soccer club video? Will check when they have time. Supermarket? Looked down thier nose at me. Police? Cant do anything. Female receptionists are friendly and helpful or as helpful as allowed to be. Male managers rude, obnoxious and harrassing, they even let themselves into my apartment to check i had not done a runner..this morning the manager ignored the do not disturb sign, knocked while opening the door and was embarrassed and horrorfied to see me standing there, fortunately for him fully clothed. Reason given? Noticed my ute was not there. Explanation given by me? A truck was blocking my driveway access and my ute was parked in supermarket carpark. Basically these people are saying they expect me to runaway without paying even tho they have my drivers license and car rego. Very nice people indeed. Other problems: internal door used as external which buckled after rain and could not be closed. Bedroom light not working, dodgy swtches that zap u, bed sagging and stained, carpet damp, stretched, filthy and even had dog excrements along skirting boards, B.I.R runners, bottom of sofa and windows. Leaf blowers at 8am and tradesmen banging around on roof.~1~1~3~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_132641198~“Clean & Warm”~The Hotel was a little dated but it was very clean and really warm, a lot of the time I did not require the the heating on and believe me it was very cold outside.

review_128369411~“Cheated”~We booked via an online website that advertised a certain type of apartment that turned out did not exist and we were instead put into a smaller, much smaller, apartment. The reception even insisted that that's what we had booked for when this is clearly not the case! I had to call the booking office to get it sorted but unfortunately it was fully booked on the first night so we had to put up with the smaller apartment. A larger apartment was later offered to us for our second night stay as a goodwill gesture. The whole experience had left a sour taste for our stay at the property.~2~3~3~1~nan~3~1~nan

The bathroom looked like it had been recently refurnished and was quite acceptable. The furniture is what you would expect of a cheaper hotel - outdated and not that comfertable. Beds could use updating (could feel springs etc). It did have a slightly musty smell to it,but an open window dealt with most of that. Quite acceptable if looking for cheap accomodation (not my normal standard when holidaying).~3~3~3~2~3~4~3~nan
review_121275406~“Desperate - last room available in Canberra”~If we had been in a position to inspect first, we would have made an offer of $60 for night, in desperation. As it was, we (wife and I) were charged $190 for a "double room" - as the last available room - and found ourselves in a dingy, dirty setting, Television not working and unable to be fixed by night manager, lounge chair with wet greenish "blob" that the manager apologised for, turned cushion over and said he "would write up in the book" (didn't seem surprised by things, and suggested we make our criticisms known strongly in the morning), lounge would not have been accepted by St Vinnies - dirty and ragged, shampoo sachet opened/used and left for next unfortunate traveller, garbage bag emptied and left in middle of floor, no milk - longlife or fresh. Torn carpet to trip up in the dark. Never again. Sleeping in the street would be cleaner.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_120893184~“Stay in your car before you stay here!”~I was forced to stay here as a result of a last minute requirement to be in Canberra; Parliament was sitting and there was just no other option. Where to start... The room is dark, dank and smells;  Lightbulbs that don't work; Blinds that don't close properly; A shower that is so 1970s it has a curtain (dirty) rather than a shower door; The room stinks of smoke even though it is "Non-smoking". A half-ironing board (really? in 2011?); A Tv screen that is smaller than my laptop; Dial-up interet access, and only limited wireless access; No change of towels, replacement of soap and shampoo, nor replacement of used coffee sachets. Seriously - if you have to stay here, delay your trip, or bring a tent and find a nice paddock. This place should be bull-dozed and rebuilt.~1~1~2~1~1~1~3~nan
review_118767978~“Nicotine coloured walls and a smell to match”~I stayed a couple of nights, there wasn't any other option as parliament was sitting. The room was dingy, which made the nicotine coloured walls even more unpalatable. The bedspread was dirty and the non-smoking room stunk of cigarettes. Don't confuse this Belconnen hotel with the other Premier Inn, which is much more modern and clean.~1~1~3~1~1~1~3~nan
review_118135682~“Out in the suburbs...”~I was booked here for 3 nights at a cost of $465. This is far more than a motel room in this type of location is worth, but it seems to be the reality of "sitting week" in Canberra that they can charge these rates. On the positive side, my room was spacious, generally clean and reasonably comfortable, there was free wi-fi which worked more than half the time, and everything I tried worked (except the phone). The bathroom was fresh, basic amenities provided, and the towels were particularly good. However the room smelt of years of industrial cleaning products trying to mask an overall staleness - probably from the ancient carpet (which had a hole in it). I overcame this by leaving the window partly open, despite overnight low temperatures of around 0ºC.  Lighting was poor - two wall lights were fitted with "daylight" fluorescent bulbs, which provided a strange blue-ish light that was insufficient to illuminate the further reaches of the room, and made ironing on the little table-top ironing board provided rather difficult. The motel has a restaurant, but it was not operational - breakfast was available to take to the room in a paper bag. The lift was old, slow and noisy - avoid the rooms next to it. I wouldn't normally use the lift for 2 floors, but the stairwell was unlit when I checked it out so stairs weren't really an option. Reception was attended from 7am until an unspecified time (understood to be about 2am), but if you required assistance to access the building at other times there was a $50 charge. Although the motel is located in a shopping centre, it is only a small suburban centre (not the main Belconnen shops), and the only stores open when I arrived were a liquor store and a KFC. This is a long way from anything and public transport is very limited - I was really glad I had hired a car and I would not recommend staying here without one. In short, this is an ordinary motel deep in the suburbs and while my room was OK, it was seriously overpriced. So the sign on the back of the door asking guests to assist with straightening the beds "to enable us to continue with reduced rates" did make me laugh...~2~2~2~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_116408806~“Just Bearable”~The stay didnt start well. After entering my room I went to put the T.V on. I spent 10 min looking for the remote to find it missing a battery. I went down to ask for another one where again I waited 10 min whilst the receptionist tried to locate another. No battery was located which left me walking to the IGA to purchase one for myself. Whilst the bathroom and T.V was fine, the remainder of the furnishings left a lot to be desired. The steel pipe that runs along the room wafts warm air BUT its also bangs loudly every 10 minutes. Following morning I asked to change rooms and this was done without fuss which was pleasing. Negatives cont, - Parking or lack there of as have to compete with the soccer club. - Lift- Extremely slow. - Noise- On main road - Out dated and needs upgrade or knockdown. - better value elsewhere. Positives, - Close to IGA and restaurants.~2~2~nan~2~nan~2~2~nan

Unsafe light globes in bedside table fittings, too hot you burnt your hand on them Very very unsafe underground, cover parking with graffiti everywhere....... Luckily as we were in Canberra for a family wedding we did not have to spend much time in the rooms. I think we were kucky it was not hot as I would no rely on the airconditioners to cool the rooms I can't believe the "nrma" even bothered to rate it, I think gave the property a 3 1/2 star rating. If overseas guests stayed there they would be wondering about the quality of Australia's hotels. A terrible place to stay.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_93810656~“not what we asked for + lots of problems”~I SPECIFICALLY asked for adjoining rooms as we have a very young family. Even after explaining the need for an adjoining room so that we could put the babies to bed and relax, AND being assured that's what we were getting, we arrived to a SINGLE room with all beds in it and then had to retire by 7pm as the babies wont sleep with lights and tv etc on. The bathroom door had to remain closed all the time as there was an odour which wouldnt have been a problem except that when shut, it rattled noisly the whole time due to some sort of pipe or air conditioning system . There is mould on the bathroom ceiling and unless you like a cold shower there is little water pressure. Somehow the bathroom foot towel was soaking wet before we used it??? The tap was also leaky. The furniture is not only outdated it is very worn. The staff were friendly enough but for $180/night I will find an alternative next time~2~1~2~2~1~4~2~nan
review_81907778~“Outdated, unhelpful staff and bad smells for $150 a night!”~I stayed here with my boyfriend recently for a night as it was the long weekend and this was the 'best option' for under $200.  Upon arrival the 70s style of the motel said it all- with all the furniture probably the original from 30+ years ago. The receptionist was not very friendly and treated us like a hassle to her day. Our non-smoking studio apartment smelt terrible- like mould and smoke, so we asked if we could switch rooms. The receptionist put us into a slightly bigger room which at least did not smell as bad as the first.  The room was cramped with excess furniture (lounges that got in the way of walking) and the bed had a noticable sag in the middle. This was probably another one of the relics from the 70s that hasnt been upgraded. The bathroom had been slightly upgraded with new tiling, but not in the shower, which explains the mouldy smell.  The kitchenette was also upgraded and was sufficient for our 2 cup of tea. Entering a password to change TV station was also a pain.  I would recommend for cheap accomodation go to the formula1 $94 a night place, as at least it is clean and more modern even if it smaller.~1~1~1~2~2~2~1~nan
review_71588285~“Look around for somewhere else to stay”~We recently stayed at this Motel, because it was the only place we could book at such short notice. This Motel was built in the mid 1970's and very little has been spent to update the rooms since apart from the addition of digital TV's to each room. The Family apartment is simply three small Motel rooms converted with a door between each room. The ensuite bathrooms and kitchenette are both extremely small and ineffective for a large family. Many of the fixtures need repairing. We had to put up with a smell somewhere between gas and sewerage for a couple of hours on two nights, and found the staff and management extremely unhelpful and disinterested. The Guest parking is shared by the local pub, so if coming home late at night, you will have to park in the local shopping centre car park, as there is inadequate parking for guests. A really disappointing stay for the price paid - would defintely recommend you try somewhere else.~2~1~2~2~2~4~1~nan
review_58876729~“Stay away!”~This place is over priced, tired, daggy, run down and in urgent need of a major, major overhaul. You will do much better for your money at more modern, more conveniently located hotels in Canberra. I stayed in a basic motel suite; the furniture was straight out of 1970, and not in a good way! Things were broken such as the vanity drawers that wouldn't shut, the door looks as though it had been jimmied, the ice on the small freezer in the bar fridge was literally 10cm thick! The air conditioner leaked water all over the floor and the entrance way to the room (which by the way was only a few metres from the from door and reception) smelt funny. Broken and obsolete furniture lay around the hall way near my room. Breakfast isn't served until 07:30a, and again the ambiance of the dining room is circa 1968. Staff were friendly enough, however I get nervous when I check-in and the commercial radio is playing so loudly and I struggle to hear the receptionist tell me that they don't have a booking for me despite me having a confirmation in my hand. Don't do it unless it is quite literally the last resort :-(~1~1~1~3~1~2~3~nan

review_29637671~“Belconnen Hotel & Serviced Apartment”~absoutly shocking, will never ever stay here again. old, run-down, manager/man on duty was very rude and very unhelpful.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_29345089~“oldish but new bathrooms”~couldn't find much else and needed to book a place, so decided to book here. the place is quiet, rather old but seems to be maintained reasonably. i got a studio apartment. the staff were quiet and polite, the room was old, but reasonably well looked after (carpet was old, but i'd seen worse). Although there was a kitchenette provided, you can't cook on the portable stove they give you without setting of the firealarm because there isn't a venting/range hood to remove steam/smoke, - so only thing left is the microwave, which at least you can do soups and other small dishes with. they had an lcd television and the reception was acceptable (about same as other places).  the bathroom looked recently renovated and was quite nice - the tiles new and clean, shower head new and water pressure and hot water good - although they give you small little bar soaps so if you're picky you might want to use your own. as they share parking with the soccer club nearby (you don't hear noise from the club and the patrons in the carpark seemed sober), you may get left without a car spot at night.~3~3~2~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_7847228~“Sometimes you have to take what you can get.”~Found this as the ONLY remaining accommodation available for an urgent overnight trip to Canberra. Whilst the premises are reasonably old the rooms are reasonably furnished. Carpets were a bit threadbare and the bathroom was a bit tired. The room was very clean, warm, quiet and bed was comfy. Restaurant is only open for brekkie (and you have to book by 9pm night before) but there are a number of restaurants within a short walk. Bit of a hike from the city centre (about 10-15 min dive, longer in peak). Free high speed internet available in the lobby and some rooms. Like other hotels in the ACT, television reception was woeful. Bit overpriced for what you got but that seems to be prevalent throughout the ACT. ~2~2~2~nan~3~4~3~3
