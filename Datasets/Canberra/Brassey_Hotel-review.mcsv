review_478386994~“Fantastic location, wonderful room”~We spent a night here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was modern, large and comfortable and there were ample restaurants on site for dinner and breakfast. The hotel was only a few minutes' drive from Parliament House and was in a quiet residential-type area. The staff were friendly and efficient. Parking could be an issue as there is limited parking on site but there is street parking which is available afternoons, evenings and mornings.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_477346039~“Location Location Location!”~A relaxing stay here, with fantastic staff. Several pluses: * Walking distance to several tourist venues and restaurants at Manuka and Kingston * We had a superior room and the furnishings were comfortable, as well as being a spacious room with a separate area with desk and wardrobe. * Free access to Hale gym - an unbelievably well fitted out gym * Terrific staff - always happy to assist. We had air con issues and some mould on our bathroom ceiling. Both were attended to on the day we reported them * Free parking, whether in front or behind the hotel * Lounges on every floor, including balconies * bicycles available for hire * Kids play area * COFFEE! - machine in the lounge was complimentary, along with T2 teas * microwavable meals and snacks available for purchase at a reasonable cost Unfortunately, the bathroom we had was not as clean as the rest of the room - apart from the large black mould on the ceiling, there was a little mould on silicon seals in the shower area. This didn't really match the quality of the rest of the hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476971480~“Family Mini Break”~Overall was incredibly impressed with the Brassey Hotel. The hotel and its amenities were modern but still payed respect to the charm of the building.  We had one of the family suites and my two daughters were over the moon with their bedroom and it's decor. Loved the kids pillows and throws!! The kids play and activity area right outside our door was a great bonus too.  I have to make special mention of the beds... the beds were amazingly comfortable, as were the pillows and all the bedding. We all slept solidly and didn't want to get up.  There were some works going on during our stay but we experienced no interference from them at all. We will definitely be back. Was such a shame to only stay one night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474038403~“Lovely Stately Hotel”~We were looking for somewhere to stay for a night and we found a gem at a very reasonable price. Located very near Parliament House and to many restaurants in Manuka and Kingston, it suited us perfectly as a base. It is an older hotel that has been well renovated and has very comfortable beds! Service was friendly, and we will certainly return when the garden renovations have been completed.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_473958875~“Good Location, Comfortable Hotel”~We stayed 2 nights in April and believe we got good value for money. Check in was easy although we we were lucky as there was only 1 parking spot available at the front of the hotel. We found out later that there is public parking at the back but this is limited to 2 hours from 9.00 to 5.00. The room was a good size and with good facilities and good wifi. The bathroom was also a good size and clean. Our room (148 I think) was one of the closest to reception and although the bed was very comfortable, there were some air conditioning units right outside that made some noise during the night (more of a humming type noise). The hotel is very well located not far from Parliament House. Although there is no restaurant on site there are good restaurants close by with good information provided by the staff. There were microwavable meals available in the small lounge area as well as good coffee. The hotel is also close to Manuka and Kingston (both walkable) with lots of restaurants, cafes and shops. The city centre, war memorial, lake and nice areas like Braddon are all within a 10 minute drive. We are happy to recommend Brassey Hotel for a stay in Canberra.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_473947189~“A little coffe shop will help”~I'd rate staff -very good, environment is clean - garden could be improved and night lights would greatly add to the ambiance. I would give this heritage hotel another chance should we need to go back for another family event.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473728073~“Lovely”~Here in Canberra for the marathon ...stayed at the Brassey in the Realm Precinct ...room was beautiful and comfortable, staff were very friendly and helpful.

review_472842762~“Good affordable”~It has been recently renovated as part of a group that includes the realm and the Burberry, good breakfast at the Realm. Premium location for NGA and parliament etc, easy access to Manuka for restaurants~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472039465~“Older hotel, recently renovated”~The Brassey is one of older hotels and forms part of a cluster that includes the Realm, the Burbury and the National.  As an older place the rooms have been renovated although it does appear that renovations are continuing. A new gym has been added recently. The hotel can be noisy as walls are a little thin, however I found the bed very comfortable. The location is good within a 15-20 minute walk to a attractions such as the National Gallery, the Portrait Gallery, Kingston and Manuka. The hotel is very limited for public space with a too small lounge containing a self-serve bar, tea and coffee. The weekend we stayed the tariff was good, but if forced to pay full rack-rate I would be unhappy.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471976155~“Okay for short stay”~Stayed two nights with my wife, the bed was a zip together bed way to soft great for lounging on not so much for sleeping woke up sore, staff inattentive, walking distance to NGA, parking was a bit confusing. Decor was nice, lots of stairs. No in-house options that we where told of~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471235098~“A travelers' hotel that offers good value...”~This is a travelers' hotel in a recently renovated older building. it is on three levels with two wings and longish corridors. There are no elevators. Parking is not undercover and is difficult to locate on on the first visit, despite the use of GPS mapping. Some thought as to the adequacy of the address given for the Hotel is warranted. Rooms and bathrooms are small. They are simply decorated and clean neat and tidy. The daily servicing of them is good and the toiletries provided are of good quality. There are limited dining facilities available and guests are offered the facilities of the adjacent hotels, Realm and the Burbury, like he Brassey, they are members of the Doma Group.  Wi-fi is excellent and staff, all attractive and smart young people, are most attentive and helpful. Should the occasion warrant, we would use the Brassey again.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471223601~“Comfortable bed”~With Canberra buzzing with lots of visiting diplomats it was difficult to obtain a room anywhere for under $300 a night. We were able to secure a standard queen room for approx $250. For that price we had a tiny dark room with an semi renovated bathroom. The only windows were so high you couldn't reach them. That being said, the bed was very comfortable and the room very quiet. The staff friendly and helpful. Not having a restaurant or bar is also another reason we thought the price was a little high for what was on offer.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470992326~“Stayed here for 2 nights”~Was very disappointed in hotel. Travelling with a disabled person. Walk from carpark to room is very long by time husband got to room he could hardy breath. Site says restaurant but doesn't say u have to walk to the next block to another hotel to get any sort of meals. On day 2 I was told there were some take away meals in fidge in lounge Would have been nice to know this when arrived as did ask the reception and they didn't mention. Breakfast was an issue again. Was told by reception that restaurant in next bloc had takeaway breakfast. When I went there they said no such thing available. wont be staying her again. It is also not easy to get to~3~nan~2~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_470187550~“Great location, enjoyable stay. Value for money. Staff extremely friendly and helpful.”~We recently went to Canberra for the Versailles Exhibition. The Brassey hotel was great value for money as the package included tickets to the exhibition, breakfast, parking, a small bottle of Moet and a plate of macaroons! We went with another couple and made good use of a small lounge area to enjoy our drinks and nibbles. This hotel has excellent restaurants across the road and is within walking distance to the Kingston waterfront precinct.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469934125~“Central and comfortable”~We opted for a Superior Room for $20 extra and it was worth it - much more space. Friendly staff, but shame there isn't a restaurant onsite. But its central for the sights, and not far from Kingston where there are lots of eateries.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469237459~“Quiet hotel”~Had a comfortable stay at this hotel. Quiet room & very comfortable bed. There's a Nespresso machine in Foyer to use anytime which is nice. Staff very friendly and accomodating. Only complaint was housekeeping not leaving clean flannel or enough soap. We had to ask at desk.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468969160~“canberra”~The Hotel is a beautiful building in a great area, nice restaurants in walking distance and the Parlement House just up the road. Very friendly staff , daily room service, we stayed in a standard room with full en-suite, very comfortable bed, all in all we had a perfect long weekend at the Brassey Hotel in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468687291~“Charming hotel but ...”~The hotel is very charming inside and outside. The room was adequate but two negatives. One: the hot water takes quite a while to heat up. Very wasteful of the water gushing down the drain. Two: It would be nice to be able to open windows to enjoy natural ventilation just once in a hotel without being plagued by insects. This hotel is located in the suburbs so it's a pity one can't do that in such a quiet neighbourhood. So had to rely on the aircon which rattled so.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468632762~“Great location, wonderful staff”~The Brassey is located in Barton which is on the airport side of the City. You can walk to Lake Burley Griffin and a great foreshore development with pubs, cafes, and restaurants. Opposite the Brassey is also a great cafe called the Maple and Clove that prepare amazing brekfasts.  Checkin was seemless,,the staff very attentive. Our room was clean, airy and very large however there were three of us. We were on the 3 rd floor - there is no lift. That didn't bother us. Parking available however the car park is small and its first in best dressed during the week. There is public carpark at the back of the hotel which is timed during the week but again on weekends no limit. All in all we really enjoyed the Brassey and will stay again when we return to Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468443501~“Convenient location but still under renovations”~Stayed four nights in this old style hotel that is currently going through refurbishment. Room was large but poorly lit. King size bed comfortable. Daily room servicing was haphazard with poor attention to detail. Separate alcove area with small desk and wardrobe, but not suitable for doing any business/office work. Bathroom lacked sufficient lighting. Hallways are narrow, and dark. The ground floor has several levels so there are steps to negotiate. Likewise the upper level is accessed via narrow staircase. Parking is 'free' but not secure. Limited car spaces are available so the overflow is via a nearby public car park with a 2hr limit during business hours. Breakfast whilst offered during online booking, and at check-in is not located in the hotel so it requires you to leave the hotel and walk to another hotel in the Realm precinct. Front desk reversed my online breakfast booking without any problems, as moving to another hotel for breakfast on a business schedule, just too inconvenient. Check-in staff friendly, with some familiar faces from other Doma Group hotels. Good central access to Parliamentary triangle and Manuka.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_467749622~“Refined place”~The Brassey hotel is beautifully appointed in old world style set in a country garden setting. Rooms are spacious and staff most attentive and helpful. The downside is no lift so it could be a little trying if you are in a room on the top floor (which is 3 floors up) with heavy luggage. There is also no restaurant on site and you need to cross over to the nearby hotel complex for a meal. Plenty of restaurant choices and you can charge back to the hotel but I found it a little inconvenient in the mornings racing between the cafe and the hotel prior to a busy schedule. Overall though, a very pleasant experience!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467406609~“Very comfortable ”~We were only two nights in Canberra and very much enjoyed our stay here at the Brassey Hotel, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was nice and clean with great wifi and good shower. The staff were always very friendly too, so what more could you ask for! Ohh and this is also very Centrally located To everything!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466710484~“I'll give it 3.5 instead of 4”~We often stay at Brassey Hotel when we travel to Canberra. Each time we have stayed there have been changes - mostly good. This stay was a little disappointing. The rooms are always lovely and the beds are just so comfy - but the showers lacked hot water and water pressure. Our room did overlook a construction site but that will change. Our room was rather noisey - we could hear the fellow upstairs visiting the toilet all night and the discussions held next door. We've never had that before. Yes we will return to Brassey Hotel as it is a small and friendly place to stay but I do hope there won't be too many more changes.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466407855~“Old World Charm”~If you like the old style decor with old fashioned service well then this is the place for you. I stayed here with a friend for 2 nights back in January. The rooms were very spacious and the amenities were good.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_465199928~“Beautiful”~Room was very clean, decor was stylishly dated, gym looks fantastic. Absolutely loved the toilet, no elevators so might be difficult for elderly or those with prams. Staff seemed friendly enough, was a lot of construction going on at the moment so expect some noise. Easy parking and relatively close to the city.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_463871097~“Good Location”~Friendly staff that were helpful on information to get to eateries which are hidden away, to various tourist sites such as th Australian War museum, the Mint, parliament house and back to city centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462855060~“Few days away”~We booked here for two people the room was clean and even though construction was being done at the hotel it was still comfortable. Considering we booked for two people it would have been nice to have two chairs in the room and a little table to eat at as we had to eat on the bed. There is no toaster or microwave in the room and no elevators so you have to climb stairs ok for us not sure on elderly people. Not sure if they had wheelchair access over all pleasant stay. Very close to all site seeing places great location.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461882674~“All Show No Go”~I stayed at the Brassey Hotel for one night with something like a 40% discount. My comments take into account that pricing. The Brassey is for you if you like; 1) Hotels that look great from the outside and have a gym. 2) Quits and then a sheet on beds so on hot nights it’s all or nothing. 3) Noisy air conditioning 3 meters away and aimed at you bed. 4) Large rooms with a table and four chairs and not much else. 5) Small bathrooms with nowhere to put anything. 6) Showers that it is hard to get wet in. 7) Nice coffee available at no charge in the foyer. It is not for you if you don’t like; 1) Construction (which is currently happening in at least one wing and the foyer). Although I admit my room was not near the work.  2) Hotels that aren’t near anything. 3) Ringing a hotel to make sure your room is available and getting no answer, just ringing out. 4) Commenting on the phones and being told it should have diverted to a message and that they were busy.  5) Parking in the street because the available car parks are full and or construction sites or too far out the back. 6) Staying in another overpriced Canberra hotel.~2~3~2~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_461828489~“Modern, comfortable stay”~Stayed for the weekend - we got a great deal on the room and were impressed with how clean, spacious and comfortable the room was. The only issue was parking could be limited at times but that was due to the current renovations.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460535687~“Hidden Gem”~We visit Canberra a few times a year to view exhibitions, to catch up with friends or family members or to catch the plane or just passing through to other destinations. We stay usually for two days. We recently discovered the Brassey Hotel situated near our desired spots of interest, nestled in the green peaceful area. This hotel has no restaurant no breakfast room. This suits us, as we are not fond of buffet breakfasts and noisy travellers. What it offers is an excellent gymnasium, spa and massage resort style, and bicycles for whole family. The hotel is near the lake and all the lovely cycle paths. The rooms are of reasonable size, have an excellent beds, nice soft pillows, and tastefull carpet, small empty fridge and cupboard with plates, cups and kettle. It has a clean bathroom some still in 1930 style. We like the small size of the hotel and it's perfect location. It is also surrounded by nice restaurants. Buvette Bistro is our favourite.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459958368~“Comfortable & Newly Refurbished”~Arrived with some trepidation at Brassey Hotel, as I remember this place from many years ago when it seemed run down. Quite a surprise as it's been refurbished and there is still some residual work being completed in and around the hotel currently and the workmen are onsite from 7am. Clean rooms with comfortable beds, slightly stuffy even with aircon but hey you can open the window and Canberra is experiencing strangely unusual hot weather. There is a brand new, well equipped gym and this will appeal to executives and business people. Slight hiccups with the toilet appearing to need 15 minutes to complete the fill cycle, but a word with reception seems to have solved this issue. Maybe the cleaning staff could have removed the dead spider next to the toilet after the third day but we are now great friends as I know I will not get attacked. Reasonable, clean and friendly. Close to Kingston, walking distance to the new rejuvenated Foreshore Area and the attractions of Parliament House.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_459514833~“Will be fantastic when the renovations are finished”~We were given an upgrade which was really nice, huge room, separate dressing room and of course bathroom with kingsize bed. It made the flat screen TV seem rather small but then again, we weren't expecting a home theatre! The bathroom could have done with a good clean, there was soap scum on the tiles near the shower head and the grouting on the bath line and above was pretty grubby. The cups left for our use were also a bit grimy, some attention to detail lets the place down but then again, when it is all fixed up it will probably be out of our price range! It was a lovely nice quiet place even whilst renovations are taking place around you.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459473567~“Great Stay”~It is a Great place to stay, location was great and the beds were amazing. Car parking was hard with the current renovations but we got under cover parking across the road for free. All staff were fantastic.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458971635~“A fab stay”~We had the kids with us this time and booked a family room. They went all out! The kids had their own room adjoining ours with bunk beds made up with special linen, toys and little table in room! Beautiful!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457984685~“Nice Stay”~Stayed at the Brassey in a superior room. Large spacious room, fully refurbished. Bed was very comfortable. The room was lovely and clean and also very quiet. Nice touches in the sitting areas of newspapers., fruit and coffee machine.  The reception staff member Dani, was so lovely and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The is alot of workmen at the moment due to the refurbishment but will be amazing once it is completed.  The carpark is a bit small expecially that some of the workmen were parking there. This was our first visit here and we would definitely stay here again. Overall a nice stay.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457649366~“Ok but attention to detail lacking ”~Quick overnight work stay means you are often a relaxed about the little things. The hotel is a old remodeled building which makes it a little quirky. My room was spacious and comfortable and bed was good. The issue was the attention to detail. Dirty marks on the wall in the bathroom, TV that would not work and a old window that had been stuffed with toilet paper to fill a draft. Just undid the overall feel and proves the importance of housekeeping I would most likely shop around next time I am in Canberra.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457529614~“A reliable choice ”~Have stayed here many times over the years. Undergoing renovations but this didn't disturb us. We were there for only one night. Good clean room and comfortable bed. We thought the bed might be a bit soft but had a good nights sleep. Room was nice and dark. Fridge in room. Coffee machine in reception free. Restaurants nearby and off street parking if your lucky. Overall a safe choice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457494668~“Value for money accommodation, however...”~Our recent stay at the Brassey Hotel was hit and miss. The staff were very helpful and overall we had a good experience. However, on our first night the A/C in our room didn't work properly and we could not get to sleep - not only did it not cool the room sufficiently it was very noisy! Fortunately we were able to move to another room for the next two nights of our stay. The staff did everything they could to rectify the situation. On a positive note, the beds are really comfortable and once we moved to a room with a new A/C unit, our stay was very nice.~3~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456551129~“Renovated, quiet, great staff”~Upgraded superior room was quite large, quiet and very acceptable. Great bed, had a desk and a small refrig. Staff very friendly and helpful. Refurbishment supposedly completed early March so can be noisy during working hours. Open car park may be too small when all units let. No eating areas currently - if breakfast required, need to go outside to associated hotel. Gym being completed.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456327053~“Careful renovations”~I booked a room here for a business trip. I was extremely disappointed as most rooms have bulldozers positions outside their windows. I moved rooms three times but still was not happy. I do have to give a special mention to one of the reception staff members, David, who was very helpful moving me around the different rooms and then solved the problem by arranging for me to move to a sister property. So thanks to David.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_454375393~“Disappointed at new ownership/refurb”~Sullen reception staff. Original room overlooked construction site.Alternative room better but discovered too late that there was no antenna connection cable for the TV. Took more than an hour for the 'maintenance man' to arrive and fix. No shower gel in the container. The place has lost its character and charm with the refurb. Dining room gone and replaced with a gym, for God's sake! Used be our favourite Canberra hotel. No longer. Email to the boss unanswered!.~2~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan

review_451550237~“Plenty of character”~This is an "old" hotel with plenty of character. Some refurbishment is underway. The rooms are large, with large beds and the bathroom is more than adequate. The air conditioner wasn't fantastic though. The hotel is close to good restaurants and the shopping area is only a 5-10 minute walk. Car parking space seems to be limited, but where else in Canberra could you drive out of the car park and see a kangaroo bounding down the road?~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_450315384~“Great room”~What a wonderful night we had at the Brassy hotel. It was just a one night stay in Canberra, but I was pleasantly surprised at this gem of a hotel. Apparently the building is about 90 years old, and it looks beautiful. The inside has been totally renovated and is very nice. Our room was very large, with a king size bed and a roll-away for our son. Great bed and great bedding made for an excellent nights sleep! We got some take away kabobs from a great place about 5 minutes drive away and ate them on the picnic tables located in the front yard of the hotel. Very relaxing, beautiful stay at the Brassy.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_450045354~“An Easy stay!”~We stayed two nights at the newly refurbished Brassey hotel. Bed was king size and comfortable. A large room with en suite and well appointed. Hotel is in Barton and very close by car to the local shopping center and places to eat. Easy car parkng out front or at rear.  Hotel charges a surcharge for mastercard use, which I was not happy about! A/C in the room turned off during the night and we roasted until it was corrected. There is no lift and we were allocated a third floor room which was a challenge.Keep this in mind if you are booking here. The front carpark was used as a work area for recent renovations and many pieces of scrap metal were lying about. I picked up one in my tyre which I had removed.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_449122364~“Charming older style property”~Situated close to Parliament House in a leafy green suburb this hotel is a remnant of an older time. The room was spacious, very clean and tidy, and the king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side, and the water ran hot and cold in the small shower, but for those with a sense of nostalgia that won't matter. However, no lifts so a bit of walking required.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449056002~“Beautiful, stunning hotel - fantastic experience, only minor room for improvement.”~I stayed here for 2 nights as part of a 'mystery flight' package that was planned and organised by my best friend.  Upon arrival, my room was unfortunately not ready (after 2pm), however reception was fantastic and provided another room on the spot, so I would not have to wait for my room to be prepared.  I stayed in a standard room, which had a double bed (the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!). A TV with limited foxtel and all free to air channels were included. The EPG on the TV did not match some of the channels programmed into the TV - for example. the EPG said in-house movies were available, however when you selected this channel it was a sporting channel. It didn't sour the experience for me too much, but is something worth fixing for the pleasure of guests.  Bathroom was beautiful - toilet, shower and vanity included. A heater is also installed above the door in the bathroom - great for winter. Iron, ironing board and coat hangers are also included.  In terms of communal hangouts, they are in the process of building a gym and a spa. Until that is complete, there is a little lounge room next to reception that has tea, coffee, magazines and couches. Other than that, you are pretty much limited to your own room.  In terms of walking distance, the hotel is a 25 min walk from Flinders Way, which has Maccas, Subway, Coles, Grilld, other restaurants, some bars/pubs, newsagent, Westpac and some basic shops and facilities. Parliament House, Old Parliament House, National Gallery of Australia and High Court are all within walking distance of the hotel. However, if you want to go to Canberra City or the museum, you will need to hire an uber or a hire car as these are at least an hour walk from the hotel. All in all - a fantastic experience. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting luxurious accomodation for a very reasonable price.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_447709841~“Beautiful but ...”~Brassey is a beautiful hotel in a great location and with friendly staff. Our room was very clean but the fresh air fan in the toilet was broken and the bath tub was stained. We were charged $30 for an additional bed although they new that we reserved the room for three people.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447426862~“Friendly staff and good location”~Helpful staff and convenient location in the heart of Canberra! So calm and relaxing environment. Complimentary coffee, tea and filtered water were available at reception. It is a nice gesture as nothing is complimentary in Australia! Room cleanliness should be improved.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_446605877~“Good location & price”~Location is very good and convenient price. Room cleanliness wasn't good! Especially around the corners in bathroom! We reported the room condition but never heard back! Receptionists were friendly and gave us some tips around Canberra! If cleanliness was better, experience would have been amazing..~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_445454682~“Classey Brassey”~Loved this updated bygone era hotel. Great value. Walking distance to some very good restaurants. The best hotel bed I have ever slept on. I'm looking to purchase the same pillows they use. Staff friendly and efficient. Free wifi. The hotel needs to install an elevator for older guests. Lovely quiet location. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_445454502~“Our First Brassey Experience”~Enjoyed our recent stay at Brassey Hotel in Canberra. Very friendly and helpful staff. Large well-appointed room. Potentially noisy patrons kept very quiet by hotel staff and management - much to our relief!~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445428389~“Welcoming and Comfortable”~We have stayed at Brassey House before and chose to return because the staff are so friendly and the rooms are spacious, clean and the bed large and very comfortable. It is in easy walking distance of the Kingston Shops with bars and restaurants and the Kingston Foreshore, the "New Place to be seen" All in all a delightful stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445366581~“December Holiday”~Centraly located to tourist atttractions with in the Canberra area(New and Old Parliment House and War Memorial) and within walking distance to Kingston and Maluka Dining areas.Room appointments suit the style of dwelling.

Recently renovated, day spa is still not finished but Gym is and will be ope soon I believeOnce the grounds are finished this will be a truly great place.

review_444776721~“Great location and price”~This is in a fantastic, quiet, location, close to great restaurants and Kingston shops. Great staff, really helpful and friendly. We got the room at a great rate with free parking and wifi . Comfy bed. No bar but good bars very nearby. Didn't seem to have a restaurant either. Don't real negatives to say about this place. Would definitely stay again if the price is right.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444776512~“A renovated part of Canberra's history”~Good value hotel BUT since being updated there is no restaurant on site and guests need to cross the road to Hotel Realm. A slight inconvenience....the staff is helpful and happy. The old restaurant space is going to be a gym. I'd rather have the dining facilities!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443969159~“Convenience and comfort”~Despite the renovations afoot, the welcome was warm, the rooms spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room was on the first floor which required a walk up some carpeted stairs, which might be not to the liking of more elderly visitors. However the room was very quiet and views were across gardens to treed carpark behind. Position allowed for comfortable walking distance to Parliament House and foreshore area. To the SW there was a small but useful group of shops as well. Brassey is part of a complex of hotels and use of the neighbouring facilities pool and gym was reciprocal. It was also possible to charge meals at the other locations back to our room.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_443207457~“Great locale lovely facade”~Staff were polite,well informed and very helpful. Room good size,clean and nice soft decor (good for relaxing). Location ideal for cbd business. Short walk to Manuka village for eating out & wonderful variety choice wise. Loved everything except carpark which was to the side or at the back of main entrance.They were doing renovations when we're there but this didn't deter from our visit.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_442838668~“Great staff, accom average but clean and tidy”~Great staff, accom average but clean and tidy. Air con old and noisy. One window was openable but only by a few inches and other window was painted shut. Ironing board needs new cover. Staff were very helpful, accommodating and friendly they are your greatest asset. I liked the decor and large rooms. The refurbishing works were annoying and should have carried a larger discount.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442815968~“How disappointing!”~Having stayed at the Brassey many times in the past when visiting Canberra, we were dismayed this week to find how much it had changed. Gone were the comfortable environment, the friendly welcome as well as the bar and dining room! When we asked where we would have breakfast we were given a map indicating a 5 star hotel over a block away! As for having a quiet drink, we were informed we could buy a bottle of wine or beer at the reception desk! While there had been a great deal of renovation, the atmosphere was cold and clinical. We will not be returning!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442806502~“Quaint Hotel”~Refurbished hostel in the Parliamentary triangle which has been refurbished into a very comfortable hotel under the Doma Group. The room I occupied was very spacious, clean and quiet.  Only downside no restaurant at the premises but there Are many across the road~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442687988~“Small Boutique charmer”~Positives - Parking - it's free. By memory the only free parking I've had in Canberra.  Location - Small old Work country charm only ten minutes drive from Canberra Civic. Only short walk to Kingston shops and shirt drive to the foreshore.  Rooms - large rooms with all the bells and whistles required. Big enough for two people on an overnights or two.  Reception - friendly and helpful. Good work Little National.  Negatives  No gym. A negative was no kitchen or restaurant but it was under construction and renovation. Looking forward to see after completed to add to the atmosphere. Not a large hotel but more of a little modern country charmer.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442264385~“Just right”~I made an excellent choice for a change. Receptionist. David was the perfect man for the job. Nothing was a trouble. with a big smile. Rooms were good and bed very soft. even I slept in a single bed ad upstairs was too hard Given the upgrade option but. Said no thanks Food at the Reams was excellent. What a great combination of the 4 hotels all working together~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_441824505~“Outdated and poky room”~Booked this hotel 6mths in advance for a wedding in Canberra. Other family members booked one month in advance and got a larger room and nicer outlook. Our room was tiny we were unable to open doors with our suitcase on the luggage stand. When asked front reception about the disparity in rooms she stated just the luck of the draw. This seems to be a very unfair system especially since we were staying three nights in a very cramped room. The room was on ground floor facing building renovations. Cleanliness was poor . Asked cleaning staff to change duvet as a large stain on it .Came home thinking it was changed discovered when vacating the room the staff had mearly turned the duvet upside down to conceal the stain. Also we had to ask for towels to be changed. The front foyer was full of dust on tabletops and floor behing coffee machine. I realise renovations are in place but even so vacuaming up dust should be a priority. I expected being an older hotel a nice big comfy lounge room with fireplace where our family could gather. This did not exist. Front staff were helpful but there was no access to a photocopier which I thought would be basic for a 4 star hotel. I am sorry I recommended this hotel to my three other family couples.~2~nan~5~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_441250801~“Hidden Gem”~Overall a comfortable hotel downside was the staff not very helpful or informative, we arrived and found major renovations ongoing so car parking space VERY limited. Hotel has no dining facilities or a bar - when we asked given vague directions to a "sister"hotel for food and drinks~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439576471~“Second time ”~Second time staying here, fantastic again great location as only takes between 5 to 10 to get to city or Queanbeyan near manika which is a great cafe spot to eat at  Room was great although had a musky smell but ok, I love the beds and the king size pillows. Tv was only normal Tv they are Also renovating at the moment so should be good changes~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439370445~“Short break at The Brassey.”~Most comfortably furnished room was marvellous to return to after a day visiting Canberra's attractions. Luxurious feather ? bed was perfect for a good night's rest. Large lounge chairs meant relaxed television viewing.  Fresh apples in room appreciated upon arrival. Most welcoming staff; efficient online check in as well as at hotel. All staff friendly and pleasant. Rooms immaculately clean. A good holiday.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_439333466~“DOMA? REALLY?”~This is a budget hotel. When you view it as such then you will be satisfied. It has no correlation to the other Doma hotels in standard. Which are usually very good. Rooms large but dated. No bar, cafe or restaurant on site. Your room doesn't even have a mini bar - just a few tea bags and a kettle. Bed is hard and air conditioner the loudest and I've encountered. Plus its positioned above the bed, hovering over your head. If you want old world charm, go to The Kurrujong.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_439177492~“Cold Shower”~When travelling for business I have (I think) pretty simple needs - clean, comfortable bed, adequate air conditioning and a decent pressure in the shower. The Brassey doesn't stack up for me. I'll start with the positives - generously sized room, old world charm, moderate prices, good location and parking. Unfortunately these are outweighed by uncomfortable bed (pushed together singles that didn't quite meet), stale smell in the room, very noisy old air conditioning unit, and the worst part - a cold shower.  As mentioned by others plumbing seems to be an issue here - hot water only gave me warm trickle until my room neighbour decided to use water then that became cold dribble. I trust this will be addressed as part of the renovations.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439147950~“Gorgeous atmosphere but short on practicality”~The hotel has preserved its old world charm but our stay would have been greatly enhanced by modern conveniences like hooks on the back of the ensiute door, more shelf space in the ensuite and stronger wifi (very weak in #378).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438606392~“Quiet and comfortable, and great value”~An older style hotel in a newly developed precinct, this offers a nice balance to your stay. The rooms are comfortably furbished - with the same amazing beds as sister Domo hotels nearby, the staff professional and friendly, and only 100m to a number of cafes, restaurants and bars. It's also often better value for money than it's neighbors - possibly due to being alongside several new, modern-styled hotels. No real need for onsite breakfast - the options around it a varied, close and good quality.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_438427339~“Nice hotel in great location ( for me )”~An older style hotel (originally I think a Government hostel for staff visiting Canberra )-I found this hotel very comfortable. Within an easy walk to Kingston and Manuka it is ideally positioned for what I wanted to do in Canberra. My room was large by today's standards and the bed very comfortable. Free wifi is good,but I found it a little slow. The only other minor negative I can think of is that the plumbing is a bit noisy-but in a heritage hotel such as this-not a big deal.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_438148519~“The Brassey Ccanberra”~The reception staff were very professional and helpful. Hotel very clean, quiet location. It will be good when all the restorations are complete. A bit disappointing that you had no access to breakfast on the premises~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434941771~“Family Friendly Accommodation”~We stay at this hotel after getting a great deal on Facebook, one nights Accommodation in a family room 2 bedrooms, main bedroom had a king size bed very comfortable with the second room bunk beds for the kids with beanbags and their own little mini bar with juice box, lollies and popcorn they loved it, there own TV to watch what they want!  Breakfast was also included as well as hot chocolate voucher for the kids and a bottle of wine for the adults. The hotel is currently going through a refurbishment but we found staying in a weekend there was no noise it was fine. So I would recommend it great value for what we paid and what we got.  The only thing is the B'fast was in another hotel at the end of street so if you don't mind walking 3 mins there and back it's fine, bfast was great the perfect buffet with all the trimmings you would expect.  The staff were very pleasant and very accommodating. This hotel is very close all major tourist attractions at a short drive also. Also they offer bike hire for adults and kids at only $1.70 an hour so if you like that sort of thing it's great too.  Great stay under refurbishment!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434135021~“Old World Charm Still Charming”~Stayed with my wife there in late October 2016. Room was expansive and had a kingside bed which was very comfortable. Decent size room and bathroom and only complaint the shower recess was only curtained off. Room appeared to be centrally heated which made for a very comfortable stay. No hesitation in staying there again.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_433713538~“An historical government hostel”~Wow, two windows that opened to parklands, birds, morning sunshine and Canberra in the Spring, and without the roar of traffic! Comfy feather-down bed and pillows to sink deeply into, outstanding. Large room, pressed ceilings, classic grey-black decor - interesting. Might have been a lift somewhere, but guests were left to haul luggage up stairs, so probably the upper floors are not for the arthritic. WiFi working. Undergoing renovations while I was there so the rates was excellent. Parking was 'complimentary first in', & competitive against the tradies preparing the gym apparently, otherwise Wilson's Parking, Everywhere. No dining room - breakfast at an affiliated hotel, which I didn't pursue - & not much choice within walking distance, but Manuka and Kingston shops a short drive away. Take walking shoes - some gorgeous original 1920s house and gardens, and the lake itself, are nearby.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433440104~“Good hotel”~My heart skipped when we arrived as the hotel looked rundown (we arrived through the back of the hotel) and obviously going through renovations. Our stay being the weekend, noise was not an issue, pheww! Room was not big but comfortable & clean, bed a bit too soft for our liking, and the bathroom seriously lacked shelving space. ALL staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. A big thumb up on the bicycles available to patrons at a very cheap rate, a great way to discover the many cycling tracks Canberra has on offer. Overall a good hotel with no fuss. We will come back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433438798~“Old charm elegance”~Great location and close to CBD. Very clean and spacious rooms. Staff couldn't do enough. Only thing we found confusing was finding the reception as the hotel is currently undertaking some renovations. Looking forward to using this hotel again but will check when the renovations are to be completed as I think it would be a different experience again.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_432023856~“Overall Great Experience ”~The hotel is in a fantasric location; close to the CBD but in a nice suburbian area. It was a great room, very clean and spacious with a nice tv. The shower flow was good (though it took a little while to heat up), and the bed was comfy. However, the walls are a little thin so you can hear the noise from surrounding rooms, and the gym which was in the pictures were still being built which was disappointing as this was one of the reasons I chose this hotel. Overall, still a good experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430721771~“A lovely stay”~I was able to book my stay through booking.com easily. Though it failed to mention that the hotel was undergoing some renovations. The work being done however was of minimal disruption to my relaxation and the workers finished up before 5. The staff that I encountered were all very nice and welcoming with a warmth that is rarely found these days. The room was sufficient to my needs with a very large comfortable bed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429910722~“Good location - renovations will be great once completed”~Another business trip, another overnight stay in a hotel because flight times in and out of Canberra suck. As the business was in Barton, the Brassey was available even though there were a lot of things on. I hadn't been to the Brassey in years, and was pleasantly surprised with the renovation work going on. It's obviously still an old building, but where the renovations are complete, it's really quite nice. There was some trouble with the lock on the door of my room but it was quickly fixed. The room was quiet, clean (and cold, but it is Canberra!) If I were to stay again, I would prefer it once the renovations are done, but before then I would be perfectly happy to stay there if nearby hotels are busy again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_428547312~“Great Location - nice, neat & clean”~Brassey Hotel is just a hop from Capital Hill, so close to everything, 3.5km from the hub of the City Precinct, 5 minute walk to the Lake, 5 minutes from/to everywhere really. We enjoyed the clean quiet room, with a big comfortable bed. The staff were helpful and friendly. Overall a great stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428335597~“Comfortable stay with very good service from staff”~Stayed at hotel for the long weekend in October. Purpose of trip was to attend Tango in the Spring which is held every second year. We were able to check-in to our room a little earlier which was nice and stayed in room 243. The room was very spacious and faced out over the main entry and was located above reception. Bathroom was clean with hot water available with good water pressure. Renovations were undergoing to the gym and spa center but we didn't hear any of the work that was going on. Hotel is located in the precinct which included some very good eateries - Maple+Clove, Chairman and Yip, Ostani and Buvette, with all these only 200m from the hotel. There's parking available but it was limited due to the renovations taking place. Hotel was only about a 30 minute walk to Floriade and about a 15-20min walk to Old Parliament House. There's also seating areas at the landings between floors which look out through big bay windows and small balconies if you want to read outside - it was cold and wet during our stay apart from 1 day. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we had our friends also staying at the hotel. There's no restaurant in the hotel and there's a Nespresso machine in the reception area free of charge.~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
