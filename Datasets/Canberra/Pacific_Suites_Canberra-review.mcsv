review_478244768~“Good location, unfriendly welcome”~We stayed at the Pacific Suites for 5 nights whilst visiting our daughter at uni. We had advised the hotel that we would not be arriving until about 23:45. The welcome on our arrival however was not very friendly. The first thing the man behind reception said was 'credit card' not 'hello'! My husband had left his wallet in the car parked just outside so returned to car to get his wallet. The man behind reception then said 'Don't worry I'll use the one we've got on file' (from our booking I assume). He didn't wait for my husband to return. I asked if we could just leave cases in reception whilst we moved the car. The man again was very curt and said 'Yes - you don't need to come back' ( I assume he meant to talk to him not to the hotel!). Not the most welcoming of receptions to Canberra. I mentioned his attitude to the front desk manager the next morning whose response was - 'he was probably tired' - that is no excuse - hospitality is their business! We had a one bed apartment which was on side of hotel. Good sized apartment but a bit dark! As we were staying for 4 days I think we could perhaps have been given a brighter apartment - we had to have light on in living area all the time. We did not complain though as didn't think we would get much joy. On the plus side the hotel is an easy 10 minute walk to the centre of Canberra and will be ideally located for the new tramway, once it is finished. Would I stay here again - yes I would - great location, clean, good sized apartment, most of the staff were very friendly.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478094580~“Good value and friendly”~Stayed 1 weekend night in a two bedroom apartment (2 adult couples). There is nothing fancy about this place but it works very well.  Check in was fast and friendly.  Apartment is fine nothing special but the essentials are there; comfortable queen beds, one had ensuite and everything worked. Our apartment faced Northbourne (the main road into Canberra) but nothing too intrusive on noise. Heard nothing from other rooms (Saturday night) which is great.  Had drinks in the bar with 2 for 1 vouchers (nice!); very friendly/helpful and complimentary hot chippies; a bit of an odd cocktail/beer accompaniment for us but great.  Walked to a central restaurant; plenty of choice about 10 minutes (seemed quite safe even late-ish at night) walk there and back.  Breakfast was OK; school holidays so very very busy. Standard fair (they need to get that coffee machine working better) but at $15 a head cooked buffet stuff, fruit, pastries etc good value and convenient. If you have more time maybe venture out to one of the many local cafes.  Parking is extra $10 per night and easy. Has a pool but I didn't use it.  And if you are planning on self catering maybe ask if they have cooking stuff because our apartment didn't. We didn't need it so no problem for us.  Check out fast and efficient. I'd definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_478078799~“Wedding accommodation”~We stayed here on the Saturday night of a wedding. The hotel was at 100% occupancy both Friday and Saturday nights so it was busy.  We had arranged early check-in and we were in our room a bit after midday.  The staff at the reception desk were very helpful in getting us in early, thank you. Lunch at The Alley was disappointing though. Maybe take the option of this being close to many cafe's and restaurants.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478058145~“Unreasonable”~Upon checking in I informed them that there were two occupants rather than the anticipated 4. It was quite obvious that we wouldn't be using the roll away bed that we had pre-booked and so placed it in the corner of the living room. Upon leaving after a week's stay I was informed that the extra bed would cost $45 per night. Apparently if I'd asked for it to be removed I would not have been charged. How about showing some initiative and asking at check-in if I still needed the extra bed? Failing that it would have been blatantly clear to room service that the bed was not being used - nor was one other regular bed in the suite! Considering that the room had been booked by my father who has Parkinson's (and was staying in another room) for a family holiday this left a sour taste in my mouth at the end of a holiday examining the delights of canberra. Please take some initiative and don't fleece customers!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477870281~“Family of five”~Nice apartment - excellent location, not far from cafes and restaurants. A 10 minute walk to the heart of the city. A new tram line is being built in front of the hotel & will make travel a breeze. Staff are helpful. The average score is for housekeeping services and the breakfast buffet. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477611375~“Great base for a Canberra visit”~We travelled for a couple of nights family visit. Checking was a bit slow - room wasn't ready. Once sorted, we had a great apartment which was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Central to dining options, a couple of blocks from the shopping centre, and close to all the attractions made it a great place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477565959~“Room was great but avoid the breakfast”~The room was lovely and it is in a great spot. The buffet breakfast was less than desirable though. You'd be better off enjoying one of the many cafes around Braddon as there are so many fantastic options on offer.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477557411~“Huge family suites , close to the city centre”~I was greeted by a pleasant staff member at reception and checked in, parking was an extra $10 per night, we collected our luggage from the car and used one of the two convenient lifts to make our way to our room.  The room was huge, we booked the two bedroom apartment, both rooms were big and had a bathroom each, the living area was also very large with plenty of space for everyone as well as a full-width balcony, ours overlooked the pool, the kitchen was well-appointed with everything required for cooking a meal. We, however, opted for the family meal deal wich are great value at $55 and will feed a family of 4 including desert, the buffet breakfast was also great value at $15 per person. The beds were not the worst I have encountered, but not the best either, the pillows were cheap and the beds sagged in the center, I wish Hotels would spend more money on the mattresses and pillows, that after all is the core function of a hotel .....sleep.  The bathrooms were well cleaned but offered only one product to do it all- soap-body wash-shampoo, the supplies, in general, were a little tight, if you plan to use the washing machine, take some powder, and you only get two goes at the dishwasher before you have used up your tablets. Overall this is a great place for a family to stay in Canberra, but management need to be a little less tight with the supplies and spend some money on new beds and pillows, because everything else is spot on.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476317980~“Wow! Really love this place”~We stayed in one of the "high rise two bed two ensuite" apartments. All I can say is "wow". Amazing apartment. Huge with great living areas, full kitchen and massive balcony. The staff have all without question been polite to the extreme. Very helpful and did I mention polite.  They had the 50% off breakfast buffet deal on. Good value for breakfast at $15/$8 (12 & under). But at $30 would be too expensive. Good buffet but no freshly cooked omlets etc. Parking spaces are a decent size for "normal" sized cars. None of the issues we had at the Novotel last year trying to fit the family car into a tiny spot.  Pool looks nice but not heated so after a *very* quick dip the kids abandoned that idea. Would love it if they had an outdoor spa for winter (hint hint) Happy hour(s) at the bar is really nice. Reasonable price on the drinks ($5) with complimentary hot chips.  Will definitely look at staying here again. My most enjoyable trip to Canberra yet.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_476279119~“Had everything we needed”~Recently stayed here as a family (2 adults, 2 children) for a week. Had a great apartment on the seventh floor with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Staff were very pleasant and fixed a blown light globe in one of the bedrooms very promptly. The room was serviced each day and we were very happy with the level of cleanliness. Parking was included and there was ample parking spread across three levels underneath the building. The free wifi was great but was occasionally a little slow. The Canberra centre and many other shops/restaurants were only a short walk away which made the location ideal as we didn't have to worry about city parking. The food served in the restaurant was high quality and we enjoyed the selection of options at the buffet breakfast. Our apartment had everything we needed for a week long stay with two young children so we would be more than happy to stay here again next time we are visiting Canberra.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476264835~“Amazing value in the heart of the CBD”~Travelling with kids 10-17, I booked a week here thru Agoda, but wasn't sure how it would be - turns out it's a real find. Huge two bedroom apartment, with kitchenette and washing machine and dryer - all near new, clean, and in great shape. The beds were clean and comfortable, and there was loads of space to move around, The location is just a block or so from all the main CBD shops, and there's underground parking below the building. The staff were wonderful - friendly, and competent, and always able to help out. Can't recommend this place highly enough. Thank you for a great stay!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476253369~“Pacific Suites Canberra”~The Hotel we great I loved it the rooms were large and very spacious Plenty of room to move and the veranda was fantastic. The pool was clean and very relaxing. The down stair bar and restaurant were excellent and the location was very central to everything. One of the best stays we have had in a very long time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475960942~“Easy walk to shops and restaurants”~It was a great apartment for 3 adult women for a girl's weekend to visit the Versailles exhibition. It had 3 beds and 2 bathrooms. The main bedroom was huge with an ensuite and an enormous walk-through wardrobe (not that we needed that for 3 days!). The second bedroom had two single beds but very comfy. There was a nice little kitchen which was good to make tea/coffee and a simple sandwich etc, with a full size fridge.  There was also a dining area adjacent to the kitchen and the lounge which looked on to the balcony. The lounge was comfortable.  The balcony was quite long and had a full size table and chairs. This was nice to sit and watch the sun go down over the mountain. We overlooked Northbourne Ave which tended to be noisy at night if you left the windows open.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_475707189~“Affordable and well placed close to city”~Reasonable close the city centre and accessible for recent visit for Canberra Time fun run.

review_475679696~“Modern accommodation ”~We stayed here for 3 nights and overall we enjoyed our stay, however there were just a few minor issues (although these would not impact decision to stay here again). The apartment was very spacious, modern & clean. It was serviced daily however there was one day when the bins (which are very small) were not emptied, dishwashing liquid & additional toilet rolls were not provided. The room was quiet throughout the day though you could hear some street/traffic noise at night. Room service was efficient, and the food was yummy. As originally stated, overall we were happy with our accommodation.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475454294~“2 Farmers go to Aus”~we loved the spacious, clean modern suite we had with Balcony. Even though the weather was cool & rainy we were warm & snug. We had a beautiful breakfast in the restaurant and appreciated the free parking for booking direct with the hotel (Tip) It was close to eating places and easy to walk to main bus station and shopping centre and next to petrol stations.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475160825~“Good for family visit”~Good location with affordable cost. Close to major attractions and restaurants. We booked 2 bedroom apartment and our kids enjoyed a lot during their stay.  During the booking via phone, staff from the hotel apartment booked in the wrong name and they didn't send booking confirmation once they called back one day before the booking date. It's good that we called again by ourselves and confirmed everything.  Checked in and checked out was smooth.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475129426~“Comfortable Stay and Close to Main Shopping District”~My wife and our son visited over the Canberra Day holiday weekend. When we checked in we were upgraded from a single bedroom to a double bedroom apartment on the second highest floor. The apartment was spacious, with two proper double beds (not two singles pushed together) and more space than we could use.  Overall presentation of apartment and building was really good, rooms were cleaned and furniture was comfortable and modern. A nice touch was the free WiFi and parking which is sometimes an extra charge. We noticed that breakfast was a buffet style and seems to be common in Canberra. The waitress who greeted us was so friendly and my son (10 month old) couldn't stop starring and smiling at her. The location to my surprise was walking distance to the main shopping district of Canberra including its dinning district. Other hotels we had considered would have been a short drive and it was the best price we could find so we were very pleased with choosing Pacific Suites for our stay.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474821266~“Canberra”~Booked into another hotel that turned out to not have disabled facilities......phoned Pacific who could not do enough to provide for our needs Very friendly staff, rooms are immaculate, full delicious breakfast supplied for $15! Convenient to everything Have a 3 night stay, lovely swimming pool, balcony with 4 chairs, washing machine and dryer supplied, full kitchen facilities. Lovely meals in the "Alley" restaurant  All staff greet you with a friendly smile!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474494818~“Great Location, Good size Apartment & Good Price too!!!”~We had 7 adults and booked two 2-bedrooms apartment for Friday night only with free undercover parking and free WiFi. Size of each apartment is large & comfortable with everything needed in your house. It is a short walk to the Civic with shops & restaurants. Half price buffet breakfast at $15 is good value. Our apartments located on 4th floor & the Northbourne Ave side so a bit of traffic noise overnight. We will stay again at our next visit to Canberra and would definitely recommend it for families.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473944397~“Good size apartments centrally located”~The Pacific Suite is ideally located along Northbourne Ave, just a few steps away from Lonsdale St, Braddon which is full of choices for dining. And it's also only a short walk to Civic with more restaurants and shops. They could do with an update with it's decor but what it really offers is great size apartments with everything needed, including washing machine/dryer. I was travelling solo for work but was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment, and all the rooms had heaps of space and a nice, bright outlook. There was a large flat screen tv in the living, and also the main bedroom. However, this one had problems with it's sound. My only contact with staff was with check-in and check-out so I can only say they were friendly and polite. I'm not sure I would return as I found the decor too simple and basic decor, and not crazy that soaps etc came as those refill bottles. However, I would definitely recommend it for families or 2x couples looking for a central place with room.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473656804~“A long stay made pleasant”~We were in Canberra for work and this place was our base for about three months. Only good things to say since the place was tidy, the rooms were large, the staff was very friendly and efficient and the location is great for the city center along with other interesting sites nearby. There is also a free city circle bus with stops right in front of the door on both sides of the building. Since this was not originally a hotel, the only two elevators do get crowded often but we did not find this to be much of an issue. Thank you and we hope to see you again soon!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_473518542~“Good sized room in a great location”~We were looking for a suite with two bedrooms and two bathrooms and booked the Pacific Suites. We were delighted with the rooms - a large kitchen diner, two good sized bedrooms (one with an ensuite bathroom) and a big balcony accessible from the main room and both bedrooms. The service was good and the location is excellent. Just a short walk from the central shopping and dining area of Canberra with the bonus of being just around the corner from Bentspoke Brewery (which we also discovered that weekend).~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_473470386~“Good but a few little things”~Family holiday, two adults three kids under 6. Location great. Room size good. On arrival, we got a room key and when we opened the door a big smell of smoke came out of the room. Called reception and they came up with a new room for us to use. Only other really issue was at night there seems to be a lot of outside noise getting in. I checked all the windows and side doors but still would hear a lot of traffic noise, lucky Canberra goes to sleep around 1PM. Staff was helpful, brought an extra rollaway bed (which is just a normal single bed) to the new room. Cleaning staff were helpful, and rooms were always clean.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473322719~“Great suite hotel, good staff, bed too hard”~I liked this hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The decor in the room was pleasant. The breakfast was both enjoyable and at a good price. The room service was a good meal. Unfortunately, the hotel has a few noisy neighbours at the moment. One night out of the three that I stayed there was light rail building work until 11pm. The bed was also harder than I like, which meant I didn't sleep well.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan

We stayed in a two bedroom apartment as we had a baby with us and like him to have his own room. The room was massive and modern!

review_471274976~“roger1278”~We were in Canberra for the Versailles exhibition & chose Pacific Suites for a 2 night stay. They were offering 2 Br apts at attractive prices. Whilst the room facilities were very good we were disappointed on 2 fronts. Firstly our friends all booked 1 Br apts & were upgraded at no extra cost to 2 Br apts in superior rooms to ours. Secondly there is significant building works at the front of the Hotel where our room was located & we experienced significant night noise despite a request for a quiet room. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast at discounted price - make sure you book the day before- and an evening meal was excellent value. When booking this facility take care to enquire about the room you have been allocated because they vary greatly in configuration & facilities.~3~5~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471209055~“Great location and value”~Had to visit Canberra for a couple of days and we chose Pacific Suites, what a great find, minutes walk from Lonsdale Street restaurants and the Canberra Centre shopping complex. We were upgraded from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom apartment. Room was well appointed with all you could ask for, albeit a little dated but very comfortable. Free wi-fi and movie channel, TV's in lounge and main bedroom and lounge has reverse cycle a/c. Restaurant prises are good and bar has a happy hour from 4.30 to 6.30 each night, with house beer, wine and spirits at $5 each, seems some locals have cottoned onto this, needless to say we took advantage of these prices. Package included car parking, two for one drink offer on arrival and complementary daily news paper. Front office staff were very efficient and happy to assist. Great deal for $357.20 for 2 nights. Highly recommended. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470223690~“Spacious and great location ”~We stayed in a two bedroom apartment. Like the other reviews say, these are really spacious, clean and the kitchen was well equipped. The balconies are a good size too. Hotel staff were helpful and efficient, WiFi worked well, and the TV included sports and movie channels. And the location is great, just round the corner from Braddon's cafés and bars and an easy 5-10 minute stroll to central Canberra. If you are visiting at the weekend with a car and don't want to pay extra for the parking, there were plenty of spaces out the back of the hotel where we parked for free.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We ate at the restaurant once on the day we arrived, food was nice. They have house keeping daily as well. Location is great, short walk to restaurants and there are quite a fews choose from. It took us about 8-10 mintues walking to Canberra centre, you can find Coles & Aldi, Cinema, Target, Myer and shops for your shopping there. We are quite happy with this place and will stay here again if we come back to Canberra in the future.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

It is close to the centre of Canberra and well within walking distance of some great shopping, bars and restaurants.

Has a nice bar with a patio, happy hour with $5 drinks and a 2 for 1 deal! What more could you want? Parking is reasonable at $10, and has a $15 breakfast buffet so it's a good deal all round.

review_467633464~“close to eateries, shops and city centre”~We booked this property over 6 months ago and had a few requests i.e room away from lifts, requested high floor on Mort Street side and not facing west. These requests were not guaranteed but were met for our 4 day stay early March along with free parking. Upon entering our room we encountered a terrible odour which we brought to the attention of reception. Housekeeping sprayed but the dreadful smell remained, we had to purchase a room deodoriser to cover it up. Was obviously some sort of greasy food that had been spilt and proper cleaning had not been carried out. There were at least 3 kitchen tiles that were broken, chipped away and sharp for bare feet. Housekeeping had missed 3 cigarette butts on the balcony that had been there for some time and as we are non smokers found this to be offensive. Bathroom very tired, shower over bath had a slippery surface and made getting out of shower very dangerous. Front loader washing machine did not work properly. And the worst thing of all, bed was way past it's use by date as there were very definite human indentations in the mattress making this bed possibly the worst we have ever slept in. Cannot comment on pool as weather was not suitable for swimming. Went to restaurant for breakfast one morning but walked out after surveying what was on offer. Although the staff were very pleasant and this property was handy to shops etc we would not be making a return visit.~3~nan~4~1~nan~nan~3~nan

Came to bike ride around Canberra and visit the tourist attractions. Were able to leave the bikes in the room. Had everything for a very comfortable stay, the kitchenette was very well equipped and the towels and room were cleaned every day. There was a pool and gym, everything an athlete would want to use. The bar/restaurant was very nice, didn't eat there but had a late night wine. This hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and pubs, so it is in a great spot close to stores and nightlife.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_467108706~“Enjoyed the stay”~The apartment was very clean and well maintained. Service was good. Staffs were very friendly and cordial. Plenty of parking but with $10 per night.

review_467102686~“Well designed apartments with privacy and quiet in mind”~I stayed with 2 teenagers, 17 & 18. The rooms were designed perfectly for peace and quiet. The 2 bedroom apartment was large with a fully equipped kitchen and spacious lounge area. The bedrooms perfectly placed either side of the living room so that when the kids stayed up to talk, I could not hear them at all. The rooms are clean and made up every day. location was central. The buffet breakfast was excellent value for guests at $15, the food was delicious and Nespresso coffee much appreciated.There was even a washer and dryer. I highly recommend a stay here. The only negative was that if my husband had come the bed would have been too soft and small for both of us.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466390081~“Nice apartments”~Upgraded to a two bedroom suite on arrival. Apartments are very nice, big kitchens, and huge bedrooms, plus two bathrooms. Living rooms are comfortable and the balconies are really big too, although just face the driveway opposite. There are some great restaurants within a block or two of the hotel, and is about a 10 or 15 minute walk from what looked to be the main shopping area.  Rooms nice and clean, beds are comfy, and TV has foxtel on it. Didnt use the pool as it was too cold, but it was a good sized pool. There is also a park just down the block.  This hotel would be great for families travelling to canberra, as the two bedroom suites are a great size, and very comfortable, you could easily stay there for a few days.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan

review_466194615~“Well located with good sized apartments”~Pacific Suites is well located in Braddon, close to nearby shops and cafes. I requested a quite room away from Northbourne Avenue so was placed on the Mort Street side. The apartment was reasonably quiet but I could still hear some minor traffic noise and I think dump trucks. Unfortunate that the windows are not double glazed. I was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment which was very spacious. The breakfast buffet was good value for $15 at the time I was staying. Overall I enjoyed my stay at Pacific Suites.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~4~nan
review_466173165~“Great location.”~We had a fantastic stay at Pacific Suites. Friendly staff, great breakfast, undercover parking, close to cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to city centre and some attractions. Room was cleaned daily and very spacious. Considering the hotel is on a main road our room wasn't noisy with the doors closed. Open you could hear traffic noise but we expected that. Bed was very comfortable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466162356~“Location and space”~There are 2 good reasons to choose this hotel, the first is location. The hotel is situated within 10 minutes walking distance of the main Canberra shopping centre and only a minutes walk away from local restaurants and bars. Also there are bus stops at the rear of the hotel that give access to bus transport that can take you to most of the big attractions, during our stay a day ticket was $9 so we could travel to and from venues for small cost. Secondly the hotel itself is clean, our room was clean, fairly quiet and spacious. It had a good sized fully equipped kitchen, a dining table and 6 chairs, a lounge area with a couch, 2 chairs and a TV. The bedrooms were quite large, one had an en-suite bathroom. We didn't hear internal noise at all but did notice that as the morning rush hour started the traffic noise was enough to be noticeable especially with the bedroom windows open. WIFI was free and provided speedy internet access. We tried the breakfast in the hotel but found that it was really busy, a little noisy and some items were not available. We had to wait for the coffee machine to be emptied, at one stage there were no plates and the cereals had run out. With shops so close to the hotel we bought our own breakfast items and ate breakfast in our room for the rest of our stay. I would definitely stay at the Pacific Suites again as access to the city centre and buses mean that hiring a car is not necessary. Families would find the rooms adequate in size and not feel crampt. The staff were pleasant and helpful.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466141658~“Clean and comfortable”~We booked into a two bedroom one bathroom apartment and on arrival we're pleased to be complimentary upgraded to a two bedroom and two bathroom suite. The apartment was spacious and clean with lots of little details which added to our overall comfort. Staff were very friendly and accommodating, will definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465496289~“Great place”~We were very happy with our recent stay in a 2 bed,2 bath apartment. It was perfect for several family members with plenty of space, well equipped kitchen, modern decor and well maintained. Lots of cafes and restaurants with walking distance, easy access to Canberra tourist spots.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465397547~“consulting in canberra”~Staff as always great. room great and appreciated a peaceful and pleasant stay whist working in Canberra. I enjoy the pool both morning before work and after work. The gym air conditioning was out of action and exercise bike required repair, otherwise gym ok.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465254338~“Great Accomadation”~My family and I stayed at Pacific Suites Canberra for a mini 2 day get away. Upon arrival and check in we received an upgrade to a bigger 2 bathroom room. We had room service for both nights and 2 mornings we had their buffet breakfast at the Bar and Grill Resturant and we were very happy with the quality of food for both. All the staff were so friendly and welcoming. We will defiantly come and stay again.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464943554~“Great location”~We had a 2 bed apartment. The apartment was very nice, very spacious and well appointed, although a little noisy at the front due to busy road outside. Front office staff were very nice and friendly. We had the buffet breakfast on our first morning and were disappointed. The hot food was cold, and there was a lack of plates and some food items. But they were busy, so hard to catch anyone to speak to them about it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464893512~“Great place to stay”~We had a two bedroom suite and it was very spacious with every amenity you would ever need. A lovely large balcony with a view. An excellent place to stay if you are visiting all the main attractions as close to most. Secure parking at a cost of $10. Many restaurants in the vicinity plus the Pacific has its own. To sum up, great location and I was more than happy with the comfort of the rooms. If I go to Canberra again I would definitely stay there. Particularly great for families.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464662884~“Not exotic, but did the job”~When you need some space for your family, and you want to be able to cook, then this place does the job. Kitchen had most of what we needed, including a dishwasher to ease the cleaning. But the floor tiles in the wet areas are of a different and unattractive era; the air conditioning is only in the main room so the bedrooms get hot; the bedding and couches have lost their comfort; and the bathroom feels old. The balcony is nice, and there is enough space. Location is convenient, but aren't most places in Canberra? So I would stay there again, but I would also look around.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464448143~“Super friendly staff”~We booked into this modern, well appointed accommodation to be greeted by very friendly staff. They couldn't do enough for us, so refreshing. We were upgraded to a 2 x queen bedroom & ensuite apartment with very spacious living area when I mentioned our party of 4 reduced to 3. My only criticism is the bathrooms require a bench area to house our toiletry bag. This well appointed apartment included a washing machine, dryer plus dishwasher & hidden refrigerator. Modern furniture & very clean. The balcony overlooked the swimming pool but be prepared for road noise. This place is situated on the main road into the city centre. The windows are well insulated as inside the apartment it wasn't too noisy.  We spent both evenings enjoying Happy Hour with complimentary hot fries then dined in the restaurant. A good range of food to choose from, fresh, interesting & well proportioned meals. Affordable price range. This place is situated a couple of blocks to Canberra city centre shopping area. An easy walk. It was raining the morning we went shopping so we had reception order a taxi. No fuss & the taxi arrived a couple of minutes later. There is undercover parking at an extra cost. You will have a comfortable stay here!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464371353~“Great Location, Good Value”~Only 10 minutes walk to city centre.  Spacious clean and good condition air conditioned apartment.  Free undercover parking.  Very good buffet breakfast normally $30 but only $15 during our stay.  A wide range of restaurants and cafes only minutes walk away.  Very good free wifi.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Highly recommended~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464020159~“Excellent apartments and location”~We visit Canberra regularly to visit relatives and the uni, and this is where we prefer to stay. The 2 bedroom apartments with 2 bathrooms are spacious and comfortable, with a balcony, some of which are large and have good views. The reception is efficient and friendly, easy inexpensive parking underneath, just a few blocks from Civic, a few pubs and cafes and restaurants nearby. The rates are reasonable too. So can highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_463915356~“Huge Apartment!”~We booked the two bedroom and two bathroom apartment which was huge and clean. This apartment could sleep up to 7 people. It had a big balcony, full kitchen, dining and lounge area, as well as a washing machine and dryer.  The hotel is in a good location, handy walking distance to restaurant and shops. If you book online, they throw in the parking for free.  The only little 'niggles' would be the noise from traffic as our apartment was overlooking the busy road outside. Also we didn't like that the master bedroom didn't have a lock or had the bath/shower combo instead of a separate shower. Another thing to note is that the airconditioning for the apartment, is in the lounge room area - so the bedroom doors need to be left open, to get any cooling or heating.  Overall, these are very small concerns and if you are wanting a big, clean apartment with kitchen and lounge room in a good location, then this is the place for you.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_463796083~“Very nice”~Nice accommodation, beds need to be upgraded to king size in larger rooms, tv needs to upgraded to a bigger size in the lounge room and a tv added to the bed room, over all very nice but a few little tweaks required, would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463051032~“Great”~We were four single women having a weekend away, this was the only place we could find where we could have four individual beds in two bedrooms. It was a good choice, spacious and clean in a good location. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463043813~“Great room and location”~spacious clean and tidy room. Balcony was a good size. Concierge were very friendly and helpful. Location is great.

review_462103179~“Great Hotel”~Great midweek stay here with family. two bedroom apartment was large and comfy. Everything we need was in the room. Very close to city and yet very quiet at night which was great. Staff were friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461851677~“Great hotel!”~Stayed for over a week, staff members are very friendly and helpful and hotel room is great. Location is close to the CBD and surrounding areas. Bathrooms weren't the best but that wouldn't stop me from staying here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461382067~“Good location, clean room, pretty good overall”~We were upgraded to a bigger room at check in which suited our toddler really well as he loves running around the large kitchen, dining area and connecting bedrooms. The bathroom is clean, the bed is nice and not much noise despite been on 4th floor and main road. The balcony is OK, not much view apart from the main road. TV had lots of channels. Cooking utensils are adequate and room is comfortable temperature wise. Breakfast is pretty average, not worth what we paid for. You'd be better off to just go around the corner where there's lots of nice cafes, restaurants and take aways. Location is great and parking was free. There are 2 lifts and it gets very busy during check out time. Overall, a very nice place to stay, would definitely book again.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_461239797~“Enjoying Canberra”~The 2 bedroom apartment, each with an en-suite, worked beautifully for our friends and ourselves. Coupled with a very large and airy open-plan kitchen and even larger living space, which opened onto a huge balcony area, the apartment exceeded our expectations. Each member of staff we met was delightfully helpful and friendly. The location is perfect - an enjoyable walk to the centre of town. We had stayed here when the Clifton and had been very happy with it, but the new owners the freshening up make this an even better facility - and the food there was great!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461053313~“No complaints about this hotel, would stay again!”~Our family trip with 4 adults was very comfortable in the 2 bedroom. 2 bathroom suite and our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer!! Well located in Canberra CBD with the free city bus stop well situated to help you get into the CBD proper very easily?~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460692164~“Great Apartment”~Well - what a great find!! We randomly booked this accommodation in Canberra not worrying over much as we were only there for one night. As we approached the location of the Pacific Suites we were a little concerned as the area seemed a bit rundown. However first impressions can be wrong for once we'd checked in and ventured out into the area and walked back from the highway we found ourselves amongst some pleasant eateries and pubs. Our actual accommodation was really good. We had a large, one bedroomed apartment. It was modern, clean, spacious and very well appointed. Such a bonus to have a washer and dryer. At the Pacific Suites there was also a restaurant which looked very nice although we didn't eat there. During our one day in Canberra we decided to walk to the city centre - a 15 minute stroll from the Pacific Suites. Very pleased to recommend this accommodation.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460314435~“Close to all amenities. Highly recommend!”~Loved our time here. Customer service was pretty good especially from Management. Got a free upgrade, absolutely stoked about. Could not fault the room at all. Massive, and catered for all family members. Pool was great. Good size, & close to our room. If you can, get room service. omg! bloody beautiful and worth the money. Quick service too. Would highly recommend staying here. Found this hotel quite central to everything. Thanks to the team & especially Management for making our stay and our first holiday in 8 years very enjoyable and memorable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459931040~“A very nice place to stay within walking distance to restaurants and shops”~We enjoyed our 2 nights at Pacific Suites in Canberra. We asked for an apartment at rear of building and higher up, to keep noise down from the main road. We were happy with our apartment which was quite large open plan kitchen, dining and lounge room with air conditioner. Many storage cupboards throughout the apartment. Laundry section in bathroom which was very good, bathroom good size as well as the bed room. A nice verandah. The apartment was very clean and well set out with all that one needs. We would recommend this apartment for others to stay and enjoy their time in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_459875727~“Great place to stay”~Rooms are very comfy and the two bedroom suites have heaps of room. Very clean and so close to the CBD - can walk there. Wish l found this place four years ago.

review_459580864~“Exceptional city centre touring base.”~We booked a 1 bedroom serviced apartment at a discount weekend rate that was great value for money and was everything we could have wished for. It was clean, well-maintained, modern, spacious and had comfortable furnishings. Best of all it had exceptional air-conditioning that we took full advantage of given that our visit coincided with a summer heatwave.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459346736~“Second stay and maybe last.”~I stayed in a 2 bdrm suite for 7 nights. As people have mentioned below there are so many things just not right here that need fixing. I also agree the aircon is not suitable for the whole unit,we had many very warm sleep interrupted nights. Our last stay was Oct so the aircon wasn't as big a deal then. Last visit and this visit we had to ring reception 3 times to have the Foxtel sport channel reset(obviouslt still an issue since Oct). One day the ensuite was not given new towels but the other room was fine. You would think a second tea towel would be provided over 7 nights,No. The dishwasher made glasses dirtier than when they went in, so we had to hand wash for the week. Location is fine,having wifi and u/cover park great as well,and the room is spacious. These are the reasons we returned. But the continued lack of upkeep of this hotel probably means this was our last stay.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~3~nan
review_459101912~“Home Away From Home”~Our family of three booked a two bedroom with one bath. At check in, the friendly desk clerk told us we'd been upgraded to a two bedroom with two bathrooms! We were so impressed with our spacious, well-appointed apartment. One of the bathrooms had a washer & dryer, and one bedroom had two twin beds, and the other bedroom had a double bed with full ensure. The kitchen had everything necessary to prepare a meal. There was also a balcony with table & chairs off the living room, and the master bedroom also had doors leading to the balcony. We never noticed any noise from nearby guests. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk to central business district, where there is many restaurants, convenience stores, and a large shopping centre, Canberra Centre. There is a city bus stop near the hotel door, which was very handy. This hotel is so comfortable, clean, and well situated. Definitely consider staying here while visiting Canberra.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458824357~“Greatly improved”~We have previously stayed at this place but were placed in purgatory in a small room at the rear of the hotel accessible through the carpark. This time with a 30th anniversary under our belt a lovely upgrade to a two bedroom apartment. Staff at reception were good, even better when we booked out and a senior member (probably the most senior) member of staff was able to waive some minor things capped it off. It didn't start out well with an unexpected payment for car parking in their own car park, then degenerated when the earlier reassurances of many 'lactose free' menu items turned out to be extremely limited choice of a couple of items. I don't like eating out because of this and it almost spoilt the celebration. I probably wouldn't have booked there if I had known the menu limitations. The breakfast (paid for two but only took up one) was limited but adequate, however a sign to advise us to ask for fried/poached etc eggs from staff resulted in me approaching a kitchen staff member whose gruff reply was 'speak to the bloke on the front desk', luckily he was walking towards us so I approached him and asked for some fried eggs. His response, he called out to the bloke we had just spoken to and asked for two fried eggs. Look no big deal but not great service, there were a number of ways it could of been handled (by both staff) but what it demonstrated was an average level of service. I'm happy because they have improved and hopefully a more dietary restrictive menu will make it a much more viable option. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458797731~“Complete amenities but airconditioning unit cannot cool the whole apartment”~We paid for 1 bedroom apartment but they gave us 2 bedroom instead. We were happy with free parking, complete amenities, room was cleaned everyday. We were happy with our stay, just with issues with airconditioning unit. It cannot cool the whole apartment especially bedrooms. We asked for electric fan which they gave to us straight away.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457802249~“Just excellent”~This was our second stay at Pacific suites. Both times have been an absolute pleasure. This last stay, our third party booking agent had incorrectly communicated our booking request and had requested two queen beds. With a two teenagers (17&15) this was never going to work having them sleep in the same bed! Our checkin host, Michael, picked up on the situation without prompt and then went out of his way to get us a room with separate beds for the kids at no additional cost. Couldn't thank him enough. The rooms have been expansive on both occasions, extremely clean and well appointed. Massive kitchen and lounge area, very clean and everything you could wish for. Well located within a stroll of restaurants and cafes or great dining in options. The new light rail will make it even more convenient when completed.  Pacific suites is our go to place in Canberra~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457287160~“Fantastic, would stay here again!!!”~We stayed here for a week (Australia Day week) and it was fantastic.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. The Hotel is very well situated, close to loads of food places 2 streets over towards the war memorial.  Accommodation was excellent. Clean and every thing you need for your stay. Rooms made up everyday and the kids loved the pool. Even though northbourne ave is a very busy the road noise was minimal.  The restaurant food was delicious and so was the room service! Our only minor complaint is that the only air conditioner is in the living room. The bedrooms were quite warm! We did end up buying some cheap pedestal fans which helped move the ac into the bedrooms.  Highly recommend Pacific Suites to anyone. Great for families!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456339211~“Great base to visit Canberra”~We have stayed on several occasions at this property. Consistently clean, and with pleasant views from the top two floors, this apartment complex is located close enough to the city centre to walk there, and close to plenty of restaurants. Beds in the 2 Br 2 Br can be a bit on the small side in one of the bedrooms, and aircon can be a bit limited for sleeping, but generally well presented and well maintained establishment offering good value~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455481364~“Don't expect much”~I was quite disappointed with this place. I guess that what you get when it's a cheap tariff. The rooms are spacious and clean. Very cheap fittings especially in the bathroom. And they use those cheap wall mounted soap and conditioners. There is an air-conditioner in the main area of the apartment but there isn't one in the bedroom and on a hot night like when I stayed it was quite hot. One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was the gym. It was it terrible shape. The air conditioner was broken and the receptionist showed no interest in trying to get it fixed for me. The free weights were loose and the handles could seriously pinch you. The chest press machine was broken. There were no floor mats and the towels hadn't been replenished. All things considered the hotel was okay but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455104472~“Great location and good value.”~We stayed here with friends visiting from overseas. Our unit was clean, modern and well appointed.

Recommended, especially considering the reasonable price.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455062738~“Spacious, conveniently located apartments”~Our two bed room apartment was spacious and clean. I found our road facing room quite noisy with the traffic. The lifts were very slow and there was, we were advised, only one luggage trolley for the whole complex, so taking luggage up and down for our family of 5 on check in and out was a very slow process. The island bench in the kitchen was loose and could have toppled over easily which I found quite dangerous with small children, management were advised of this concern. Our tea and coffee was not refilled during our 3 night stay, we had to request this which was a small annoyance. The family buffet breakfast deal was good value. Service from reception staff was very good.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan

review_453246134~“Wonderful, clean and spacious suite!”~What can I say but YES! We really enjoyed our short stay here. Travelling from Sydney we had arrived early into the Pacific Suites and our suite was not ready (2 bed/ 1 bath), no problem we thought we would go for the short walk to the shopping centre. However the wonderful man at front desk said no need, lets upgrade you. So into a 2 bed / 2 bathroom suite we went. Into the elevator and out a couple of floors up and I was struck by how clean it looked and smelled in the hallways, good start. Walked in to the suite and was blown away by the spaciousness and again cleanliness of the suite. For us travelling with 2 primary school aged children this was a little bit of heaven to have the space. Kids loved the pool and I loved sitting in the sun chairs and relaxing and we all loved the breakfast downstairs at the restaurant. Cafes and shops in walking distance, bottle shop (necessity for travelling with small kids haha) across the road. Very close to all the tourist attractions. Would absolutely stay here again if back in Canberra~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
