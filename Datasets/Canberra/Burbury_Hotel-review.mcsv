review_478622410~“A luxury appartment for small money”~We did book a nice big appartment with a balcony. The view wasn't exciting but the appartment was the more. All rooms were spacious, modern furnished and clean. Bed and bathroom were within the biggest we have seen on our whole trip.  The hotel is located close to Capitol Hill. Staying there on a weekend the citiy was quiet with few people around. We were amongst few guests in the hotel and so we got the appartment at areally cheap rate. It was very good value for money.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_478362997~“A good family hotel”~We booked for a short few days away to Canberra and needed to have 2 bedrooms... and this place fitted the bill nicely. The staff were friendly on check-in and the room was large enough with 2 bathrooms, lounge, kitchen, deck area and 2 bedrooms.. plenty of room. The monochrome palette is ok but the rooms seemed to lack any splashes of colour or texture. And the sofa was really really uncomfortable.. a little more attention to the details will elevate this place still further and make it great rather than just good- pictures on the walls rather than bare hooks, more cushions and some colourful accessories. Hiring bikes and cycling to the local attractions confirms what a great location this hotel is. Worth a visit for a value-for-money family stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478198217~“Great location. Well appointed.”~We stayed in a 1 bedroom Luxury Apartment for 8 nights. The central location is excellent - many places of national interest are within an easy walk. The kitchen appliances are very new and high-tech although the manuals are in a drawer if you need them - which I certainly did. My only disappointment was in finance; in that I added one extra night after we'd been there for 5 nights, as we underestimated how much more Canberra has to offer. This final (8th) night was charged at a much higher rate than the first 7 nights, which I felt was a little unreasonable - given that I'd already spent a week there. We only discovered this on checkout - so my fault for not getting a quote. There is also a surcharge on ALL credit cards which I don't remember being warned about.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477846997~“Great Location and very nice apartments”~We stayed in a two bedroom apartment which is part of the Burbury complex for an over night stay in Canberra. It was a large and well fitted out apartment with free wi-fi. The location is near the parliament and also the eating areas around Kingston. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477654107~“Comfortable stay”~We visited Canberra with our two DDs and the grandparents and stayed at the two bedroom serviced apartment at the Burbury Hotels and Apartments. We were very impressed with the services, the designer decor and the provisions. The reception staff are very courteous and there are good eating options around the hotel precinct. It is well located within 5-10 minutes drive of all key attractions. The only downside is that there is no lift access to the low rise apartment block.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477571986~“Wonderful stay”~Really enjoyed our one night stop over at the Burberry over Easter (just love Canberra when there are holidays! Hardly anyone about!). We were located on the far end of the building and the room was quiet and reasonably dark (although not as dark as the rooms that are not on the end due to the small amount of light let in by the bay windows which we enjoyed).  Beautifully furnished and clean.  Enjoyed a complimentary movie and the free wifi was really good.  At $100 cheaper than the Realm where we normally stay, it is excellent value for money.  Whilst one of the restaurants down stairs wasn't open to deliver room service on the Sunday we arrived, we were rested enough to enjoy dinner at one (if not the only) place within walking distance and open over the Easter weekend - across the road at Ostani. Did a lap around the block on the way back and viewed a healthy bunches of Cockatoos.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477006991~“Great weekend getaway ”~This is the second time we have stayed here, it is a very good hotel in a great location, with modern comfortable rooms. The beds are very comfortable and bathrooms are a good size with lovely amenities. The breakfast is good, one of the best things about it is the terrace and views where you eat. The car park is very convenient and selection of bars and restaurants in the adjoining hotel are good. Short drive, uber or taxi ride away from the museums, lake, Parliament House, a several suburbs with heaps of food and drinks options. Reception is ok, small lobby area though so can feel a bit crowded at checkout time. The last time we stayed here was 4 years ago so we did notice this time that the rooms were starting to look a bit tired, but still a very high standard.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476616839~“Excellent two bedroom apartment.”~Great two-bedroom apartment - in a sort of hotel precinct created around several hotels and apartment blocks. Ours was in Building 3, Room 22 in which each bedroom had its own bathroom. Quiet location in Canberra, with several good restaurants right below the hotel and across the road. Breakfast was great - it was a public holiday so it was at Buvette across the road, rather than the more usual rooftop of the hotel. Dinner at The Chairman and Yip was delicious too, and with great service. Could do with better signage in parking basement and generally around the precinct to direct guests from their rooms to Reception etc. Unusual microwave in room needs a sign to direct guests to the Compendium of instructions. But wonderful accommodation overall.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_476306068~“Hard to fault!”~Really enjoyed our stay here over the Easter weekend. Everything worked really well for our family of 5 including 3 young children. Great sized 2 bedroom apartment with everything you would need. Brilliant food and drink options. Accomodating staff and so welcoming to kids - easter arts and crafts, an easter egg hunt, a petting zoo and a visit from the easter bunny. The hotel is also ina brilliant location - close to the lake, parks, restaurants and shops. A great value hotel. Will definitely return.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476291145~“A Great Stay”~The Burbury rooms are larger than most and the offer free parking, free wifi and free movies. There is a bar and restaurant across the road which is also fantastic. You are also walking distance to Kingston and an assortment of restaurants. Also walking distance to the lake. Staff are helpful and eager to please. I will definitely be back for another stay.

review_476290616~“Well Located if you like a walk.”~We stayed for two nights. The hotel is well placed if you like to walk to restaurants, markets etc. It is in a quiet location. We had what I would describe as a budget room. It wasn't bad, but did find the bathroom setup a bit odd - no solid wall between it and the sleeping area so you could hear any bathroom noises.... I also found it odd that there was no toilet brush. When I rang reception about this, they sent a fellow up with a brush to clean the toilet but he said he could not leave the brush.  The room was not spotless but reasonably clean. It was pretty cheap so I guess you can't expect 5 Star if you are not paying for it.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~5~nan
review_475691629~“Single night visit prior to Australian Running Festival.”~Visited for a single night prior to Canberra Half-Marathon. Large room with good wash facilities. I ordered an evening meal which was fine. The only reason for three (as opposed to four) stars is that the floor didn't appear to have been cleaned in advance of my arrival. Otherwise - fine.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475654922~“Super little hotel in easy walking distance of parliament.”~Super little hotel in easy walking distance of the Australian parliament and the "National Capital Attractions". Our room had a small kitchen which came kitted - extraordinarily - with Global knifes (excellent chef's knifes that retail at c. $200 each). Bill was incorrect at exit - the hotel had allocated charges from another guest - or I would have gone to 5 stars.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475382491~“Mostly excellent ”~We stayed here for two nights. The hotel is in a quiet street but is close to the sights of Canberra and the restaurants of Kingston and Manuka. Everything was lovely except the loose toilet roll holder. The second night there was noise from the restaurant but really it was very quiet at night and the room was very dark which I always appreciate.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475140540~“Would good a great hotel... if they maintained it”~Room nice - bit of a style over substance in selection of furniture... not all very practical for an extended stay or comfort. Main issue with this hotel though is the cleaning - or obvious lack of - mould all along the shower, hallways clearly not vacuumed in days... It's a pity the hotel is poorly managed in these regards as they are letting what is otherwise a nice hotel down. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474600316~“Good location and clean rooms”~We had just moved to Canberra and we stayed here for almost a month. We left because they do not allow pets. Spacious rooms, good size kitchen, clean and within walking distance to the wonderful shops/cafe in Manuka.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474080104~“Fine for short business trips”~I stayed here for 2 nights in a 1 bedroom. It was a fairly small bedroom, large flatscreen to, clean and comfortable so no problems getting a good nights rest especially with the blackout blinds. The staff were helpful when I wanted some English Breakfast teabags which they went across the road to their other hotel for so thank you very much.  The gym across the road which located in the Hotel Realm building across the road was modern, offers towels and with enough machines to use was a nice change. There is also a pool too. Restaurant wise you have a selection around you but my advice is to book ahead if you really want to eat somewhere specific. I couldn't get into one for a Tuesday night.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473907560~“Worst Hotel Experience Ever. Avoid! ”~Upon walking into the room everything seemed satisfactory however this was not the case.  Below are the issues in which I raised more than once with the front desk and again on check out. Our stay was for 4 days.  1 Flooring in the room – the tiled area had not been cleaned from the previous guest and had not been cleaned our entire stay.  There was makeup on the floor tiles, marks and stains, all not from me which a mop would have cleaned up. Luckily there were slippers provided because walking on that floor was disgusting with visible stains. The carpet area had not been vacuumed as there was dust, paper wrappers and white linen fluff everywhere.  Unfortunately this was not only in the room, but the entire floor across level 2.  The lift was dirty every single day and the same rubbish had not been picked up off the floor in the lift our entire stay.  When you step out of the lift on level 2 there was a chewing gum wrapper in the same place for our entire stay.  There was white linen fluff along the corridor to our room which at no stage moved or was cleaned up.  2 Air-conditioning – we had to call maintenance after arriving to our room to turn the air-conditioning off as it wouldn’t turn off. 3 TV – about midnight on the first night we had to call the front desk again to have someone come up to address the issues with the TV.  It would not turn off, each time we turned it off, it turned itself back on.  Two men came to the room, they had to physically remove the TV from the wall and disconnect it from the back of the TV.  We were told this would be fixed the following day which it wasn’t.  I had to ask the front desk for them to have it fixed a second time at 4pm on Friday as nobody had been to correct the problem, nor were we offered another room.  Later that evening we had been given a second remote for the TV. 4 Dusty bedside tables – at no stage during our stay our room had not been dusted and with the amount of dust on the bedside table it would suggest dusting has not been carried out in that room for some time.  I could write my name in the dust build up next to the bed.  I called the front desk and asked this to be cleaned as I am an asthmatic and with the amount of dust next to the bed I was likely to have an asthma attack.  Absolutely filthy. I had to ask for this to be done twice as the first requested went unheard. 5 Shower mould – There was a build-up of mould in the corners of the shower along with a silver foil cap from a shampoo bottle which was from a previous guest, absolutely disgusting.  I had to call and ask for the shower to be cleaned. I had to ask for this twice and still this wasn’t addressed during our stay. Mould is an asthma attack trigger. 6 Toilet floor – the corner of the floor tiles where the toilet is had a visible brown stain the entire time we were there. It had not been cleaned at all.  I had to wipe the floor over myself where the toilet is as it was so dirty. 7 Screw on the floor – there was a screw left on the floor outside a room 2 doors up from us which was about 2 inches long. If a child had picked this up and swallowed it the hotel would be liable.  8 Cigarette butt – there was a cigarette butt outside our door, we don’t smoke and this was there our entire stay.  Not even picked up by the cleaners. 9 Electric shock – when turning on the exhaust fan on our last night it crackled and I got a small electric shock. 10 Vanity light – a light above the vanity flickered constantly when turned on. Our stay was so disappointing and disgusting I emailed the Director of Hotels and the General Manager. My reply had many excuses but no actual apology which is a reflection of the poor standards this hotel holds.  I can see others have rated this hotel well however each time I was at the front desk other guests were complaining. Avoid this hotel and stay somewhere else.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473256379~“Disappointing ”~I have stayed at the Burbury many many time it's actually my go to hotel in Canberra so obviously I love staying here. Unfortunately this time it was not so great. Have you guys changed housekeeping companies ??!! I found the rooms are not cleaned well, stains on the bed sheets, showers screen not cleaned. I felt really sad because I love this hotel but this time I feel like you have really dropped the ball! Change back to the other company otherwise you will lose your regular customers like me. Next time I'll choose the realm.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472590801~“Spacious, clean, convenient and quiet”~Stayed just the one night and thought the Burbury was a great option for our visit. I've stayed at many different hotels In Canberra for short breaks and the Burbury was extremely good value for money. Location to the National Gallery is excellent and it's also an easy walk down to the lake at the Kingston Foreshore area. Bathroom amenities are good quality and all the regular facilities are available. Staff are pleasant and check-in, check-out easy. I would definitely stay at the Burbury again.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_472250646~“From Hero to Zero”~I can't believe what a difference 2 years makes! Last time we stayed I would rated the hotel Excellent and now the standard has dropped to a poor level. Reasons: Our room was not serviced till after 7 pm even with a reminder, most of the floor got the same treatment. The rooms were not as clean and had mould in the shower and the carpets had not been vacuumed and even had broken glass through the carpet. The breakfast staff on level 7(except the great chef) were sour and uninterested. They even ran out of bowls and the coffee machine was out of order causing us to go to the Realm Hotel across the street where the story was similar. Poor service, lack of food and crockery! At Buvette the sister restaurant we had an unexplained surcharge which I need to follow up again with them ! The front of house staff were good but the back end is the issue ! I would appreciate speaking with the Director about improvements required as they have some serious issues to work through.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471989248~“Still ok, but showing signs of wear”~This was our 7th stay at the Burbury Hotel. we have been staying here since it opened.  It is a very chic design with very comfortable rooms and good beds. The hotel is starting to show signs of wear and tear and a little neglect here and there. Carpets are starting to get baggy in places, lamps don't stay up, pads and pens are no longer in the rooms and there were 16 voice messages on the phone some dating back to January. The front desk staff (Emily) have improved immensely compared to previous experiences. The breakfast buffet is more limited than before (although, fried eggs and omelettes are now available on order). The attendant here was aloof and not too welcoming. The chef however, was delightful and very friendly.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_471968532~“Great location and spacious apartment”~We had a great stay at the Burbury Hotel for a family wedding.

Hotel is very centrally located with good restaurants on site.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_471775388~“well located and presented property”~The Burbury is well located in Barton- close to various Government Offices.

The beds are particularly comfortable.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_471028544~“Nice place to stay”~Really stylish rooms. Some exellent eating option should near by - but avoid Ostanninat all costs. Certainly have a drink but the food is underwhelming and the service is hit and miss. A great place to stay for government business.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_470506913~“A good business stopover”~The range of hotels in Canberra has improved in recent years and the Bunbury is a contributor to the better choice. The hotel is well located for business in the parliamentary triangle and for me a pleasant morning walk to Manuka for an early breakfast. The rooms are modern, classy and well appointed not expansive, but adequate. However, I did find it very comfortable. The hotel is part of precinct and hotel Realm is across the street, where there is a decent bar, a cafe is across the square. Thus the hotel is designed for you not to need or rely on room service. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469741555~“An Adequate Hotel but needs to improve service”~I stayed here one night for a business trip based on Tripadvisor ratings and price, which was reasonable.  One reason I booked it was that it had gym facilities - the gym is located in another building in the street (I think the entire street is a series of apartments and hotels like the Burbury). After driving from Sydney and arriving in the evening, I couldn't be bothered looking for the building or the gym on my own. Instead I went to the room, which is modern and sleek. It has all that you need but nothing extra. There is an armchair in the room, but not one to sit comfortably in and watch TV, so sat on bed, ok but not perfect. Then I ordered dinner via room service. This arrived in a paper bag and a plastic take-away container. There are no plates in the room to serve it up. At least they provided normal cutlery. I ordered a caeser salad, which was very good but at $22 I would like a plate to eat it off and a chair and table to do this - again at least the bed was there to eat my dinner. Later that day, due to pricing I moved to another Hotel in Canberra and realised in the afternoon that I had left my pyjamas behind!!! I immediately rang the Burbury who could not contact housekeeping but informed me that they would and would call back to advise me if they had the items and where I could pick them up - that was Monday 20 March - it is now Friday 24 March and I have had no response whatsoever. All I can say is thank goodness it wasn't something valuable. The website indicated there was a balcony - again my assumption, I didn't ask - but there wasn't. Overall, my experience of this Hotel was not particularly favourable. It is let down by so many things, I wouldn't recommend it or stay here again.  The next 2 nights I spent at QT - less expensive, far better room service and impeccable friendly and knowledgeable staff - none of them missed a beat with all my dealings~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_469708818~“Fantastic hotel”~I had a wonderful stay at the Burbury Hotel.

review_469278203~“Useless staff, and not a 4 star, save your time and money stay somewhere else”~My very first encounter with a staff member was when I was booking over the phone. I specifically asked whether there was any benefit in booking directly through the hotel or booking.com and he said: "no there is not." After I booked with him I hoped on their website where there was a promotion on the home page stating "book with us directly and save 10%." When I called back another member answered and stating that his colleague was looking at the wrong page.  With my luck, I got to deal the same staff member at check in. We arrived on a Friday night, with luggage. The staff member stated we are in building 3. We grab a luggage and start walking towards building 3. As we arrive at building 3 scan our cards and nothing. I walked back to the receptions explaining that we were unable to get in he said "no that's the residential building 3, your building 3 in on the other side" After walking around in the dark we finally found our building 3. As the 4 of us walk into our 2 bedroom apartment, placed our items down and to see only 2 chairs around the dining table. I called up reception and asked for extra 2 chairs as I stated in my booking that there are 4 adults staying in the apartment. 5 minutes later a gentleman arrives with 2 shabby as chairs, now if I wasn't staying at a 4-star hotel I wouldn't care, however, they put the 4-star badge on themselves. I asked the gentleman where did he get them from and why are they in such bad condition he just said sorry we ran out of the other chairs.... how does a hotel run out of other chairs.  They have all these smart tv options but unfortunately none the staff members knew how to set it up and the technician only works Monday to Friday.  Their guest book forgot to mention that before using the oven you need to switch it on from the other side of the Kitchen Nevertheless, no one knew nothing. I asked what were the pool hours no one knew, and the most confusing part was that you were allowed to use the pool from one hotel and the gym from the other... yet Burbury itself did not have the facilities.  After 4 days of constantly contacting receptions for issues, as was we checking out the staff member asked how was my stay as I replied not good very disapointed. he said oh sorry to hear that I wish we could have compensated you in some way! No one wanted to offer us anything during our stay and all the sudden we are leaving the state and they wish they could of compensate. Don't waste your time or money by staying here.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan~nan
review_466437888~“Nice hotel but lots of walking to get to your room, breakfast car park etc”~The rooms were beautiful well set up and large semi self contained. The rooms were clean and new and well appointed. But the walk to breakfast was too long and the car park was painful we asked for a room away from the lift (due to noisey lifts) and were given a room straight across from the lift (the lifts here are quite) and the room layout puts you away from the lift it isn't good for people with wheel chairs or walking aid as the ramps are steep and there are lots of pebble lined paths and pavers with big gaps around them. If there was a bridge over the car park entry to main reception/ restaurant and the rooms it would be easier to get around.~3~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465914950~“Lovely large room ”~This hotel sits behind the Realm. It has a much larger room compared to a standard hotel room and is really well appointed. The foyer is a little cold and unwelcoming but the quality of the room makes up for it.  There are great restaurants all in this precinct and makes this a great choice when in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464640846~“Modern, Clean, Minimalist Hotel room”~The hotel had very modern, clean, minimalist rooms. The rooms were a bit dark. We stayed in the hotel section. It was all fine, just didn't have any character at all. We got a deal where the breakfast was included. On the first day we had breakfast at the Burbury Terrace - the food was really substandard and poor quality. The next day we had breakfast at the Buvette Bistro in the Realm Hotel - we didn't realise that we could have breakfast at this restaurant, the food there for breakfast was fantastic. The location is fine if you have a car to drive to restaurants etc. The gym is very good. The hotel just lacks character.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464456632~“2 night stay”~Comfortable hotel and perfectly located adjacent to parliament triangle for galleries and enlighten. Staff efficient but not overly friendly. Room a good size and clean. Cleaners did not replace items we used the previous day which is poor. Wifi good and free as was the parking. Breakfast offering quite limited but was fresh and nice views from 7th floor. Plenty of other places around hotel do brekky so we went elsewhere on second morning.  Could not leave windows open to get fresh air at night due to noise from bar across the road but no sound with windows closed which was great.  Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464177313~“I wouldn't Stay Again”~I really don't like picking on hotels but I must be honest. The TV didn't work it kept freezing up and we had to turn it off and then turn it back on 5 minutes later, on closer inspection it had been a replacement TV (not a good one at that with the tv angled upwards). The light shade in the corner of the room was broken and didn't work. The bathroom wasn't clean and had some type of white hard liquid over the basin and sink. The room was 315 if the management want to go and check it out, and by the way it was so noise from the bar across the road we then couldn't get to sleep.~2~nan~3~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_464138020~“Comfortable but soulless apartments”~I stayed in the Burbury Apartments for three nights on a work trip. I generally stay at the Realm or East hotels but it was a sitting week and neither had rooms available within the available budget. While apartments are affiliated with the hotel, they are not a hotel. Pros - Generally good location in the Realm precinct, short trip to capital hill. - Wifi is free and generally consistent enough to stream radio. - Room is clean and comfortable, though the stainless steel kitchen bench on wheels feels like a morgue trolley.  Cons - Very dark room. I spent some of the day in the room working and, when I went back outside, was stunned to discover it was bright and sunny outside. - Check in (and reception generally) was slow. The check in desk was inadequately staffed and inefficient, requiring lots of patience. - There are no supermarkets in the immediate vicinity and no snacks/mini bar in the room or room service option. I got in a bit hungry, wanting a little snack. The fridge/pantry was empty and it was raining when I arrived so I didn't feel like trudging 15+ minutes each way to Coles. There are restaurants and bars in the immediate Realm precinct but you can't pick up something little, quick, easy and healthy. - A bit noisy at times. Rubbish trucks were emptying dumpsters at various times of day from what sounded like a few metres from the bedroom window.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463918140~“Nice and relaxing accomodation”~We had a two room apartment. The rooms were spacious ,well equipped and spotless. The main bedroom had a large ensuite and the other room had a bathroom in a separate room. All of the necessary utensils, crockery etc were there. The layout in our apartment was excellent with a nice space between the two bedrooms to ensure privacy. A variety of eating venues are located within the Burbury complex plus other eating places within easy walking distance. Underground parking was easy with a lift within the parking area.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan

The first time they upgraded me to one of the apartments but i much prefer to stay in the hotel (Although the apartment is very beautiful and spacious). The rooms are quite big, with modern decor but the layout is a little odd. The minibar had lots of nice treats and the air conditioning was appreciated as it was a very hot day when i was there. I slept beautifully on a nice big bed overlooking the street. The gym is no longer at the Realm and the breakfast was not upstairs but you can access both in another building close by. Overall a very pleasant stay.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_463066611~“Apartments are different to the hotel - take note”~We made a last minute reservation to find that we were in the 'apartment section' not the hotel section. Didn't think much of it at the time of booking....  There is clearly a difference.  They were the most poorly maintained apartments we have ever stayed in. Bathroom tiles were filthy, grout was stained, shower screen grimey and didn't close properly and to top it off there was hair left over from the previous guests in the corner of the shower.  Shelves in the bedrooms were dusty, bed side lamps didn't work (x2) I could go on....

Reservation and check-in and out were friendly and extremely efficient. the room had every facility we needed. the eating options were just what we needed - late night light dinner at the bar and extensive breakfast.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_462129868~“EXCELLENT HOTEL WITHIN EASY DISTANCE OF MANY FACILITIES”~Burbury Hotel in the suburb of Barton, Canberra is a great location within walking distance of major facilities, including Parliament, Galleries and the shopping centre of Manuka with its numerous restaurants and cafes The room i was allocated was spacious, well designed, had a view and was comfortable; it was also spotlessly clean The breakfast was held on the roof top of the hotel and had a great view overlooking parts of Canberra; the food was good and typically hotel fare I would definately recommend this place and would stay there again whilst in Canberra~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_461044448~“A very nice hotel”~This hotel is a a very modern well designed hotel. The room was quiet and comfortable. The block out blinds had me sleeping in for once.

review_458765551~“Perfect Spot over”~Had the pleasure of staying at this well appointed hotel on our way to Thredbo with the kids. Highly recommended ... breakfast was great and rooms had everything we needed and more! Kitchenette, fridge, Laundry with washer/dryer, comfortable beds, iron&board, hairdryer, bathroom was missing a bathtub if you had small kids but I loved the well designed bathroom. There's a great Japanese restaurant downstairs which is a must!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458205521~“Lovely, well located hotel”~We had booked a special package which included breakfast, a drinks voucher and tickets to the Versailles exhibition at the National Gallery. Our receptionist was welcoming and efficient, listing all the inclusions and explaining the layout of the hotel which is one of three associated properties - the bar and breakfast room are across the road. Our room wasn't large but clean and well designed with a lovely bathroom and quality bed linen. The location was excellent, within easy walking distance to both old and new parliament houses and the National Gallery etc. At breakfast there were plenty of healthy choices and good coffee. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_456516468~“Great location”~Quite, clean and great location. Close to all the sights and some good restaurants, coffee shops and the lake. Unfortunately few of the eateries/restaurants at the hotel were open during my stay, which was a downer, it also would have been nice to know the pool was actually at their sister hotel across the road. Note to management - I know I was there during school holidays, but having numerous babies and toddlers in the spa (in particular) was a little disturbing - from the health stand point of the toddlers.... Not a real winner - and lots of your corporate customers were walking out of the gym/pool/spa facility making similar comments. Just an FYI.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan

review_455837315~“Very disappointed”~We have stayed at the Burbury a number of times and encouraged our parents to stay here as well. Unfortunately our last stay over the Christmas/New Year period was terrible to say the least. We arrived for check in and both our rooms where not ready and we where advised we would be called when ready, after 2 and half hours I called and amazingly the rooms where ready. Once in our rooms it was apparent they where not cleaned to a high standard with hair, food and grime all over the room. After many many phones calls back and forth a staff member at the realm organised to have this fixed. I asked the front desk to have the manager contact me but this never happened. I will never ever stay at the Burbury again it was disgusting!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455295547~“A fantastic stay”~We stayed here for 5 nights during our stay in Canberra. We found the location very convenient and quiet. There was underground parking and the location was close to a lot of attractions. It took approximately 15 minute walk to get to Manuka shopping village which was great for convenience shops and eateries, a lovely place to dine outside on a warm evening! We had our breakfast accross the road at Buvette cafe which is all part of the hotel precinct. The staff here were great and the breakfast was buffet style offering a good selection of hot and cold food. Our room had a king size bed and would have to be one of the most comfortable I have slept in by far. Room was contemporary and a good size with everything we needed for our stay including free wi-fi. Check in was easy and fast. Our parking and breakfast was included in the package which was fantastic value for our stay here. We had use of the pool in Hotel Realm, a short stroll across the road if we needed to. We had a wonderful stay here and would highly recommend. We will definitely come back and stay here again in the future.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_451546880~“Great value, excellent staff, big and comfy room”~Great stay for a very affordable price. Best compliments ! You "must" have a car to move around Canberra and the hotel offers an underground garage. I didn't use other hotel facilities (restaurant, pool) so I can't make comments on it.  As written before by others: you can't switch the air con off (at night, when you want to sleep without the ventilation noise). Just take the key room off the slot and it will shut down.  All in all it was a real pleasant surprise, given the average level of the hotels in my budget in Australia.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_451328361~“Great hotel”~We are 2 adults and a child, so staying in a standard hotel room is small for us, even for 1 night.  We had a great one night stay here in a 2 bed apartment. Check in was quick, the staff were helpful and friendly. The room was huge, 2 bedrooms, 3 apple TVs, with Foxtel and free movies. 2 full wardrobes, lounge, dining, full balcony, full sized fridge, and microwave. For the price of a standard hotel room this was very good value. We were able to use gym,sauna and pool at the realm hotel, literally 5 steps away.  The room was clean, beds were comfortable, free wifi, free parking and for $20 per adult breakfast across the road at Buvette restaurant was well worth it.  The only down side was only one restaurant was available for dinner, until later in January when the rest re opens. We would definately return to this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451149633~“Good location, great value...but?”~The good: Booked in on the "Versailles , Treasures from the Palace" package. Tickets to the NGA exhibit, cocktails and great breakfast all included made it a very good value night out.  Unusual concept with a number of hotels in the same block, sharing facilities like the pool, restaurants etc works well as all are linked via computer ( for charge back etc). Plenty of choices to wine and dine, not cheap, but it's Canberra! All within a stroll. Lovely parks nearby and close to many of the nations capitals highlights. Room was fine, comfy bed, plenty of room and clean. No view from our spot but no big deal. The bad: Trivial perhaps , but the TV is unworkable. Point the remote at the Apple thing to change channels, point the remote at the TV to change volume..unless the sun is shining on the Apple thing, as this renders it useless. Crazy. Thanks to the young man who came up and explained how useless it was. The 'carpet' surrounding the Tele was covered in dints that looked suspiciously like remote controls being propelled at hi speed in its direction.  The aircon is the only thing you need you're room key for ( other than opening the door, lifts etc ). Unless you have some super power I lack in regards to being a great guesser you need to place the key in a slot below the air con controller....no where could we find any info on this. Thanks again to reception who I suspect have been asked this a few times before. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451129906~“Perfect hotel close to city”~We booked for 2 nights initially, ended up extending another night, the hotel is perfect, decent sized room and all amenities included, especially loved the pillows and linen, they were so comfy! Staff were helpful and efficient, there are a few highly recommended restaurants in the hotel itself, we hadn't had a chance to try it but will definitely give Lilotang a try the next time we're there, will be back :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450897603~“Great place, needs a little uplift”~I've stayed at the Burbury a couple of times over the years and do like the hotel. It's in a good central location, has quality facilities like the gym and pool and the restaurant complex offers plenty of options. However it does feel like some recent lack of upkeep is letting it down. 1. External balcony locks - neither balcony door lock worked (oddly we had the same problem last year) and despite 3 discussions with reception and 2 maintenance visits the locks still didn't work and so the apartment was essentially unsecure for 3 days 2. Kitchen equipment - there were plenty of saucepan lids but no saucepans which meant food had to be cooked in a combination of a frying pan and a 5 litre stock pot.  3. One bedroom side table was missing which meant books, glasses and other items needed to be left on the floor. All the above could be fixed at low cost with some checking periodically and quick resolution. And for some reason the air conditioning goes to central control at night so you can't keep the room cool at those times. So it's a good place to stay and a lot better than many other apartment options in Canberra, however when we come back in April I will be slightly apprehensive.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450875953~“Family holiday ”~We stayed at the burbury hotel. It was well reviewed on TripAdvisor and other sites. When we arrived at 9pm after a very long drive we were given a room that was not made up. We then came downatairs ans upgraded to a unit which was comfortable. Bathroom was not well cleaned but the beds and general facilities were comfortable and nice. Close to parliament house, manuka and Griffith where there are good healthy eating options.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450844738~“Nothing Good To Say”~SLOW CHECK IN Upon arrival the check in desk could not locate any of our reservations. I had to check their computer and advise staff they were using the incorrect dates while searching for our reservations. Staff member was completely clueless and this extensively delayed checkin for our entire group. UNCLEAN ROOMS When entering our room we noticed another hotel patrons belongings still inside the room and the room had not been cleaned. We were left wondering if we were given the wrong room.  RUDE STAFF We had to go back down to reception as they failed to answer our three phone calls and advise them of this. When advised staff were uninterested and unapologetic. After waiting 1.5 hours for the room to be cleaned, we were met by rude housekeeping. This staff member rudely complained to us that she shouldn't be cleaning the room and she should have ended her shift 2 hours ago, trying to make us feel guilty. The room was not cleaned until 11.30pm. On our last night at the hotel we were given 2 $5 drink vouchers to apologise for the inconvenience. Given to us way too late to even use them.~1~nan~3~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_450621593~“VERY NICE HOTEL AND MODERN , A WORTHWHILE STAY AT THE RIGHT PRICE”~I stayed her in January 2017 for the Summernats event & was pleasantly supprised by the nice modern Hotel, furnishings and ammenities provided.There was restaurants & eateries Nearby.A little out of the Centre of canberra ( approx 4km) The only not so brilliant about my stay was being kept awake until 2am Saturday morning by the Hotel Patrons opposite & the early moring Garbage truck. However, Free Parking was provided for my stay & Free WIFI which worked great & really Modern and very clean Bathrooms which were great to see . Foxtel, Movies and free to Air T.V were also provided. A Very helpful reception as well . I would stay here again without doubt & would recommend it to anyone looking for a Nice place to stay~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450620745~“Very close to the bus stops!”~Stayed two nights - the good: free Apple TV with movies, free wifi, clean and modern. Good lighting (lots of switches!) and proper desk area. Parking is safe and easy.  The bad: no housekeeping between nights (I would have liked the tea/coffee topped up, for example, and the bed straightened.) The interesting: the room is two rooms without a door, the bathroom being separate to the bed part, but the shower and toilet are behind a frosted door that does not go all the way up to the ceiling; it's open to the room. The basin is then in the open, outside the toilet/shower room. It's not at all an issue when you're staying alone, but might matter if you're sharing with someone you're not terribly comfortable with (then again, it was a queen room, so you'd better be comfy together!).~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~3~nan
review_450053785~“Canberra break”~We shared a 2 bed apartment with friends and found it very comfortable and kept us fit climbing all the stairs from the basement carpark. Apartment has 1 bedroom with ensuite but lacked decent chairs and table to enjoy the large balcony. Kitchen has modest equipment and we had enough cooking and serving dishes. Bed was comfortable and there was access to a pool with in the neigbouring hotel. Preference is for other apartments closer to Manuka and Kingston.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_449789122~“Business luxury”~I visited the bur bury hotel on numerous occasions when working in Canberra. It's well located, has great facilities, the rooms are really well equipped and of a very high standard.

review_449656526~“Fantastic Location”~Great high tech hotel in a great location. Just 5 minutes from Parliament House. The eateries are quite expensive so we just took a 5 minute drive to Green Square where there was a little shopping centre. Room Service the 1st night was a bit slack however the next 2 nights it was good. The beds are really comfortable & there is no noise at all. Would stay here again without a doubt.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449494521~“Contemporary and spacious”~The hotel is relatively new and the room that I stayed in was surprisingly large and the front of house staff were brilliant upon arrival and throughout our stay. The room we stayed in was very large with all typical hotel room furniture, and a very very comfortable and large bed. There were quality furnishings and fittings and ample lighting to provide all manner of moods required. The room could also be blacked out completely. The bathroom was also very spacious, but if you wanted to use the toilet whilst someone was in the shower, and need privacy, that isn't possible, but that is a very minor issue, not worth worrying about. It was in a great location, walking distance to the National Archives, National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery. It was also equal distance to Kingston shops and Manuka shops and a slightly longer walk to the vibrant Kingston foreshore.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_448385553~“OK, but could easily be much better”~We stayed in a one bedroom studio apartment for 2 nights at a rate of $200/night. Overall: the hotel is functionally fine, though charmless. An ok base in Canberra for a short stay. The room: a very large 1 bedroom apartment (I'm not sure why it's referred to as a studio). Not a bad layout, though it didn't make you feel like you wanted to spend any more time in it than necessary. For example there was no artwork at all on the walls - I don't stay at hotels for the art experience however having absolutely none on large walls made it look soulless and uninviting. Very comfortable bed, and a useable balcony.  Location: good, pleasant neighbourhood, part of the Realm complex, which has a number of very similar low-mid rise buildings. A car is a necessity. Service: very friendly and helpful, though for the housekeeping staff food left in the cupboards and a dirty plate here and there was not ideal. Other comments: the feeling was that the hotel had spent no more than absolutely necessary - bland not particularly attractive furnishings, 2 of each type of crockery (I mean, 2 dinner plates, 2 side plates, etc), coupled with a non working dishwasher. A few dollars more and the room could have been much more guest-friendly and attractive. Positives: free wifi (with a very good speed), online check-in and mobile confirmation of the room's availability, free parking for website direct bookings. Stay again? No, even though the gripes are relatively minor in the scheme of things.~3~nan~nan~5~3~nan~5~nan
review_448368685~“Great hotel”~Spacious room, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, lots of storage space, nice view! We loved it! We stayed 24 to 26.12 when most of Canberra was shut down due to the Christmas holidays, 3 of the hotel's restaurants were closed too but Ostani right next door was open and provided good dining and drinking options. Highly recommended hotel~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448358998~“Confused New Year at the Burbury”~I normally like the Burbury and have stayed before and enjoyed the experience. It is in a good location and the desk staff are nice. This time we found they shut the hotel kitchen for the whole New Year week, so you have to go to another hotel for any food or refreshments. They are short of towels and on one occasion we had to wait until 6pm to have any towels, so we could shower before going out. The normal shower gel and other standard hotel basics were missing or forgotten. The breakfast at the other hotel we had to use was very poor and I ended up giving up with a cooked breakfast as it had been cooked long ago and then left until someone ate it. The cooked buffet food was warm at best, really not good. Seemed like they wanted to close the hotel for the holidays but forgot to tell the customers.  We will remember this for next years events and go somewhere else.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447962157~“Relaxing Room”~Good location, with car parking, our bed was comfy (but we did find the pillows too uncomfortable) and the room nicely furnished with a small balcony outside our windows. It was a quiet room with aircon, wifi, bar fridge, king bed & nice towels. The staff where lovely. Due to the Christmas break, the restaurant was not open & not many restaurants were open but there was a good wine/foodie bar across the road, for a dinner after a long day's drive. The rest where a drive into the city center.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_447415668~“Quality stay in a luxury apartment”~Stayed 5 nights over Christmas in a two bedroom apartment which was modern, roomy and airy - we had our own large balcony with a day bed and table for two. The space, light and facilities in the room would make it a very comfortable place to live for an extended time. The pod espresso machine worked well. However, microwave use meant resorting to instruction manual each time. The identical bathrooms were roomy but the vanity unit gave up practical bench space for an unnecessarily large basin with one of those silly little taps that don't reach out far enough to allow to get both your hands under them. The apartment was serviced daily even though website says weekly. Thanks! Free WIFI is nice and quick. Will happily stay here again.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_447067752~“Absolutely Fantastic - Make Sure You Stay Here”~Stayed here on Boxing Day while passing through Canberra, really wanted to delay the rest of the trip to stay another night as it was so fantastic. The place is quite new and presents in immaculate condition, parking onsite is free which is secure with easy lift access to the rooms. The room was far above the expectation, very luxurious and perfectly appointed, far more spacious than expected also for a very decent rate! TV entertainment is great with a wide range of free movies and the bed is super comfortable, made better with full block out blinds. We will be back in Canberra in the future and I will have no hesitation in staying at the Burbury.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_446264221~“Pure Comfort”~The hotel and staff make this a pure comfort kind of place. First - I enjoy going to Australia and work has called me here several times with extended stays of at least three weeks. The hotel has gone out of their way to accommodate my stays, and to provide excellent service. The hotel is convenient to Manuka where this is good shopping, food, and groceries. It is close to a park for relaxing and walking around (Telopia). I also rent a bike when I am here, and the front desk staff is helpful in accepting the bike dropoff or pickup. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. I hope you enjoy Burbury as much as I do.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444954406~“Comfortable and convenient”~Had a one night stay at the Burbury so we could check out the tourist attractions of Canberra. Booked a two bedroom suite, which is spacious and modern. Free onsite parking in the basement, but on arrival you may have some fun trying to find a spot to park out the front of the hotel. While basements are never particularly attractive, this one had a disconcerting smell of gas. Other car park users also remarked on the strong "sulphur" smell. Maybe the ventilation system is insufficient.   Kitchen facilities looked good, didn't really have opportunity to use anything. TV in one of the bedrooms didn't work properly, eventually it just quit. Whilst looking for the location of the hairdryer, discovered that housekeeping may be a little lax, empty biscuit packets in bedside cupboard. Kind of makes you too nervous to go looking behind the bed, etc. (And yes, the hairdryer WAS located in the bedroom wardrobe, storage a bit tight in the bathroom). Shower is lovely and large. Noticed every now and then a bit of an unpleasant odour from the drains in the kitchen and bathroom sinks, but it was not too bad, seemed to be an occasional thing.  Overall, the hotel was conveniently located and the beds were comfortable. Did not try the onsite restaurants. Would happily stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444767209~“Not quite as good as expected”~Expected to be wowed by staying here, friends have raved about this hotel. Previously we've stayed at The Realm or Hotel Kurrajong. Booking, check in & check out were flawless. Clean room, low noise, good amount of classy amenities. Comfortable bed and climate control. Had a room up high as requested. The room itself has suffered from the joy of previous guests with black rub marks and general rubbings on all walls, dents in tiles, pencil lines still on walls from the sparky fitting power points. The wear & tear on the room surprised me given it's a relatively new hotel. Shower was roomy however was terrible with bottom slide up & down hook unable to hold the weight of the shower head, top fixed shower hook too high for short people and lose, minimal water pressure, however bathroom was 2 way and had loads of room. Everything we needed was easily found and in good working order. Parking was interesting and a little stressful. Being a busy Friday evening we decided to advance straight to the car park rather than negotiate a park at the front entrance. We found it tight for our CX9 and to our surprise there was no ability to contact reception via intercom to enter the carpark and either had to attempt to reverse out of the tight entrance in to a busy tight lane or lucky for us, someone left which opened the gate. Would consider staying again however it would be at a special rate, I don't think it's worth the normal rate.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443885372~“Less great than last time”~Ive stayed here four times in the past 12 months, its great value for money and location. Generally underrated, i was slightly disappointed this trip due to some signs of deterioration (or management). Im not usually a complainer, and i will be staying here next time i visit canberra, but the blanket was dirty, and the room clearly had been visited by a smoker previously. All fine, just a lesser standard of care to the last few visits. Previously coffee machines and toothbrushes were provided but no longer.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_443691576~“Disappointing stay”~Room 504.....Checked in and dropped bags quickly without really checking out the room. After getting back to the room realised there was no hairdryer. There was dirty water left in the dishwasher with food stuff, the floor looked as though it hadn't been cleaned for weeks with food stains still on the floor and the carpet had not been vacuumed. Main desk were very apologetic and offered a complimentry breakfast and assured me the room would be thoroughly cleaned the next day. Wrong!!!!! The room had not been cleaned at all. They really need to look into their housekeeping standards, as it is very slack. Another breakfast offered. TV in The bedroom poorly installed and didn't work. Curtains and walls dirty and sticky tape on walls and ceiling. No mention of changing room. Would NOT stay or recommend to anyone they stay there.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~1~nan

At the end I need to wait for one hour and got my room at 5:05pm  Any 4.5 stars hotel would not allow this happen at all .  However the receptionist even did not feel any wrong ( may be she was too busy as only she was working on her only )  At then end she offered me a bottle of champagne (which worth $8.99) as compensation for my late check in !!!  I paid $419 for per night for 1 bed room apartment on this hotel .  I will ever come back or recommend my friends at all . I usually stay in another 5 star hotel which I pay similar price but I realise there is such a big different .  This Hotel from staff training , room facility , Hotel facility ( NO facility at all ) even breakfast ( the worst breakfast in my life experience in a So call 4.5 Star hotel )  Last thing - when we requested a Late check out at 12pm (only one hour extra) , we need to bargained with the front desk and explained we had a Late check in last night at 5pm in the afternoon .  Unprofessional staff service with poor management , I really feel sorry for this Hotel .

review_443205498~“Over nighter at the Burbury”~My wife and I have stayed at the Burbury numerous times. This time we were there to attend a function at the national gallery. This is a great hotel if attending any activities around the Parliamentary Precinct. We were staying in the units in building 3 this time. These are comfortable and room apartments with all facilities for self catering if required. My only issues were the "Smart" TVs. The longer you watch something the more out of sinc the voices become until the TV stops working. Both TVs did this. A bit annoying. The other issue was on the Saturday morning we had a fire alarm go off and we all had to evacuate the building. Nothing wrong with that per say. But as for staff protocols and requirements for these situation, the hotel needs to do a lot of improving and understand what is required of staff and management in these type of situations. The good news was that it was only a false alarm. And yes, we will stay at the Burbury again.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
