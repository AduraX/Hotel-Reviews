review_477865861~“Nice but dated decor, hidden costs”~My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Checking in was flawed....all our details were wrong and it took 2 tries to fix it. Key card did not work and I had to get new ones but they did not operate the security gate for the car park. Handbook in room clearly states wifi is "complimentary" which I take to be free...but it's not...$15 for 2 hours....! Buffet breakfast was nice but not included in price. ($20 each) TV in room was hard to navigate with some free to air channels not very good reception. Movies were not free. Decor was dated with lots of timber however the hotel seemed to be well maintained and clean. Overall, it is a nice hotel but could be improved with more inclusions rather than extras. We have stayed in hotels overseas that were much cheaper and with more inclusions than this one and still at 4 to 5 stars. Worth a try.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_477066929~“Comfortable and relaxing”~We stayed for once night on Easter Monday. Having been camping at the National Folk Festival for six nights , we were delighted with the conferrable room and compact but very functional bathroom , complete with bath. We had a very pleasant night and took advantage of the very well presented and supplied Buffet Breakfast for an extra $20 per person pre booked before heading back to Melbourne the next day. Unfortunately the coffee machine were not working well but one very ind staff member made me a barista coffee from the bar. We also appreciated the secure car park at the back of the complex , as our car was packed with camping gear and luggage.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476228886~“Pleasantly Surprised!”~We used a package deal through Red Balloon, and found the hotel and food extremely good. From Sydney, you arrive at your hotel almost as soon as you reach civilisation! The hotel is bright and modern and the staff are very helpful with a smile! The rooms are spacious with everything catered for. Even better was the very high standard of dinner and breakfast! You won't be disappointed!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475414623~“Comfortable But Bad Bathroom Design”~The hotel has a nice layout, with a central indoor garden area. It's located on Northbourne Avenue, which provides a range of bus services to the city centre and beyond. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom is surprisingly small. For example, the hair dryer is located in a cupboard near the entry to the room and the tea and coffee facilities are located in the bathroom opposite to the basin. The walls surrounding the basin are all covered in glass to make the bathroom seems less tiny than it actually is, which means there are is hook for a hand towel to hang and dry on. The light above the basin is directly above where the guest stands. It doesn't illuminate their face, but the top of their head. It's unsuitable for shaving. You'll notice that the hotel does not have any photographs of the Deluxe Room's bathroom on their website. There's a good variety of food for breakfast and no cafés nearby. The price of breakfast is comparable to other hotels.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_474419713~“Very well equipped 2 bedroom apartment”~We booked direct with th Pavillon for a good deal on the apartment we stayed in. The unit appeared to have been recently refurbished. We all commented on the extremely comfortable beds and the excellent shower head. Our only minor disappointment was that had to eat at the bar as the restaurant did not have pizza which was the dish of choice for our younger travelling companion. Overall highly recommended for a stay in Canberra~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473764572~“Quite surprising”~We picked this one through Wotif, they were offering a good price. Not knowing what to expect, we were very surprised. When I first tested the bed, I thought a little bit firm, but had no difficulty sleeping on it. The place was immaculately clean. My only reservation was the King bed, too big for the room, especially as we also had a single bed in there. Can somebody tell me why so many hotels go for king beds? I could not fault the staff. We were made very welcome, with greetings no matter where we went. One of the great pluses for this hotel is the dining facilities (that in a dining review). I was really impressed with the tropical setting in the centre of the hotel, which housed the lounge & dining. Parking is available onsite. Front facing rooms have some traffic noise, but when the curtains are drawn it blocks out most of the night traffic of which tere is very little.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473305864~“Pillows at Northbourne”~Search the net frequently for best price. Don't get caught by their guarantee to match lowest price offers- they don't.

review_472808201~“Great assistance in an emergency”~The renovated rooms are quite pleasant - the bathrooms in the suites are superior to some hotels charging twice the price. Though the hotel is a little way away from the CBD there is a complementary shuttle to get you in and back. Having left the hotel to head home we had a car break down. Not only did they promptly fit us back in but extended a reduced rate because of earlier occupancy and reception staff members were tremendously helpful in assisting us to get a hire car. very professional, pleasant people. Breakfast is reasonable value but the area can get very crowded.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471786687~“Needs a refresh. But does the basics.”~Stayed a few nights for work in March 2016. Had to stay in four different hotels during the trip and The Pavilion came in a clear third.  The modern outside doesnt really prepare you for the kitsch interior. Yes it is funky and a bit retro - which would be fine if the rooms were modern. They are not. Checkin was simple and straightforward. Given access card to park the car (in a good sized car park) and was told the card reader doesnt work well and you may need to buzz to bet let in. Lo and behold it didnt work each time. The corridors to the room are drab and depressing.  If you are looking for crisp, warm, coordinated and inviting room in the main hotel this isnt the place. While attempts were made to bring it up to spec, the bathroom is what loses the room points (see photos). The bathroom is very small, dated and disappointing (Curtained bath/shower combined - which if you are tall you will be about 6 inches from the ceiling). While some might like the basin being separate (and beside the entrance like a 80s country hotel) I dont. Sadly I could readily hear the occupants above flush their toilet while I was laying in bed.  Fittings are chipped, scuffed, worn, various finishes and It just didnt gel.  The room AC is constantly on (cant change fan speed and is not particularly quiet letting out an audible 'bang' every now and then). The patched ports in the ceiling areas are simply embarrassing. The new bar fridge is uncovered. The toiletries provided are fixed and bulk dispensed (bodywash, handwash, shampoo/conditioner combined). Felt a bit cheap. The hotel comments as being close to Dickson (Chinatown of Canberra). If close is 1.5km or 150min walk then yes it is close.  The bed is ok (two pillows rest in cupboard) and despite most the rooms being accessed from the central atrium (bar/restaurant) it was not particularly noisy. The linen and carpets were clean. The desk in the room had no lamp (so dont try doing work at night as the only light apart from the beside lamps is a big ugly oyster light at one end of the room. Power points in the main room are all at floor level. If you are not a fussy guest and you are use to staying in country motels/hotels you will like this place. It ticks the BASICS. However if you are use to rooms that are inviting,warm and make you feel good, then this isnt the place. Some photos are included in support of the above.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan
review_471227167~“Excelent value in a very good, well located Hotel”~I have stayed several times at this hotel, however it was the first time stay there for my wife. On previous stays I was in Canberra on business however, this time we were there to attend an Embassy function. Upon entering the Hotel, my wife was immediately taken with the unusual, delightfully set out atrium style lobby. She immediately decided, that she wished to have coffee there when we returned following our evening function. Check in at reception was fast and congenial and our room, with a king and a single bed was spacious, clean, light and well equipped. The bathroom was small, but sufficient. The shower was located above a full bathtub and it was great to enjoy a shower with good water pressure and easy controls. Though we did have a nightcap following our return to the Hotel, the only meal we had was breakfast the following morning. The buffet had nothing wanting. It was well set up well organised and impeccably presented and it was every bit as good as it appeared. The breakfast chef is to be highly commended. Checking out was also quick and efficient and very polite, as were all the staff we encountered during our stay. Parking our car was also easy in a secure, large outdoor carpark. We will definitely return there when visiting Canberra again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_469767213~“Not too bad at all”~A two night stay at the Pavillion during a parliamentary sitting week and as many Canberra travellers know, you grab what you can find. I usually stay at QT.  I must say the room was quite good. The bed was comfortable, the sheets were crisp and the pillows low and firm ( just how I like them!) The room could do with a refresh of the furniture to make it a bit more modern and the bathroom was still displaying its roots from the 70s and 80s with a small low bath and shower curtain. Would be great to have these bathrooms redesigned and add nice tiles and glass surrounds.  A good range of instant coffee including decaffeinated which I love to drink at night and enough milk supplies to have 3-4 cups a day. Had the room service a couple of times and was not disappointed with the basic meals available. The shoe string fries I had with the schnitzel were to die for; hot and crispy! The hotel would benefit greatly from a refresh of the rooms and atrium as I think it's getting a bit dated, but this is nothing the staff can be held account for and all my dealings with them showed excellent customer service. Well done team! The only gripe for me was the wifi internet (this is where they lost the fourth rating point for me). I can't believe in 2017 that they still restrict access through Intertouch and limit you to 1 GB per day. I thought the days of limits on internet access were long gone. People stream directly to their devices these days as TV is so boring. Slow internet speeds and restrictive download limits are almost non existent nowadays and places like QT have free unlimited wifi at lightning speeds for literally only a few dollars more per night.  Perhaps the property management group could invest in a more modern internet service provider. Intertouch are money hungry pirates and should be avoided in my opinion. Overall a pleasant stay and happy to recommend it to other travellers.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469328170~“Rosella Room”~The renovated suite was superbly appointed. The only noted shortcoming was the lack of a vanity light over the mirror in the bathroom.

Bar menu is good value and the drink prices are reasonable. The atrium area is very pleasant to have a drink or meal at.

Car parking is secure but sometimes a little overcrowded.  The restaurant was very accommodating , especially with the children's menu and special dining area.

He then took consul with the Duty Manager who I personally think is a Racist Anglo Aussie refused to give me the room with a balcony and to make it even more convincing went on to lie that they were booked out entirely for the next 9 days. He was totally unapologetic and had that arrogant insolent look about him. Must have got his hotel management qualifications from the back of his Cereal Box.  Why wasn't I informed of this earlier?? And why did I get two different answers from the people that are the face of this hotel.  Oh and don't use the spa I'm thinking these jets haven't been properly cleaned in 4 years!!

review_463624982~“Atrium Style Hotel”~I stayed for one night in February 2017 and this was my first visit since 2012. Not much has changed over the past 5 years since my last visit and the fit out in the hotel needs upgrading.  You will find the Atrium area very pleasant and particularly for any business meetings or social gatherings. I must compliment the staff who went out of their way to help. As I said previously the hotel needs a refurbishment and the staff programmed my room key six times before we could enter the room. They were helpful and kept trying to assist. The rooms were clean and fairly spacious. If like sport on cable TV, that is all you get with 4 sport channels and not much else which was a little disappointing. All in all fair value for money as this is not an overly expensive place. Take care with accommodation in Canberra when parliament is in session as the accommodation options are fairly limited.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_463623216~“Good hotel but in need of a freshen up.”~We stayed at the Pavilion for 1 night. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to assist. The room was clean and tidy and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very small and almost impossible for 2 people to use to get ready for meetings. There are a distinct lack of mirrors in the room - just one in the bathroom area so a husband and wife getting ready for a meeting together will struggle in the small space. We had breakfast which was ok - however the chef needs to learn how to make scrambled eggs that don't resemble lumpy wallpaper paste! In all it was a pretty standard hotel breakfast but not very inspired. In general the hotel feels a bit tired and in need of a freshen up, The new light rail will be opening in front soon and create better access to the hotel as well.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_462751289~“good hotel”~stayed for 3 nights for business, stayed in a suite. The ambient with the big atrium and tropical plants is nice. The hotel appears clean and well maintained. The Suit was roomy and reasonably modern, bed was firm pillows are a bit high. aircon was old styl aircon which can't be switched off and causes the windows to vibrate and rattle. My room was in the second building out the back 3rd floor and was reasonably quite otherwise. the bathrooms are a bit dated, had a old plastic spa bath which when used all smelled mouldy. The hot and cold tab are unusual and if not careful it's easy to burn yourself as the water is scolding hot. an old analog TV in bed room was out of place and did not seem to work anymore in the morning. Living room had a bigger LED which needed to be switched on by hand. picture quality was pretty average. we had free wifi (pretty slow) but found out on the second day it was only valid for one of our days of stay. We had the breakfast buffet which was hot and cold and well appointed. Unfortunately the Nespresso coffee machine is set to luke warm so no hot coffee unless you order and pay extra. Two coffee machines but with the small Nespresso milk containers one seemed to be always empty. breakfast times on the weekend start a bit late at 7am especially given the Canberra show was on some adjustment could have been made. Secure parking was good to have and our cars felt safely parked off street.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_460978790~“Excellent location”~I like to tell it how it is! Previous comments show the hotel has a very diverse reputation! My opinion is that is correct. We would not class it as four and a half star - more three and a half as it lacked the little things a four and a half is known for!  What we liked was the setting of the Atrium bar and restaurant- this is a big drawcard. We found some of the staff in the restaurant/bar were not attentive to the patrons as they could have been... our room was clean and we were happy with the housekeeping on the whole. We ate at the restaurant one night and although happy with our meal felt the menu was fairly limited. The bar meals were less expensive, nicely served and ample. We found this hotel noisy on the inside! Our room was above the kitchen and below the conference room so we heard chairs being scraped across the floor etc from above and from below lots of banging and never ending purr from the cooler room or fridge...at night this noise seemed to intensify. We also found that housekeepers started their weekday shifts early and so the passage noise from them knocking and calling out didnt allow for peaceful morning routines.  The bathroom in our room was very small but adequate..and yes, if you wanted a bath the soap situation would have been an issue.  Right outside the hotel we found the bus stop and so were able to use the buses for our entire stay..cheap at $4.60 per day for Seniors. The hotel being on the main thoroughfare gave excellent location. At present the light rail work is being undertaken but we did not find this a problem. The free secure parking was a welcome bonus. On our arrival the staff member who checked us in perhaps needs more confidence in being friendly but we didn't see him at reception at other times and found the other reception staff excellent and of great help.

Accessible to the city and Dickson for an extremely reasonable price. Will definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458775195~“Needs updating!”~This establishment needs updating. We upgraded to an apartment to ensure a walk in shower which was fine with ample hot water on demand. There were no utensils or crockery, no microwave, the jug had to be filled at the handbasin via a glass and in places the carpet was bare. Comfortable bed and working air-conditioning. Breakfast was adequate with the usual offerings. Good location and easy taxi services to the centre and attractions. Suitable for a brief stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458029602~“Good business accomodation”~Stayed at the Pavilion for 5 weeks while in Canberra for work. Good basic accomodation, but nothing special. The indoor garden with hundreds of assorted tropical plants and a fish pond was a highlight. Rooms comfortable and spacious. Bathrooms will need an upgrade in a couple of years.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_457996719~“Comfortable”~Secure easy parking. Friendly staff. Very clean. Comfortable bed. We have stayed here several times. Bathrooms a bit dated eg step over bath for the shower. Quiet despite work on light rail on Northbourne. Lovely bistro area for a quiet drink coffee or light snack. Formal dinning available.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457990646~“An aged lady who is still showing some class”~Great location. The pool is a saviour in summer. Staff attentive and helpful. Air conditioning in the rooms struggles - the pedestal fan that was requested was provided promptly. Had to train house keeping that towels thrown in the bath need to be replaced with fresh ones - we got there~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457480279~“A great stay.”~Great 3 night stay in January 2016 in Suite 250, looking out on the main road (Northbourne Avenue) I had no trouble with road noise, a good room and bed.  Had 3 excellent breakfasts, all staff were friendly and helpfull.  Free secure parking was a bonus and with a few minutes drive to the city centre, 4 km.  A bus stop virtually outside if you dont have a vehicle. Also one km from the Dickson Shops, a wonderful eating area known locally as Chinatown, many restaurants. Book in advance for promotion rates Can only recommend the Pavilion on Northbourne, thanks for a great stay.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_457226816~“Visit Canberra”~Close to Dickson shopping and 10 mins from major attractions. Free secure parkingAnd friendly wait staff. Curly fries on the in room menu are the best. In fact in room menu one of the best I've seen. Paid for balcony room in hotel, don't needn't have wasted $40 view of wall and ugly back of hotel stuff when sitting.. people looking into my room from adjoining window. Don't get the room near the conference room either, people outside our door, really loud woke us up.. seemed annoyed when we tried to exit our room. Bed looked nice but pillows were? And paintwork a bit tired, mini bar package available on request. Wall toiletries provided, bathroom a bit squashy, no bickies. Price point good, if we had not run into the conference and felt balcony extra $ a con. No redress from management on departure, no warning on check in.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456832484~“Pavilion stay”~A very pleasant hotel with excellent meals. The pool was a little difficult for anyone with a disability such as knee problems and the hotel was quite a distance from the CBD. The shuttle was good but limited so taxi fares added a lot to our stay. Overall a very nice place to stay with helpful staff~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456662835~“Love this place”~Love this place, our home away from home, have stayed here many times over many years and it has always been great. Used the pool for the first time in January, it was lovely. Good to see Dan back, we missed him on our last stay. Love the Restaruant and staff are always so friendly. We will return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456508353~“Tired”~Have previously stayed in the new apartments and they were excellent. Stayed in one of the rooms around the garden. It was tired and very basic and certainly not the 4 and a half stars advertised. You can do better. The garden bar is nice but the chairs are old can greasy. Ewww.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456344551~“Spacious apartment and close to what we wanted”~Single bed uncomfortable and lumpy, but others great. A bit noisy being on main road. You can hear people downstairs waiting for rides near gate. I would stay again, and try (again) for room at the back.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_456252660~“It's average with room for improvement”~Overall hotel (nice), parking(free), room and seating areas (nice and clean).  Check in/out a breeze. The room AC control doesn't really work for cooling, as hotel staff informed me that the entire hotel is set at the same controlled temperature. Not good if you like a cool room. All documentation noted free Wifi, however when you log in, its for 1GB. The wifi access code changed daily, which wasn't explained and I used my phone data. Food / beverage expensive - even to the extant of being charged for changing a condiment on a burger. I booked late check-out.... either House-keeping wasn't informed or they ignored this and started knocking on the door early to clean/prepare the room. That was $40 well spent!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454866714~“Stop over”~Usually stay as a stop over  Like the fact that you can open the window Stay away from rooms in the front A lot of traffic noise and the construction of the new metro. Overall the hotel is good value if you get a deal Bathrooms all, need an update but are still functional. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454200100~“Star Rated and Moderately Priced”~Just for the night, a once revered hotel, showing a bit of age but excellently maintained and squeaky clean. Very comfortable bed and very quiet night's sleep. The staff are very friendly with the air that nothing is too hard for them. Thank you for a great night's stay.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454172647~“Basic & a tad tired - go elsewhere.”~I travel for business (in excess of 40 + days/nights pa) and I thought I'd give the Pavilion another go........I wish I hadn't. Wotif had an attractive rate that hooked me & the establishment matched this price, apparently this is a 'Deluxe' room, home for tonight is literally a matter of metres from the bar/restaurant, the room is basic and not that clean, the bathroom/shower is tiny and worn, this presents more like a 2/3 star hotel than its given 4.......do yourself a favour and jump down the road to the 'Rex' - that's where mine and my staffs dollars will now be parked. Sorry Pavilion on Northbourne but I can see no value (even at the discounted 'wotif' rate that you matched) with what you offered up.  - onwards and upwards.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453467912~“HOMELY HOTEL ONLY 6 MIN DRIVE TO CBD !!”~I frequently visit Canberra and on this occasion chose The Pavillion on Northborne as I found it the most reasonably priced for a hotel with a swimming pool.  The hotel is very nice from the moment you step inside. There is a large open Pavillion with timber and indoor plants all around. Very relaxing, it looks like a typical indonesian style set.  The staff were all very efficient and polite. Check in and check out easy and quick. Buffet breakfast avail, also a bar area in the main lobby where you can have a relaxing drink at the end of your day. The rooms were spacious with a double and single bed in our room.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_452907467~“tropical hotel”~We arrived mid afternoon and the check in staff were very proficient and helpful - lift to our room on 2nd floor (only 3 floors) and we looked down to the open tropical palm bar and snack bar - looked very cool and restful. At first sight our room look very acceptable - one double and one single bed, small bathroom with separate hand basin while toilet and shower/bath shared a small separate room/space. As with some hotels these days the toiletries were not there, only a pump style hand wash at the basin (and no where to hang a hand towel). The aircon did not work properly (It was a hot day 33c) and this made the room uncomfortable especially during the night. The shower over the bath was not good for older people and the shower fittings needed fixing, water sprayed all over the room from ceiling to floor. TV reception was poor - wifi free and easy to connect. The dining room was very pleasant with happy staff and good food although the hand cut chips we too large and not crisp as chips should be, the roasted chicken galanti and the scollops were presented well and very nice - we had to wait for a long time between coursers and for that the one desert ordered was a compliment from the kitchen. Wine was the normal price for hotels and restaurants. We would stay at this hotel again and check we received a better style room., eg walk in shower and working air conditioning.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_452484441~“Needs up dating and would be a better place to stay.”~Close to town and plenty of parking , Breakfast was very good $20 a head, help your self Breakfast. Rooms need up dating very badly, air con in room not work ,stains on carpet. Bath room cracked tiles and marks on walls. And at 5.00 am in the morning fire alarm went off, every one had to get out of hotel. Faulty fire alarm in kitchen .Staff were good but I think they should have given every one late cheek out time for the trouble.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_452186817~“Old and tired, quite disappointing”~Pavilion is very much in need of refurbishment -- the carpets are stained and worn, the car park security gate mostly failed to work, the whole place just looks tired. When we arrived at 1 pm we were told our room was not ready, even though that was the nominated check-in time, and that it would not be ready for 1.5 hours. No reason was given and there was no suggestion of a genuine apology. On the plus side, the bar food and service were excellent.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452052499~“Lovely stay”~Hotel gave us a lovely experience all together. Spacious clean rooms, lovely food and friendly staff. Only concern was the air conditioning which was not working at all and very slow internet connection.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451345994~“Nice Hotel/Apartments.”~The hotel is on Northbourne Ave, close to the city centre, and everything is easy to get to. Plenty of parking. The pool was great for kids and adults alike. Airconditioning in the room we were in was poor. Some other guests were offered a fan when they complained. Rooms were very clean, and the buffet breakfast was very good. The gym is small but has everything you need, and there was a guest laundry. Recommended for families or business travellers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451342155~“Quick trip away”~Very friendly staff, good location. Would stay again if in area. Had onsite restaurant but did not use. Good parking at rear. Within driving distance to town and easy to find. Reasonably priced for time of year.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451071886~“Summernats stay”~Relaxing/individual was a trip that felt like we were in the hotel alone except for the fact the cleaning fairys came I and was tidied up for you and the food was made whenever you wanted great experience would stay again!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450828711~“Be wary of misleading web pages”~Stayed at Pavilion a couple of years back and would like to have stayed once again. Checked prices with booking sites, then checked with the hotel's web page. Great news - 'ROOMS FROM $109.00" However, entered my dates and prices actually ranged from $150-160.00 per night.  Questioned this with the hotel and 24 hours later (prompt response?) advised that the rate of $109.00 applies in 'low season' and will be available in August. Today is Jan 10th. Well, there's promotional advertising and there's misleading advertising. I do not know how anyone can keep a straight face responding to an request to explain such a disparity and then having to respond with this ludicrous claptrap.  Looking elsewhere this trip.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449515452~“Well worth a stay!”~The Pavilion on Northborne was a wonderful place to stay. Convenient to get to, with plenty of off-road (secured) parking. The hotel was beautifully set out with planted 'rainforest' areas throughout. While I did not eat at the restaurant I did have several drinks ($9 for schooner of beer) at the bar. Good selection available. The hotel is very close to Dickson shopping area and this meant there were quite a few dining options nearby. While originally booking a standard room for $110/$120 I was offered an upgrade to a Spa Room for an additional $40 / night which I happily did.  The room I was given on the third floor (elevator access) was extremely spacious, clean and comfortable. Lounge / kitchen area was more than adequate living space. Bedroom had very comfortable bed and desk to work at. Bathroom was very spacious. Spa was vast! Ordered room service breakfast in the morning and it was delivered on time - and with plenty of variety to choose from.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_449425945~“Weekender in Canberra”~Service and parking good. The green foyer/bar area lovely and unique and very nice to sit in and relax at end of the day. Nice change to be able to open the window for natural air ventilation and room clean. Booked on a site (and it's own sign) as four stars, but I'd say three to three and a half. Had a small TV that took ages to become functional/warm up, and I think bulk wall mounted squeeze packs for bathroom toiletries is definitely three star (or less) without any body cream. Additionally for those who must use a bath, the wall mounted squeeze bottles can not be accessed/used in a bath. Otherwise, hotel easy to access, always got a park, close as well to eating hub of Dickson.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449405328~“Great Quality and Service”~My wife and I stayed overnight at the Pavilion on two occasions in October and November last year, on our way to and from a visit further south. A little bit of luxury is welcome to anyone and that is what we experienced. The room was spacious and comfortable, service friendly and efficient, and the one diinner we had ther was tasty and economic. We would be happy to stay there again.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_449075047~“Simple and elegant ”~Centrally located in Canberra and good value for money. The venue is equiped with pool,gym,facilities and a it has a beautiful restaurant within a inbuilt garden inside the hotel. This was amazing. Good food all round friendly staff. The rooms were quite nice up to expectations the air-conditioning was very poor it had central air-conditioning which i found was very poor our room was hot had to to open the window to keep it cool mind u and this was summer in Canberra.spoke to reception abt it but do didnt get much help from them all they said was give it time and it will cool up.also found the wife signal was not strong in the room but ok in common areas.found a piece of hair in one of the bar snacks and brought it up with the staff member but didnt get a strong apologie for it i felt as it was none of there business.  Overall a lovely place to be enjoyed our stay there hope the management will look into the faults and concerns and look forward to being there again. Highly recommended for families~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449036404~“I Recommend this hotel”~Beautiful hotel with enough free car parks. Room was spacious and clean. Everything was prepared. Lobby was really green and refreshing although I don't give it five stars because it is not one of those luxury new ones and I expected a more friendly welcome when i got there but still recommend it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448762345~“Great base for a week in Canberra”~We stayed at the Pavilion for seven nights over the New Year. It is a reasonable walk to the CBD but is on a bus route with frequent buses. The room was slightly dated but was a good size, clean and a very comfortable bed. The staff are great. The restaurant/bar have a good menu with variety at reasonable prices. We were able to eat for each of the seven nights without having to go elsewhere. We recommend the Pavilion as a great base for a holiday in Canberra. Great value for money.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_448215464~“An oasis in the city”~We stayed for one night on New Year's Eve & were pretty impressed with this place. Our room was on the ground floor & we entered it via the indoor gardens, bar & restaurant. The room was very quiet & a good size - we had a queen & single bed.  We'd booked the buffet breakfast & it was one of the best buffets we'd tried. Not an extensive choice, but what they had was delicious.  Our only negative was the other guests' kids in the pool. There were heaps of them, being very noisy, jumping in & splashing us adults. So we didn't stay very long. Overall, great value, close to the city & the service was great.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448170747~“The best bed I have ever slept in anywhere!”~The front desk staff were superb -- very efficient and friendly in spite of being hugely overworked. The room was very well presented. The bed was the best I have slept in, anywhere in the world. I realise the tariff for my room was exceptionally low because of Christmas time but the regular rates offer very good value. The TV reception was very scratchy on several channels but, no doubt, something easily fixed.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_447937777~“Overnight Stay”~Overall hotel needs an upgrade looking old and tied rooms very small not much room to move around bath rooms definitely need an upgrade for this price range considering what others offer restaurant facilities where good food was good and breakfast was the usual buffet style~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_447348788~“Could be better”~Stayed for three nights over Christmas at this hotel in a one bedroom apartment. Apartment was comfortable, but needed an update. Bed was very hard. Very old TV in bedroom. Housekeeping missed us altogether one day, even though we had called to check - we ended up calling for clean towels late in the day. Our major annoyance though was the terrible free wifi, absolutely useless. When we made queries about it, we were told on each occasion that "'you're the first to ring about it today'', which we simply did not believe. We were referred to the 1300 number of the external internet provider - the hotel itself could do nothing about it. As someone who always uses an iPad when travelling, the lack of internet was awful when planning places to visit in Canberra, theatre times, etc. We've never struck this problem before at other hotels or motels, so we were very disappointed. We probably would not recommend this hotel for that reason.~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan~3~nan
review_447326372~“One more stay at The Pavilion Northbourne”~The Atrium houses check in, bar and restaurant and all rooms open onto it providing a comfortable relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. Because it is several stories high the sound dissipates well staying low level.  Rooms are comfortable with proficient service. Menu is straight forward being easy to understand and variable without being extensive making choice quick and simple. Full breakfast with many self serve options was better than expected. Lunch dinner and room service all available.The Pavilion has a business centre handy for photocopying and getting stuff done away from your room. Have not been there for years but still enjoy returning to that Atrium!~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_445932234~“quick stop over”~While our stay for for one night only, I found the rooms suitable for our needs, close to the city and easy to find. Free parking was available. A lot of facilities were available and Im sure a longer stay would have seen us access these. The full buffet breakfast and barista coffee was a great way to start the day. Room Service is available 24 hours.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445392378~“Nice hotel in a good location”~I stayed in a standard suite which consisted of a separate lounge and bed area. The bathroom was huge. Everything was clean and tidy. Wifi did not work so well in some areas of the suite. A personal pet peeve of mine is that I didn't like having my toilet paper and tissues folded into a triangle shape each day. To me it seems outdated and a bit icky. Overall though, the hotel was nice and pleasant. A short 10 minute walk down the road to the Dickson main area will lead to a large number of restaurants, plus a supermarket and service station.~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_444958442~“Underwhelming ”~Booked a 2 bedroom apartment for 2 nights for our family to have a quick look around Canberra. Central location and decent sized apartment, although I can't imagine being able to do any cooking in the kitchen. The reception and communal areas are attractive, albeit a bit time-warpish! The apartment was dated and carpet was water stained. Aircon worked and everything was clean and comfortable. There was no washing machine, which I had sort of expected being an "apartment". TV had Foxtel but with poor reception and the main bedroom had a older style tv, rather than a flat screen which shows it's age. Parking was free which seems novel for Canberra, so defiantly a plus. Overall, it was a comfortable stay but underwhelming and over priced.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444950018~“Poor value for money”~On the whole we were disappointed with our stay. Mainly based on the price. The rooms have reciently been renovated which was nice but the AC vent was a piece of cardboard there were water stains on the carpet the bathroom was outdated and the TV reception was poor. For what we paid I would have expected a lot more.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444370926~“Good and quiet location”~Though the Hotel is in one of the main streets of Canberra, there was no traffic noise in our apartment. The apartment was a two bedroom suit, appointed with all the necessary facilities. A single bathroom for 4 adults was not convenient. Our room was #367 in the annex - with windows facing the glass corridor to the main building, this there was some loss of privacy.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_443884750~“kEITH URBAN CONCERT”~I have stayed at this well located comfortable hotel many times over the years when travelling to Canberra. On this occasion i was disappointed that the hotel did not go out of their way to assist guests who had come for this big event. Given that this hotel and many others were fully booked it may have been an opportunity to offer transport to Canberra Stadium - i believe they offer shuttle service Mon-Fri. Public transport was an issue. The hotel could also have offered bar/coffee for guest on return from concert instead of additional taxi fares to the city. Hotels - support your guests as they have all travelled to spend time and money in Canberra and at your hotel! This was a planned event!~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_443599165~“Good Place to Stay”~Very happy with our stay at Pavilion on Northbourne - greeted by Dan on check-in who was lovely and welcoming. Room was very clean and a good size. Dont like having to stand in a bath to have a shower but the water was very hot and the shower head was a good height (so helpful when you are tall!.) The mattress could do with replacing and the pillows were not very comfortable but these were our only negatives. Had dinner in the car area and buffet breakfasts - lots of good food choices and the staff were very helpful. Would definitely consider staying again.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443443494~“Excellent stay”~Great stay - most of the staff were very helpful and friendly, great service, very secure big car park, 24 hour front of house desk. Lovely well appointed rooms, spotlessly clean, serviced both days. Excellent stay will be staying there again.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_441033746~“A worthy choice for a Canberra stay”~Recent stay to fill the gap on a Saturday evening between a social dinner and a drive back to Melbourne. Chose this on price point (via Qantas website) and location on Northbourne Avenue, for easy access to the Barton Highway onto the Hume. Pleasantly surprised with this choice of accommodation. With the light rail works underway in the median strip, you need to find a spot to get to the right side of Northbourne Avenue for access, if you are heading from Civic or Canberra southside. Easy parking at the door to check in but there were other cars in front so you are at the mercy of them moving to get to the car parking, post check-in. I had booked online earlier the same day but they had all my details and all the paperwork was ready. A very welcoming greeting from the Reception team. You need to leave a credit card deposit of $100 as a pre-authorisation, regardless of whether you have paid in advance for the room. There was a wedding reception occurring that evening and based on that was provided a room on the third floor, on the opposite side of the Reception. Good to be warned but I was heading out anyway. After check in, returned to my car to find parking at the rear of the building. Plenty of (self) parking and noticed the high fencing around all the car parking which made the outdoor parking feel quite secure. Car park was busy owing to the wedding but returning later that evening there were still parks available, albeit, around the rear of the building. Sought a small jug of skim milk and some ice at the bar area and provided with both with a smile despite the team being busy preparing for the function ahead. Plenty of air conditioning throughout the building but the air conditioning in the room was not so functional – a small dial to register the temperature but no real air flow noticed. One large window in the room which could be opened, but there was no flyscreen so opted not to manage flying insects throughout the night and left that closed. Room a little stuffy as a consequence. Linen was nice quality and bed was on the firm side but comfortable enough – good to see a mattress protector and the top mattress with a spill proof cover. Bathroom has a small newly renovated vanity and a separate cubicle with the toilet and shower over bath. Bath was not full length and small however shower was good pressure and plenty of hot water – two ticks here! Configuration of the bathroom was awkward layout and shower/toilet area was really tiny – not much room to move around. Pleased to find a decent hairdryer in one of those ‘hairdryer’ drawstring bags and not those wall-fixed fiddly little white things that blow a bees breath. Room lighting was on the dull side. TV worked fine. A small cabinet with cups, plastic glasses and tea/coffee (instant) along with a jug. Turned the temperature up on the refrigerator to chill water to take the next day and the water was lovely and cold the next morning. No time to sample breakfast (reduced price if pre-purchased at check in) this time. Check out efficient. Location is between Dickson shopping precinct (Woolworths) and the Braddon area – which is fringe Civic. With a car, both locations very easy to access for shopping and eating options; without a car, then a bit of a walk. This accommodation is a worthy choice.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_440983101~“Pavilion stay”~When I got there I was faced with friendly front office staff. They have continued this all the way through my stay and check in experience. As always there is confusion in the F&B Department, however food has improved vastly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440558623~“An Oasis in the Capital”~As usual the staff at this hotel are great. The reception, bar, kitchen and servicing could not be faulted. We were greeted hospitably, served without fuss and catered for very well. Parking was easy and the WiFi was excellent. The hotel is a lovely setting and clean and relaxing. Well done Pavillion. The scrambled eggs in the buffet don't stay warm enough. But the poached eggs are a wonderful alternative.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_440029344~“Biggest breakfast”~The biggest breakfast you can get for $20. Buffet style breakfast that was a large variety to choose from and well presented. Amongst the trees, ferns and many other plants created a beautiful atmosphere. Also went there and enjoyed mocktails in the early evening as it was such a serene atmosphere.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
