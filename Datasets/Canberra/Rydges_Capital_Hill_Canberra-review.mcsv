review_477335877~“Two tales of the room”~Stayed at the honeymoon suite for the spa bath The room is basically split into two sections - old dark room in its original condition and recently added stunning luxurious bathroom and shower facility.  The spa bath is separate from bathroom shower facility and there are a total of three basins! Very spacious and bright! The dining and bedroom is very dark and outdated. In fact it is the darkest hotel I've ever been to! It is in desperate need of more lightings even before talking about room upgrade.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477269324~“Great Stay”~We stayed for five nights, the room was big and comfy.Staff were very friendly and the motel itself is big and well kept. It was within walking distance to the national archives, high court and art galleries and a short drive to anything else. We didn't have any trouble using the free parking, there isn't many spots but we were lucky enough to get one each day. Happy hour at the bar was great value $5 beer and wine. We had the buffet breakfast one morning and it was good but overpriced we didn't eat at the restaurant at all as two of us are vegan and there were no options. My husband and I would definitely stay there again it was a great price for what we got.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_476655467~“Comfort and Style ”~We stayed at Rydges Capital Hill overnight and had a terrific suite. Choosing to overlook the street gave us beautiful trees just beginning to change colour and a deciduous tree with no leaves.  The suite was well appointed with a comfy chair, desk and office chair, tv, couches and best of all there was no road noise. Bedroom was comfortable with both a bath and a shower and a large tv. Bed was wonderful after hours on the road.  We caught up with friends for dinner in the Fig Tree cafe and were not disappointed. For a public holiday there was a good selection with three of our party having the pulled pork burger, slaw and chips and the other two of us having pumpkin ravioli. We were able to sit outside of the main area and have a wonderful catch-up. All plates were empty so that was a strong indication of a meal that hit the spot! Early this morning we awoke to three very cheeky white cockatoos playing in the leafless tree - they gave us a great welcome to the day as well as many laughs with their antics.  Breakfast was good with watermelon juice and the yoghurt berry parfait getting our vote. Parking was well priced, with the disabled park generous thus allowing for the ute to be re-packed easily.  The overall experience is one we would repeat. I will bring my bathers next time as the pool and spa looked most inviting.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476374077~“Old hotel”~We stayed here with 2 small children over Easter long weekend. Hotel was extremely worn out and smelled the same way it looked. We had a embassy suite and the room was really great. The kids had a sofa bed each in lounge room and we had king bed in bedroom. Storage space, Bathroom and bath were enormous. The best thing about this hotel was the room. Wifi worked very well everywhere. We felt the pool was too cold for the kids to swim but we did see many families swimming. Breakfast was horrible!!!! I dreaded every morning going down to eat that rubbish. It was very busy and staff could not keep up with demand. On the last day We ended up going to QT for breakfast as we heard better things. Front desk staff were nice but you could definitely see that they are not used to high occupancy. Another good plus was that they offered late check out promotion till 3pm for $30 which was great for us. Location great too. Overall hotel is old but was worth for the huge room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475728681~“Too many children In the gym”~Went to use the gym and it was over run by children under 10 years old and disinterested parents. Gym's are a dangerous playground for children. Plus try using the running machine with some 5 year old standing at the side grizzling that she wants a turn. Rydges check your policies for appropriateness.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_474925618~“Family getaway .”~Stayed for 2 night during the holidays. Very close to attractions and a short drive from major shopping centres.

Dirty tables poor service and missed orders. The was clearly no management .~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_474473140~“Thought would be brilliant - but ordinary”~First impression - arched glass way filthy and plastic plants as far as the eye can see. I think the three trees in the area near the dining room were real but everywhere else dreadful plastic. AND I mean everywhere. Ick. Not a big hotel which I like and special requests met. Room quite small with nowhere to sit other than the desk or on the bed. I asked for a chair of some sort to sit and read or have a drink and it had to be brought up especially, but really each room could have just fitted in 2 smallish tub chairs for relaxing. I never understand when room service is also offered but nowhere to sit and eat (on your lap?). No power points except at floor level for recharging phone or using laptop/ipod etc. Only place to boil kettle was in the bathroom. A bit of a mish mash if you ask me. I don't think I'd stay again. Very ordinary.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_474418904~“Weekend away”~Overall the experience was good. Very quick check in (Priority Guest Rewards Member). Received free wi-fi, free basement parking and two water bottles. I think I was supposed to have received two per day, but only received them on the first. Facilities were good. Used the pool and spa on one of the days. Only bought a coffee at the coffee shop, so not sure about food quality. Very close to Manuka shops and dining area. Room was clean and comfortable. We did have an issue with our bed (slopped into middle and very uncomfortable. We brought this up with reception the next day and they said that they would look into it and possibly offer a change of rooms, but nothing was said or done. Apart from this, we had an enjoyable stay. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_473325676~“Do yourself a favour- don't”~They could not find our booking. 2 calls and 45 minutes to fix the TV, after going to reception as no one answered phone, have to read in bed or desk due to poor lighting. after going to reception. Can't adjust air conditioning temperature- is on or off. Dirty spoons in room coffee cups. Safe too high for me to use. Ring housekeeping got reception asked for 2 pillows as no additional in room, told "it will be about 30 minutes as no one is here". PowerPoint for desk on floor, charging phone in bathroom. Little function little service.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473110325~“Good Hotel, Lacks a little in caring for the customer.”~A long wait to check in at about 6.00pm in the afternoon we arrived. Only one person on check in, should have been more at that time of the day. Room was comfortable and beds were good. Our door code refused to work twice during the stay when we came back to the room. Had to leave my wife in the corridor and go down stairs to get this fixed. Reception staff could not have cared one little bit. A bit like tough luck sir!!! The happy hour was excellent and the young lady behind the bar at Capital Bar was excellent. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472840989~“Luxury in Canberra”~Great place for a business trip, nice large comfortable rooms with good wifi, good restaurants (I especially liked the breakfast) and a convenient location.

review_472510464~“Rydges Capital Hill Canberra”~The hotel is in a central location and better value than a number of others. It is undergoing much needed renovations. Rooms large, staff friendly and work hard particularly at breakfast if a rush is on. Insufficient staff if a bus group hit the eatery at once. Covered parking at $12 per night is a bit much as you can park in the street outside for free.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471347950~“Don't stay weekends!”~We stayed here to visit the hot air balloon festival. Unfortunately on the Sat night the noise from 2 weddings within the hotel was exceptionally loud. We couldn't watch tv, read a book, or sleep. We complained to no avail. Staff responded with the most ridiculous statements such as noise like this is normal in hotels across the country, it's just like if there's a party on at your neighbor's house, and that they regularly book loud functions on the weekend as "leisure travelers don't have to get up for 9am business meetings". We had been up since 5:45am for the balloon festival. Yes, functions are a normal part of hotel operations but if you're not a guest at the function you shouldn't be affected. Having now read the reviews on this site I can see this has been a known problem for at least 12 months as has not been rectified. So much for being a "luxury" hotel.  The staff were hopeless and completely unapologetic. The complaints process seemed non-existent. We were informed there was no one on duty with the delegation to refund that night's accommodation or resolve the complaint. On check out Sunday we were assured we would hear by Tuesday regarding a possible refund. We waited. We heard nothing. We emailed head office on the Wednesday and within 30 mins were contacted and a refund was given. We've been staying at this hotel for years and now it's time to find a new place to stay in Canberra.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470730066~“Poor Customer Relations”~We stayed the night here for a weekend away. I am a Rydges member and basucally had a fine comfortable night. The only problem we hadno restaurant service on Sundays so had to go out.  Ae we were not in the room much we did not have a thorough search or look around. On the morning of leaving we decided to have a coffee in the room. Upon looking in the fridge we noticed a small amount of mini fridge liquor. But not the normal selections such as beer soft drinks juuces etc. Looked for a mini bar list but there was none. So we filled out comments card had our coffee and went to reception to check out. There was only one receptionist and she was having a very heavy discussion with a customer about a bill.  We waited with another customer to be served. At no time did rhe receptionist acknoqledge or aoologisefor the delay. After about 10 minutes the customer with the problem left and the receptionist just looked and said "checking out?" I confirmed we were and paid the account. I then mentioned that it seemed the mini fridge was not serviced after previous person as there was not the normal selection. She made a note of it and said we should have contacted earlier when we checked in. I pointed out that we only noticed that morning when we had a coffee in the room. Also there was no list of a mini bar in the room. To which she gave a look that made us feel as if we were being accused of doing the wrong thing.  Overall her manner was extremely poor for a person who is supposed to offer a service to the customer. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469791613~“Extremely disappointed and annoyed ”~Stayed here for 4 nights. Room had light not working. Return air in corridor outside room very loud in middle of night. Been a Rydges member for many years. They refuse to give you the advertised discount of 20% on "all meals and drinks in the bar or restaurant " when you have the buffet breakfast. Had dinner in restaurants and again they refused to provide the discount unless I could Quote my membership number. Which was identified at check in but not put on the booking. When went to the reception to sort it out, the duty manager Sonia was extremely officious and condescending.  Have stayed here numerous times and it has normally been a positive experience. However this stay has resulted in the most appalling service I have received. The cups in the restaurant were dirty. The wine glass from the bar had lipstick marks. What has happened to this motel!!!! Peter Maher~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469476866~“Weekend Rally”~Was part of a car club weekend group booking. This was such a disappointment. Worse hotel experience ever for me and I've travelled a lot. Breakfast tables not cleared, no one offered any service to a table or to show where anything was. Had to chase someone to order a coffee. Bar service dreadful no entertaining of anything not on menu which was limited as they didn't know how to charge. Carpet water stained in hallway on ground floor should be replaced.  Mini bar not restocked at all in four days. No drawers anywhere including bathroom having to keep everyone on bench or in case. One case stand for a twin room and only two towels so requested more which delivered quickly. No bedside table on side with power point.  Housekeeping and reception were really helpful and giving fresh milk and handling queries. Positive - beds really comfy and quiet rooms with blackout curtains. Room was nice and bathroom very modern. TV channels hard to find any as there are many but no guide to which channel is which.  Air con can control by temp its freezing or off and only control fan. Never seen such a weird control system. I am a Rydges member and won't stay here again. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469285027~“Reception staff not attentive”~When checking in reception was busy. Customer in front asked how the receptionist was and he complained about work. 1 receptionist on, hotel was full, 5pm check in. No welcome, no greeting, and walked off half way through serving me. When I left, reception staff provided no greeting and stared at the computer instead of acknowledging me. Rooms fine, but powerpoints so low I could not put my mac charger in the socket. Breakfast OK, but limited selection for cost.~2~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_468433279~“Unexpected Upgrade”~We stayed for 1 night as a Palace of Versailles package. Our tickets to the exhibition were ready on arrival and when we checked in later in the day we were upgraded to a suite, very comfortable. Fantastic bathroom. Our evening meal at the restaurant was very good and the breakfast plentiful. The package was very good value. The staff were very friendly and the service very good. Have stayed at Rydges hotels before and have never been disappointedly at any of the hotels. Would definitely stay here again.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468368296~“Outdated”~Probably great in its day but desperately needs a facelift. Chosen for its location as close to conference venue but it was very average. Room was a good size but outdated. Bathroom needed a good clean as mould in shower corners. Sliding door on balcony came off tracks..so once back on i chose not to use that again :) Bed was comfy and the breakfast had great choices. I got signed up to their rewards Club upon check in for discounts on food and accom (thought may be helpful in future stays)... but.. you can't use this for breakfast.... or room service.....so... very average and will not be staying there again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467971436~“Disappointed”~Stayed for 2 nights. Our room was poorly lit and gloomy, even with the low kW bulbs on. The bathroom had been updated and was nice - except when you step out of the shower you virtually walk straight into the toilet (poor design). Bed was comfortable. On the Saturday night we arrived back at our room at the hotel after a wonderful dinner at a restaurant in Manuka to find that there was a loud function on the ground floor of the hotel and because our room faced the centre atrium the very loud music funneled straight up. We were not informed of this when we made the booking (if we had we would have booked somewhere else). The music was very loud and even with the tv on at the highest volume we were straining to hear it. We were only in Canberra for the weekend from Qld and we had lots planned for the Sunday - we think it is only reasonable to expect a peaceful night sleep when you pay to stay in a hotel. My husband rang down to the front desk at 10.15pm to ask when the music would be turned down and we were informed 11pm. When booking I would definitely recommend you ask for a room that does NOT face the centre of the building which overlooks the eating/bar area. I found the staff at breakfast not to be friendly at all. The staff on checkout were the same - no smiles, no "How was your stay Mr and Mrs....", no "Have a nice day". Sometimes our only personal face-to-face contact with "Rydges Capital Hill" will be with a member of the front reception staff - they can either totally enhance a customers experience or leave the customer disaffected. We will stay somewhere else next time we stay in Canberra.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467651546~“Disappointed”~Took the Versailles package offered, on pre-booking, (on the net) asked for a ground floor near the front. I was given a top floor room almost as far from the front as possible, the hot afternoon sun 'cooked' the room, with the air con not putting much out in the way of cooling. Sorry Rydges, will be staying somewhere else on my next Canberra visit, you have lost us.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan

A three seater lounge, a tub chair and an office chair were comfortable features. All was clean and tidy. Plenty of hot water. Buffet breakfast was adequate and filling with gluten free bread available for coeliacs. Lower ground parking was available at a moderate cost. Joining the loyalty club is recommended and worthwhile.

review_463355178~“Some Good, Some Not So”~We recently spent two nights at Rydges Capital Hill Canberra, taking advantage of their “Versailles – Treasures from the Palace” Package. The package included accommodation in a superior room, parking, full buffet breakfast, tickets to the exhibition at the National Gallery, a two course “French-inspired” meal including a glass of French wine. The accommodation, breakfast and parking were good, as was the location, with only a short drive to the National Gallery. The “French-inspired” menu was uninspiring and the French wine was remarkably ordinary. We had dinner in the Figtree Restaurant on both nights of our stay. On our first night (Sunday) a limited menu was available, and the Capital & Co Bar was closed (although drinks were available in the restaurant). The service was very good that night, but the following night when a full service was available, the wait staff left a lot to be desired. We had to get our own water for the table, and had an unacceptably long wait for the dessert to arrive – at one point, we almost walked out. We had an enjoyable stay, and the hotel is ideally located for events at Manuka Oval, so may use it again. But you may be able to find better options around town if you’re planning to visit the Versailles exhibition.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan

review_460513726~“Disappointing Experience”~Having previously stayed at Rydges Capital Hill on a few occasions, I looked forward to returning again.  Unfortunately, the new room renovations at the hotel have taken away some of the room qualities. The large, double spa was a positive room facility; this has been replaced with a smaller, single bath. The shower space is quite small and the new, fixed screen too narrow. The water then splashes all over the floor, leaving it very wet and slippery.  Also at the time, the room was above was being renovated and the waste chute was right outside the window. This left a day where all that was heard was broken building material crashing into a skip bin. The restaurant appeared under staffed. In the morning, people were standing around waiting for food supplies to be replenished and the range of options were limited as the kitchen couldn't meet the demands. In busy times, tables were hard to find as many were left unattended and piled with dirty plates etc.  Unfortunately, staying again would have to be questioned as it appears the standard has considerably dropped.~2~2~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan

review_458611859~“Storage.....lack of”~This is our favourite hotel in Canberra.....But......a room refurbishment has resulted in a bathroom with absolutely no storage cupboard, shelving or even a vanity top...just a pedestal unit. Likewise, room itself has no bedside units with drawer or cupboard, just a small table top on legs. No drawers in the wardrobe in fact not anywhere to put socks and undies etc. a couple of shelves in fridge cupboard that held phone book, coffee, tea tray etc. so disappointing and easily fixed.....please....as the rest is fabulous.

review_458328854~“Not in the Top Ten”~We drove here from Melbourne to meet with an old friend who lives in Sydney. We were here for three nights. There were some refurbishments going on and we were upgraded to a suite to get us away from the noise. The rooms were commodious to say the least, the bed was beautifully comfortable, but the general decor was much in need of an update except the bathroom which had been brought up to standard. Our room looked out onto the covered area that serves as restaurant and seating area, this rendered the room rather dark and left one with no idea of the weather (which was rather wet) the staff, we found were as seems often to be the case in Aus were very pleasant and helpful. The food in the restaurant both at breakfast and at the one dinner that we had at the hotel was pretty bad and way too expensive and served in the wrong order etc etc. The bar area was buzzy when we used it and the bar staff again very pleasant. The car parking facilities ( beneath the hotel) were not cheap. This is a hotel that thinks it is better than it is, and charges accordingly, the room rate however was not exorbitant but the rooms were not the best either.Generally the place is rather sad and in need of a makeover, which will take forever if they stay open whilst doing it and diminish any credibility they have.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_457729923~“Nice to look at, disappointing to stay”~Nice to look at, disappointing to experience  When we arrived we thought it looked lovely outside and in - pretty gardens, interesting artwork, new bathroom, clean and modern.  However, there were two double beds, with one bedside table between them, where there was plenty of space for 3 or 4. I ended up using the slope-seated swivel chair as a bedside table. The bed was squishy and bounced every time we turned over.  Several of the towels were ragged. The shower had a great supply of beautiful, hot water, but the cheap tapware was difficult to adjust.  The aircon choices were hot, cold, or airless, with no opening windows. Too cold to sleep under only a sheet; too hot for the quilt.  We can't comment on the restaurant or the pool since we didn't use them.  The final disappointment was the bill. We thought that $270 for 2 nights was pretty good. But when they added, without our authorisation, an extra $26.46, I really felt ripped off. I called the hotel the next day when I saw the bank statement, to be told that that was for parking and credit card fees. We were never informed of these costs during check-in, but all I got was "Sorry, the clerk checking you in usually would mention it. I can't do anything about it". Of course it turns out that the parking charge is noted in the booking - way way down in the fine print, but it certainly was not explained by the check-in staff. I will never go back nor will I recommend it to other travelers.~2~2~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan

review_457062905~“So relaxing ”~Stayed 5 nights and found the price offered in mid January was exceptional for what we got. The room was of a very good standard ( yes I had to put the kettle on the floor but that's no big deal), the room was very quiet, had a lovely view so I could watch the sun go down each night in the distance, super comfy bed and pillows, the wifi worked, the cleaning staff were friendly and efficient. the location to the shops and the cinema was a 5 mins walk. We parked on the street no problems. Maybe we got lucky as some of the reviews from posted here aren't very complimentary. I would definitely go again as Canberra has so much to offer.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455735049~“Lovely stay and the most helpful reception staff!”~We had a lovely time at this hotel, extremely comfortable king size bed (although the fold out sofa for the kids was terrible), great pool, awesome breakfast, and convenient location. The best part of this hotel was the amazing staff, every person we spoke to at the front desk was super helpful and accommodating, making us AND our kids feel very welcome, it made all the difference. The one big negative was the restaurant dinner we had - it was not great. The kids chicken schnitzel ($12) was just a big processed chicken nugget (awful), the burger was dry, the fish frozen rather than fresh, and the ravioli not made on site (it was a bit Gordon Ramsay kitchen nightmares to be honest). So we would definitely stay here again, we just wouldn't eat at the restaurant (other than for breakfast which was amazing in comparison to dinner). Thanks to all the lovely staff for making our stay fabulous!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

It just has space and feels uncrowded. Parking is convenient and relatively cheap. The facilities, like pool and spa are great but could be open for longer hours. It is out of CBD but close to Parliament House and National Art Gallery.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453941267~“Good for the price but sneaky credit card charge so pay cash”~Stayed for one night on a breakfast package and ok budget buffet inc. juice, fruit, cold and hot buffet inc scrambled eggs and bacon strips (but not the eye) and a coffee machine. Extra if you want a cappuccino which is fair enough. Free parking is about 12 spots outside or on the surrounding streets after 6pm M-F or 2 hrs otherwise or pay inside. Pool is good indoor and spa is above ground style but fine and gym. Our room was renovated and quiet on the weekend but aircon has no temp control- only a hot or cold setting and fan speed - so was freezing or off but must be old system! Building is dated but as I said couples queen room was smaller but comfortable and renovated bathroom and furnishings. Cheeky $6.13 transaction fee on $175 has put a bad taste on the night though, as not upfront or I would have paid cash! You only find out on the emailed invoice; as at internet checkout it said $175! I am sure they will say it is in the fine print or links.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453881598~“Nice room but don't eat here”~This stay was for business. The room was clean, good bed and bathroom. Check in fine however check out was very slow with only one staff member trying to help all. We had dinner in the restaurant that night which had been prearranged but went totally wrong. Poor choice of foods to select from, not enough in stock so not everyone got their first choice and had to select again. After being told there were only two steaks left suddenly more were found but they were very tough. The waitress was also not very helpful at all. Very poor customer service indeed.  Breakfast wasn't much better with the worst quality and range of fruit available. Would stay at the hotel again as it is well located but would not eat here at all.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453277089~“Expected better”~We felt that this hotel was disappointing for Canberra we expected more for the cost of $150 per night. The hot tub was smelly and didn't work properly and the amenities around the pool were minimal. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_453195973~“Great hotel”~Booked 2 rooms double rooms. Bathroom has been updated and was of a good size. Beds are super comfy and rooms are very quiet and very clean. We used the swimming pool which provided some pool toys for the kids. The hotel is in walking distance to Manuka shops. This is my 2nd time that we have stayed here and will definitely be staying again next time in Canberra.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_453190613~“Terrible and rude staff.”~We booked two nights at this hotel since we have stayed here before and thought we would give them another chance. Well this was the worse stay ever. WE checked in at 2pm as per check in time only to be told that one of the rooms was not ready and they weren't sure when it would be. After about 2 hours of waiting we found out from one of the cleaning staff that the room wasn't ready because they had painted one of the walls at 2.30pm and were waiting for it to dry before we could go into it. Are you kidding me? You were going to put people into a room that was just painted with all the paint fumes. They thought we couldn't smell it. After refusing to go into that room which wasn't ready anyway, we requested another room. After being told that the hotel was full, they miraculously found another room for us. Funny isn't it? One of the cleaning staff had told me that she would sleep in that room if it was her because it was fresh paint and wouldn't smell. She must have no sense of smell. If you have people checking in at 2pm why would anyone paint the room at 2.30pm. Makes me wonder what the hell happened in that room that you would have to paint it at such late notice. Who knows? The entire staff was rude and especially the girl at Reception when I checked in. This is the last time we will ever go to Rydges Capital Hill. No one here knows what the other person is doing and they really are unbelievable. Just skip past this hotel and find another in Canberra, there are plenty around.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~1~nan
review_452895526~“Disgusted, DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!”~This hotel is absolutely terrible, I will never stay at another Rydges again. The rooms are tiny and i booked a queen room but instead got 2 double beds, the bathroom is very run down, the indoor pool STINKS, very dusty and very very very over proiced for what you get!!! not happy~2~nan~nan~nan~1~1~3~nan
review_452517338~“Good and easy place to stay”~Good place for couples to stay and enjoy the breakfast. Not as great for families unless they are young as the rooms are smallish, but overall a good place. We booked through wotif and like many places always search for deals.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_452101390~“Good location and very good value”~The hotel is in a great location, only a few minutes' walk from Manuka where there are lots of places to eat. There is an underground car park, a bit cramped and hard to manoeuvre a large car around! The days I were there were very hot, and the air-conditioning on level 3 was not keeping up. The friendly receptionist Nicole kindly found another room on level 1 which was perfect. And included complimentary breakfast as compensation, a very nice touch. Booked through Booking.com and it was very good value.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_450795936~“Bit dated and food is over-priced”~Rooms are a bit dated and daggy but a good size and good lay out. Room service food took over an hour, after being told when ordering it would only be half an hour. The food that eventually arrived was pretty ordinary.. A smaller than entree sized ravioli for $26!!!!!.... Way too expensive for what it is! Had a similar problem to other posters, in that the bar was closed when we wanted a 5 o'clock beer. Most staff were pretty good, business-like etc, but not particularly warm or friendly. Cheap toilet paper. Leaking bathroom sink. Towels were threadbare. Pillows are a bit lumpy.... All minor things but they all add up to a 2-3 star experience, not a 3-4! ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450045020~“2 NIGHT STAY”~Stayed for 2 night in a Embassy Suite. There were 5 of us and the room was very spacious although with kids a table and chairs would have been good to eat at. We only had 1 chair between 5 of us. Buffet breakfast was great with a good selection.  The Restaurant for dinner had a very limited menu with only 2 main meals. Would have been nice to eat there as they had a deal where kids eat free but due to the limited menu choice we went elsewhere.  Pool and spa area was great. Overall was a nice clean place to stay.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_450016138~“It's brown”~Stayed here the few days between Xmas and New Year. First impression upon eventually getting into our room was "it's brown". The carpet was brown, the walls are brown, the bedding is brown, the curtains are brown, the coffee and side table are brown, extremely underwhelming really. After reveling in all of the brown-ness I thought that a brown frothy beverage was in order and made my way to the bar that is advertised in the foyer, lifts etc. When I arrived I was confronted by a sign informing me that the bar was closed for a number of days. Interesting. The sign says I can get said beverage in the restaurant, so off I go.  Asked the lass serving what the story was with the bar, was told that "it's a quiet time of year" and "weren't you told at booking or check in?" (Answer was no). After a beer I decided the go back to the room. Neither card worked. Proceeded to reception to have this rectified and asked the question about the bar and was informed that "bar staff need holidays too" and there are a number of good bars locally. This was all within an hour of checking in for a 4 night stay. Had to get the room keys activated a number of other times because, apparently, putting them anywhere in our wallets caused them to fail. Dinner was expensive and nothing to write home about. Staff were polite but quite disinterested. Pretty disappointing for what used to be the jewel in the crown of accommodation in Canberra~2~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_449519410~“South side”~Comfortable and spacious room. Undercover parking at a cost. Breakfast typical hotel buffet style. Best to walk to Manuka or Kingston for dinner. Great choices for restaurants there. Free wifi. Helpful staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449509327~“Disappointing; here's why”~This hotel is impressive when you first enter the expansive lobby. We parked in front, mindful of the signs that said we needed to check in before we attempted to park.  The lobby is large, light, and leads off to the bar, dining room and a semi-garden style atrium sort of set up. Unfortunately on our arrival the tables were dirty, and plates of half-eaten food were lying about.  We arrived late afternoon and were the only people checking in. Just as well. We were obviously a serious inconvenience to the guy working reception. Checked our booking (slowly), handed us our room keys, gave us a single drink card and told us parking as $12 if we wanted it. We did. To say he was uncommunicative is being kind.  Our room was OK. The coffee table was large, allowing just on 15 cm between the coffee table and the bed. The furnishings were in reasonable condition although the electric jug needed a bit of a clean. The toilet had an interesting habit of re-filling MOST of the time, but it wasn't too difficult to just take the top off, poke the plastic piece that made it refill. However, the clunking noise in the airconditioner was a bit more problematic. We tried changing fan speed, etc. but it really didn't help. It clunked and knocked off and on all night. We went downstairs to the lobby to have our one shared drink. The restaurant attendant was chatting with other staff (oblivious to the tables spilling over with dirty plates, glasses, half-eaten food, etc.). She offered to sell us another drink after pointing out the restrictions on the free drink we had as Priority members. We decided to share our single beer.  We got a newspaper to read and saw a stack of magazines laid out. Were they for use by guests, for sale, or what? We were obviously standing there quite near the reception guy, looking at them, but he studiously completely ignored us. I asked about the magazines and was told they were free. Which was nice, actually, as there was a selection of Marie Clare, InStyle, Vogue, etc.  I then asked about the wifi and was told -- abruptly -- I was given the password with our room keys (I wasn't). I was given another slip of paper but made to feel I had been very remiss in misplacing something that I had surely been given. Didn't argue as he had already lost interest and gone back to studying his computer. I was dismissed and so went back to the room with my magazines.  When the best part of your stay at a hotel is a free magazine I think that says everything that needs to be said.  Oh, and checking out the next morning....a long, long wait for the one (eventually two) staff who didn't seem to actually know the process.  Staff and maintenance make a major impact on guests. This hotel fails in both areas.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449365493~“Comfortable hotel; good location”~Very comfortable rooms (had booked 2, both were good rates but no breakfast included), appeared to be recently renovated, bathroom in very good condition. Free WiFi that actually worked for the duration of stay (2 nights). Air conditioning in room lacks individual control other than setting hot or cold and fan settings, no temp control which is annoying. Parking was $12 / night which was ok, but for Canberra it could be free perhaps, as it is in some other places we have stayed at previously. At time of arrival reception was staffed by only one person and there was a 10 minute delay while one customer sorted out some issue. Surely, another staff member could be found to speed up check in for the other 4 people waiting!? Thanks to whoever found my wife's prescription sunglasses and returned them to reception!~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_449076000~“Central location but aged facility ”~Location wise, this hotel is near all the major attractions by walking. Manuka is also walking distance.  However the hotel is aged. Rooms are a good size but all the power outlets are flush with the floor so some chargers cannot be used. Only wall Outlets are in the bathroom.  Carpets around the lounge bar smelt musty. Some staff were friendly while others made me feel like I was an inconvenience.  Food service was good and the range ok, prices were mid range due to closeness of a number of options.  Pay extra for parking. Health club and pool looked ok.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448776030~“Very Disappointing”~As a frequent visitor to Canberra, I was so hopeful for this hotel. We came to spoil our daughter who had a rough 2016. But we were quickly let down upon checking in to checking out. We were not formally greeted in our check-in on New Years Eve. There was a gentlemen who was not serving anyone but had his head looking down as if reading the computer, while a woman was checking others in. We stood there hoping the man would at least look up, acknowledge us and assure us that someone would be right with us. He never spoke. During our time waiting in line, we looked around and noticed rubbish pouring out of the lobby bin, empty wine glasses and plates sitting in nearby dirty tables, rubbish laying around the hotel, etc. My first instinct was to cancel my reservation, but I finally was checked in. It was literally a 3 minute check-in. I'm okay with a speedy check-in, but the woman that appeared to have been recently trained offered no information about the hotel or "don't hesitate to call us if you need anything," as you would expect from a Rydges. First room was clean but AC did not work. We went to the front desk to move and there was no one at reception for a few minutes. The gentleman ended up moving us to the room next door. That room had a working AC but the walls needed some fix-ups as there were dents and paint chips in the walls. Again, not something you would expect from Rydges. I walked around the hotel and quickly noticed how dirty and run down it was. Every table outside of the restaurant was dirty for hours. My daughter and I wanted to sit down and relax near the waterfall area, but every table was dirty and empty. While it was New Years, the crowd was very light. So we got in the car and drove 15 minutes to an amazing restaurant that had awesome reviews on Tripadvisor.  What this hotel needs is more cleaning staff during the night. Even the branches on the indoor trees are dusty. Every single piece of glass is very dirty and needs a serious cleaning. More than a quick windex wipe-down. The external windows near the front look as if they have not been cleaned in months.  The pool was nice, as well as hot tub. We went once and noticed there were no towels. My husband walked up to reception and asked for more towels. He was told it would be 15 minutes before they could get us some. 45 minutes later, my husband walked up to the room dripping because no towels came. The worst part of our stay was truly the most disappointing service we've ever had. A young woman named Jess checked me out. Absolutely no greeting, no "how was your stay, etc." I politely asked her for a detailed receipt and it was as if I offended her. I thanked her for it and she didn't reply. I actually said, "it's okay to say your welcome or thank you for your service." She just looked at me and moved on to the next customer. I promise I was not rude or offensive at all. This girl must have consequences for poor service. I try my best to offer grace to the customer service industry as I once was a waitress as well as a Marriott front desk supervisor. But this hotel was simply very disappointing. It has potential. Very easy fixes; New friendly staff as well as train all staff to keep the lobby and reception area clean at all times, including those glass tables all around. There were plenty of times I walked through a silent lobby/reception and 1-2 staff standing around the counter. Hire more staff to do a massive cleanup to make customers know they are in a nice hotel.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~1~1~nan
review_448392051~“Very Spacious”~Spacious...good value for money...good breakfast but far away from shops. Good bedding and staff very cooperative. Parking could be an issue. Good views. Was very busy considering schoolies. Wifi access was good in rooms~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_448189649~“This is a bad hotel to stay with”~1. Cleaner forgot to close our room after cleaning. This partially happened because of a door return mechanism was not fully operational. I reported everything to the hotel's reception. Of course, nothing was done. Our room was in fact open for several hours when we were away because of a cleaner's fault.  2. No fresh air in the room because it is not possible to open any window. 3. Wire of a kettle is 40cm, possible to boil only on the floor or in bathroom, whereas the last variant is strictly prohibited due to OH&S issues. 4. Breakfast is $28! For many years of my travel I have never seen such a price for breakfast. Luckily Manuka place was not far. 5. Staff is unfriendly. Upon check in, we were not offered a WiFi password, not told of where our room is and one card from the door did not work. We went multiple times to the reception to fix the above. 6. Electrical sockets are in ridiculous places. One is underneath the bed and as a result it is not possible to reach it. No sockets near two bedside tables. Two remaining sockets are in fact 2cm above the floor and as a result it is very inconvenient to use the kettle or iron.  Just because of the first issue the hotel deserves the lowest level.~1~nan~nan~2~2~nan~1~nan
review_448141698~“Always a great place to say”~My family stayed here over the Christmas period and service was once again fantastic. The rate was very reasonable and we had a very comfortable and quiet room. The only slight hitch was that a t shirt was left by the pool just before closing and when we went down to check the next morning it was gone. This is no fault of the hotel I am assuming but a bit disappointing to know that someone just thought they would take a new t shirt that was a gift.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_447097871~“Great Family Accommodation..(School Holidays?) ”~My partner and I stayed at the Rydges for 2 nights after Christmas. We utilized the pool/spa facilities and they were great. Room service on night 1 took quite a while; 40 minutes, whilst on night 2 it was delivered to our room within 10 minutes.  One issue I had/have (which may actually be fine) was with the lift. Whilst moving between floors, the doors would open while it was still moving. This left me feeling uneasy.  Would I stay here again? Maybe. As my heading states this is more of family hotel. Although this does make you wonder why in the in-room drink menu they only have wine.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447088915~“Surprisingly good!”~We booked this hotel after reading different reviews on a variety of hotels in Canberra.  Rydges is an old hotel that has been renovated. The foyer is dated but clean. Our check in was smooth and fast as we prechecked in online the day before. They sent us a text in the afternoon of arrival to let us know our room was ready, which was great. No surprises. Underground secure parking is $12 per night which was a bit of a surprise, but oh well.  When we arrived at our room it had 2 double beds(as requested) made up and the room was clean and recently redecorated. The bathroom had also been recently renovated. It had a great shower but it was a half glass opening where the toilet was. Whenever you showered the whole bathroom get pretty wet. Not the end of the world but probably not the best of design layouts.  The hotel offered free wifi and limited Foxtel channels, it was enough.  After our first night we headed downstairs for a buffet breakfast which was nice. Minimal staff on though so it didn't present as well as it could. We'll put that down to it being a public holiday. Also the wait staff's uniform of black pants, white shirt and black vest seemed "sloppy" as none of the team had the vests buttoned up. Maybe loose the vest and add an apron instead? We returned late in the afternoon in time for a quick swim before dinner to open our room door to a half made up room with the bed dress pillows still on the floor and the fresh towels thrown on the bathroom bench and cleaning clothes left behind by the cleaner.  This hotel was quite nice and well priced. The location is great and the Reception staff really efficient and friendly. The Housekeeping staff let them down but again we'll put it down to public holiday and maybe all staff weren't on board.  All that aside, we loved our stay and will stay again here again next time we're in Canberra.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447026887~“Excellent value, but reception....not so great”~I have to agree with the previous post, the reception staff are efficient enough but very disengaged. The right response to a report of a bad spill & a trip hazard is "are you okay? and "can you give me the details" not "oh, dear". And really, why could they not request room service deliver some fresh milk? Other than that, for a great price we received a quiet, roomy, meticulously clean, well maintained room with a good bed and shower in an excellent location for us.  We had a light dinner in the restaurant also, food was fresh & service was good. And housekeeping we're very efficient and friendly. Overall, very good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446200019~“Rooms are great”~The rooms and foyer live up to the Rydges standard, however their staff really need to greet their guests on arrival and be a engaging and friendly. Breakfast was okay - cold eggs are not the way I like to start my day, neither is not having a cup to make coffee and being surrounded by dirty tables that hadn't been cleaned up from previous guests breakfasts and the unripe fruit should never have made it to the pass.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444933208~“Fine for a quick trip”~We chose Rydges because of its location and were pleased with our choice. As part of a package deal with tickets to an exhibition, we were pleased to have breakfast, parking and wi-fi included. Rooms are minimal, with not even a drawer to store your spare socks, and we needed to ask for a second chair to avoid the necessity of one of us sitting on the bed all evening - it was provided quickly and pleasantly. The range of breakfast offerings is fine, but we found that by the (not very late) time we arrived many dishes were depleted and were not being refreshed, so eat early if you want a choice. Overall, though, we felt we received good value for the price.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_444932002~“Spacious and comfortable”~Very spacious room (we had an Executive King Suite). Great bed - really comfortable. Nothing much has changed since we stayed there for our wedding nearly 25 years ago, but it has been really well maintained and the quality of the fittings is obvious. Spectacular value for money when you get a special deal - worth signing up for their Priority Guest Rewards program and subscribing to the email so you don't miss the specials.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_444778118~“Good value”~Stayed here for 3 nights as part of a flights and accomodation package from wotif.com.au. It proved to be very good. The room was quite large and came with tea/coffee things, free wifi and a fridge. The bed was not very comfortable. It was conveniently located for the nos 2 and 3 buses, which go to the Parliamentary Triangle attractions and the City centre. Shops and restaurants were only a 5 minute walk away in Manuka. The hotel restaurant was a bit pricey for dinner but the food was good and the service quick and efficient. I did not have breakfast in-house as it was way too expensive.~5~nan~nan~2~5~nan~5~nan

review_443256026~“Poor”~We visited here for the other half too attend the Keith Urban concert. While Friday night was good, Saturday night was very poor. The hotel played host too two weddings and a Christmas party. While they are more.than entitled too, impact noise wise on other guest is not acceptable. Having read other reviews, I should of known better booking here having poor soundproofing in the rooms. I asked what time the music would decrease and told after ten. I rang reception at 11 when the music was still thumping through the room. And told they would get it turned down. There was no change. It wasn't til 1130 that music ceased. This hotel needs to improve room soundproofing and people should ask if they holding a wedding or party first. If they are, dont book. Plenty of really good hotels in canberra, especially with the amount of business and government here. Look around. Staff were polite. No complaints there. Was happy with room service and rooms. Just soundproof them better and let patrons know how the music or hollering will echo and get into rooms.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We stayed in a suite that is fit for the Prime Minister, and I am sure a few of them would have stayed in that room in the past. The room is luxuriously appointed and is HUGE!!. The room rate was extremely reasonable, we have stayed in smaller and worse places and paid more.The bathroom alone is bigger than my bedroom.

Slight problem with cold water pipe hammering but that is being fixed. Loved the sink for washing cups etc instead of going into bathroom. Much appreciated. Normal checkout is 11 a.m. perfect as you do not feel rushed. This hotel with its spa, swimming pool, gym cafe and restaurant is ideal either for a stop over or a longer stay.

review_441606567~“Disappoint experience”~The overall experience of staying at this hotel was well below the standard of Rydges hotels we have experienced. The superior room for two people had one uncomfortable chair, no place to place folded clothing away. A hanging wardrobe was the only storage place in the room. No security safe. The only electric points were at floor level so for elderly people like us you could only use the electric jug in the bath room. Most unsuitable. There was no valet to assist. The dining experience was well below expectation. Any Coeliac's should avoid this place as there is no gaurantee your food is free of contamination, at breakfast gluten free bread had to be requested, no gluten free cereal was available, no gluten free sweet rolls available. My request for two fried eggs took almost 45 minutes to appear. The reception staff could not make restaurant reversations and did not exhibit any desire to ensure our visit was trouble free. Our booking was not handled well.~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_441188813~“Well located hotel for Manuka and Parliament House.”~I spent a night at the Rydges Capital Hill while visiting an Exhibition in Canberra. The hotel is well located for activities south of Lake Burley Griffin. While I found the hotel good in many ways I felt it had deteriorated a little since my last visit. While my room was large and comfortable, little things like there being no iron and ironing board or additional pillows or blankets in the room was a let down. So my shirt was a little creased the next day but that is not the end of the world. As a member of the Rydges rewards club I was not offered the free beverage that comes with being a member, I even cheekily flashed my rewards card to the receptionist but she didn't seem to care. I do not ask for these things because to me it is not a big deal but as a courtesy the staff should be aware of the hotels policies. The breakfast was good with plenty of choice and the hot dishes were "hot" not like many other hotels I stay at. There was good fast wifi in the room allowing work to be done. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom amenities were to typical Rydges standards. Over all I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~3~nan

review_440808564~“Try somewhere else”~With all the options in Canberra give this one a miss. Tired decor and furnishings. I had a terrible room overlooking the front of the hotel and had to keep windows closed at night so I didn't have to see the coloured lights. The beds are comfortable but the bathroom was tired and not that clean - mould in corners. The tap dripped and so I had to shut the door so I didn't have to listen to it. It was a pretty warm day when I arrived but no one had turned on the aircon and so the room was stuffy. TV options were rubbish and there was no list of channels - you had to go through the channels one by one to see what was on. Ordered room service and the call timed out twice.  Had drinks at the bar and they didn't have lemonade! Food seemed to take a long time to arrive but it was quite good. Breakfast buffet quite well done but all the hot food was in Le Creuset type dishes and so the lids were really heavy - plate in one hand/heavy lid in the other made it quite difficult. I am not sure if breakfast was an additional charge or not because no one was there to ask, or ask me for my room details.  Generally, I thought the staff attentiveness wasn't great. One of my colleagues arrived at 2pm and her room wasn't ready until almost 4 but my room was ready early - perhaps because I got a dud one. We had also arranged to make use of one of their conference rooms for a business meeting and I was also very disappointed with management of this event as well. I stay at Rydges around Australia because they are reliable but I have to say that this has definitely made me rethink bookings in the future.~2~nan~4~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_440444086~“Property and staff need an urgent update.”~After texting me to say the room would be available at 2pm, no earlier, on arrival at 2.45pm was eventually informed after waiting at reception for some time, it would not be ready until 3pm. Why text then??  Reception staff could do with customer service training, and attitude management Would not stay there again...Looks like staff and hotel need an upgrade....~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_436724722~“Good location but needs a facelift”~I have visited this Hotel quite a few times and generally speaking it is a pleasant experience.Front desk staff are attentive and helpful.Rooms are comfortable and clean and the beds very comfy.The hotel is starting to feel a little tired and this is evident in the 1st generation Flat screen TV's that have one disabled USB port,which is a real pain if you have brought movies you want to view.The Figtree restaurant has nice lunches and dinners,but when I visited it was a bit like Fawlty Towers.I was told the meal I wanted wasnt available,then during my meal I was not asked once if i wanted another drink, pretty ordinary service given I WAS THE ONLY GUEST IN THE RESTAURANT!!~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_436472861~“Definitely the place to stay in Canberra”~Having stayed at many Hotels in Canberra I would have to say Rydges Capital Hill is by far the most comfortable and quite reasonably priced. All the staff are courteous and professional and the rooms are kept immaculate. Most importantly though, their beds are second to none. To top all this off their food is fantastic too. I highly recommend staying at Rydges Capital Hill when going to Canberra.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435450297~“Perfect Place To Stay”~Very nice, modern Hotel, in a perfect location. Reception was very efficient and helpful. Room was spacious and very comfortable. Breakfast in the Bar & Grill was one of the best we have had. However, dinner was different story. We went both nights we stayed. The first night the meal was good, but very slow service. The second night (a Saturday) was terrible. The music both nights was loud and night suitable for a nice restaurant. The meal was very poor, and expensive. Service was non existent. Only other negative was the parking. There is not a lot available under the Hotel, and when you use your room key to exit it doesn't always work. Very annoying. However, we will definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_435226275~“Great hotel in a fabulous position”~We've just stayed at this hotel and would come back here in a heartbeat. Clean, good food, great staff, parking, nothing was to much trouble. We really enjoyed it. Only one thing and that is if we could have a shaving/makeup mirror.... Really the only suggestion.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434957073~“Would stay again, great location and very comfortable”~Stayed 2 nights and very happy. The room was well appointed, spacious and the bathroom recently renovated. Exceptionally clean. Great location. Very quiet. Bed was excellent and had 2 wonderful nights sleep. Fabulous indoor warmed pool with towels available poolside. Large spa too but majority of the jets not working so didn't bother using it. I would normally say it is well worth joining the Rydges guest club for the little extras you normally get. However was very disappointed when, on check in, instead of the usual complimentary drink voucher for my husband and I we get at the other properties, the receptionist gave us a single drink voucher. Not much use and not very welcoming. Needless to say we didnt bother using the bar or restaurants at this property Due to this attitude. Management need to take a serious look at how they treat Rydges members compared to the rest of the chain. Happy to stay at this hotel next time we visit Canberra.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_433832311~“Unimpressed ”~I stayed here with some relatives in August and we enjoyed our stay. However, my fiance and I also had the honeymoon suite booked for approximately 5 months (for our wedding weekend). Four days before our wedding they advised us we couldn't stay in that room are there was a sudden renovation taking place. Instead, they offered us a downgrade (a room worth $100 less per night) with no extras and no actual apology (more a 'yes, we get you're disappointed but it's not our fault.') We were very lucky we found somewhere else to stay. We won't be booking in here anytime soon.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433098189~“In Need of a Make Over”~I recently stayed at this hotel with my husband, another couple and our two 16 year old sons. First impressions is that this hotel has seen better days. The carpets through out the hotel need updating as they are quite water stained. Our hotel room and the boys had gone through and up grade and wasn't too bad but our friends had a spa suite and it looked very average, especially the bathrooms.  The bar area is quite small and extremely understaffed for a Friday night. There is a lounge area behind the bar but it is very out of place and you feel like you are sitting in the middle of a nothing space. The breakfast bar wasn't too bad but in trying to make it appear very trendy all the cookware was cast iron which meant very heavy lids with no where to put them. The pool area is quite clean and a well equipped gym. The hotel was quite full when we stayed there so had to wait quite a while for the opportunity to get into the spa with there being other families in it at the same time.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_432783392~“Rydge's reliability. ”~We've stayed in 4 different Rydges and always found the service friendly and helpful, and the beds comfortable. Capital Hill was no exception. The room we had at the Capital Hill Rydges was newly renovated and very nice. We were away from the main areas and it was quiet. The room was on a corner so nice and spacious. We'd stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431985315~“Unimpressed!”~Breakfast was terrible, the food was very ordinary and it cost our family more than it did for breakfast the next day at a nice cafe. The windows were filthy and the restaurant floor was sticky! Not impressed!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431405971~“It's that good.”~Good location, good food and good service. Hey, you will really find it hard to complain here. I'd visited the hotel a couple of times mainly for food and drinks, I had never stayed. But when the option came up - I signed up quickly. Good place.~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~4~nan
