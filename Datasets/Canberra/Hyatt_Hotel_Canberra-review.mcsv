review_476762507~“Pleasant one night's stay with a toddler”~We stayed at the Hyatt Canberra for one night with our toddler. From what I remember, it was quite expensive to hire a cot, so we just used the existing bedding. The king bed was comfortable and was big enough for three of us. Bathroom was wonderful, our son loved his bath time.  We had the Easter dinner buffet, which was superb! We recently dined at a popular seafood buffet located at an international hotel in Sydney but this one was far better!. Oysters were really fresh and the king crabs were so tasty. All the other dishes were also great and we especially loved the pork belly, duck and spinach rice. Desserts were divine as well. Loved the chocolate fountain and panna cotta.  We didn't bring our swimmers but the swimming pool looked good. We hired bicycles at the club house and rode all the way to Kingstone along the river. It was great as they had a bicycle with a child seat. We didn't have the buffet breakfast but had light breakfast from the cafe near the lobby. The furniture was a little dated but had a nice ambience. Overall, we had a pleasant stay and will definitely return. (The only downside is that the hotel is only 4 storeys high so there is not much view. But we didn't mind this too much.)~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_476015262~“Significantly improved since last visit”~This is a Park Hyatt hotel and so aspires to be a 5 star establishment. Staff were very friendly and efficient from the pre arranged airport pick up through to check out and return to the airport. All these services were faultless. The only area letting the side down slightly is the 2 restaurants. In the Promenade Restaurant I was presented with a poorly prepared starter which I returned without touching it. In the Tea House lobby cafe I had the special afternoon tea which while served in a most attractive area with indoor and outdoor areas turned out to be a buffet affair the service of beverages was quite satisfactory but if it was supposed to be a "high tea" I would have expected a traditional table service for the food. Having said that we had a most enjoyable couple of hours. Whilst I was entertaining guests at tea I was otherwise solo and was disappointed the there were no half bottles of wine on the list as the freshness of wines by the glass is sometimes doubtful. This was confirmed when I was served a flat glass of champagne. In all my overall impression is that of a significant improvement since my last stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475652020~“Fantastic hotel”~Spent only one night for our wedding anniversary. The environment, the facilities and the service were first class. Our room at the back was quiet and looked out over a park, which we could enjoy from our balcony. Plenty of things to see and do within walking distance and we took advantage of these.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475507703~“BREAKFAT BUFFET REVIEW”~Went to the Hyatt for a decent buffet breakfast Friday morning. As you would expect the staff were all very professional and helpful, and the varity and quality of the food was 5 star. Always love a freshly cooked omelete to order. I especially liked the iced tea which is not normally found at a buffet. The smoked chicken was awesome. Not cheap at $39 per (kids half price which is a nice touch for families) but it is quality.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475497148~“Unique Art Deco hotel”~This hotel is steeped in Canberra history, with memorabilia scattered throughout the hotel. The Art Deco styling is reflected throughout-from the carpets to the stairs to the black marble bathrooms. Buffet breakfast was delicious; we started the day with a swim, and had coffee in the gardens after breakfast. Being so close to Parliament, you feel like many prominent people have stayed here. Enjoy a slice of Canberra's history!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475422596~“Ideal Situation”~This is the third time we have stayed in this hotel on the Club  Level. It is a rambling building linked by long passages and set in green treed surroundings.. The staff are very friendly and the Concierge extremely helpful. In fact, at the last minute they were able to organise tickets for us to attend Question Time at Parliament House. This was a new and interesting experience for me. On one particularly day we were welcomed back with bottles of water. The advantage of this hotel is that is is walking distance to the Gallery, Science Museum and Portrait Gallery and there are lovely walks along the lake. Parliament House is no distance away. The Club Room is open all day for tea, coffee soft drinks and light snacks. Canapes and drinks are served in the evening and the hot ones are very tasty.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475382235~“Gorgeous hotel, great staff, and excellent location”~This hotel has such a wonderful feel. The low rise architecture and high ceilings make it feel like a classic luxury hotel from the old days, yet it still feels contemporary now.  The staff is excellent and the best I have come across in any hotel in Australia. They really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and looked after. The location could not be better. Walking distance to Lake Burley Griffin, the Capital, and many museums. The grounds are immaculate also and the birds that call Canberra home are incredible.  Can't wait to come back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475182922~“Lovely hotel”~This hotel is clean, neat and well positioned. It is a little bit of a rabbit warren in its layout. This may be due to its historical values.  The gym is fantastic, the food is expensive, but fantastic location. Easy walk to the national museum, gallery, and Parliament House.  Can walk to some good cafes- try mocan and green grout for breakfast.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474756389~“Poor old Hyatt Canberra”~The Hyatt Canberra promises a lot more than it delivers.

review_474460174~“Great features highlight hotel visit in sprawling complex”~Quite a sprawling complex with lots of rooms for meetings, functions, long passageways, many atria, Park Hyatt Canberra offers lovely, very polite, helpful staff, excellent service. Rooms themselves are minimalist in decor except for beautiful, recently renovated large bathrooms in black marble and white appliances and featuring the wonderful authentic Australian skincare products by Appelles. A soak in the long tub - possibly the nicest soaking tub we’ve experienced - is a luxurious experience. Park Hyatt’s main restaurant, Promenade Café, specializes in extensive breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets, with a very wide range of offerings at many different stations. Particularly popular is its weekend Seafood Buffet. Promenade Café also offers an à la carte menu, which, in our mind, was better than the buffet offerings. The filet mignon was tender and delicious, the roast chicken with rocket salad very nicely prepared. The chocolate caramel lava cake was tasty but even sweeter than expected. On Sundays, Afternoon Tea in the lobby is an elaborate affair, with an unbelievably large number of delicacies, and clearly extremely popular with couples, brides-to-be and families. Better make a reservation as last-minute arrivals will not be accommodated due to every table’s being occupied. Only downsides are very limited restaurant options, no gift shop/necessities store, confusing layout, other wise, would certainly rate a “5.”~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_474434887~“Great Hotel with a wonderful history, but food below standard”~Whilst we have visited Canberra many times, this was our first stay at the Hyatt. As far as the hotel goes, we were not disappointed. We found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful - obviously well trained -, the room was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom very well appointed.  We were, however, disappointed with the food. We opted for the buffet on the Saturday evening. We found the food on offer very ordinary ( I think we paid $75/head). The 'fresh' seafood was obviously frozen, the hot dishes were barely warm and the dessert bar quite mundane. On top of that, the coffee at the end was charged as extra. In summary, we would stay at the Hyatt again, but will almost certainly eat at a restaurant outside of the hotel, of which Canberra has many great options.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_474418937~“Old world charm - central location”~Check in was seamless and the people at the front door very pleasant. Our room was on level four near the presidential suite which meant we had to walk through the hotel to get there. I was amazed by how many people were there for the afternoon – it was packed to the rafters. Apparently it gets booked our two weeks in advance so if you are going make sure you book early (it looked impressive).  The room was fine albeit maybe a little tired. Size was good and had everything you would need. The interesting thing was that the room was marketed as a king bed but it was only a queen size bed which I thought was a little cheeky. With our room we had access to the Ambassador Club. This was a lounge, below the presidential suite, that had free tea, coffee and juice and snack food (very little) during the day. From 6-8pm there were drinks and canapés and this was a nice treat (the food, like the hotel, felt a little dated – but was lovely).  There is a good size gym, pool at the back of the hotel. The tennis court was $10 to hire which I wasn’t informed about. I thought that disclosure would have been appropriate as opposed to me having to query it when I received my bill. I am assuming the gym was free… We didn’t eat at the hotel but there were a couple of options as well as the trusty buffet for those so inclined. I did go down to the bar at 9pm on Saturday evening and other than one other couple, there was nobody there…strange. It sadly lacked atmosphere and I also thought the wine by the glass options were very boring/ average. The scotch options however were comprehensive. Other bits - the hotel is wedding central which for some people could be a problem however we found it to be quite fu. A rollaway bed for a young kid will set you back $80.00. Our room had free wi-fi but not sure if that applies throughout the hotel. There is also ample parking around the hotel and its free. It is very centrally located and the architecture it colonial and big and airy. I have stayed in a number of hotels in Canberra and I think this is a hotel that appeals to an older generation – very classic with a bit of old fashioned charm.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_474414689~“Grand old lady but very tired”~Gardens at the front of the hotel are beautifully maintained but the interior doesn't match up. The carpets everywhere are in need of replacement. The bed base squeaks and the bed head was very worn on one side. Housekeeping needs much better supervision as the turn down service did not turn the bed down and was erratic. The used coffee cup was ignored as was the milk frother from the coffee machine. The Ambassador Club staff were very pleasant and efficient. The lobby restaurant was more than acceptable with good staff. There was no sign of any senior management which was very evident as although staff were good willing they appeared to lack knowledge. Would have given this Hôtel 3 1/2 if we could~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474382328~“Great hotel”~Spend a weekend at the Hyatt and enjoyed every minute of it. For such a huge hotel it is remarkably good. Excellent service generally and a very pleasant atmosphere. there are various options for meals, drinks and snacks and we enjoyed the Speakers Bar for quiet drinks and food.  It is a bit on the expensive side and so value for money may be a question but overall it is excellent.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474237682~“Architectural masterpiece ”~After quite a break I decided to stay at the Hyatt again. This low rise hotel is quite superb in its presentation and the rooms are of a superior standard. It is quite beautiful and a pleasure to stay in.  However no 5 stars from me. On Sunday night I tried to order room service. The number rang out, then I tried both the front desk and the operator.. both rang out.  I then tried using my mobile to call in from an external number .. it rang out also.  Eventually the concierge answered the phone and took my order. I was told that phones just keep ringing until someone picks up and that they were busy Quite unacceptable for any hotel let alone one that charges premium charges.  The breakfast offering is superior but seriously $39 for breakfast is excessive.  This hotel is a premium destination but over reaches with its pricing~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473712246~“Showing the kids the Nations Capital”~I took our children on a road trip from a Melbourne to Canberra to show them some of the sights. The Hyatt is in a lovely location, is a beautiful historic building with great access to many sights. Concierge were very helpful however my checkin was a bit sloppy and they failed to tell me anything about my Club inclusions (Ambassadors Lounge). The staff in the lounge were fantastic and went out of their way to provide my daughter with tasty gluten free options. We had dinner in the restaurant on night which was also lovely (I had the barramundi which was fantastic). The other night we tried to order room service but no one would answer my calls so I ended up going to the Lounge so staff there could order for me. There was a VIP staying in the hotel which was obviously the focus of the hotel staff. Our room was very close to this VIP and the rooms surrounding us were taken up by his staff so we did have some uncomfortable yet funny moments when I (45 year old woman) and my two children (5 and 9) were stopped by burly security guards as we walked to our rooms and asked where we were going. Thankfully the 'visiting' security guys got to know us and were very pleasant (not so the 'local' security guys). Perhaps informing us of this situation upon arrival would have been suitable. Kids thought it was all very exciting though..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473283483~“An unpleasant stay at the Hyatt”~We stayed at the Hyatt a few of months ago and I have been waiting to do this review in the hope...a vain hope as it turns out...that I would have received an answer to my Registered letter that I sent about a major problem we had at the hotel. It is inconceivable to have not had the courtesy of a reply, or even an acknowledgment of receipt of a letter, from a supposed 5 star hotel. The issue was major and I fully detailed it in my letter, but feel it is not the proper avenue to discuss it online.  As two seniors, we seemed to become invisible to staff when we wished for any service...staff appeared to be far more interested in using their computers than looking up and asking if we needed help. One incidence was when we went for a meal at The Promenade...we were eventually noticed, the restaurant was NOT busy, and were seated at a table, with the question "did we want a buffet or an a la carte meal"...we asked for a moment to decide and were given a menu and then left alone and the person did not return. We decided the buffet must be the obvious choice, which was a mistake...the food was of a very poor standard that night and an ordinary bottle of water cost $10. At $75 a head, we expected coffee to be included, but no, that was extra.  We had one staff member over the 3 days we were staying actually ask us how we were enjoying our stay...otherwise no one even bothered. There were two other senior guests with us and they found their "treatment" to be exactly the same. I guess we don't fit in with the business/conference clientele. We were so disappointed in our treatment I preferred to forfeit an ALREADY PAID for 2 night stay to celebrate a 48th wedding anniversary, than ever return to the Hyatt. We have traveled quite extensively and have never had something like this occur before...it is sad this should happen in our own "backyard".~1~1~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan

review_472336093~“YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!”~The old saying "You get what you pay for" couldn't be more applicable when it comes to this majestic hotel. My wife and I have just visited Canberra and stayed 2 nights at the Hyatt. I had visited Canberra numerous times previously on business however I had never stayed at this wonderful hotel. From the time we arrived we were made feel very welcome and every staff member we came in contact with was courteous and friendly. Our room was spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. Our tariff included breakfast which was excellent. The property is well located with a beautiful park at the rear right on Lake Burley Griffin. My wife and I visited the Treasures of Versailles exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia, and we were able to pre purchase tickets at the Hyatt, which saved us queuing up at the Gallery. All in all we had a really wonderful stay and look forward to returning to the hotel at some time in the future.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan

Cons: Not enough complimentary shampoo, soap etc in bathroom, or towels only stocked for one guest when two were booked. Had to request more for other guest. - Spa broken and unusable in health club - Pool crowded with "non guests" training, one lane aggressively swimming butterfly, another lane, dominating man "pool walking". No room to relax at all. -Biggest Con of all - just checked my credit card - Final invoice I agreed to was $361. Amount charged on my card ( without telling me) $661 ! When I called for explanation and finally spoke to duty manager I was told they add further charges " in case you run off without paying " then refund to your card. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and never come across this attitude ever. When I gave them my card and pin it was in good faith that it was for the amount we spent, no more. Insinuating a guest will abscond and acting in a faithless manner is abnorhent and offensive. It has pretty much soured my experience. This was not explained upon check in at all and is disappointing and I will now have to watch my card for the extra " $300 to be refunded I did not spend ( in case we left without paying) !. Terrible way to treat guests.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_470690987~“Superb hotel, quiet, nicely furnished, comfortable”~Stayed 3 nights on our 5 month journey and overall had a wonderful experience. Only three issues stood out: 1)Business center printers didn't print and phone wasn't working to call for help, 2) Steak in The Promenade served on a piece of slate, allowing juices to run all over table but luckily not on clothing (informed mgr and he agreed; it will be changed, 3) getting brewed coffee was a hassle. Staff being trained on differing types of coffee to avoid issue in future (until new staff arrive). But, having experience these minor inconveniences I still highly recommend this hotel property. Staff attitude was admirable even if not always able to remedy situation immediately. Parking is $25/day but you can park in the adjacent lots for $12 a day and free overnight if you wish to save a little.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_468741781~“Great Hotel but Disappointing Stay! ”~My partner and I stayed here Saturday and Sunday night.  I've stayed many times before and loved it but this time there were several disappointments.  Firstly the housekeeping cleaned our room following our first night and left 1 used towel.  Secondly the wines by the glass were ordinary. Ninth island Pinot Noir is hardly up to Hyatt standard and $14 per glass.  Then we decided to have the seafood buffet on Sunday night. Ordinary!  The oysters were warm and milky. The lobster tails were tough and the prawns were tasteless. Obviously frozen and thawed! And yet $74 pp.  Monday the breakfast was not as good as Sunday. No Eggs Benedict offered. Must be because it's Monday??? I hope that this review will help them get back on track as this is a great hotel in a fabulous location close to the galleries.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467480635~“5 Star Hotel, 2 Star Aircon”~Wonderful property, we loved the layout, classic design & decor. Checkin was fast yet friendly and warm. Our room was immaculate and the bathroom had real wow factor. One slightly massive problem, this was the heatwave weekend of January and the heatwave was not restricted to the outdoors. We could not get the a/c temp lower and were virtually sweating in our room so called maintenance. A very friendly bloke spent a bit of time tinkering with it and then proudly announced "Well it was 29C when I came in and now it's already down to 27.5C! Should be cooler in a few hours by the time you go to bed tonight!" This is a 5 Star hotel - arguably the best in Canberra and we were sitting in our room 'cooled' to 27.5C??? NOT! So we had to traipse back to reception which, as anyone who has stated there would know is about of a trek from the farther spread wings and tell them this was just not acceptable. To their credit they immediately moved us to a chilly room which was just perfect. I then indulged in a deep, relaxing bath which was heaven. We had afternoon beers in the garden which was lovely and refreshing - even in the heat. We didn't eat at the Hyatt so cant comment. Overall, other than the a/c debacle it was a very good stay~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_467450443~“Opulance”~Without over spending your allowance you can enjoy enjoy the comfort and luxury in a very peaceful setting. Well worth a stay. The food is first class. Whether at High Tea or simply walking through the foyer to hear the piano being played is a please.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467982272~“Great service, facilities and position, hotel needs an upgrade”~I loved the hotel, the staff and the facilities, it is however looking a bit tired. It was a great location. The cleanliness of the bathroom was excellent. Checking out was a little congested at 11am, but when discovered another staff member appreared~4~4~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_467982273~“Love the Hyatt!”~When in Canberra we always stay in the Hyatt. We find that it is quiet, comfortable and very central to many of the cultural centres that we wish to visit. This year we visited 'Enlighten' and the Hot-air Balloon Festival, which were just across the road from the Hyatt, and Treasures from Versailles at the National Art Gallery so the Hyatt was very convenient. After late nights, early mornings and busy days, the Hyatt was so comfortable and relaxing!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467109100~“Wonderful room, great evening dining, breakfast service terrible”~We stayed overnight March 11/12 to attend a family engagement. We have both stayed at the Hyatt many times, in fact it is our preferred Canberra hotel accommodation. The room was lovely albeit set up with an extra bed even though our reservation was for just us (a couple) never mind they removed it very quickly. Dinner was wonderful and the service terrific. We decided to have a quick breakfast enroute to the airport and that's where the hotel service let us down. About 20mins after ordering our coffees arrived but they weren't what we ordered - apparently our order had not been put in. After enquiring where my husband's breakfast (a la carte) was we were told it was on it's way. I had finished my continental breakfast and it was light and what I wanted. We were about to leave when his breakfast was presented to him - you guessed it - it was nothing like the 2 poached eggs on toast that he had ordered (40 mins prior). We left and Mike missed out on breakfast and was fuming. It seemed the staff couldn't understand poached eggs on toast even though the menu said (eggs any way you like). Disappointing. Upon checkout we informed the staff member that we had not had one of the breakfasts and she said leave it to me. Yep, stuff up again. the email I received after arriving home was for $76 for breakfast. I had to email and phone call (took ages to make myself understood) so hopefully the bill will be adjusted soon. Not a nice experience to leave the hotel with.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~2~nan
review_466937627~“Hyatt Canberra”~The Hyatt Canberra is quiet and very comfortable. Service is good, King room with balcony was large and airy. The bathroom large with an enormous bath. The bed was large but I felt it was nearing the end of its life. All in all a comfortable stay. Would stay again.~5~5~5~3~5~5~5~nan

review_466709057~“Dated, musty, terrible food. Great location”~We stayed in the Canberra Hyatt in February and were very disappointed. The hotel rooms are musty and dated. The interiors are well worn. Probably the most disappointing part of our experience was the food. We ordered the buffet which was ridiculously mediocre food, quite embarrassing really. It was also very expensive and the worst meal we had on our 2 week holiday. We won't be staying here again. It is expensive, overrated and in much need of an overhaul on all levels. A shame as it is a unique old building (that needs money spending on it) in a fabulous location in Canberra.~1~nan~5~nan~2~nan~3~nan

review_466647534~“Long Weekend Away”~Stayed here for two nights over the Victorian Labour Day weekend (which coincided with the Canberra Day Long weekend). The hotel had a lovely atmosphere and the staff were very helpful. We had a king room with a balcony and a beautiful marble bathroom (with a bath). The hotel was walking distance to the Parliament houses and National Gallery.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466645807~“Ideal for a night with the boyz after winning big on the slappa”~Old mate won a few grand on the slappa so treated the boyz to a fancy night at the Hyatt with some cheeky beers. Hotel staff were heaps sick towards us, despite us being drunk and kinda shabby. They were top blokes. 5/5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466642159~“High Tea”~Went for high tea for a birthday party. First time I had been to the Hyatt. The venue was very nice and the staff were welcoming. I thought it was a bit pricey and would not do high tea again and would have liked more savoury dishes. There were only party pies and curry puffs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466616771~“Amazing hotel!”~This hotel had everything. Get the breakfast plan, it's amazing. They make their own yogurts, preserves and the selection of fruits are great. The location is amazing, surrounded by mountains, a river and the wildlife is everywhere. Walk out the back door to kangaroos, kolas, many types of birds and river sharks. You definitely want to stay here.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_466472984~“Holidays ”~Fantastic for a romantic holiday. Old style hotel, with fabulous service. Our room was perfect, food delicious, staff & service the best. Can't rate the whole hotel high enough. Location is perfect, the view great.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465962264~“Enjoyable stay”~This was our second stay at the Hyatt in Canberra. From an easy check in, excellent in house dining and a spacious room - it is a really nice place to stay. We also had breakfast included in our room rate which we enjoyed, a fantastic way to start the day. Happy to recommend this property if you are travelling to Canberra. One minor point, Hyatt's quoted rates don't always seem to include GST which means the final rate you pay is higher than expected.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465640994~“Good base in parliament precinct”~Stayed 2 nights at start of a 4 week trip. Great location, nice room , only downside was the re-carpeting in the room above, hammering started at 6.30am, too early for retirees. Otherwise would have rated 4. Good pool, parking below (extra $25 a day) but so convenient.~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_465443098~“Afternoon tea at the Hyatt”~We were here recently for my birthday as l had heard great things about this high tea. We were seated on very comfy couches and poured a glass of sweet bubbles. The set up is not huge but the 2 tiers offer a wonderful selection of sweet and savoury. We went to the 2.30-5.00 session so did not have lunch beforehand, we left a couple of hours later very full. Yes it's expensive but for a special occasion totally worth it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465407570~“Very dated and not keeping up”~A very dated hotel where the owners continue to underspend making this Hotel the poorest quality Park Hyatt I have stayed at in the world, particularly compared to recent stays at the Park Hyatt in Shanghai, Dubai, Vienna and Milan. Way below Hyatt Regency standards such as recent stays in Zurich, Delhi, Chandigarh.~2~1~4~4~2~2~2~nan

review_465174955~“Wonderful and charming hotel”~My daughter and I had a wonderful stay there. We were well looked after. The Deluxe Twin Room was very comfortable, clean and a good size. The staff were superb. I have stayed in many hotels, local and overseas, and have never ever come across staff who are so friendly and helpful - thank you all you wonderful people at Hyatt Canberra, especially to Ali. We had lunch and dinner at the Promenade Café, the food was divine and the service superb. I strongly recommend the Hyatt Canberra. Another thing, the gym is well equipped. For a 5-star ranking hotel, I would give it an 8~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_465079851~“A welcome visit by American & Australian Couples traveling together”~The Hyatt Hotel Canberra is really a grand lady with a very helpful staff. The hotel seems to stretch out forever, with walking time & distances from lobby to room quite long. Beautiful grounds, restful indeed. Rooms spacious, meals quite good. Location of hotel requires a vehicle for transport as there is much to see in Canberra. Not a destination for student back packers or groups of Asian tourists.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_464870042~“High tea experience”~Whilst were not staying at the Hotel, we visited especially for the High Tea.. Thoroughly enjoyed the high tea experience at the Hyatt Canberra. Lovely selection of  canapes and sweets to choose from. I am unable eat sugar due to health constraints and advised the staff of that when booking. As a result, they had a special non sugar selection of deserts that they served to me at the appropriate time...delicious. Not cheap but worth the money for a special experience.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
