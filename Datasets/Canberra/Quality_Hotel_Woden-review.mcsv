review_475945008~“Family Holiday ”~Stayed at Quality Hotel four days. The is bathroom and carpet is outdated. Lift slow. Good for a short stay. Breakfast to be included would be ideal. Not to far from the city and site attractions. Staff helpful. Tradies restaurant ok. Two resturants across the road. Westfield shopping centre 5 mins away.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475143338~“Convenient for a Weekend in Canberra but Not 4 *”~A friend and I recently stayed for 2 days to see NGA exhibition etc. Room was large and clean with two queen beds as requested. Onsite and secure underground parking. No valet to help with bags but you can help yourself to the hotel trolley. Tradies Club Restaurant, Pillars on site which I thought overpriced for just a Club meal. You can buy a Buffet Breakfast Voucher to Pillars for $13. Reception staff were friendly at check in, However - they had booked us into a ground floor room,#102 in the walkway to the restaurant, opposite the lifts with a view of the carpark!! When I immediately asked for a room change I was told " it would be convenient for me" Really!! She wasn't interested in discussing and I wasn't told they were booked out. I later saw someone in a wheelchair trying to manoeuvre into the lift to the 4th floor. Poor Customer Service.  There is a Asian Noodle Bar across the road with great food and good prices. Other than that, not much around. It was adequate for a weekend considering the price. Good for business travelers but certainly Not a 4 star~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474044249~“Don't bother.”~Checked in to room 404 and checked out fifteen minutes later, not something I would be game to do normally but I just couldn't stay there! Room had an odour like stale sweat and Glen 20, I couldn't breathe. Went to open the windows and found worn, torn curtains. Outdated bathroom was daggy and uninviting. For the price of a standard room I expected a whole lot more. To the credit of management they let me free without argument and did try to give me a better room. Booked around the corner at another hotel for a much better price and higher standard of comfort.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473755487~“Convenient and reasonably economic - but now a bit tired”~Regardless of some mixed TA reviews, we booked in here for 9 nights, attracted by the good location and reasonable price.  While our 4th floor room was fairly spacious and clean, the room service seemed to be rather haphazard and disorganised. On most days, the cleaners didn't appear until late afternoon - and then often didn't replenish the tea, milk, sugar etc. The single lift was another frequent irritation - often incredibly slow, especially when staff were holding the doors open, to load their trolleys. Although the Tradies Club is right next door, we found several of the dishes to be of forgettable quality, and not particularly good value.  Overall, quite disappointing.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_473687146~“Good option for decent accommodation”~I am not sure it's deserving of 4 stars, but definitely more than 3 stars. Nice and clean, looks very new. Was quiet so had a good night's sleep. Booked a twin room, so had two double (or queen?) beds, which was great. Room and bathroom were quite large and had a table and chairs for dining at. The downsides were that there was only one lift, so it was often a fairly lengthy wait for the lift (not the worst thing but just a little odd in a new building), only one person on reception (also slowed things down a little) and room service was very slow to arrive. Room service was nice but not overly exciting - probably to be expected from this type of venue. The menu selection was large though, so a good choice. For me, the reason I booked here and not elsewhere in Woden was the offstreet parking, including lots of basement parking. We were able to park without anyone parking next to us, thereby avoiding door dings.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan

review_471266426~“A good & comfortable motel”~It's a new, nice, clean and functional motel. Check-in was quick, room was very spacious with 2 double beds. Bathroom was also of decent size. The underground car pack was locked up in the evening so very secure. TV with free to air channels only but that was fine by us. Did not have breakfast so could not comment. Good location with only 5 minutes walking to Woden shopping centre which had David Jones and a supermarket. Would certainly stay here again if come to Canberra.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469546156~“Outdated and unclean”~My partner and I were supposed to stay for 6 nights but ended up getting a refund after the first night. It was a highly unpleasant experience... Shower had mould, bathroom was very outdated and for some reason the floor was constantly sticky. The room entire room smelt musky and obviously not properly maintained or hygienic. I wouldn't recommend this hotel~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469490787~“Excellent modern hotel, very comfortable large room with direct access to Tradies Club”~Room was excellent, quiet, large and modern.

review_465955536~“Three Nights ”~My partner and I stayed at this hotel for three nights. Our room was average: we were located on the second floor and our view from the window was of a buildings roof and the bathroom was very dated and didn't have a proper enclosed shower, therefore every time you had a shower the whole bathroom floor would be soaked. The lift was extremely slow and the door swipe cards played up. I wouldn't recommend this hotel, nor would I return.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465123910~“For and against...position only. ”~We have just returned from a visit to see family in ACT. We picked this hotel for a change as we have tried several in area. Our usual favorite we couldn't get accommodation at. There are pros and cons. Firstly it's in a good position. It's only 8 minutes from Parliament House (and attractions)by car. City is across the lake. Next door is the large Westfield Mall. Parking is undercover and secured. Rooms size was good. The beds clean and very comfortable.However...the fittings were not fabulous! The tv was so small and dated-wrong for the size of the room-limited stations. There was an old fridge under bench. Tea -coffee making facility(kettle) biscuits. However the benches with cups, kettle etc are made for people 6ft tall! The wardrobe was the same-ok for one person, tiny storage and again the rail was that high I could barely reach. I know this is not drastic but I'm over 5ft. Bathroom was large. But the floor tiles dated and slippery-and into the shower. The basin was new. However no shelves or room on top. This is definitely aimed at males( sorry guys) without vanity bags. Useless for women or anyone with a larger toilet bag and no good for a couple. They have a restaurant adjoining "Tradies "-breakfast I thought $$ (we went next door to have brekky at mall) They have a bar and dining room, poker machines etc. After staying in several places in Canberra for years I would only return if there were no other choices.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463101188~“A very comfortable and spotlessly clean, conveniently located hotel”~This hotel is conveniently located near the excellent conference facilities provided by Woden's Hellenic Club (just a 5 minute walk away). Parking facilities are excellent with a lift service to your room~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462836256~“Comfy & convenient”~Excellent hotel, nice clean rooms, great staff, easy parking & free wifi.  The only downside is the breakfast which is actually done by the adjoining Tradies Club in The Pillars restaurant which is woeful (dinners are too). I would stay in the hotel again but eat elsewhere - plenty of restaurants nearby.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458409410~“Great Facilities”~I stayed here for three nights on business and found the hotel to be great. Bed was okay, but the generous size of the room and bathroom really impressed. It is central to so many areas, and only a short walk to Westfield Woden. Having the Tradies Club adjacent on the ground floor was also very convenient, for meals or to visit the bar after work. Was really pleased with my stay, and no faults to report.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454413706~“Well presented hotel with friendly efficient staff”~I stayed here for 1 night after getting a good deal on Wotif (the promotional material at the hotel guarantees a better rate if you book direct). Check in was fast efficient and friendly (thanks to Phoebe), before I could insert my card for the lift to operate another employee had inserted a master card, this level of friendliness and helpfulness continued throughout my stay. The room was large, well presented and clean. The complimentary teas coffees etc included 2 biscuit packs (which have sadly disappeared from most hotels). The room was quiet and dark at night, despite being close to a road which was busy during the day. Free wifi was included, but this slowed considerably later in the evening. Attached to the Tradies club where you could enjoy traditional club food or within easy walking distance to many other restaurants.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453296812~“Convenient Value”~Second time we’ve stayed here and we’ll certainly be back again. Well located, in terms of main roads, it’s proximity to Woden Westfield shopping centre and the Tradie’s Club which is attached to the hotel. Comfortable room with what I consider to be two essential features - free wifi and plenty of secure parking. Friendly reception staff and the right price complete the package.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_452277436~“It's the Toyota Corolla of hotels and I mean that in a nice way”~The title really says it all; the hotel is perfect for people who don't require their hotel rooms to be furnished by Philippe Starck and Ralph Lauren and just want a nice place to stay.  The room I stayed in is a good size with two double beds and usual room furnishings. Easy to use aircon and tv are also present. The bathroom, shower only and no separate toilet, was bigger than some hotel rooms I've stayed in before so no worries there. Check in and out were fine and I requested a wakeup call, however, I work up before the requested time so I'll assume the phone would have rung right on time. The hotel is a ten minute walk to a major shopping centre, across the road from a swimming pool and ice rink and there's a bus stop diagonally across the road for a 15 minute bus ride into Civic which is Canberra's CBD. Like a Toyota Corolla, this hotel provides comfortable surroundings without extra cost luxuries.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_451828493~“Great room great price ”~Very happy with the queen size standard room here. Hot showers with good pressure. Air con was excellent, we stayed on a very hot summer night but the room was very cool.  Bed was good and the room was clean and stocked up with everything needed, extra pillows towels the lot.  Paid $15 for the breakfast, I suggest you eat early to get the fresher food.  Will gladly stay again~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450564557~“Decent hotel”~Average hotel but a decent quiet stay. Rooms facing the busy road were loud. Luckily I brought a fan to tone down the noise. Otherwise I'm not sure I would have gotten any sleep. Staff were friendly. Front desk were helpful. Be careful on your rates when checking in though. I booked through Wotif and noticed the hotel were going to charge me $50 more per night. I asked for a statement before I checked in. I hope this hotel will resolve that issue because how many Wotif or Expedia people would not look. I walked both nights to a nearby shopping village. Heaps of restaurants, Coles and Wolworths.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_450352605~“Nice stay”~Well located nearby Woden Shopping Centre, cinemas, restaurants, quiet area. Only a 15 min drive to CBD. Hotel is clean, well kept, basement car parking, customer service was good. No gym or pool on site however.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449787882~“Good price & location.”~Stayed the one night in a 2 double bed room with my son. Great location to everything we wanted to see and do in Canberra. Room size was very good and beds were comfy. Room and bathroom was clean. The building elevator is the only negative and must be the slowest in the world. Got the breakfast (13.50 each as hotel guests) and for a buffet breakfast wasn't too bad. I've had better but also had much much worse. Would definately stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449072025~“Not too bad at all”~We were happy with everything regarding the rooms on a recent three night stay. We stayed 2 nights in the family apartment (1x king bed in bedroom, 1x sofa bed in lounge room), and 1 night in a double room that had 2x queen size beds. Both rooms worked very well for us (2 adults and 2 <10yo kids). Hotel is easily accessible and very close to Woden Westfield (literally 400mtr away). Staff were polite, room spotless and good service every day. The road is not too noisy and the block-out curtains make a good nights sleep. We didnt eat at the attached Tradie's Club, but heard it was nice from other guests. The hotel has a guest laundry with 2x washers and 2x dryers ($2 each use).  Only 2 small complaints and really these are very minor: 1 - the lift. The entire building (4 floors + garage) are serviced by one very small and slow lift. It was usually not much of an issue, but trying to get from the top floor to the bottom floor and back up again at 8am involved a long wait for other guests and cleaning staff that were all trying to use the lift at the same time. 2 - parking. We were unable to use the garage due to the roof height being too low to fit our roof rack under. No complaint on this part from us but other guests did tend to use the front carpark even with smaller cars that did make parking at night fairly hard for us. Luckily, there was one free space in the carpark on each occasion, however if not for a bit of luck here we would have had to park out the back in an adjacent business carpark that was dimly lit and looked a little dodgy. The hotel could probably do a little better in managing the front carpark, especially in holiday periods and ask that guests use the garage instead of carpark (unless their vehicle is unsuitable - like ours was).  All in all, it was a good stay and we would definitely stay again.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_447354856~“Very roomy and comfortable but spoiled by poor breakfast, noisy neighbours and unmade room.”~My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights recently. We were initially very happy as the room was very spacious, the 2 double beds were very comfortable, everything was clean and it was very quiet at night. We had breakfast elsewhere most days, but 1 morning we decided to try the buffet breakfast - never again! Few cereal choices, only very watered down milk on offer, very sloppy scrambled eggs, bacon OK, a few pastries, a few slices of just 3 fruits. Very poor value for the $15 per head ($13.50 for hotel guests) Then on the 4th evening we returned back to our room to find that nothing had been serviced - no beds made, towels changed or general cleaning done. We complained but were told "I'll let my supervisor know". No contact made back to us. Then to top it off, on the last night there, we were awoken several times with loud talking, and extremely loud banging coming from next door. So off I went in my pj's to complain again. Thankfully this noise ceased and we found out next morning that the room beneath the noisy one had also complained. So all in all, we felt rather disappointed in our choice and will not stay there again. The unserviced room deserved at least some consolation!~2~2~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_447106059~“Disappointed ”~We stayed only one night . Firstly we booked a room with two double beds, with breakfast but when we arrived they put us on a one bedroom plus sofa. When I explained about the kids allergy.... they exchanged the room for finally 2 double beds as requested previously and I was informed on check in that wasn't available. The toilets wasn't clean . Had mold and black dirty around sink and shower. Before I put my kids to bed , I had a massive surprise that the bed sheets was dirty.... had pubic hair, and hasn't been changed from previous guest. Again complain to reception.... they had no spare clean bed sheets and also no staff working at night time to swap. 20 min later , a very kind receptionist brought a pair of clean bed sheet . To finalize , they show me the bill for 50 dollars breakfast, with apparently was included. Very very poor breakfast.... no variety at all.... only cold milk, no chocolate powder, very bad..... My suggestion is... if you are traveling for only one night stay .... don't loose your time at this hotel. Staff are good and helpful but the total price with hotel + breakfast, you probably will spend the same amount in a better and more clean hotel. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445722337~“Room and experience”~Location of the property is convenient. The actual hotel room is quite nice but the bathroom does not match the room decor, it appeared very basic in comparison. We had an emergency evacuation at around 3:30 am on the night we stayed. Everyone followed the evacuation announcement and somehow all moved to the front of the property.  We were one of the first to get there and watched people came down rather slowly over the next 20 over minutes, the fire engines arrived around 15 minutes into our wait. And interestingly, there was not a single staff or warden that surfaced to provide instructions where we should actually gather, or to account for everyone let alone advise what exactly is happening.  In the end, one of the fire fighters advised that all is fine and we could return to our rooms. As we were entering the property again through the main entrance, we saw one staff, standing by the reception desk politely smiling to everyone as people walked pass.  When we checked out the next day, we casually asked the receptionist what had happened and she advised it was some sprinkler issues in the basement that was meant to be fixed earlier. Honestly, not happy with this experience. Personally I expected the staff on duty (or night manager) trained on the evacuation procedures and acted promptly, we were lucky that nothing happened but what if it was a real fire, it could be potentially dangerous.~2~2~nan~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_443188313~“Excellent quality, convenient location and very affordable”~My wife and I stayed here for one night this past week. We had driven up from the coast to attend a reunion lunch, opting to stay overnight rather than drive straight home. What a great decision, and staying at Woden meant we were close to the lunch restaurant chosen for the reunion, and also only minutes away from Woden Mall. The hotel is really easy to find being on the main road from the centre of Canberra, looking smart and relatively new. Parking was straight off that road as well as plentiful and free. Checking in took no time at all and everything was ready for us, the bonus being a really welcoming chat with the receptionist ! Our room on the top floor overlooked a long view to the distant urban horizon and it was a blessing that, for once, we were not staring at brick walls only metres away or overlooked by an office block or similar. The room itself was quite large and airy, with a small balcony of usable size. We had been given a room with a queen bed plus also a single bed, a table for eating/relaxing and three chairs. A very pleasant layout and, as it turned out overnight, really comfortable beds and good pillows. The bathroom is similarly large and comes with plenty of great towels, wall-mounted bottles of shampoo and also shower-gel, with additional hand soap and body milk also provided. So nothing needed there ... everything laid on. We had a wonderful sleep and decided to breakfast in the mall rather than at the hotel itself. Checking out was similarly easy and, in sum, this is a very good property and was a wonderful and comfortable choice for our stay. I will definitely come again! My only small complaint is that placement of the high wall-mounted air conditioning unit meant that it blew straight onto the queen bed. My wife couldn't cope easily with this airflow and therefore slept well in the single bed, further away from that wall.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436712145~“Slipped”~Have stayed several times now for the location, and this visit's 4th floor room facing the main road was one of the better ones we've had, with a comfortable bed and quiet. But breakfast was dismal and there was no hot water on our second morning, apparently for the entire floor if not the whole hotel. This seemed to be a surprise to reception so was possibly just a faulty hot water system. However only one staff member on duty to attend to the queue at checkout sealed it, and we will stay somewhere else next time.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan

review_428990361~“Good value for money”~We recently stayed at this hotel. The rooms are a good size in a quiet location. This is a 3 star hotel in my opinion. The rooms are a good size. The bathrooms are a good size, but lack cupboard and bench space. There is also limited hooks for towels and clothes.They also need a bit of a refurbishment. They are a little bit tired with a lot of grout mould.  The restaurant in the club is very basic. The breakfast buffet is ok. But there is only instant coffee. It is also only open until 9am.

review_411275610~“Lovely Staff”~I've stayed at this hotel a few times for work. The rooms are very spacious and it's a great location if you're needing to access the National Capital Private or Public Hospitals. The staff at this establishment are well trained, friendly and very professional. They make your stay pleasant as they're always offering to assist where they can and giving a warm hello/good morning upon approach. Ladies if you're staying here you'll want to consider bringing your own condition. The one provided at the hotel is in a dispenser and is a 2 in 1, not very conditioning at all. Also I was a little hesitant to use the hair dryer in my room, it looked old and the test tag on the cord said "retest 2013" something the hotel should look into ASAP.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The bathroom was very spacious. it was a little outdated with the tile choice but it was much better to have the space that for it to be extremely modern. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

review_403830713~“Clubber”~Good location if you need to visit a close-by Club or Canberra Hospital. Parking out the front of the Hotel can be a problem while booking in, but free parking is provided underneath out of the winter frost. Rooms are large and you can ask for a sunny balcony. For some unknown reason Canberra clubs charge interstate visitors for honorary membership, but it is complementary for the adjoining affiliated Tradies Club during your stay. If you like Greek food and atmosphere then the Hellenic Club is also close by. The only inconvenience was that the lift was out of operation when we checked out.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_397684697~“Comfortable with great staff”~I stay here for work purposes and have been doing so for approx. the last 6 or so months. Rooms are clean and very comfortable. My pick is definantly the Teasdale Suite, a one bedroom apartment. Cosy and feels like you are at home not staying in a Hotel. Staff is amazing and there is daily service to the rooms. If there was to be a downside it would be that they are not fully self contained. There is the usual microwave, toaster etc. but no actual stove. In saying that there is a variety of utensils for cooking, For me being away for a period of time, I take my slow cooker which does save $$ by not having to eat down stairs every night. Close to Fyshwick markets, Ikea etc. and 15 - 20 minutes walk to Westfield shopping centre and Hoyts movies.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_395922736~“Pretty good for the price”~We stayed at Quality hotel for one night on our way to the mountains. The staff were very friendly as I had to call them to let them know that we will be late checking in due to the wild weather on the way. Our room was big and specious and beds were firm. The breakfast was decent too.  I would have given 5 stars except for 2 things - when I called the hotel to let them know that we will be come in by 9, they did not mention that the bistro will be closed at 9 and we should cater for our own dinner. Also, the price of the buffet breakfast for adult was fine for $15 but the kids was $12. That I found a bit steep compared to adults.  Otherwise, good stay that I recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395353827~“Not Bad”~We recently spent three nights at this hotel. We were quite pleased with our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel room was warm and comfortable, as was the bed. Yes, it is a little dated but don't let this deter you. Some below par comments on the breakfast deal with the Tradies Club and, although not 5 star, we found it quite good with plenty of variety for all tastes. Some great places to eat, very close, especially the Italian Restaurant and Noodles Cafe across the road. The only negative is one elevator and lots of people to move.

review_391229321~“Stayed here to visit family during school holidays”~We really enjoyed this hotel. The service was very good. Friendly front desk and a problem with air conditioner was promptly fixed and we were contacted a day later and asked if it was working. There is a club connected to the hotel with reasonably priced meals and local wines. It was good for dinner or breakfast. We had a small balcony which would have been nice in summer. Easy walk to shopping or eating out. Very good hotel for family. Free parking underneath, laundry on site and good wifi.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389920746~“One night stay”~2 of us stayed here in June and found it to be quite a nice place. Hotel is joined to a club,so all you have to do is go downstairs and you can eat,drink,play pokies or have a bet at the TAB. When you stay here you become a temporary member of the club for the duration of your stay and for $15 each a full breakfast is served at the club. Rooms are clean with everything that you need for a comfortable stay included,~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_386276753~“Short stay”~Stayed here 2 nights. Handy location room very clean & comfortable, big bathroom. Secure parking easy access to lift from carpark. So glad the room had a balcony so we could open the door to let in some fresh cool air, even though it was winter the room was very warm. Had all our meals at Tradies why go out in the cold. The food was plentiful & very nice the Chicken Schnitzel, Roast Pork , Barramundi & Lemon Sole were all delicious as were the vegetables. Would have no problem staying here again~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386262285~“Very clean, with friendly staff.”~We decided at the last minute to head to Canberra for the weekend and booked this hotel for a great rate. It exceeded out expectations, with a large room and very clean facilities. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient. We ate dinner at Tradies and enjoyed our meal, especially the various gluten free options.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_385073843~“Convenient location, comfortable beds, secure parking, close to amenities.”~We chose this motel for its handy location. It is only 15 minutes by car from the city area, the Parliamentary Triangle, and many attractions. The bus interchange is close by.  It is only a short walk to Woden Shopping Centre, which is a medium sized mall. There are lots of places to eat if you don't want to eat at the motel. It is also close to the Hellenic Club which serves meals for a variety of prices. We did not eat at the Tradies Club which is on-site as we had other facilities. The room was very spacious with two double beds (which we found very comfortable) and the usual chairs and table, tea making facilities, fridge, ironing board and iron, TV, etc. This room had a lockable communicating door with the next room, useful for families. The large bathroom was well appointed with lots of towels and a large shower. The free underground car park is secure. The lift is managed using a key card .The staff were friendly and helpful.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_382328540~“Good location, basic amenities, avoid breakfast”~Was there for 2 nights on business. Location is excellent. Service was friendly. You'll have to buzz in after hours as entrances are locked and monitored by CCTV. Wifi signal is adequate. Room service requires a minimum expenditure of $15 with an additional $5 service charge while breakfast at the restaurant is buffet-style only at $15. It was basic continental breakfast, with scrambled eggs, over fried bacon, toast, fruits. not necessarily appetising, nor worth sampling. It's within walking distance to a Westfields, where there's Coles and Woolworth and bakeries for alternatives. Room has a toaster and biscuits are provided with the complimentary mini bar. The room is spacious, but when I arrived, the doors and screen to the balcony were unlocked - do check for security when you arrive. There are no gym nor pool facilities, but the surrounding area is good for a nice run.  Bathroom was large, water pressure good, and toiletries are dispensed from wall dispensers.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_381794343~“Hotel was fine but don't eat at The Tradies Club”~This hotel was well priced and centrally located. Our room was large, spotlessly clean and the beds were very comfortable. The only negative was the food next door at The Tradies. Their restaurant supplies the food for room service and they offer discounts to guests who dine there.  We thought we would support the club and have an early dinner. We both ordered the roast pork which was the special of the day. What a mistake! Although it was a generous serving, the meat was Luke warm, dry, tasteless and smothered in slimy gravy. The frozen vegetables were soggy and the potatoes undercooked. The following day we both had upset stomachs. Needless to say we won't be returning to the restaurant but we really liked the hotel itself. Oh & if you fancy seeing a film while you're there, do yourself a favour & check out the Hoyts Cinema in Woden. Every cinema has luxurious, leather reclining seats & huge screens. SO nice!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381007357~“Mismanaged and uncomfortable”~I checked into this hotel, only to find that another person's belongings were already sitting in my room. A major security breach. I was given another room, but couldn't help wonder if someone else would end up coming into my room! The bed was very hard and I found it difficult to get comfortable. The pillows were good though, so I was able to fashion a make-shift bed out of them. The free wi-fi was fast and easy to connect to. There was free parking out the front and I got a space without any issues. I was given the luxury of a late 11am checkout with no extra charge, only to have the housekeeper repeatedly knock on my door and attempt to gain entry at 9:30am while I was still asleep - well before the standard check-out time of 10am. It was pretty scary hearing someone try to come in while I was in bed. There was no "do not disturb" sign for guests to use, and this may have addressed that issue.  The mini bar was reasonable but contained no alcohol. It was more of a mini-kiosk. However you could go down to the bar if you wanted something else. The room was fairly quiet and I was able to sleep through the night.  Due to the uncomfortable bed and messups with the room occupancy I won't be staying here again.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~4~2~nan
review_375341531~“Good value accommodation”~I chose this hotel primarily on its location, which was convenient to the business I was visiting in Canberra. If your business was in the centre of the city, or you were visiting as a tourist, it might not be so convenient a location: it is however, easy to get to from the centre by car (a 10 minute drive, don't know about public transport). Hotel itself is clean and comfortable, has room service, free wi-fi, and a buffet breakfast is a very reasonable $15 ( although there is not a huge selection of dishes). I was surprised to find the hotel is known as "The Tradies" which is a social club attached to the hotel, run by the CFMEU; which I guess explains the name. The club provides discount meals and slot machines, and hotel guests can join and enjoy the facilities. This is a reasonably priced, good quality (no pun intended) hotel.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_374046587~“IRRESPONSIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE”~I called to book 4 rooms for a weekend. It was a complicated booking and couldn't be done online, so had no choice but to call. The customer service person was busy checking people in and said she'll call me back in about 15 minutes. I waited for over an hour and finally called her. She said she was still busy and I waited another 20 min or so till she finally called me back. It then took almost an hour to explain to her what I was after and make the bookings (it was a complicated situation though). After spending several hours in total on this project, I finally had 4 bookings made and the lady said she'll get the manager to send me confirmation the next day because my order will have a discount, since so many rooms. Several days later, no confirmation. When I called back, turns out I HAD NO BOOKINGS!. Luckily they had rooms available, except one, which they managed to move some people around and open up for us. When I requested a discount, given the trouble and stress I was put through, the receptionist lady absolutely refused and couldn't care less that they didn't do their job. She said it wasn't her!!! Absolutely appalling responsibility values from the staff. I asked to speak to her manager but apparently this woman was working alone (it was late eve), unsupervised! No wonder they can't do their job right...they are understaffed and unsupervised! UNACCEPTABLE. That same lady promised to send me my confirmations, which I didn't get...had to call back again!!! NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_373967028~“Very good facilities here and nearby”~Two days (onsite course) and one night accommodation - chose to stay here because the course I attended used a function room onsite (in the connected Tradies club). Rooms are adequate but the bathroom seemed sparse and in need of an update. Get in early for undercover parking as it's limited. An excellent Noodle House across the road too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_373919052~“Good place to stay, close to everything.”~We had to come to Canberra on a family emergency and chose this motel as it was close to the hospital. We needed a room for 3, and got a room with a queen and sofa bed. It had limited kitchen facilities, but was attached to a pub with reasonable food. There is also a coin operated laundry onsite. Parking included. Down side was having to ask for our room to be cleaned most days, but this could have been because we were extending our booking on a day to day basis.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_369089607~“Nice Hotel”~Nice hotel Beds very comfortable in a convenient location. Room was clean.  On the downside but nothing major. Confusing booking confirmation saying adjoining rooms which wasn't the case and the key cards were temperamental. Also no milk for coffee.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368837975~“Nice place”~Friendly staff and located near most things. The rooms are were clean and comfortable, but a little tired. Modern furniture, but older style bathroom and balcony. No problems during our stay and good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_368023764~“Did the job and was clean and tidy!”~I purchased via Hotel.com for a Saturday Night @ a cost of $144.00 Aud for 2 x Double Beds and a preference on ground floor. I was contacted the day before asking if I wanted a King and a Single which I requested 2 x Double Beds. It was a bit of a hassle getting the 2 x Double Beds but I explained the situation that I have an 18yr old boy who needs a double bed but the hotel finally accommodated this request and it was on level 3. The reason I requested the ground floor was that my son was competing in a mountain push bike ride where I could not leave the pushbike on the vehicle as it is expensive and may have been stolen. It was no hassle though as there was an elevator and we just kept it in the bathroom. The room was clean and tidy and I would stay at this hotel again if another event would be held in the vicinity.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367637188~“Handy Place To Stay”~Rooms clean and well presented. Roomy bright and well appointed. Bathroom clean with all complimentary shampoos etc. Underground parking a great bonus with elevator to your room floor. Staff attentive but hard to understand. Had Buffet breakfast that was the worst meal ever. Toaster that needed 4 goes to brown bread, Rubber scrambled eggs, sloppy fried tomatoes, bacon like shoe leather so after 1 meal I gave it a miss and ate at a nearby café who knew how to cook.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_361330564~“Handy location............”~Just stayed one night at the Quality Hotel, and for my purposes it was the perfect location. Staff were friendly, room was clean and tidy, super comfortable bed with beautiful linen and a great hot shower. Its not the Hilton, but all I wanted was a comfortable nights sleep and it served the purpose beautifully. The Woden Shopping Mall is right next door and the Southern Cross Club for a meal / drink is a leisurely 10 minute walk away. There is a restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel called Tradies, but I didn't get the opportunity to experience it personally.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_360506367~“There are other choices”~This choice was driven by price but not a preferred option although is easy to locate and great to have the Tradies dining option so conveniently attached. Specified a room that was not interconnecting and ended up with an interconnecting room. There is always noise that escapes through the interconnecting door and as a business traveller I explicitly request quiet, not interconnecting and away from family bookings. Two trainees on Reception so check in took a bit longer. Duty Manager there to assist but Reception was busy and people look to get through Reception quickly and to their room. Outside parking limited and exposed to elements. Option for underground parking which would be better as the Canberra cold season approaches. Room spacious, nothing special with dated décor although the bed was surprisingly comfortable. Bathroom functional and shower also spacious. Awful toiletries and bulk shampoo/hand wash – I don’t use them but bring my own. Seeking a quiet room I was a bit dismayed to be placed near the elevator. Noise from others – bit of a shouting match somewhere inside – still, can’t control some of these activities. Check out efficient but different team. It’s a functional hotel but there are other options for stays. Close to Woden centre so shopping facilities are nearby. Bus interchange is a hub for connecting anywhere in Canberra so a car is non-essential.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_355473018~“Good value accommodation with expected amenities”~Recently, my husband and I stayed in this hotel for three nights and I was presently surprised at the quality of the room and the amenities provided. It was indeed very good value for the money we paid. The room was spacious and tea and coffee making facilities and a bar fridge were provided. Although it is not located in the city centre, the bus terminal, shopping centre and restaurants are within walking distance.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_354503374~“Exceeded Expectations”~We returned to Canberra for a longish weekend, to attend to some business and to catch up with friends and relatives. As former Canberra residents we were aware of this hotel as interstate work colleagues had stayed there and had commented favourable, but the clincher in our selecting this hotel for our five night stay was its reasonable price compared to most of its high-priced rivals in the National Capital. The welcome by Reception staff was warm and friendly and the efficient and helpful service continued throughout our stay. Our room was very spacious and well maintained (not luxurious, but good value for money). Amenities in the room (including tea/coffee, free wifi and daily newspaper) were better than we had experience at other hotels on our recent visits to Canberra. We will happily return here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_347082671~“Ticks all the boxes!”~We spent 2 nights here recently and found it both comfortable and conveniently located. We had undercover parking and free wi-fi to go with our spacious room and on our first night we were able to find a range of restaurants within walking distance. The Tradies Club was a handy place for dinner the following night and the Woden shopping mall is right there as well. Being close to some major arterial roads made the place easy to find and also made it easy to get in to the city and and other major centres. The location, as well as the facilities, will definitely see us returning whenever we visit Canberra.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

What a surprise we got when we arrived, the staff were very friendly, the hotel lovely and the room was exceptional. It was spotless, spacious and the beds were very comfortable. We had a balcony with plenty of room to sit outside and look at the view. The Tradies club which is attached offered a lovely breakfast at a very reasonable price. We couldn't fault this as a place to stay.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

The room was very clean with 2 good size very comfortable beds.

review_339284019~“Clean, comfortable and good value”~We stayed two nights in the Quality Hotel Woden. Arriving at 4pm, we did not have any issues with the front reception doors opening, nor did we have any issues checking in or out. The room was spacious, clean and quite comfortable. We ordered room service on the first night. It came from the Tradies restaurant next door. Whilst it was basic fare, it was quite good and hearty, quick and still warm! Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the second night as we spent the whole night in hospital with a sick child, but we would definitely stay there again! It is close to the Westfield for shopping and dining and only 20mins from the city centre and other attractions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_333458109~“reasonably priced, but average hotel”~staid overnight for early hospital appointment. Arrived 7.30 pm - door was closed. checked in, confusion re name, married vs maiden; lift is still very sensitive, slow, no jumping, no overload, no nothing... camera right in your face; room; instead of requested queensize bed, two doubles. Appeared to be interconnecting rooms - our door was partly open. Was the other door closed? nope - hello neighbour! Receptionist not too fazed, oh, sorry. will lock it for you if it is a problem. really? Went for a feed to the Tradies club - undercooked steak and deepfried fishermans basket. Airconditioner very noisy. unable to open windows. Thats it. No more stays here for us.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan

Cannot rate the dining facilities as we attended a function else where, other wise overall a nice quite stay.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_331148844~“Comfortable and quirky”~Stayed here for work and room was clean and well equipped apartment with free parking undercover or in a carpark out front. easy walking distance to restaurants and supermarkets in Woden 'town centre'.  Negative s- you need your hotel room key for EVERYTHING. To get in and then out of the restaurant below, the lift, the front door, it is quite annoying. The reception wanted to take a photo copy of your licence plus $100 bond on checkin ( "in case we need to call the police" was the response). The breakfast is truely awful and I avoided. Verdict - was staying here for work, comfortable apartment though very poor internet connection~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_329891484~“good and safe”~Is clean and safe, you need the card key anytime to open the lift and the restaurant. the service is acceptable. The carpark is good and next to a shopping and restaurants. but is nessesary a car anytime.  The restaurant likes good, but expensive, due to I didn´t eat there,  I payed extra for the breakfast and wasn´t enoght, just eggs and bacon, but not well done. thumbs down. The cost is good.~3~3~2~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_328323585~“Over ruled ”~Hard to enter if auto doors not switched on for arrival as it has a poorly signed entrance. Horrid check in over room request plus surcharge on credit card yet again & location of room. Once we got that issue ironed out got quiet room on top floor, still not what I paid for but ok. In it a fan of hotels you book a particular room and they have 50 excuses why you can't get one. Given breakfast coupons in business package but unless you have an hour in morning no point in waiting. If you want to eat on site must become member of social club then you can gain entry into club. Not bad pricing but 2 meal I ate were in a word rubbish. Known for our schnitzel says the sign, mine was hard as rock & not edible.  Only plus was laundry night, 4 machines only $2 & $1 for soap. If I return to area would check other options. Check out was slow, inaccurate & final straw.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_327259979~“Excellent value, location, cleanliness. Recommended.”~I was very happy with my stay here (for business.) I'd go back and I'd recommend it. Well-priced and I've really only one minor gripe about the slight inconsistency of the hot water in the shower but overall, it's an excellent facility. My room (211) was spacious, impeccably clean and the beds were very comfortable. Free parking in the basement was a bonus as too was the adjoining Tradies Club (restaurant - similar to an RSL) where the buffet breakfast is served (it had a good variety of edibles and was only $13.50) and you can have lunch and dinner there too. I had room service and while it was nothing terribly fancy, it was wholesome and tasty, quick and certainly very convenient. The Westfield shopping mall (and cinema) is only a 5-minute walk away and this too is incredibly convenient. Highly recommended overall. Enjoyed my two-night stay (and had no trouble with the lift as others seem to mention.)~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_326830856~“A good value 4 star Canberra Hotel”~Quite a new hotel in good condition, with good sized rooms.

review_325653619~“Good basic motel style accomodation”~Stayed here on a recent work trip to Canberra and the hotel offers good but basic accommodation. The rooms are certainly spacious but the whole complex is a bit tired. The location is good being about a 10 minute walk from the Woden Westfield, which has a few good restaurants. The hotel Wifi is a bonus but it lacks the few Foxtel channels that most hotels have to offer.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_324307368~“Couple of nights work trip”~Very nice and clean hotel. The tradies pub downstairs has great meals, beer and pokies so no need to go anywhere for the night. Room was quite clean and quiet.  The lift is a shocker and is very slow and with only 4 or 5 floors stopping at all levels seemed to take the whole morning. The elevator music is also something to behold. Parking is underground and easy to access. Overall quiet happy and would stay here again.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_324072556~“No customer service and complete lack of care”~The hot water tap in the shower did not work (not just no hot water, but no water) so improvisation was required using the bath tap. Reception was notified at 7am and upon my return at 9pm that night when I asked if it had been fixed I was asked to go, check and then let them know! When I asked what the receptionist planned to do in the event that it was not fixed I was told I could boil a kettle for hot water. When I checked (having left reception as she clearly was not going to be helpful) the tap did now work but the shower head had been installed upside down so the water went up towards the ceiling. I removed the shower head and replaced it the right way round myself and rang reception (since she was clearly not intending to follow up) to let her know. I was then rudely rung at 11pm as now she had some time (!!!) so she could come to my room. UNBELIEVABLE!!! No feedback forms were provided despite asking and there was complete disinterest, no apology and if there was the option to rate this worse than terrible this would rate 2 levels down from that.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_323781083~“Good Value”~Spacious, clean rooms and a good shower. Bed was firm and comfortable. Only slight negative was music from the adjoining Tradies Tavern/Hotel which our room looked onto, but it didn't go late. Overall, good value for Canberra.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan

Staff are very helpful but don't bother with the breakfast. It is appalling and held in the next door club at the Tradies. The coffee did not taste like anything more than coloured water. Good light breaky if you are in a hurry. Go down the road for a decent tea or coffee.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_316745365~“Clean and spacious”~The rooms were very clean and spacious. We were a family of four: parents plus a baby and toddler. Plenty of room for a cot and our luggage. The service was great - fast check in and check out, we didn't require anything else. The lift is a bit slow & small but not too bad. If you have a car it is a very quick drive to all the landmarks. There is also a Westfield within walking distance. We stayed there because our friends live nearby and we just needed a bed to sleep in. I am very particular about cleanliness. This hotel exceeded our expectations for these purposes.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_314976768~“Five night stay”~First, a clean spacious room,large bathroom,cleaned and towels changed daily. An experience on the second night when the smoke alarm went off at 2.45am, due ,I believe,to a night porter making toast and burning it. We were on the top, 4th floor, by the time we evacuated the fire engines were on hand. Secondly, A very useful location for getting around by car in Canberra. Free underground car park with security gate at night. Restaurant quite reasonable,though free membership of The Tradies Club required to use it. Breakfast tickets from reception desk required to get a breakfast. Pros, it was within walking distance of where we wanted to go, Cons only one slow lift, and stairs we walked down many times. Free daily newspapers.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_313960477~“Good Points and Not so good points”~The location of this hotel for us was good. What was frustrating first up is that we arrived one and a half hours after check in time and our room wasn't ready. After a very exhausting day, to wait a further half an hour was not ideal.  So we had a one bedroom apartment. The room was fairly good but would've loved a bath given that there was a great deal of empty space in the bathroom. The worst thing about our visit was that the hotel fire alarm went off at 2:30AM and we had to evacuate until the fire brigade declared it all ok. My children, understandably, were petrified to go back in and it took me a good hour after returning to the room, of reassurance that everything was ok. On checkout, the receptionist asked how our stay was and after another guest and myself made reference to how tired we are from the nights events and me explaining about the fear of my children, there was no apology or 'we are sorry that had to happen', just a simple 'oh but you got to go back to your bed'. A definite lack of empathy and you could tell she wanted to brush over the nights events. A lack of customer service like this puts a sour taste in your mouth to stay again!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_313483578~“Happy Stopover ”~My family stopped in Canberra on our way to Sydney and stayed at the Quality Hotel Woden. The room was very modern, clean and spacious.

review_312599007~“Perfect choice when in Woden”~This is a great hotel to stay in, very convenient to the shops and hospital. The room was quiet and the bed super comfortable with a gorgeous mattress topper. We had an accessible room however didn't really need those facilities but it was great to have the space of the easy access shower and toilet. I would have liked some plates and cutlery in the room as there was a toaster with no knife or plate to use it with. I would definately stay here again, great friendly staff and nothing was too much trouble. We loved it that the Tradies club was just through a doorway and handy for a quick dinner or lunch. The ice skating rink across the road was ideal as would the pool be however it's outdoor so only in summer it would be open. Only a walk to Westfield shopping centre a bonus.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_312494254~“Clean, quiet and modern”~I stayed one night for a work trip and found the room 207, to be clean, well appointed, very quiet and warm. The hotel is next to a club I didn't go in but instead opted for room service. I had a great steak but no salt or pepper or sauce/mustard! Breakfast I had the continental In room version. There is a jug and toaster. There was a shower (no bath)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_310006472~“Large Rooms with comfy bed”~Stayed for business. Don't recommend the breakfast...better off walking to the town square shopping (Westfield) or the Smoque. Dinner was OK but not particularly cheap especially for a "Legendary Parma"...anyhow you be the judge I like the rooms for size and bed quality. Don't like how particularly thin the walls were especially when a couple decided it would be a good idea to "kick on" from 2am to 3am on a weekday!  Yes I would probably stay again if I had business in Woden/Weston area.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_309746566~“Great service, very clean rooms.”~We stayed at the quality hotel Woden in September. We had a queen size bed and a single bed in the room on the 4 th floor. On arrival the staff were very friendly and welcoming. They went out of their way to accommodate us. We travelled with 2 adults and a 10 yr old child. The room was very clean and had almost everything we needed. I was surprised because they did not have a safe in the room. The motel had undercover secure parking which was great. The price per night was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this motel. The Tradies club was located downstairs (their food was not great)~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_304608891~“One night stay”~Went to Canberra for a funeral. Stayed here one night. Found it convenient , clean and comfortable. Bar and Bistro quite OK And prices reasonable for these but watch the accommodation price. It seems to vary and be somewhat high and not necessarily what is advertised. This hotel is very handy to local restaurants and many facilities. Within 10 walk of the big Southern Cross Club which is highly regarded. I would recommend it as around four star accommodation.

review_303163514~“Great place for a family or economical accommodation.”~I had a meeting in Woden, one of the Government centres in Canberra, and was booked to stay in this hotel. It's very clean, basic, affordable and right near Westfield shopping and some affordable restaurants.~3~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_300117777~“Great Little Stay”~This hotel is situated near Canberra in a small suburb called Woden. The rooms were spacious with two large twin beds. There was a heating/cooling device on the wall with comfortable bedding. The front desk girls were very helpful. The lift not so good taking a long time between floors. There is a shopping centre nearby where you can buy food or other requirements. The hotel is affiliated with a Tradies lounge where you can get a tasty pub meal.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_299033343~“Comfortable stay for ACT weekend away”~We stayed here for a weekend getaway visiting friends and family in July 2014. The room was very spacious and we had a kitchenette. the bathroom had a corner spa bath which was nice and they provide you with bathroom products like shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and moisturiser etc made from native Australian plants which all smelled really good. Was a nice touch I felt, being in the Australian capital and all. It gets so cold in Canberra in the winter, so the ability to control the temperature in the room was appreciated.  The Southern Cross Club is nearby.Staff were friendly and the breakfast was good. Thanks for a nice weekend away :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
