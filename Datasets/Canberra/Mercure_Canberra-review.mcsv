review_478368483~“Excellent value, clean, spacious and friendly”~Great value room, had a stay 3 nights but pay for 2. The room was very spacious, clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Only issue I had was being charged $10 per day for parking. I would recommend the Mercure Canberra.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan

review_477595994~“Super Central - Great Value”~Easy walking distance to the main shopping, eating and entertainment centre of Civic in the downtown area, Very comfortable rooms, extra large "lounging" area in the rooms which gave you the feeling of space and not being crammed in. Parking was a little tight if you have a larger car as we do ( a Toyota Prado). Staff pleasant and were very obliging with up to date information on their city.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476677124~“Very comfortable and great location”~We (travelled with my mother in her 80's) stayed here as we came to see the exhibition of "Versaille, Treasure of the Palace". Our room was very comfortable, room with twin beds. The location was in an easy driving distance to the exhibition.  Customer service at check-in for us was very lacking. Two young males checking in people, one we could overhear was very friendly, helpful to his guest, showing her a map, explaining about places. The male we had just checked us in, no conversation - had we been here before, were we going to be visiting any attractions etc, nothing. I asked for a map. He gave us one. No information relating to the map was given, like opening the map and showing us :- hotel is here... etc etc. He told us our room number, I said how do we get there... he said past the desk and up the stairs. I said where do we park the car, he said if no room at the front of hotel (which there wasn't) park around the back. I had to ask how to get there. Just no information was forthcoming for anything. Parked the car at the back (apparently you have to pay for the parking, I didn't know this. But their gate wasn't working, so parking was free for us). Now there is a bit of a walk from the carpark, back to the front of the hotel where our room was situated. A bit of flat walking and some steps, more flat walking, more steps. So this wouldn't really suit someone with a wheelchair or a walker, or a pram.  Fortunately I had noticed on a booking site the hotel had a lift. That was going to be helpful for my mother. She can manage stairs but not heaps of them. I ended up changing booking sites and didn't check details (so my fault). There wasn't a lift to our room. Our room was up on a mezzanine level, a couple of steps higher than the first floor.  Asked at the desk where are the lifts, we got the same male again. He said lift is in the new bit of the hotel not the older bit. No offer of help with our bags. He could see my mother was elderly.  Anyway, finally got to our room, quite spacious, clean and comfortable, we were very happy with our room. Decided we would go for a drive, so I could get my bearings for the exhibition we were seeing the next day and then we would have dinner. So back downstairs, got the same male again, and asked is there somewhere to eat here. His reply: yes we have a bistro. I said well where is it. Him: through those glass doors. Me: what time does it open and close. Him: 9pm. For his attitude alone I would never stay here again. Truly he is in the wrong job. Checked out the next morning, two different males on the checkin counter. Handed in our key, he said everything is right room has been paid for, you just need to pay for one breakfast. I said we didn't have breakfast, we brought our own. He said well that's interesting, I will have to look into that'.  So really I am sorry to say I would never recommend this hotel to friends on our experience with no customer service.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~2~nan
review_475421469~“Mercure Braddon ACT. ERNH64”~Centrally located for War Memorial and National Art Gallery. Restaurant too expensive for an overnight stay but Bistro food excellent quality and value for money. The included full buffet breakfast enjoyable, room was comfortable and spacious. Excellent king bed. Only disappointment was mould in the shower recess.~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475186889~“Versaille,Treasure of the Palace”~I visited this exhibition with my grandaughter this week and we took advantage of the Mercure Canberra package.We stayed 2 nights So glad I did,this is the 2nd time I have stayed here and it is now my go to place in the ACT.We were greeted on arrival by a very cheery and helpful staff member who immediately offered us an upgraded room.The room was lovely,spacious,clean and overlooked the gardens.Breakfast was included,much to the delight of my grandaughter,and it was great,very substantial and set us up for the day.Dined in Olims bistro 1st night and had room service from Olims on the 2nd night and again the food was very good. I highly recommend Mercure Canberra to anyone wanting great,comfortable accommodation in Canberra.Very close to everything.Ask for room 405.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475135560~“Great short holiday visit to Canberra - War Memorial & Versaille exhibition”~We go to Canberra regularly, usualy in the school holidays. This time we wanted to see the daily 4.55pm Last Post Ceremonies at the War Memorial so stayed for 3 nights in the Mercure which is in easy walking distance. We had a comfortable room on the ground floor with a balcony and a view of the courtyard. Everything was terrific especially the magnificent meal we had on the Tuesday night in the restaurant. My only crticism, and it is one that applies to most hotels that I have stayed in. The quality of the flat screen TV was not great, a very cheap brand with poor resolution & pixilation.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473939424~“Comfortable Stay”~Stayed for 3 days. Had a great room - ground floor, large with balcony and outdoor area. King bed and large bathroom. All very clean and spacious with little road noise. Staff were very informative and friendly. Ate at both the restaurant and bistro and had good meals in both. Very good location. Central, close to War Memorial in safe neighborhood and easy walk to the lake. Excellent value and will be back~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473540520~“Beautiful Old Girl”~This hotel has a lot of old world charm in the communal areas. Great location. Easy walk to Australian War Memorial. Fresh crisp quality sheets. Nice sized rooms. Very quiet area and easy parking. My room needed a new bed as it was a two single king with dips like a hammock. Just ask for a room with a new bed. Breakfast selection is good. Restaurant is closed Sunday and Monday nights.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473472697~“Customer Service at its best”~I initially wrote a negative post but then edited. This is a lovely old world charm hotel but it does also have a bistro attached so if you come on a night when there is football on prepare yourself for some rowdiness. There is a more 'upmarket ' restaurant which is also the breakfast room. The dinner menu was good albeit a tad expensive and a bit heavy on the seafood (I am allergic). My initial tiny room had some kind of compressor right outside the window that was playing up and sounded like a helicopter hovering overhead hence my initial negativity. However, management's swift handling of the situation in moving me, without hesitation, to an upgraded and quiet room was spectacular customer service in my room. I would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473245104~“Comfortable "old fashioned" hotel.”~This hotel has an old fashioned feel to to it. It is spread out a bit with a nice internal courtyard area. The reception area is lined in a darkish wood panelling and this adds to its character. The rooms are really nice (303) quite spacious - with a king sized bed, comfy seat with foot rest, desk/ chair, small bureau with a mini fridge ( well stocked), tea/ coffee makings, suitcase stand, wardrobe. There is a nice balcony with chairs and a table. Bathroom is modern with a shower cubicle, toilet, sink area with free toiletries. We had a great night's sleep! If I treturn, this will be the hotel for me! Free wifi if you join the loyalty scheme!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_472580953~“Great location ”~Got asked if we wanted to upgrade our room. Pleased we did, just gave you heaps more room for very little $ per night. Room was clean and well presented. Breaky ok. Had dinner in the bistro one night. Looks a bit tired but the food good. Location to the war memorial was awesome. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472541165~“Lots of history and character”~This Hotel has been around since the mid 20's and carries that character today. The room we had was two story with the sleeping and bathroom up a narrow staircase with two turns. the room was clean and had all we needed. The lounge room was quite large and included a nice desk and comfortable balcony (ground level) which overlooked the court yard, it was quite nice and relaxing to sit out there. A small "kitchen" was just inside the entrance door which would be ample for cooking or heating a small meal. The television in the lounge area down stairs was a good size and the lounge comfortable. lighting in all areas except the bathroom is dim. Upstairs there was a comfortable king size bed and firm pillows, the area is quite small as it was most likely designed to have a double bed, very small television and a stand alone older style wardrobe. the bathroom has been refurbished and is quite small, really only one person at a time. the bath and shower were both good, nice mirror for the vanity and enough bench space (for us). We enjoyed our evening, there is a book on the history of this (Ainsley hotel) on the coffee table, and it is fun to flick through. it is a shame it is a fair way from Canberra centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_472289103~“Decent Hotel”~We had a 3 night stop here and found it quite characterful, the room was a good size looking out onto a garden courtyard, it was comfortable with all the necessary fitments in place. Nice bathroom. There's a reasonable restaurant which serves breakfast and dinner if required and a sports bar and restaurant.  The only downside I found was our room location was quite tortuous to get to when arriving and leaving with luggage, the room was on the ground floor but had to travel outside up and down several sets of stairs. So if you're infirm best to get a good room location on booking.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470942543~“Trip to Canberra”~Good location, good Bistro and Restaurant. Friendly staff. However, the building is now quite old and is showing its age and needs renovation. EG: Windows that will not open, skirting boards with lots of paint off and walls need painting.~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_470531592~“No pazazz, just comfortable and homely”~The Mercure brand is unfailingly reliable, and this hotel in Braddon doesn't have great views of anything and it's not spectacular, but it's predictably comfortable, clean and quiet. It's also quite a large hotel and quite spread out, but it has rear access from a large carpark which is very convenient.~4~4~4~5~4~4~4~nan
review_470417046~“Great value at a great location”~This place is a bit older but has had a renovation. Our room was cosy and nice. Small bathroom but very clean and well maintained. The staff were very nice and very helpful. We forgot a few things and they helped us out. It is a very easy walk or short drive to most places you want to visit. Good value for us as well.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470398362~“Lovely experience”~This is a lovely old style hotel with all the character of a hotel built almost 100 years ago. The rooms were clean and very comfortable and the staff were friendly. The meals at the restaurant were first class.~4~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_470127169~“Friendly staff”~I stayed there for a night. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but small. There was room for a queen sized bed and not much else. There was a small wooden desk with a dining chair rather than an office chair and no other chairs to sit on. The bath room looked as though it was recently renovated and very nice. The walls needed washing/repainting but the rest of the room was clean. The corridors reminded me of something from Fawlty Towers (fortunately nothing else did!). I didn't try the restaurant. The location is very convenient......only a short walk to the war memorial, shopping centre and convention centre.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470010423~“Very Odinary but OK for one night”~A half leisure half business hotel and thus ideal for neither but sufficient. Rooms OK but not sot special, long corridors to some rooms, adequate parking. Large sports bar and terrace fairly busy. Dining room minimalist and soulless. Service good but seemingly understaffed.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_469927996~“Do not trust all reviews!”~Relying on reviews from a single website is a mistake we will not make again! How so many experienced Tripadvisor reviewers rated Mercure Canberra Australia as Excellent and Very Good is a mystery. Built in 1927 and added to over the last 90 years has created a disorganised collection of rooms, corridors, entrances, stairways, levels and facilities that is now in need of a serious and major upgrade. Both outside and in, the general condition of the complex, fittings and furniture in rundown. Creaking floors, narrow corridors, surface wiring, added fire doors and poor quality repairs and additions does not match the “Mercure” brand. Check in and check out was smooth and efficient and all members of the staff were friendly, happy and helpful. Our bed and linen was clean, fresh and in good condition. Parking is available onsite at an extra $10 per day. We will not stay there again… Our room was in poor condition with mould and cobwebs in the very compact bathroom. Although the TV screen was large, it was a low-grade poor quality unit. Everywhere we looked, we saw disorganised equipment, furniture, supplies and boxes. The Bistro and bar are poorly maintained with a “pub” style atmosphere including sticky tables, empty salt & pepper, uninteresting menu and tired meal presentation. For those with any disability you will find steps everywhere, a maze of corridors and pathways, unfriendly furniture and a number of other issues including escape corridors blocked during the day with housekeeping trolleys.~2~nan~3~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_469734317~“Lovely convenient spot close to City”~We stayed recently for a 3 night stay. Loved the split level room (a King) and the extra space therefore available to us. The rooms are predominantly laid out round an internal courtyard, a great place for a read in the sun or a quiet stroll. It was fairly hot when we were there, so less used, but in autumn and winter, it will be a lovely spot. Rooms are a little dated at times, but certainly not lacking amenity. The Aircon was a bonus with the humidity, and was necessary, due to the bed only being made up with a doona/duvet, rather that having a top sheet as well. This meant we were deconstructing the bedclothes every night, so we could sleep with just a sheet. Note that the split level rooms do get quite hot over the course of the day, due to convection (heat rises) and did not appreciably cool off overnight. The paid parking might seem a bit much, but you are able to come and go as you please, with only the need to get a ticket validated the first time after you come in, via the front desk.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469056306~“Friendly staff & comfortable accommodation”~A group of 36 of us recently visited Canberra & were based at the Mercure. I don't think any of us was disappointed. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and answer any questions. It was very pleasant walking around the nearby streets and the War Memorial, Canberra City shopping centre and parks were just a short walk away. The room my husband and I were given was quite large, reasonably sound-proof, with a comfortable bed and small courtyard. The breakfasts were more than adequate and the serving staff there also very friendly. We dined at the motel each evening and were quite happy with our meals there. I would certainly stay there again if we return to our scenic and interesting capital city.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_469009346~“Disappointed”~We were given Accor vouchers and decided to stay somewhere different. Our first impressions were walking down towards our unit through rubbish left over from a beer festival, sticky footpaths and plastic glasses stuck on trees, rubbish on the grass. The beer festival, according to the signs was on the Saturday and we got there Sunday night. Not a good first impression. Room was a good size, very dark but very quiet. On our second night we had to ask for clean towels, tea bags, milk and I still don't know where the tea spoons were. Breakfast was plentiful but scrambled eggs with chunks of rubber in it and bacon that you could sole your shoes with was not enjoyable. I asked for clean cups to make tea and was told the cups there were fine they were badly stained and the waitress had been complaining about them. The two I picked up were stacked in where the clean cups were stacked but were stained with somebody else's leftover coffee. Dinner we ordered through room service was good and generous serves. We paid $494 for the pleasure of this I would never stay there again. The highlight of the visit was Dawson, we met him at reception when we checked in and he seemed to pop up doing other work around the place, he was delightful.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468437627~“Nice Spot - Room a little bit dated”~As an Accor Platinum member I was made to feel welcome and given a loft room with the bedroom upstairs. Large, clean and everything was very comfortable and also had a comfy bed. The room service menu is excellent with a lot of choices and is good value. The minibar items are well priced I thought. There is dinner and breakfast available in the restaurant which is a lovely venue. Staff working at reception were really professional and friendly to deal with. Location is handy for those with a car. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467123391~“Disappointing room”~There were lots of good things about our two night stay at this hotel, but the room itself was very disappointing. It was small and incredibly dark because the window was very small and the curtain didn't draw back well. Quite claustrophobic really and the view was over corrugated roofs only (the kitchen maybe?). On the plus side we didn't have much noise, the aircon was fine and the bathroom was good, apart from a shower that couldn't be unhooked and the towel rail which was directly over the toilet (care needed when hanging up the towels!). We had booked through a travel company and breakfast wasn't included (not an option). We decided to buy our breakfasts at the hotel and they were excellent, though not particularly cheap. We also found the guest laundry good and easy to use. We ate at the hotel pub one night and it was OK. If you don't like meat which has only been shown the cooking pan (IE running with blood), remember to ask for it cooked as you like it - I failed on this and had to leave a lot of it! Overall I couldn't get away from feeling that we'd been given one of the worst rooms in a good hotel - disappointing.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466403545~“Historic property central to everything”~This hotel has history and so the building, courtyard and layout is not your usual city stay but we came for the National Gallery package to see the Versailles exhibit, which was stunning and great value overall. It's an easy few minutes from the airport, staff were helpful, there are nice street walks surrounding and the dining terrace was nice for a generous breakfast until late (11am) on Sunday morning. Looking out to the inner courtyard is definitely worthwhile. The room itself (we upgraded to a loft) was well appointed with lots of space to sit. Bathroom is small but you can have a bath and water pressure was good. Basic toiletries and very thin walls were my only concern, but we slept well and enjoyed the mini break. It is not like most Accor CBD hotels but lovely for a heritage property. My tip: do not eat in for dinner, it is a short stroll to the nearby Sage restaurant which was excellent!~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465998839~“Appalling”~The room was a disgrace, dirty, smelly and dingy. I stay in Accor Hotels a lot. this was the most disgusting room (140) I have ever been exposed to. My wife and I stayed 5 minutes and the departed the Hotel and we will never return. The room was an embarrassment and badly let down your brand. You should reconsider keeping this hotel under the Accor brand name. The owners would have been disgusted.~1~1~2~1~1~1~3~nan
review_464902776~“Old canberra style”~Hotel from the early days of Canberra but fully refurbished. Rooms around central garden courtyard are very pleasant. Hotel is stingy with some of the basics. Only 1 small cake of soap for 2 people and only 1 facewasher. Also no biscuits for your cuppa. Good buffet style breakfast.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464601906~“Nice stay - good location”~Older style hotel, with a nice charm. Rooms are well appointed - just try to get one that does not have a view of the Carpark as it is a little noisy and well - not exactly appeasing to the eye. Staff are fantastic, with breakfast a little simple but nice all the same. Carpark is NOT SECURE so please be aware of this and whilst we were there - someones car was broken into. Great location if you want to visit the Australian War memorial and a 5 min walk from the city centre...perfect~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464434164~“Good value, lovely grounds”~We booked through Accor and found it very cheap for the great quality accommodation that it was. The grounds are lovely and the rooms were well kept and modern. They put up a roll away bed for our little one without even asking which was great. My parents ate there and the dinner was lovely and great value because they used their Accor card. My husband and I went out for dinner while my parents baby sat. We didn't feel like walking. A taxi costs $9 to get to all the restaurants. About the only thing that I could complain about was the breakfast. It was a bit poor, lacking in options and quality. Overall will stay here again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_463913620~“Reasonable stay, but slight change to service standard”~Reasonable stay overall, however was disappointed that some of the service has changed. The parking will now cost an extra $10 (which was not made obvious on our booking online, nor when we checked in. There is a sign at the back of the hotel that states this, however we were parked at the front the whole time so never saw it). Further, the bar downstairs shut early and people were asking for more beverages, along with ourselves, and we had to resort to the room mini bar, which had limited offerings. The following day at breakfast the waitress was very rude when she said the two of us could not sit at a table for four, loudly instructed the other staff in front of us not to let anyone move, then promptly allowed other couples to sit at those tables. I was made to feel so embarrassed. On the other hand the evening staff were very helpful and lovely.  We visit Canberra a bit as we have friends there and visit the gallery, so we decided when we left that we would explore other accommodation options next time.~3~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_463620225~“Very good value accommodation”~My wife and I stayed in a standard room with king size bed. The room was spacious, clean (except for a few stains on the carpet) with good facilities. Hard to fault really. The Mercure is located outside the city itself but still close enough to walk to (allow 15-20 minutes). The War Memorial is probably 10-15 minutes walk in the opposite direction to the city. My one complaint was with the seafood buffet (held on the last Friday of each month). You can book either the 6.30 pm sitting or the 7.30 pm sitting. I chose the latter, but most people, it seems, come to the first sitting, for good reason I found out. There were three oysters left when my wife and I approached the buffet at 7.30. I assumed more oysters would be brought out but to my surprise I was told there were no more left. A seafood buffet without oysters - what a disappointment! And A$65 per person. There was ample supply of other seafood but without oysters - what a letdown.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462092908~“good hotel for a weekend away”~We booked the loft room for 3 adults which was a good choice because the room is spacious enough.

review_462051098~“Great location”~Only 5 minute walk to the heart of the city. Main restaurant was excellent. The service and food were top notch. We also ate at the bistro and the meals were also very nice with quite large servings. The pub at the hotel is a great place to enjoy a few drinks with friends and if you wished you could take your drinks to the lounge area for some quiet time. The garden court yard is also a nice place to sit and soak up the sun and maybe read your book.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_460824071~“Family room was spacious and I'd recommend the hotel”~Stayed here in a family trip to visit museum and gallery exhibitions. The hotel is family-friendly and their family room (with a gallery 'floor') was great for our family of 4. The inclusive breakfast was good with a wide choice of food, only criticism is that the second sofa-bed was pretty uncomfortable. The building is heritage in style and has character, it is well maintained with lovely gardens. We found it a short walk to Canberra shopping/restaurants too.~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan

The rooms are amazingly comfortable (it's a large hotel so you might get lost, so keep your map on you !!!!) They have a bar and restaurant attached, so you have everything at your fingertips !!!!

review_459841367~“Short Trip to visit Art Gallery”~The building is one of Canberra's original buildings and has been kept as close as possible to original, this leads to a little extra walking to the rooms but is part of the charm of the building.We stayed in a loft apartment which was equiped with a kitchenette and comfortable seating and dining facilities. Bedroom and ensuite on the upper level were clean and comfortable. Dinner menu in the dining room is a set price for either 2 or 3 courses and should cover most tastes. Good meals are also available in the bistro behind the bar albeit a little noisy.  Hotel also offers 2 dog friendly rooms. All in all a pleasant 2 night stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_459024372~“Convenient central location”~Just had a week at Mercure, Canberra. We had a loft apartment, not too much room in the bedroom but enough for a case, plenty of wardrobe space & very good ensuite. Lounge, dining & kitchen is spacious and comfortable.

review_459014385~“In desperate need of a refurb”~We last stayed in this hotel four years ago and I doubt that a single dollar has been spent on it other than to install car park barriers. We did not use the car park since there is more than enough parking available in the street next to the hotel. The room we were allocated was small with a bed, desk and a chair that looked as though it belonged in a 1960's schoolroom. What is it about hotels that think that guests want to sit on the bed rather than in a chair? The only window overlooked an outside staircase and a corridor that led to other guest rooms. The bathroom was adequate other than there being no space at all for one's own toiletries. The breakfast was fine but the staff always seemed to be reactive in clearing and setting tables rather than the table be set for arriving diners. The hotel bar is the local pub and sports bar which was closed when we returned to the hotel after dinner at 9pm. Overall the hotel looks and feels old.~2~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_458405267~“Very disappointing!”~Stayed for 2 nights. First impressions were pretty grim! Found stairs and corridor ares very grubby and dirty- bannister rail was absolutely filthy - didn't even want to touch it! Corridors badly in need of painting/ cleaning. Had to pay for Wifi after 60mins(mine was waived after complaining) Also had to pay for car park.Staff fine. Didn't eat in hotel so can't comment.

review_458224990~“Great base for extended stay”~I stayed at Mecure Canberra to visit the Australian War Memorial, and was attracted by the close distance between both venues. Having the option of a buffet breakfast available was another selling point. The highlights of the Mecure are the friendly and helpful staff, both in reception, housekeeping and kitchen, the heritage features and decor of the hotel (love the timber panelling and etched glass), the tasty breakfast, excellent food with good portion size from the bistro in an affordable price range, clean rooms with comfortable beds. The main part of town was a reasonable distance to walk, which meant we didn't need to rely on transport for everything. I would have no hesitation in staying again, and look forward to finding an excuse to do so before long.~5~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan

review_456584010~“Lovely Building, great staff- BUT”~We enjoyed our stay, the building was old and needed some minor facelifts and paint to common areas of accommodation wings. We wanted to visit the War Memorial, which is within a few minutes walk. Our balcony was rife with bird droppings and dead Christmas Beetles, the interior of the room was excellent in cleanliness and presentation. The main reason we have not given a higher rating is that we had to pay $10.00 for open air not secure car parking.~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

Unfortunately they partied late into the night and set the fire alarm off at 2am which was not very restful. The hotel should have monitored the noise and partying a bit better for the sake of all guests.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_455514450~“Olim's”~Overall very good as usual.  The parking has become a bit of a pain in the neck. I preferred it when it was free to guests of course.  I understand the need to limit the access but I think that guests should have parking availability as part of the stay.  Is the ultimate plan to lease out the parking area once they have a figure on the books?~5~5~5~4~5~4~5~nan
review_455321366~“Adequate, however at times communication and service were lacking”~Accommodation in a standard room was adequate, without being exceptional. Noise at times was intrusive, both from other guests slamming doors or walking down the corridor and from unidentified mechanical noise at night. Superior rooms were better located in a nicer part of the hotel facing the inner courtyard. The TV remote was frustrating to say the least. Breakfast was plentiful and varied, however at times the staff were overwhelmed by the sheer number of guests presenting themselves on Sunday morning, with the number of available staff, supplies, table clearing and the availability of cutlery sadly lacking. There is no parking which is not free of charge, so be prepared to pay $10 per day. The concierge kindly reduced the cost for us given that we were staying 5 nights. Finally I booked my accommodation 4 months in advance, and took advantage of an attractive pre-paid rate. However I was told later after initial checkin that my credit card transaction had not been approved, and that I would have to re-submit my credit card for payment. There had been ample time to inform me of this prior to my arrival either by the hotel direct or via email/web notification. Without the ability to adequately check my bank statements, I reluctantly agreed. A great deal of anxiety and mistrust could have been avoided if this had been followed up earlier.~3~4~3~3~3~4~3~nan
review_455296071~“wonderful heritage hotel too few left”~Arrived to a lovely low profile hotel with a Windsor Melbourne feel of yesteryear how refreshing. So few left in Australia so what a gem! Particularly loved and enjoyed sitting in entry area very English what a pleasant surprise. Great location only 1k easy walk to Canberra Central shopping precinct with all department stores needed including Myer and David Jones cafes and restaurants. Breakfast was all you needed to get the day started in a lovely setting looking out to gardens. Will be the only place we want to stay when visiting Canberra. Also Dawson was so welcoming. I hope this hotel always stays the same a rare gem in Canberra catering to those that are tired of modern and who treasure the past of which Australia has so few of. I purchased the book Olims Hotel Canberra through the Ages fabulous read with photos when this hotel was built opened in 1927 and more. Cheers LorraineP~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_455134315~“A Day At The Museum”~We enjoyed quiet old world charm of this hotel. The room was excellent spacious clean with a pleasant view overlooking manicured gardenx of the courtyard.  Late arrival following 3 hour drive meant that going into central Canberra for dinner was not appealing. Flavours the in house finedining restaurant filled solved theproblem. 2 course or 3 course fixed price with matching wines by the glass made an enjoyable dinner  Breakfast typical Accor buffet however staff were a bit thin on the ground with some items running out and not being replenished in a timely fashion.A minor issue in the scheme of things.  Definitely our new preferred hotel for Canberra.  ~5~5~4~5~5~4~4~nan
review_455099160~“Lovely stopover”~Enjoyed a night here on our way through to Sydney.

review_455071093~“Taken by surprise”~From the time we arrived & were checked in by Karen; we were more than surprised. For a well known hotel brand to have 'pet friendly' rooms available was one out of the box & we really appreciated that. The room was spacious & comfortable with a king bed, there was even a grass area for the dog. The breakfast staff were friendly & helpful and we really enjoyed the meals at the bistro. If you are travelling with your pet - I highly recommend you stay here at the Mecure.Close to town & all the attractions in & around Canberra~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_454324280~“Seen better days”~Not convinced that the room I paid for, for one night, was for a double occupancy. Rather small with a very large tv, no facilities to make tea or coffee in the room and squeaky floorboards. The room and bed linen appeared clean. The bathroom was not as well maintained, with a small window which needed dusting and removal of cobwebs. The sliding door on the shower needs replacement. Generally, not impressive, including the dated furnishings in the main foyer. Staff at the front desk are doing their best in a hotel which has seen better days.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453935247~“Great stay”~Spent 2 nights here with my adult son in order to visit Australian War Memorial. Check in was seamless with great service. Our room was lovely. Beds were extremely comfortable with a choice of pillows. Went to bistro for lunch and dinner first day. Had a hiccup with dinner. It was quite late and they started to pack up. We had waited quite a while so went to enquire about our meals and discovered that the server had not passed our order to the kitchen. Our meals were cooked immediately. The manager on duty was amazing and extremely apologetic. He enquired as to our booking and as we were staying another night he offerred dinner on the house the second night which suited us well but very unexpected. Service unbelievably good other than this one hiccup. Thankyou to Nick, the restaurant manager for taking such good care of us. Lovely hotel. Will certainly stay again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453904850~“Northside of Canberra”~We checked in online and given good directions to find hotel also updated to cover our request for a view. The Garden facing room was lovely and spacious. First night had dinner in the pub, it was full on a Tuesday, but so noisy. Excellent meals.Next night went to the Courtyard restaurant and didn't want a big meal, the staff obligingly arranged just soup and entree. The hotel is close to shopping and galleries. All the staff were really pleasant and helpful. Breakfast has good choices and even fresh honeycomb.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_453892838~“Hotel from hell - never again.”~We booked the "Treasures of Versailles - Standard Room" package via Expedia which, according to the "added benefits" section downloaded from the Mercure Canberra website included 2 tickets and audio tour package to the NGA's Versailles exhibition. (Our reason for travelling to Canberra.) On arrival, we were told the package we had booked and paid for didn't include tickets or audio as these were a completely different package. This was incorrect as I downloaded directly from their website. We had to pay extra for the tickets - negating much of the benefits of the so-called Treasures of Versailles package. Things were no better when we found our room, which was small (16 sq m, not the advertised 24 sq m) and smelt horribly of damp. The TV gave a welcome message and hoped we enjoyed our stay but wouldn't show anything else despite trying every button on the remote, The free WiFi activation code turned invalid half way into our stay and the air-con worked intermittently. I gave up complaining after a while. All I can say is: Don't think that what is offered is what you'll get!~1~nan~2~nan~nan~1~2~nan

review_452205300~“A taste of old world elegance”~This property is located in what used to be an upmarket Canberra hotel. As a consequence there is a lovely well maintained garden area and lots of space in the rooms. If you can get a room which faces the courtyard. On site facilities include a pub which does good counter meals including evening specials. I ate there on steak night. There is also the Courtyard, a more upmarket restaurant which does very good food - set price menu where you can do either two or three courses with choices for each - entree, main, dessert. On site parking - $10 per day which since it isn't undercover I wasn't 100% happy about but I guess in the big picture this isn't too bad. Location is good - not far from the War Memorial and about 15 minute walk down Ainslee Ave to the Canberra Centre. About the same to Lonsdale St.~5~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_452175833~“Superior room”~This is our third stay at Mecure Braddon. When staying in Canberra we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Staff are very welcoming and helpful, nothing is too much trouble and Bistro is the place to eat for dinner. Breakfast there is plenty of variety to choose from. Have stayed from 4 days to 2 overnight stays, only 10 minutes from airport, very handy to everytihing. Would highly recommend.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_451599584~“Plenty of character here...”~First impressions count, prior to arrival I received a a phone call from Patina Farmer, GM of the hotel. I had not had this happen to me at any other hotels. Check in was very efficient and front office staff extremely pleasant. This hotel has a lot of old world charm and is in a good location. Rooms very comfortable. I would recommend rooms overlooking the garden. Had dinner at the Courtyard Restaurant and was most impressed by the quality and presentation of the meal. Breakfast is also served there and I always like the option of having eggs of your choice cooked freshly ie omelettes etc. All in all a really good experience.. Thanks to all the staff for making it enjoyabel~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan

review_450703933~“Convenient”~A well appointed hotel handily placed for the lake and war memorial. Car parking is charged for which is a pity. The food in the restaurant was very good and meals are also available in the bar area but this is open to non residents and was noisy on our visit. Courtyard area interesting and provides access to some rooms and the restaurant. A good venue for a stay in Canberra.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449760144~“Canberra character and history”~We like this traditional hotel, it was one of Canberra's first and is heritage listed. The location is great, on the corner of Limestone Avenue not far from the Australian War Memorial, and Ainslie Avenue, looking up towards Mt Ainslie, and a 10 minute walk downhill to the Canberra Centre shopping precinct. The rooms are not large but are well appointed, tea and coffee facilities, TV, Aircon, fridge, ensuite. There is a cafe open for breakfast and dinner, and Olims bar and lounge with poker machines where you can get meals if the cafe is not open. We found the staff very welcoming and consider the Ainslie a very useful place to stay in Canberra. There is some car parking near reception, and guest parking at the rear. The gentle architectural style and guest room setting on two levels surrounding an attractive central garden area with a fountain makes for a nice stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449756828~“Don't stay here.”~We booked a hotel room last minute as we had been travelling and really wanted a good night's sleep in a comfortable place. The hotel is quite charming on the outside and reception area and the reception staff were pleasant. Our room had mould in the shower recess, it appeared quite old and ingrained but some of it was able to come off when I wiped it so obviously not cleaned thoroughly. There was fluffy type dirt in the bathroom on the floor. The mattress was sort of sloping, I'd say quite old. The worse aspect though was that the door to the room seemed to have a big gap around it's edge which let bright light shine it all around the edge of the door and really lit up the room. This made it hard to sleep. The hallway outside must have been lit up bright all night and the door needed replacing. Shame as it is quite a charming old world place but needs some TLC as it is looking and feeling shabby. Very disappointed.~1~2~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_449451581~“Feel Secure at the Mecure”~We had two nights here and had got a package deal which included tickets to the Versailles Exhibition at the National Gallery. The Mecure has a lovely "old world" feel about it, dating back to the 1920's, with some great history. The beautiful timber lined foyer and sitting room, with magnificent etched glass windows and open fireplace, is a perfect introduction to the well manicured and maintained garden courtyards, enclosed and overlooked by balcony rooms all around. With tiled gabled roofs, timber colonial style windows, buildings no more than 2 stories high, paneled interior hallways, a lovely fountain and interior fish ponds, the hotel is well presented, with a laid back and relaxing feel to it.  Our room was well appointed with dark timber furnishings, spacious and modern bathroom, comfortable king size bed, good sized TV screen and windows overlooking the rear of the hotel towards Canberra. It was very clean with an effective split system heating/cooling unit, good lighting and contemporary rural photographs decorating the walls. The location is close to the war memorial and a quick drive into the CBD or across to Parliament and the National Gallery, High Court , Questecon etc. The staff were helpful and attentive and were quick to respond on our first night to shut down a noisy party going on in the adjacent room when we reported this. Unfortunately, they missed out on delivering the ice we had ordered, and we found it easier to get this directly from the hotel bar. The courtyard restaurant was terrific with great views of the gardens and excellent service. Check in and out was efficient and access to the car park easy, though there is a small fee of $10 daily for this. Lifts are centralized and given the expansive layout of the buildings, it was quicker for us to take our luggage up (and down) the stairs. All in all a lovely facility, good location and at a very affordable price. Worth another visit.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_448801381~“Pleasantly surprised”~We visited Canberra to see several of the exhibitions which were on at the time and booked this hotel. The Mercure staff were great - helpful and enthusiastic. The hotel was fully booked on the first night of our stay and the room that we would have liked was not available - however this was solved for the next three nights. The hotel which has a lot of history attached to the capital has been refurbished by Accor and the rooms are very pleasant. The best rooms face out into the central garden and have a verandah.where you can sit out and look into the garden. Very enjoyable in the late afternoon after a hot day. The evenings in Canberra are cooler, Location in Ainslie is very central. Would stay there again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_448366121~“Ok, if there is just two of you”~Location is fine, we had a car to get around. If you do not have transport, a hotel in the cbd might be a better choice. Pro's: fridge, kettle with tea & coffee, hairdryer, iron & ironing board, good a/c, good sized table & chairs and friendly staff. Con's: a bit dated and shabby, reasonably clean however. The sofa bed was truly awful, unable to sleep in it. The main bed was ok. I would not stay there again based on the sofa bed. We had to take suitcases up stairs to our room, as the lift was on the other side of the hotel. Parking was paid parking, or you had to try and find parking on the road. The front area had minimal parking available. 2 stars mainly due to not sleeping!~2~2~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan

review_447238855~“a charming place to stay-access room”~Stayed 2 night, some thought has gone into this access room. lovely balcony, non spring doors, spacious room with furniture to match this heritage hotel. Just. Lovely very clean room. Bathroom is adequate except for the fact these rooms need a something like a "coffee table" to go under sink to put toiletries etc on it. My partner is in a wheel chair and to get to the restaurants reception area the ramps are bit steep and with carpet makes hard going if wheeling yourself, we found I had to help out and push. Dinner in their formal dining room is highly recommended would go along way to beat it. Olim's bistro is great as well serving large meals this is more pub side. A huge thank you to Karen on the front desk who went beyond what you expect I had a function to attend without my partner, he stayed in the room, Karen said if he wished to go up to the restaurants just tell him to ring reception I will go and get him and help push him up the ramps. St out in the gardens and had a drink thoroughly enjoyed the stay, will highly recommend, have to say though starting to look a little tired but why do you expect with a lovely old heritage hotel. Loved it and will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan

review_446992353~“Fabulous ”~I took my husband here as a surprise for his birthday as it is conveniently located close to the Australian War Memorial. The building has a lot of history and there was a book in the room that told you all about it. Even though some of the facade is a little tired you can easily accept it as charm given parts of the building are nearly 100 years old. The staff were fabulous and each one greeted him with a happy birthday whenever we walked past. A surprise gift of wine and muffins when we arrived back after a long day at the War Memorial was a great touch. Thanks to all, completely recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_446356119~“Nice Hotel, Lovely Staff”~We stayed here one night in a deluxe loft room. The room was clean and comfortable although I did find a number of cobwebs around which was a bit of a surprise. The air-conditioning was a bit difficult to control but finally go it working.  We had dinner and drinks at the bistro and the meals were good and generous portions. The buffet breakfast was pretty good except for the overcooked bacon that was so hard and tough.  After breakfast we returned to our room for about an hour. Housekeeping lady walked in without knocking and we quickly let her know we haven't checked out yet. She was apologetic but surely must be a better system to monitor when people have checked out OR better still have courtesy to actually knock before entering.  Overall our stay was good, nice hotel, definitely old hotel with lots of character.  Note to Management: Your employee "Dawson" at check-in should get "Employee of the Year", a great guy with a lovely nature, friendly and a pleasure to deal with. He is definitely a great asset to your hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_445933939~“Very Impressed”~From the moment we checked in, we had a good feeling about this place. Every member of staff we came across, from front of house, to cleaning staff and waiters in the restaurant, was exemplary, being both friendly and efficient.  Our loft room was clean, quiet and comfortably furnished. Our room type also had a kitchenette. We had the pleasure of dining at both restaurants and although very different from each other, both offered great food at very reasonable prices. The city centre and the War Memorial are both within very easy walking distance. Car parking, at $10 a day, is very reasonable for a city hotel. We don't usually stay at Mercure hotels, but if the Mercure Canberra is any indication of the usual standard, we will definitely be returning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445745911~“Some good but overall disappointing”~Having often driven past this elegant looking old building we were really looking forward to a stay which included tickets to the Versailles exhibition at the national gallery. Check in was fast and pleasant and we were given No 140 and told it was an upgrade as all the standard rooms were booked out. This I did not understand as we had booked several weeks before. And the room was just not acceptable. It was large but dark with a view over some ugly roof tops and had two queen beds. However, when I complained the staff were most helpful and we were given a much nicer room overlooking the courtyard with a king bed which was much appreciated and I guess a genuine upgrade. This is a tired hotel with public rooms in much need of some TLC which could make it truely beautiful. It has historic significance in Canberra and it is a shame to see it so run down. The other disappointment was the breakfast. Scrambled eggs too salty, tinned mushrooms drowned in pepper and overcooked bacon like rubber. The coffee provided was awful but you could order one specially made for an extra cost. Tinned fruit (except the melon) and something that purported to be bircher mouselli but was nothing like it. Just not good enough. So all in all although the staff were friendly and helpful and there was free parking and WiFi this is not a hotel I would recommend or return to.  ,~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445562877~“Character hotel close to War Memorial”~I liked the old buildings and the surroundings. As I was visiting the Australian War Memorial, it was very conveniently located. Although I had booked a twin room, I was given a double bed. Normally I would not mind but the springs dug into my ribs on one side so I had to shift to the other side. The doona was placed between two sheets instead of in a cover and became too hot during the night. The wardrobe only contained single blankets so had to make do with one of them. Banging doors and the next rooms toilet also contributed to a restless night. Breakfast was good though.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan

From the time we booked our short stay to the time we booked out, we felt so valued as visitors. We loved the "Wedding Survival Kit" that you all put together for us and it certainly came in handy! The atmosphere and historic significance of the Mercure Canberra enhanced our short stay and it would have been lovely to have stayed longer. The bed was lovely and comfortable and cleanliness fantastic. Breakfast was fresh and didn't taste like it had been sitting for too long in the food heaters. The location of the Mercure Canberra was great for us, close to the War Memorial, which is a must see and close to other family members who were also in Canberra for a family wedding.

The Hotel was an old government building that has been renovated into a hotel but the renovations have maintained the original look. The reception staff were great and nothing was a problem to them.

review_443509377~“Mixed views”~We stayed here for one night in October. We'd driven down from the Blue Mountains that day, found it well enough and checked in.  We were allocated a ground floor room which wasn't a problem in itself but as we put the luggage in the room it sort of filled up very quickly and left little space to get past the bed etc. It was a very small room and bathroom so it was a good job we were only there for one night. Unfortunately I think the walls and ceiling were the thinnest I've come across - I heard a lot of noise during the night and early morning. And the TV - it almost filled one wall it was so large - too large for the room. 2 dining options so we chose Olims bistro and sat in the connecting area to finish off our drinks after dinner. It was all a bit chilly in October - we needed our fleeces on indoors!~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_441865287~“Dreadful!”~This is the first negative review I have ever written on Trip Advisor. Stayed here for 1 night only and as it turned out that was more than enough. On checking in were allegedly upgraded to an executive room however the room seemed no different to any other. The room itself was adequately equipped however was dingy, the carpet was stained and sticky and the bathroom neeeded attention to the shower grouting which was discoloured, the back of the door was splintered and falling apart and the plug hole in the sink hadn't been cleaned for some time.  We'd had a long day so we turned in early only to find that the pillows stank. On closer inspection they were all stained yellow and needed replacement. Housekeeping brought 2 replacements which were in the same state. My wife finished up sleeping on my rolled up coat. At checkout we discussed these issue with a duty manager who was professional and very apologetic but must have been embarrassed by the problems encountered. He gave an assurance to sort out the issues I guess only time will tell.~2~1~nan~1~nan~nan~2~nan

The only downsides for me would he the quality of matress as i believe it to be a very old one as it was not very comfortable at all and when u put 2 matresses together to form a king bed it indicates cheap to me for such a big hotel chain and the lack of foxtel in the rooms, if it was there i could not figure it out. Overall a good stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441436842~“A few days break in Canberra”~Hotel very well located, not far from War Memorial, shopping centre etc. Older hotel, needs a bit of TLC We had to request a new shower screen as the door would not open or close properly, and the job was done immediately.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_441199699~“Glass half full”~We had a reason to be near the Australian War Museum, so the location of the hotel was superb - a mere 10 minute walk. On a cool day or evening, a pleasant 10-15 minute walk to the City Centre (actually not too bad) but might be uncomfortable on a hot day for an older person - especially with the heat and Canberra flies (take your personal fly repellent). Check-in was efficient, despite a mix up in the names of the guest (wrong room booked) but in all honesty, I can't blame the hotel for that one. They handled it with a smile. The room was booked to accommodate 3 adults and a child. It served its purpose. The only issue is that the principal double bed was on the mezzanine level so one had to drag cases up a narrow staircase - and we only had roll-ons, so I can't imagine trying to drag a full-sized suitcase particularly for older guests. You could of course, leave the bags downstairs. The secondary bed was a converted couch.  Room amenities were all OK, but nothing spectacular or particularly memorable. Bathroom was acceptable and clean.  Prices for the in-room nibbles and drinks were high but not uncharacteristic. The bed used the sheet-doona-sheet strategy. Seems OK when you see the made-up bed but when you actually sleep in the bed, it is inevitable that the bedding order changes and you are inevitably in contact with the doona - which had no washable cover. So if you're a bit squeamish about skin to raw bedding contact in a hotel, then you might have an issue. The hotel is old but updated (some time ago) in a manner to retain it's 'original charm'. A picture of the hotel shows it at a time when there was nothing else in the neighbourhood. It still looks the same. Pleasant garden and surrounds. The restaurant seemed pleasant but we didn't eat there apart for breakfast, which was adequate but unexciting or memorable. You could choose between a Continental breakfast or a hot breakfast. Both appeared adequate. The hotel has a bar (no surprise), and gaming facilities. I must say that when I walked through this area, I had the feeling that I was walking through a 'typical' suburban (or country) pub - it offered some service with little class. The 'garden' seating outside the bar/pub was covered in parts (great for hot or wet days) and had heating for those colder days. Apart from mosquitoes and bull ants, very pleasant. I think the hotel needs a rethink about its positioning - is it a budget facility or an iconic experience? It could be either but by trying to be both, it is neither. Check-out was easy and staff were very helpful.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
