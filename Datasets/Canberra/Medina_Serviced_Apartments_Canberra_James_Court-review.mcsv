review_478658964~“Nice place on the main street ”~We stayed on the 7th floor for one night and were impressed overall. We were greeted by a genuinely friendly and helpful receptionist, no fakery here, were also automatically waived the $15 car parking fee which I otherwise would not have been happy with. Hotel is nicely decorated, our 2-bedroom room on 7th floor was brilliant, large, clean, and had a nice balcony. There were some interesting contrasts too: unit was mostly modern and super comfortable but things like the dishwasher and microwave were so old that they were beyond antique, did not dare touch it let alone use it, fridge too but it worked well. All in all, highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477850911~“Lacking customer service, parking and gym access”~The check in staff were not overly welcoming and the gym had been out of access for over a month. We arrived on the Saturday and the car park was full and the staff did not want to deal with it. However the room was very nice and the location is excellent.~2~3~5~4~4~4~2~nan
review_477846491~“Inner Canberra gem”~Great service good quality rooms, well equipped affordable price in an excellent location near Canberra's resurgent inner city precinct. Nice pool gym spa sauna well maintained and clean. This place is a find.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477056728~“Worst hotel experience you can ever imagine”~First of all, the hotel didn't give us the roll away bed as we requested because they claim they don't communicate with booking.com; Secondly the front desk was totally rude and unwelcoming; Moreover, the cleaner of the hotel stole $150 cash from my friend's wallet within her bag in the closet. The hotel didn't even give us any refund.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_477019278~“Canberra Marathon Trip”~Good location, although a bit noisy. Although we were on the 7th floor, we could still hear the traffic down below. Apartment was clean. Second bedroom was very small and claustrophobic. Had some issues with the free WiFi not connecting.~4~5~5~2~3~4~4~nan
review_476633517~“Great location”~Stayed for 3 nights over Easter with husband and toddler in a 1 bedroom. Very spacious. The kitchen is equipped with microwave, oven, fridge, toaster and kettle. Check in and out was quick with friendly service. Parking was $15 per night. Great location, only short walk to shopping centre, restaurants and cafes. Negatives: - Room not so clean on arrival - We found the bed not to be very comfortable - Can hear a lot of street noise (we stayed on level 4) - Housekeeping knock and enter straight away without waiting for a response~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476624070~“Locational advantage wasted. Not value for money!”~Poor internet - as good as none - unless you pay up for it. Car park space quite stingy, car park dark, and smelly. Upper cabinets of cupboard were not dusted and cleaned. Had a layer of dust which was a put off just like the internet. Front office staff - no eye contact. Lack of willingness to even have a proper conversation with the customer. Part-timers? Overall - not value for money although a good location.~1~1~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_476433736~“Great Location. Comfortable spacious rooms.”~Great place to stay. It was a bit expensive for our budget but it was a special occasion. We have stayed here before and would have liked to have stayed longer .  We will certainly stay again. It is also very easy to get to.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476288619~“5 night stay”~Great location. Easy 10 minute walk to Canberra main shopping centre and Lonsdale St, for the foodies. 2 bedroom apartment, big enough for 2 adults and 1 child. Great views from the 8th floor, which is the top floor. Modern, basic and clean. Can still hear the traffic from the 8th floor, so if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. I would stay here again. McDonalds is attached to the building, if you want to make yourself sick!! Parking is a separate fee, $15 per day.~4~4~5~2~4~4~4~nan
review_474822300~“Terrific all-rounder”~We stayed on a Monday night whilst visiting NGA and two of our group were repeat visitors. Location was perfect for walking to a restaurant and they allowed us to leave our car while we went out for breakfast the following morning. Staff were friendly and helpful, rooms clean, our 2 bedroom suite had a balcony which was lovely. We were on the 7th floor and weren't bothered by any noise. Didn't use the kitchen facilities but they looked adequate for a longer stay. Only small negatives - if you're fussy about your pillow, take your own and (no fault of the hotel) parking was a bit tight for a Landcruiser.~4~5~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_474343420~“a Good Experience”~The location of this place is good in terms of lots of beautiful little restaurants and pubs close by and a shopping centre with a super market for some essentials. The McDonalds behind the building is a bit offputting as there are a lot of loitering in the area and a few dodgy characters haning around, which was not that great but for a short stay and the price we paid, this was a good place.  The apartment was spacious, two bedroom, two bathroom was great. Service was friendly too. Really cannot complain about anything here.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_474000087~“Good hotel”~My family and I had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 7th floor. All the facilities met our needs and we could enjoy the weekend in Canberra with no hassles. Location is good, close to Canberra City shopping centre and lots of restaurants. The bed was comfortable and the cooking/eating facilities adequate for a weekend stay. Only downside is the noise from late night drinkers in the street below (not Mena's fault)~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473983639~“well worth a stay”~Clean, well appointed apartment with easy access to a wide range of restaurants, cafes and shops. Lounge/dining/kitchen area well designed with plenty of room. Beds comfortable, although second bedroom fairly cramped whereas the main bedroom was very spacious; pool and spa a bonus although TV reception for Chs 2 & 7 poor. Kitchen well equipped except for a very necessary egg slide. Reception staff not very welcoming even though check in was efficient and the required information was offered. Being on the 8th floor kept us away from the noisy traffic and balcony view splendid.~4~5~5~4~3~5~4~nan
review_473721262~“Needs much upgrading”~For such a well-located hotel, with spacious rooms, much is run-down, sub-standard and tired-looking. Front office staff need to ensure that guests are not treated with disdain and to possess local tourist knowledge.~2~3~4~3~2~2~2~nan
review_473045517~“Excellent value for money”~Clean, centrally located, family friendly accommodation If you are planning to visit the attractions in Canberra with young kids, you will need a taxi/ car Lots of extra blankets for when it gets really cold Unfortunately, the tea bags etc are not replenished daily which is a nuisance ~5~5~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_473024607~“Canference Accommodation”~The apartments are well situated about 15 min walk from National Convention Centre and close to shops for an alternative experience. The apartments wer average with really hard beds and small pillows. Staff professionalism could be improved~3~3~4~2~3~2~2~nan
review_472598039~“Ok nothing special”~Property is central but rooms are okay only. Kitchen had no pans or pots though it has a kitchen. Showers were mouldy and room provided had entrance outside the hotel (sort of) as you had to go through a glass door to get to it. This made the room a lot noisier. Would not stay again.~3~4~4~3~3~2~4~nan
review_472244269~“Happy Family”~Lovely rooms very spacious so great for us with 2 little kiddies! Just need reception to be a little kind! It is very close to shops and such which is very handy as you dont need to move your car as well! Would recommend~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_472235343~“Not Impressed”~I wasn't happy to be charged an extra $30 to park the car in the upstairs disabled car park. I think all costs should be up front when booking. Dirty plated in cupboard, missing leg on microwave so it rocked when cooking, security lock fell off wall as it wasn't attached properly, no batteries in remote for TV so had to buy some.Informed the reception staff when leaving of the problems but they didn't seen interested and didn't write anything down. Not Good.~3~3~4~2~3~2~3~nan
review_471974589~“Just gross.”~The rooms were dirty, the Internet was unusable - such that I couldn't connect at all to their WiFi and when I did, the connection was so poor that it didn't load.

review_471732939~“Central but needs a lesson in delight”~Its hard finding a decent hotel in Canberra that is well priced. The hotel is dated and old and maintained as well as it can be. I generally stay here if everything else is booked.  When I asked for my invoice from a previous stay on my second return, the staff were very rude and unhelpful.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_471558371~“Awful. Unusable WiFi, dirty, room cleaning not done properly each day. ”~The best way of describing this property is that I booked it because there was nothing else available. The rooms were dirty, the Internet was unusable - such that I couldn't connect at all to their WiFi and when I did, the connection was so poor that it didn't load. The room cleaning each day was pathetic and not done properly. Honestly, this is one of the worst places I've stayed at.  Staff were so unhelpful.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471544176~“Stay in central Canberra”~A ideally located and presented accomodation. Some external noise but beyond the control of management. The pool was clean and conveniently located for our early morning swim. Car parking was convenient and reasonably priced, but could be better signed and lit particularly at night.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_471280091~“well located but noisy”~Room was good but second bedroom very small, balcony was small and very dirty. The room very noisy as it faced Northbourne avenue and we found it difficult to sleep due to noisy traffic. Room facilities were good although couch was worn and uncomfortable due to sagging - needs replacing.~3~3~4~2~3~3~3~nan
review_471268852~“Excellent apartment, close to shops and restaurants”~Stayed for 4 nights with family. Was very close to shops and restaurants..walking distance to Canberra centre. Would prefer more utensils to cook as we had our family there and only had one pan and a pot which made it difficult to cook a meal..~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_471210821~“Value city accommodation”~Medina fullfilled all our needs. Staff were helpful cheery reassuring. The location was ideal. My group ranged in age and needs, all were met. Loved the apartments, so good to have seperate bedrooms and the kitchens were well stocked. This is one place I could stay again and for extended periods. We could hear the traffic at night but it was not unbearable. Pricing was competitive and there were no hidden costs.~4~4~4~3~5~5~5~nan
review_471028104~“Apartment / unit accommodation”~If I was staying in Canberra long term, this would be an excellent place to stay and be self sufficient. One can take own groceries and utilize the kitchenette. Good sized rooms that could do with a little bit of TLC. Secure complex that is approx half way between airport and Parliament House.~4~4~4~5~5~4~4~nan

review_470167669~“No hassles stay”~The size, layout and facilities in the apartment were quite good. It had everything we needed, was clean and in good order and housekeeping service was excellent. I like the balcony. It's just nice to be able to unwind with a coffee and get some fresh air. The apartments are very centrally located, with so many great food options an easy walk away- even with a baby and you child. Traffic noise does carry but luckly canberra is not too busy or noisy most of the time and the noise didn't disturb our kids. I was grateful for block out curtains in both bedrooms.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_469966476~“Overnight in Canberra”~Centrally located in Civic, Medina is easy to find. Shops are around the corner as are a number of dining/shopping facilities. The place is quiet and comfortable. Everyone had a good night sleep. The swimming pool is quite large.~4~4~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_469560246~“Great value if you need 2 rooms”~great value if you need 2 bedrooms. One is a little tight in size and did not have an ensuite, the other was large with an ensuite.But still excellent value. Location very good in Canberra within walking distance of many places.~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_469537629~“Medina Canberra - Very average”~Rooms smell on arrival. Specifically of ethnic foods. No digital TV. Time to upgrade Antennas or TV's. No spare toilet rolls in bathrooms. Very disappointing. Poor climate control. It is the 21st century. Time for full apartment climate control. Not 2 air conditioners that do not service the entire apartment. Overall, extremely disappointing.~2~2~3~2~2~3~3~nan
review_469371637~“Good sized rooms but tired”~I stayed here overnight for work, I was given a 2 bedroom apartment. The place is definitely roomy but does need a renovation as it is quite tired. It is at a good location though. However I won't stay here again unless at Parliament time where every hotel is hideously expensive.  There is a 24 hour McDonalds next to the hotel so you can always get some food anytime if required.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_468985398~“Good location”~Handy to most attractions. Roomy apartments with 2 good bathrooms. Good underground parking available at an additional charge of $15 per night. Only concern was the unpleasant rubbish smell from garbage room located near the lift. Might have only been on our 4th floor.~3~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_468739168~“OK but room for improvement”~My only big gripe was the parking. The spaces are far too tight, the parking is poorly organised between private spaces and guest spaces, and the extra parking fee charged on top of the room rate was a nasty surprise at check-in. Several of the staff members were exceptionally good and helpful, though there were also a few that were pretty sour and unhelpful. Hope this place gets better, because it is only a few small things that could take it from average to really good.~3~3~4~2~4~3~3~nan

review_468405923~“Location Location”~These apartments are roomy with 2 people and bonus separate bathrooms. Located right in the centre of town.

review_467952016~“Don't waste your money”~Too expensive for the quality. Outdated (attempted to modernise on the cheap) & s/c accom was missing most things (inc forks, knives, bowls, saucepans). House keeping service was very average also. They provide the absolute bare minimum, but nightly rate is more suited to a moden, fully equipt hotel. Beds were very hard also - so quite uncomfortable~3~2~4~2~3~3~3~nan
review_467687562~“Fabulous”~We stayed for 2 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment. It was clean, looked great and had everything we needed. Hotel was in a great location for everywhere in Canberra. Highly recommended, would stay here every time now.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467684378~“Convenience is the key to this property”~Close to CBD and transport. A long outstanding need to update the televisions and TV reception which is not of modern standard. Reception is more than often unattended with the staff out the back behind one-way glass windows. Room appointments need to be modernised also.~4~3~5~4~4~3~3~nan
review_467428251~“Relax and enjoy”~This 2 bed 2 bath apartment was very suited to our needs. A good location handy to City Centre facilities. No air-con in 2nd bedroom could be relevant in summer as not sure how effective the living room air would be for bed 2. That the building is a little dated makes for a comfortable stay and the room servicing was good. Kitchen is well equipped.~4~4~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_467412966~“Fantastic stay in Canberra”~We have stayed at James Court before. It is located centrally to Civic and has good parking, (which you pay for) The apartments are light and spacious. It can be noisy depending on which side of the building you are on. The housekeeping staff are attentive.~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_467031806~“Still functional, but dated.”~Still functional, but dated in terms of decor. Location excellent, but noise from street carries. Short walking distance to city centre. Gym out of action & availability of pool & spa appreciated. Will stay in venue next trip to Canberra.~4~4~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_466423293~“Very dangerous and slippery tiles around the pool”~The reason I didn't give this apartment a better rating is because we saw two children take really bad falls - both hitting the back of their head on the tiles. I was very careful but my husband and I were afraid of the extremely slippery tiles. The location is good. The living area of our two bedroom apartment was spacious but the second bedroom is a bit tight but adequate. The kitchen seemed well appointed. Second bedroom has its own t.v. and the second bathroom was a great advantage as we stayed with another couple. A major sting was the $15 a day parking rate as a guest! A bit unfair we believe.  All up I would stay here again if the price was acceptable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465959422~“Great location”~The hotel was spacious and very clean, but you could hear all the street noises. Very secure. It is very outdated, and it really needs a good refurbishment. Apart from this it was a very good apartment.~3~5~5~5~3~3~5~nan
review_465474057~“Discappointed”~second bedroom was poor, no bedside cabinet, no TV, no drawers, and very little room. The location was excellent however, easy access to the city, no face cloth provided in the second bathroom, disappointing accommodation~3~2~5~3~2~4~3~nan
review_465205297~“GREAT ROOMY 2 BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH TWO BATHROOMS”~Loved this apartment which was central to downtown Canberra. Rooms were big and roomy and loved having 2 bathrooms along with the 2 bedrooms. Kitchen was nice and large although we ate out. Loungeroom was a nice good size. I would recommend this accommodation for singles, couples and families. Pool looked great although I didnt use it.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_464423196~“Never again”~After our first visit we said never again but thought we'll give it one more try. Not worth it. Really unfriendly staff, the rooms are sub standard and there are so many other places to choose from. Extremely noisy and a really grubby area. Bathrooms are 15 years behind anywhere else. A 3M adhesive picture book used on shower screen door for it's handle. They wouldn't know how to make a bed if they tried. It really is sub standard. Dont even ask about car park.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458236417~“Serviced Apartment close to Canberra City”~Good, if a bit bland serviced apartment. Within walking distance of Canberra City and ANU. They chisel a bit on extras-parking/wi-fi, stuff you wouldn't expect to pay for normally. Rooms are fine-big and clean.~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_457955368~“Attractions”~We travelled as a family with 3 children. We seen most of the attractions but really needed to stay a few more days to get to see the rest of them.  we visited the War Memorial, Parliament House, National Museum, The zoo and aquarium, Telstra Tower.~5~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_457787689~“Good location, reasonable facilities, worth considering.”~The pool was not that clean - I found 3 tomatoes in the bottom on the Sunday morning. The pool could have done with a little heating, since the water did not receive any sunlight to heat it up. The apartment only had air conditioning in one bedroom and living area, the second bedroom had none. The second bedroom was very small even for 2 single beds. The fold out extra bed was falling apart and an adult would not have been able to sleep on it - we had paid an extra $50 for this. The queen bed was a little hard. The TVs had poor reception and did not pick up all the free-to-air channels. We had to pay $15 dollars for parking, it is assumed that parking is included in the room rate. The tiles in the kitchen were cracked and loose. An extra towel had to be asked for although we had paid for the extra bed. Positives Location was very good. The convenience of the pool was great, especially for the family. The room was mostly air conditioned. The pool area was mostly shaded. The fully functioning kitchen supplied with the essential crockery, cutlery and cooking equipment. Negatives The pool was not that clean - I found 3 tomatoes in the bottom on the Sunday morning.

review_457759023~“Won't stay again.”~The hotel balcony had not been cleaned and arrived to find dirty beer bottles and cigarette butts. Got stuck in shower as door jammed. Ironing board dirty. Noisy at night. Didn't stack up to 4 star hotel.~2~3~4~3~3~2~3~nan
review_457437663~“Needs a small face lift”~Rooms are very comfortable and service is good, but the rooms are looking worn and well used. it is all well appointed, would stay again but needs a quick spruce-up. Affordable overnight rates for parking was also a good thing~3~3~4~4~3~3~4~nan
review_456846016~“Be prepare for noise”~Any room overlooking Northbourne Avenue will be noisy, due to the construction of the light rail. Any room overlooking the pool will be noisy, particularly when there's a group of guests staying together (teams travelling for sports, summernats).~2~nan~nan~2~nan~5~3~nan
review_456564903~“Stay In Canberra”~Excellent. Located centrally. Good swimming pool. Only issue was parents not controlling their children in the swimming pool, but that is out of Medina's control. Good eateries within 300 mtrs of Medina.~5~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_456356873~“Great place for families”~Good place to stay. The 2 Bedroom apartment was spacious and functional and outdoor pool/spa relaxing and catered for all people, old and young. It is close to all major Canberra attractions and main streets~5~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_456333426~“Review from a Canadian”~Great place to stay. Central to downtown and the river. Nice to have 2 outside sitting areas. It would have been nice to wifi as the was an inconvenience when you are from another country and trying to contact family.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_456331072~“Last minute stay”~We booked a two bedroom apartment at the last minute and arrived about 10 minutes after making the online booking. Everything was ready for us when we arrived including printed out booking forms. The staff were very friendly. The room was clean and well finished. There was an excellent selection of different size pillows in the cupboard which was greatly appreciated. There was some street noise but it did not keep us awake.~5~5~4~4~5~4~5~nan
review_456111410~“Good location”~Medina apartments was walking distance to shops, restaurants and Lake Burley Griffin... perfect loaction. The only downside was that our corner apartment was facing a busy intersection so we had traffic noise.~4~4~3~3~5~5~5~nan

Very friendly and helpful staff. Kitchen equipment a bit average but you can get by. The kids ( and us too) loved the pool. Overall very pleasant stay!!~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_456048841~“Excellent”~Staff were very helpful and went out of their way to assist us and provided dvds for the kids. The apartments were a great size, perfect for the family. Location was great with nearby eateries and shopping, and a short drive to major attractions. We did find the beds and pillows to be too hard though.~4~4~5~2~4~4~5~nan
review_455518908~“Ok. Nothing to rave about.”~Price was quite good. Room was adequate but bathrooms and kitchen were a bit tired. WIFI was terribly slow, much to the disappointment of children. I don't like paid parking either when you've already paid for a room. Pool was excellent. Great location.~3~3~5~4~3~3~4~nan

review_454858030~“good location”~Great location close to everything in the city area. Staff very friendly and helpful, and replaced a faulty clock as soon as they got another one. Rooms are a bit tired and definitely need a refurbishment, shelves in bedroom cupboards and better reading lights. Better matresses and pillows would be wonderful.~3~3~5~2~3~3~4~nan
review_454645977~“Great Family apartment - helpful staff”~We had a 2 bedroomed apartment which had a spacious lounge, a dining table, a usable ( but dated) kitchen with all appliances and a reasonable sized patio. There was a nice view from the patio.The main bathroom had a shower, a washer and a dryer. The ensuite had a spa bath with an overhead shower.  The whole apartment was a bit dated but very clean. There was a main road outside the hotel but there was minimal noise when you were in the room. The staff were very friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
