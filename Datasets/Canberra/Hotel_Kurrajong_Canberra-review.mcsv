review_474018496~“Luxurious stay at this Historic Canberra Hotel”~From the time you enter the Kurrajong Hotel you feel steeped in Australian Political History. Portraits of many of Australia's most prominent political leaders surround you. The décor of the hotel is Art Deco. Everything around you says comfort and quality. Location here is optimum. It is situated right in the middle of the parliamentary district. Close to the War Memorial, the Royal Australian Mint and the National Gallery. Breakfasts are sumptuous, with all the usual hot items but on the cold side you have beautiful fruit coulisses, preserved cherries, yoghurts, bircher muesli, grapes, sweet honeydew melon and of course a good range of cereals.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478374430~“disappointing!”~I had to move rooms twice for first a very noisy air-con unit and then a mouldy smelling room - 3rd time lucky, but no firm pillow in the room, and no menu page in the room compendium. There really should be a choice of firm or soft pillows in the room - you shouldn't have to ask! I had been meaning to come here for years as I regularly need to be in Canberra for either work or personal trips.~3~3~3~3~3~4~4~nan
review_478363485~“Quiet and comfortable”~The Hotel is very comfortable, staff friendly and excellent location. The rooms are very quiet with no traffic noise or noise from your room neighbours. Breakfast good. It is great that you access to the gardens and scenery is lovely.~4~5~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_478357877~“Lovely historical hotel in heart of Canberra CBD”~Nice, clean, lovely staff, good breakfasts. We had a great time exploring Canberra for a couple of days, using this hotel as our base. It was a close walk to Parliament House and not far to drive to other major attractions. I would stay again. Love the history behind it. I love Canberra, in my opinion there's nothing boring about it!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478136722~“Our Kurrajong stay”~Lovely hotel, efficient friendly staff. Very clean and comfortable. In a great location. But the $15 a night for parking is hidden until you get there and you discover there's really no other option. Beware, it's a rip-off. The dining experience was excellent, but the breakfast options are unnecessarily secretive and limited. If those things were fixed it would get a much better review from me.~3~3~5~5~4~5~3~nan
review_477929698~“Quirky, Historic, but missed the mark”~We booked two rooms for two nights, and overall OK. They consistently managed to just miss the mark. I booked on the phone - clearly a female voice and gave an obviously female name, but the confimatory email was address to Mr... When we arrived they told us they had given us the wrong bed configuration and they would be up to change it and made a big fuss about this, but when we got to the room it was as booked. One of the rooms smelt awful - mouldy and stale. The room was not clean, revolting in fact. But to be fair they moved us. Then we enjoyed ourselves. The staff were pleasant and the beds comfortable. An electric blanket would have been nice, but when we warmed up we had a good night's sleep. The bed was comfortable. I think it is a training school for hotel staff. On this basis it is probably OK.~3~nan~nan~4~2~nan~3~nan
review_477838981~“Excellent business hitel”~Very convenient for my meetings in Parkes. Refurbished to high standard, some character of yesteryear and a refreshing change from many of the new characterless hotels that cater for mid price range. Excellently appointed room although on the small side, quality bed and sheets, and has everything needed for a short business or pleasure stay. One downside and that is slow internet speed. Would definatly stay again.~4~5~4~5~4~5~4~nan
review_477651257~“Great historic hotel”~Wonderful Art Deco feel with the history surrounding you with the portraits in the hallways and the decor.

review_477601491~“Lovely property but treated differently to normal guests”~We had a lovely stay at the Kurrajong Hotel in Canberra, beautiful setting and polite staff however because we had a Trip a Deal we felt as though we were a bit inferior because of limitations to the service.~4~3~5~5~5~4~4~nan

review_477271164~“A lovely historic hotel”~The Kurrajong is one of Canberra's oldest hotels but has been renovated beautifully.  The bathrooms are very modern, and the hotel has a lovely sunny courtyard. Major attractions - Old and New Parliament Houses, National Gallery, Lake Burley Griffin foreshore walks - are all within walking distance. The hotel is situated in a leafy and quiet part of Canberra. The only downside is parking, which is $15 a day and seems to be limited.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476985088~“No comfortable.”~The hotel was a bit not comfortable. The carpet was dirty, the sink too, and the blanket had a large stain. For two days they have made the bed, but they didn't clean the room. The windows could not be open even if the room was in the ground floor.~2~3~2~2~3~2~4~nan
review_476977678~“Long Weekend Break”~Great hotel, nice character rooms and friendly staff. Stayed for three nights and had a good, quiet night each time. Minor issues in room servicing and a reservation mix up, but this was dealt with effectively by the staff.~4~4~4~5~4~4~3~nan
review_476634188~“Average old hotel with overestimated price and services”~We booked via Hotel's website and it was hard to get enough information about the rooms. But the biggest disappointment was on the day of arrival. It appeared that the system has assigned us a standard Heritage room instead of Heritage Family room that I booked. The receptionist gave us the key and didn't even raise a question despite he obviously knew that the rate I paid was for Heritage Family. Only when I returned with a lot of confusion he confirmed that there was a mistake and then offered a refund.   Of course, there were no large rooms available so we had to stay in standard room for two nights. As an excuse, the receptionist offered us an upgrade to Executive Suite for one night free of charge. That was nice, but the impression was spoiled anyways. I'm sorry, but I couldn't see 4 stars in that hotel. The service, facilities, rooms were only at essential level. As I said, we've been accomodated at the standard heritage room. It apperead that the room was designed for the disabled people. The bathroom was with rails and shower seating and with very minimum convenience. There was even no shelf next to the sink so we had to store our toiletries on the opposite shelf above the toilet. There were no bath robes provided - this is NOT a sign of 4 star hotel. The room and furtniture were relatively clean, but can't say anything more. Doonas were awful!! They are probably 10 years old, covered with pills and weary. Mini bar prices are rip-off. I know the drill, but $8 for peroni is over too much. After we've been moved to Executive Suite thing got nicer, but still suffer the same problems. Old and weary doonas and furniture, horrible roll-over (sofa), no bath robes and somehow no shower caps provided. Overall, rooms looked tired, boring and minimalistic. Same framed prints on the walls. General hotel impression was spoiled by the disgusting smell of old (especially in the lobby and corridors). I know the building is old (and that's a plus), but there are so many ways to fight the smell now. Hotel management simply doesn't care. On the positive side, I really liked the fireplace zone in the lobby. Nice place for an evening drink with a book. Inner courtyard could have more attention. Bar staff didn't care when I was there not even offering to turn on a heater.  Finally, finding a parking spot was a torture.  As a conclusion, I could say that this hotel is very average, but in quite good location.~3~2~4~3~2~3~2~nan
review_476626574~“Comfortable - lovely outdoor space”~Comfortable small room, however outdoor terrace area adjoining room was nice and gave much needed space although shared with other rooms. In house dining good but not much choice- breakfast was the nicest.~3~3~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_476603146~“Great Easter stay.”~Beautiful hotel in a great location. Canberra in the early autumn is very picturesque. May need to check in early to ensure you get a parking space onsite. There's street parking which is free over Easter but may not be available when surrounding businesses are in operation.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476351658~“An excellent place to stay”~I choose to stay at this hotel as it is convenient to my business in Canberra and for its cleanliness, comfort and helpfulness of staff. There is now a market close to the hotel along with convenient cafes during the day and a club for dinner, if you choose not to dine at the hotel itself. The parking situation and therefore arrival and departure from the hotel are the only drawbacks of the experience.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476297592~“service”~services could be and should reviewed ; as this was during public holidays season, fewer staff was available for customers. However, this is not an excuse as customers are always seeking good services at all times regardless. Staff allocation should have been arranged .~4~4~5~5~5~5~3~nan
review_476283572~“Lovely hotel, beautifully decorated”~We stayed for 2 nights over Easter for our anniversary, the hotel was a lovely surprise, lovely decor, very clean, really friendly staff, whilst being very professional. Our room was spotless, one of the cleanest hotel rooms I have stayed in, spotless bathroom, well equipped room with pod style coffee machine, a docking station for your ph. Bed was comfy, hubby said the pillows were too soft ! Very nice courtyard to enjoy a drink or snack from the bar, good bar menu, gas heaters are on of an evening to take off the chill. We had breakfast the first morning, I would not recommend the hot breakfast or full breakfast, not enough on offer, all of it was quite cold, you can have eggs to order, we had poached, and they were really cold and inedible, so that was a waste at $28 each. We also had high tea , very disappointing, the sandwich s were made an cut and left unwrapped, therefore dry, minimal topping, the cup cakes were from breakfast, so reused, the scones were dry, assume the days before, and I think store bought, the hot cross buns were the same, inedible, we had champers with it but after 10mins had to ask can we get tea ! On a better note as far as food goes, we had dinner at the restaurant and it was really lovely, bit pricey but was worth it Great location to visit the attractions of Canberra and just a $15 - $20 dollar cab ride to the city centre, casino etc~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_476254335~“Improved since last visit with only small issues”~This is my second stay/review of this hotel and I am happy to say, there are obvious improvements. The staff are very friendly with the best service experienced in the restaurant. The food is still over-priced but wouldn't be if the sides were included and didn't need to be purchased separately. A steak ($42) and 2 sides ($9 each!!) is not what I would by any stretch of the imagination call a 'decent' price. The breakfast buffet was quite average but I have been told that the coffee is great (I myself, don't drink coffee). You have to ask about the free WiFi at check-in as they don't volunteer this information during the check-in process. The room I had was very spacious and the bed and pillows ensured a good night's sleep. The cleanliness of the room was a little disappointing with cobwebs on the windows, dust on the desk, radio/clock and lamp and mold present in the bathroom. If you have issues with walking up stairs, you need to let the hotel know that you need a ground floor as there are no elevators to the 2nd floor (it is after all, a very old building)~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476250488~“Wonderful experience”~Staff were fantastic polite, helpful and knowledgable of the area and attractions.

review_476248649~“Hotel Kurrajong”~Great location in Barton very close to Parliament House, the National Gallery, very short drive to the Kingston waterfront where there are many restaurants. It is around the corner from Ottoman Restaurant a turish restaurant which was exceptional.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_476243849~“Denise”~Good location handy to everything we wanted to do on our visit, one of the rooms had not been cleaned which was disappointing, rooms small, very comfortable beds, reception and restaurant staff good and friendly. In all had a fairly good experience.~4~4~4~5~3~3~5~nan
review_476223280~“Terrible service in restaurant”~Service in restaurant was terrible. Vastly overpriced for the food and service. We had to wait 15 minutes to be served and we had to approach one of the waitstaff for this happen. We had to ask for water for the table 3 times for this to happen. We were served the wrong dish even though we had an in depth conversation about the meal when ordering. No one came and asked how the dish was throughout the entire meal. The meal (2 meals and a bottle of wine) was extremely disappointing for the $180 spent in it. I would not be recommending this restaurant to anyone and unfortunately it tars the whole hotel experience.~3~1~3~4~3~4~1~nan
review_475981117~“Beautiful hotel”~This hotel was beautifully furnished, very classy and clean. It was a real pleasure staying here. The staff were very friendly. Lots of nice touches with fresh lemon water after a big day of site seeing. We had chocolate bunnies left at our door Easter Sunday which was a nice surprise. The courtyard with the open fires is lovely. Can't recommend highly enough.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475967509~“Beautiful hotel, brilliant service”~We stayed at the Hotel Kurrajong for our wedding anniversary. The hotel has been really nicely restored in an Art Deco style. There is a gorgeous lobby, with a bar and fireplace, so you can have a glass of wine by the fire to start or finish a great evening. The room was beautiful and spacious and had an outdoor area to sit. Maddie, who organised our booking, even organised flowers and chocolates for our room - which was really lovely touch and just made a nice stay even nicer. The staff at reception, in the bar and in the restaurant were all fantastic - without exception. We would definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475788192~“A really nice surprise”~We stayed at the Hotel for two nights on a voucher and were really happy. Our room was very small but it was clean and comfortable. The hotel and grounds are lovely and the staff are friendly and helpful. We only ate breakfast at the hotel - it was varied and plentiful, and we were able to order omelettes or eggs 'to order'. The dining area is lovely and you can sit outside weather permitting. My only complaint was a bit of a slip up in the housekeeping one morning, for which the management was genuinely apologetic.~4~5~5~5~3~5~4~nan
review_475728500~“Lovely High Tea but stale scones!”~I organised for 27 people to celebrate my 50th with an autumn themed High Tea. The staff were lovely and the service was impeccable. The venue is gorgeous! The food was presented beautifully and the choices were lovely. The cocktail was excellent with champagne presented as the alternative choice. We had a wonderful afternoon. The only disappointment were the stale dry scones on everyone's plate. I let it slip on the day thinking it was just mine, but it was subject to much discussion by guests during the week after the event. Scones are so quick and simple to make fresh but these tasted a few days old. Fresh scones should be a standard, particularly given the $48 price per head for High Tea.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_475719571~“Quality refurbishment without cookie cut hotel feel”~Outstanding room that was very comfortable. Rooms were not your standard repeated design of other major hotels and were fitted out in a way that was complementary to the heritage of the building, not competing to fit into it. Absolutely a step back in time but in all the right ways that creates a modern reflection of its deep character.  Bed comfortable (though pillows a little too soft) and bathroom VERY nice with one of the best showers that I've had in a hotel. The dinner menu, while a little pricey, was very much worth it with excellent meals enjoyed by all in our group that dined there. Breakfast was ok, but well overpriced for whats on offer in my view. Absolutely suited a business stay, not sure how i'd feel travelling there with the family.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_475707665~“My Canberra visit”~Staff excellent, especially our check - in lady at reception and staff in dining room. Inadequate parking and lack of an exhaust fan in the bath room were a couple of negatives. Distance of room from entry, reception, dining room and parking were also drawbacks but efficiency and helpfulness of staff more than compensated.~4~5~5~5~3~5~5~nan
review_475671578~“Happy Easter break”~Happy Easter break with clean and quiet room and friendly staff. I was a bit sceptical about a "green clean"of the room on Friday. Sounded more like a dishonest way of not using people on a public holiday to save on penalty rates.~4~3~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_475448079~“Very comfortable but with oddly deficient room service.”~We spent three nights here and found the rooms very comfortable indeed. There was a very nice lounge area and we had no complaints with the cocktail area, the restaurant for dinner, and the buffet breakfast service. Oddly, though, for 3 days we had to wash our own cups, spoons and glasses and clean away any mess made making any beverages we prepared (tea bags, wrappers etc). The room was serviced satisfactorily each day with regards to bed making, rubbish removal, towel replacement etc but we came back each night to a pile of dirty teacups lying around. Also, when we were checking out we were almost charged for breakfasts that had been pre-paid, and we were almost charged for parking that we didn't use. Only our eagle eyes prevented this from happening. I don't think this is good enough in a hotel of this standard.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~2~nan
review_475441252~“Hidden gem”~My hubby and I stayed at Hotel Kurragong for 4 nights last week. Loved the hotel the art deco feel. The room was lovely and totally loved the outdoor courtyard. Breakfast was very nice in the glass atrium looking out on the courtyard. Fantastic shop across the road to get drinks and nibbles to take back to the room. Just a short walk to good restaurants and Attractions. Only one complaint on Saturday afternoon there was a wedding in the courtyard so it was closed off to hotel guests as was the glass atrium. As there was a large group in for dinner due to the marathon there was no where to sit as the foyer was full of other guests too. As the wedding was very small and they were not using the glass atrium it would have been nice to be able to sit and have a drink before dinner. Great expresso martini Overall a very enjoyable stay with only the one hiccup Such a shame as we loved this hotel but upset that they didn't cater for there other paying guests~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_473992170~“Difficult to fault”~We went down to Canberra for the running festival and were lucky to find a room at the hotel at a discounted rate (offered by another site). The hotel is difficult to fault - although my wife has had a go! We were allowed to check in early and check out late. The hotel was immaculately presented and the room completely quiet - except for my snoring. We didn't eat at the restaurant but it was busy for both dinner and breakfast. And the "faults" identified by my wife - well they were user errors really - no instructions on how to use the in-room Nespresso and no plastic toothbrushes (thank goodness) to compensate for forgetting to bring one down from Sydney. Would I go back again? Absolutely!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473951684~“Canberra Visit”~The Kurrajong is a great old hotel, with a lot of Canberra history, including it was the "home" of Ben Chifley when he was Prime Minister. It has a great "old world" feel, while maintaining good modern facilities in the rooms. The "bar garden" area has a great feel and was an excellent place to meet up with friends for a drink, especially on a pleasant night with the full moon rising! The staff are excellent, and while they did their job very professionally, we were able to have chat with some of them and get to know them during our stay. It is also very central, with easy access to a lot of the galleries, museums and parliament house~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_473528471~“Lovely stay in historic hotel”~A 3 day visit to Canberra to include National Gallery, Portrait Gallery, old Parliament House etc and the Kurrajong Hotel is in a perfect location - walking distance to all these and the lake. The hotel, built at the beginning of Canberra (1920s) and used by politicians as a home base, has been refurbished and updated but has retained a great sense of the time it was built and has photos of the early days and Prime Ministers on the walls - a history lesson as well! The hotel was delightful, great decor, great staff, lovely gardens for some breakfast or afternoon drinks. Breakfast was buffet but you could order eggs or pancakes to your own taste; lunch and dinner menu was not huge but we were very satisfied with what we had. Food was fresh, well prepared and well presented. Rooms were very tastefully decorated and spacious enough. Bathrooms excellent and all the usual is provided. Beds were comfortable, a coffee machine with capsules, free wi-fi. The only slight negative could be parking. It is a good idea to purchase a 'spot' prior to arriving but it may not get you a parking place on site if the hotel is heavily booked. However, the staff were really helpful and we had no problem parking in the street at times.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

The woman at the desk could not have been more gracious.. she found us a parking spot right in front of the front doors of the hotel, got a porter for us to assist with the luggage and gave me vouchers for breakfast. The room was spacious, super clean and tastefully appointed. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel and enjoyed the convenience, the ambiance adn the food.

review_472582742~“1920's gem in a quiet and convenient location.”~Excellent location in Barton for the government buildings and national galleries. Lots of nearby restaurants. The hotel is a 1920's gem with lovely rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. We were there when a wedding was on and we were not inconvenienced in any way. Only challenge was car parking as it was limited and the surrounding streets are only short term parking during the week.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472582511~“Weekend Getaway”~The atmosphere in the hotel is welcoming and the decor is one of elegance and a cut above your standard accommodation. The room was very clean and the staff welcoming. Car parking could be a bit better. Would stay here again!!~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_472567439~“Check reviews”~Looks beautiful. Parking is limited. Great evening meal. Customer service just the worst but the staff are friendly enough. We made a reservation through a third party (web site) to arrive to find there were no rooms booked for us & found it most embarrassing travelling with an overseas guest and not what you want to be told at 5.30pm on a very wet evening~2~3~4~4~4~3~1~nan
review_472515224~“Tiny room for 2 people. Much better value at the same price at other hotels in Canberra.”~My daughter and I had 2 beds in a tiny room at the end of a rabbit warren of corridors. The bedding was queen sized sheets and a badly pilled doona, no cover, folded into a heavy ungainly parcel on each bed. The hotel is a lovely old building in a handy area and the small ensuite fairly recently redone was fine. We did not eat at the restaurant as there was only one vegetarian dish on the menu. Also sent back 3 cups; one cracked, one with a lipstick stain still on it, and one that was dirty. Breakfast is mediocre at best so don't bother. There is hardly any parking onsite so we parked on the street. This was ok on the weekend but would be a nightmare weekdays. We certainly got the impression that using a Luxury Escapes voucher meant being allocated the worst room available and didn't bother staying the second night.~3~2~5~3~2~4~3~nan
review_472490411~“Beautiful Hotel Close to City Centre”~While being massively renovated, the Hotel has retained its 1920s feel. The rooms are spacious and well designed and the restaurant is pleasant. Watch out for parking which is all on street and distances back to reception are all long.~4~3~4~3~4~5~3~nan
review_472413699~“Art Deco splendour”~Beautifully appointed courtyard rooms were an utter delight. Elegant and yet relaxed ambience throughout. A tip? Go to breakfast either very early or late-ish, otherwise be prepared to queue for a table for the excellent buffet.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472327889~“Nice Place, Great Location”~My wife and i stayed at the Hotel Kurrajong and we loved it. The rooms were very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Old Parliament House, National Gallery and you could even walk to the New Parliament house. The Kingston Foreshore is within a very short drive as is the Glass Factory and the Old Bus Depot Markets. The Kingstone Foreshore also has some great places to eat breakfast lunch and dinner. All around, we had a great time at Hotel Kurrajong and definitely recommend this place.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_472317620~“Lovely Atmosphere”~The hotel was very classy with friendly staff and a welcoming and cosy atmosphere without being stuffy. The room was lovely with a comfortable bed and a bathroom with plenty of room. Being within walking distance of Manuka for eateries was very convenient and the Kingston dockside was also only minutes away by car.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_472301282~“Beautiful old world hotel”~Lovely old hotel in a very nice part of Canberra. We were there on a busy weekend over a public holiday so the breakfast area was a bit crowded. However, a few days later most people had moved on and it was absolutely lovely to sit there and look out over the lovely garden. Staff were warm and obliging. Our room was very nice and we had comfortable pillows (for a change). The other thing that was different to many other hotels we have stayed in....no noise! Once we were in our room with the door shut, there was no noise. Probably because it is an older hotel with thick walls. We bought it through Luxury Escapes so breakfast was included as well as a late checkout which was well worth it. Would recommend this hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_472258731~“Great location”~Historic hotel with a touch of luxury close to the heart of Canberra. Make sure you enjoy the Friday evening music over a glass of wine if the weather is good before dinner or after work or a drink in the bar~4~5~5~3~4~5~4~nan
review_472254181~“Warm and cosy”~My partner and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel. From the moment we walked in we could feel a sense of luxury yet the vibe was warm and cosy. We would definitely stay here again and recommend for our friends and family too!! We were aware of the parking issue yet were lucky to find a spot the whole time!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472245967~“Boutique”~A great place to stay with exceptional customer service. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The location was very close to the airport (with no aircrafts noise) and also close enough for easy access to the war museum and parliament. I'll stay here every time I am in Canberra.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_472241149~“No parking available - in the city where a car is essential!”~Really upset by lack of parking. Our car is never left on the street at home, and I never rush parking tickets by parking illegally. If weekend parking is not limited in the street, get the signs changed!~1~1~5~4~2~2~2~nan
review_472022009~“A nice stay”~My wife and I took advantage of a two night stay offer promoted through Luxury Escapes. This is a very nice property with an historical background. Rooms were quite spacious, very comfortable and very clean. Whilst there is an elevator to the first floor, the design of the hotel is such that the entire first floor is not on the same level requiring guests to navigate small stairwells. This is not ideal for elderly guests and there was no offer at check in to help with taking bags upstairs. We used the hotel restaurant for dinner on the first night however, the food, when served was only warm rather than hot. This is not good for a five star hotel. The other thing that upset me on checkout is the fact I was levied with a credit card surcharge. I was presented with my initial account to check which was fine, I handed the lady my credit card and she processed my payment. There was no mention of surcharges and it wasn't until I arrived home and looked at the account that I noticed the additional cost added and charged. This is not on and the young lady at checkout should have advised me that payments by credit card were subject to a surcharge. We found the staff efficient, polite and friendly but the front office staff we encountered were lacking in their knowledge of local attractions insofar as opening times, admission charges, etc. Improved concierge service would be of benefit.~4~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_472005779~“Overnighter”~Not being a regular visitor to Canberra and because I was just there for the Opening of 2017 National Portrait Gallery I found the Kurrajong as it was close to the Gallery. The hotel was faultless, staff very very helpful , ambience, food , absolutely everything just perfect . Would definitely recommend and stay again if I am every in Canberra again. Thank you Hotel Kurrajong~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472005297~“Lack of attention to detail”~The room and en-suite was well appointed. Concierge was about to change shift when we arrived and were busy - no offer with luggage or assistance to locate our room, in a rabbit warren, was offered. The coffee machine in the room had been left dirty and the collected dust under the bedroom chair was laid thick. Our one off dining experience was disappointing. Salmon was returned overcooked and we were offered a fresh salmon dish. Unfortunately, It was also overcooked. As the other diner had already completed their dish it was not returned a second time but should have been. This hotel is in a wonderful location, has lots of historical importance to the ACT and could be so much better, so easily.... simply with more attention to detail and great customer service. So much potential - would love to see it improve!~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_471996325~“Nice Hotel with good position”~The rooms are well fitted out and comfortable. Availability of onsite parking can be a problem with limited spaces . You have to drive around adjacent streets to find a spot. Good location 15 minute walk to Galleries etc.~4~4~5~4~4~5~3~nan
review_471986739~“An excellent boutique hotel”~First time here and we were very impressed. In Canberra for a mother daughter weekend and the Kurrajong was a delightful surprise find. Centrally placed within a short drive to Civic, Kingston, Manuka yet whisper quiet away from the bustle. Lovely attentive service and gorgeous facilities. Will definitely return.~5~4~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471969209~“Perfect”~We love this hotel, we stayed a year ago and our fond memories were correct. It has a great atmosphere, a strong link with Australian political history but most of all exceptional service! It is walking distance to lots of national attractions, and far enough from the centre of Canberra to appreciate the serenity !~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471955065~“Lovely restored old world charm”~Stayed here after our wedding nearby.  The hotel staff were lovely and allowed us to check in early so the groom had a place to get ready. Lovely touch of a chocolate platter and a really touching handwritten card congratulating us. The staff were pleasant and friendly. Room was clean, quiet and well appointed with a very nice bathroom and great lighting. Comfortable bed and furniture. Nice view onto garden courtyard from our groundfloor room. We slept poorly but I think that was all the post wedding excitement rather than any fault of the hotel! We had breakfast at Chifley's Bar and Grill which was a large amount of delicious food. We'll be back for our anniversary.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471951407~“Over rated and over oriced”~Stayed for the weekend.. no parking was the first let down, after stumbling into the front door in near darkness.. no lights on!  No concierge either to help with bags or holding open the doors! Don't they have auto doors in our capital??? "Go and park on the street" was the comment from the night manager. It went down hill from there... Then the room... small, badly laid out obviously "designed" with an Harvey Norman catalogue in hand... cheap! And I'm paying premium rates!!! Let's talk about the toilet! The seat was not fixed and fell off.. maintenance generally terrible ... study lamp on the desk broken along with soap dish in bathroom... shall I go on? In short over rated over priced and second rate ... Don't bother with this so called "heritage hotel...~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471758765~“Dad's 80th Birthday”~Booked this hotel for a surprise 80th birthday for Dad. Sonja in reception even set up a birthday surprise of a cheese platter when he got there. Very nice, well done and thank you for making his check in so very special. He got a real thrill to think the hotel could do that for him. Well done indeed Hotel Kurrajong.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471741643~“Comfortable and enjoyable”~Nice old world hotel close to Art Gallery and Portrait Gallery. It needs to have a porter to greet new guests before they try to enter the hotel, to advise about parking and to help with luggage. Also needs a porter to help with luggage to upstairs rooms. There are no lifts and stairs to negotiate outside and inside the hotel. Good food in restaurant.~4~5~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_471594057~“Parking is a joke ... good hotel otherwise”~They charge a $15 parking fee for a non-guaranteed spot in the hotel's crescent shaped driveway or in a relatively small parking space on the side. Too bad for the hotel's guests when demand is boosted by an event such as a wedding reception. We counted multiple cars in both areas not displaying the hotel's parking card. Solution - don't pay for parking, instead park in the street (free on weekends). Rooms are nice enough, showers are good. Be ready for a long and winding trek to reception from some rooms. Walking distance to some nice restaurants including Ottoman Cuisine.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_471563244~“A short but great stay at this historic hotel.”~We only stayed one night, but will surely return here when we revisit Canberra. The hotel has had a stylish refurbishment, but retained its quirkiness, and charm as well as lots of photos of historic figures and events. Very comfortable bedroom, great shower and comfortable bed. Efficient, polite and friendly staff. A mezze snack and a cold beer on a hot afternoon ticked all the boxes, breakfast was quite adequate. Had to pay extra for this as well for parking. Parking was a tight squeeze, but we managed OK. All in all a great stay. Thank you .~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471538907~“Stay was 11th, 12th and 13th March but we travelled to other places on our holiday. Title of review is Thanks”~Thank you very much for excellent service. We were very happy with our stay. We enjoyed visiting Canberra for sightseeing, and to celebrate my birthday. The Hotel is in a great location and is full of history.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471465715~“Beautiful historic hotel in the best location”~We stayed in a ground-floor Heritage room for 2 nights (Friday & Saturday) at the beautiful Hotel Kurrajong. It has been meticulously restored and the room had added modern features such as a wall-mounted, flat-screen TV, ducted air conditioning, a very modern bathroom with extra large shower and modern decor. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were quiet. The hotel had lovely sitting areas and a nice restaurant (Chifley's) for breakfast and dinner. What really makes this hotel are the staff - they are so friendly and helpful. Hotel Kurrajong is centrally located so it is very easy to get around. The highlight of our trip was visiting the nearby National Gallery of Australia to see "Versailles: Treasures from the Palace". We can highly recommend dinner at Belucci's in Manuka. Also check out the Old Bus Depot Markets in Kingston on a Sunday. As mentioned in other reviews there is a shortage of parking at Hotel Kurrajong (there wouldn't have been many cars around when it was built in 1926!) but there is plenty of street parking (unrestricted on weekends).~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471317200~“Reunion”~Disappointed with room location and first day breakfast - not up to standard. Stay also soured by confusion over payment and deal offered, with unsatisfactory resolution. Staff efficient rather than friendly. Felt tolerated rather than welcome during our stay. This was contrary to a previous stay which we enjoyed.~3~3~3~3~2~4~3~nan
