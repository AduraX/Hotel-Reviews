review_478368867~‚ÄúThe staff were fabulous - accommodating and delightful.‚Äù~From the reception desk staff who were efficient and polite, to the restaurant staff who were welcoming, friendly and accommodating (without being over the top), to the Housekeeping staff (one who was called unexpectedly to change the sheets when I cut my big toe and bled everywhere, the other who was on routine room cleaning the following morning (she was so nice)) who could not have been more lovely leaving us both with a fond memory of the hotel and a determination to stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_478138796~‚ÄúPerfect location, let down by short cuts‚Äù~Pros: Location is great, perfect. Had recently been through a refurbishment, lobby looks excellent and inviting. Good bed, feather pillows Good breakfast Free internet Cons:  I can confirm the shower (and bathroom basin) pressure is lacking here, it barley does the job. I had to double the time in the shower so I could rinse property. Based on other reviews this is a hotel wide problem. I personally have cancelled a future booking because of this. Air conditioner cannot be controlled property, and it very loud. It ended up being too loud and hot at night. Street noise can be heard in the room. Some of the window seals appear broken and not replaced during the renos. No double glazing. Cleaning is generally okay, but found a few stray hairs in the bathroom, and the recent renovation is starting to show its age through lacking in cleaning. No free water provided, and limited convenience stores in the direct vicinity makes it hard to avoid paying (unless you drink tap water). Overall hotel has plenty of potential and feels 4.5 star as you walk in. However the cons described brings this hotel down to a typical 3 star unfortunately. For the right price its okay but shop around.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_477383038~‚ÄúExcellent hotel, if you don't look too hard.‚Äù~Very comfortable and amazing location, but the lack of room service desserts, the ill-fitting sheets and low water pressure would've been disappointing if I'd paid full price.  Breakfast was fantastic and parking was reasonable.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_477071919~‚Äúüëçüèº‚Äù~Clean room, lovely staff and comfy stay! Bed was comfortable and fell asleep instantly! My only criticism is that the bathroom did not have a fan, which then fogged up the humble sized bathroom.  The restaurant was also lovely with a warm ambience, friendly and quick staff. We were seated for a table of seven. As our mains were slightly late, we received complimentary entrees including fries and polenta chips which were delicious! I personally ate the gourmet pie which was rich in flavour however could have been saucier.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475743408~‚ÄúEaster weekend away‚Äù~The room seemed ok to begin with, however ageing with scuff marks, paint off walls and furniture broken, housekeeping could be improved as it felt very dirty. We enjoyed drinks in the bar but the staff seemed very disinterested with customers and more in chatting with each other. We decided to have a bite to eat but were told you can't order from the restaurant at the bar. After trying to book into the restaurant to book a table in 20 mins we were told there were only two settings for the night and told to come back in 90 mins. We ended up going elsewhere.  Next trip we will definitely choose to stay elsewhere. No customer service at all in the bar and restaurant.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475436061~‚ÄúPleasant and comfortable stay‚Äù~QT Canberra is located a short walk (10-15 minutes) to the National Convention Centre Canberra which is great if you have a conference/event which you are attending there during your stay in Canberra. A little further out from the main shopping strip of Canberra which is located on the opposite side of the hexagonal London Circuit. This hotel has an unique decor which is refreshing and definitely separates it from other big chain hotels. The rooms are comfortable and of reasonable size for its pricing. There isn't much else to say about this hotel. Nothing outstanding. Great for a short business trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_475371803~‚ÄúBest freshly made omelette in town‚Äù~The buffet breakfast at QT Canberra is the best I've come across. It's fresh and has a huge variety for all tastes. But what impressed me was the yummy omelette made while you watched! Fresh eggs (none of that ghastly egg powder) and fresh ingredients. The rooms are spacious with funky decor, coffee pod machine and a mini bar. Great service all round from check in to departure. Parking spaces are a bit tight.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475339365~‚ÄúLoud aircondition and low water pressure.‚Äù~We stay for 2 nights and i was disappointed to booked in this hotel, 1st night i found out the aircondition system is loud and not really cool. Low water pressure when using the sink and bathroom. The flooring of the bathroom was not installed correctly, no door installed to the bathroom. Small bathroom, when having shower the water run outside the bathroom floor.i disagree that this hotel is a 5 star hotel this is below average hotel. I did not book for standard room our room is QT Queen booked for week days.but i was disappointed and i have this bad experience. The hotel is stylish and nice view outside the balcony, Restaurant is fancy but it is not really close to the shopping center. It is not my ideal hotel i am not coming back again. I stayed to other hotel in canberra like novotel is way better.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474609769~‚ÄúGood value for money, quality facilities, customer friendly‚Äù~Stayed here for 2 nights, good central location, good quality room and facilities for the price.

review_474504800~‚ÄúNice place to stay‚Äù~Stayed two nights for business. Very nice hotel. Rooms were very clean and well appointed. Breakfast in the restaurant although a little expensive was very good. Views from the room were quite spectacular although this would change with the way the room faced. Nice bar with a dizzying array of spirits available.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474394196~‚ÄúWe were with the Sydney 2 CAMberra group, and we are always looked after so well. Really enjoy our stay‚Äù~We stayed for one night with the Sydney2CAMberra group.

review_473981073~‚ÄúPositives and negatives‚Äù~Positives - capital bar and grill for dinner - great food. Cool and funky feeling in hotel. Staff very helpful and friendly. Negatives - this was a Rydges hotel which event has converted into a QT. It does not feel like a 5 star hotel. bed very small and uncomfortable. Barrista coffee at breakfast which tastes terrible and there is extra charge above buffet. Not walking distance to many restaurants. Breakfast buffet ran out of smoothies around 830am and staff refused to make more. Balconies are dirty.no pool or gym.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473954237~‚ÄúLoved it , will return for sure- thankyou QT we are now fans‚Äù~Our first stay at a QT hotel and we are hooked, at last a hotel that feels like it is for adults instead of the unbalanced focus on children, cut glass cocktail set up in the room, adult touches and d√©cor, looked the theme. Loved the coffee machine and T2, probably wished the bathroom amenities smelt nicer they were good quality but smelt generic .Rooms are well equipped and appointed as you would expect, a little quirky but not too much to get weird like other hotels. Bed so comfortable, loved the balcony and thank you to the reception and the management of this hotel for the upgrade and who acknowledged and spoilt us for our wedding anniversary. It was generous of you and those touches made our trip. We did not eat in the restaurants but will try in the future, looked great and they were really pumping every day like a permanent party. Lots of fun to stay here, amazing location, walks everywhere walking distance to shops , supermarkets and restaurants only 10 minutes away, great views over the mountains loved it. I would encourage the staff at reception to stay warm,friendly and relaxed and not get too pompous there is a danger of that. The attention to detail even in the corridors was really cool, we got lucky with the parking and had a spot each night. Thankyou we will definitely be back. Also loved the technology emailing asking for requests and then actually meeting them and texting when the room is ready - how cool is that ?~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473721156~‚ÄúGreat hipster hotel‚Äù~I stayed here for three nights last week for a business trip, it's a quirky hotel on the outskirts of the city area which means you have to go for a walk for dinner, but the rooms are fashionably decorated and very comfy, with quirky minibar items and the breakfast is a buffet spectacular. If for no other reason I would choose to stay here again.  Great hotel with an air of difference which is refreshing in the Canberra scene.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473005619~‚ÄúBrilliant service during conference‚Äù~Attended a conference at the QT hotel and was extremely impressed.

review_472798662~‚ÄúOne day in the seat of power‚Äù~This is such a fun place - involving decor which gives you unexpected photo ops, very knowledgeable and friendly staff and an outstanding breakfast.

review_472750407~‚ÄúLove staying at QT‚Äù~My daughter and i stay at QT quite often. The rooms are very comfortable. Great breakfast.

review_472515383~‚ÄúAvoid the stock standard - QT -a refreshing stay.‚Äù~On our way home driving from Melbourne we decided to stay in Canberra and booked that afternoon at QT as the website/photos looked fantastic and the room rate seemed reasonable.  We were not disappointed as the photos were exact. QT is an effortless, contemporary and satisfying hotel. The room - a standard queen ‚Äì was modern, clean, a good size and the air con was terrific as it was easy to adjust and was instant in the desired changes. The mini bar offerings were fun with a great selection of snacks, beverages and quirky items. The theme throughout the hotel was a refreshing satirical and arty take on politics with d√©cor to match its art/contemporary vibe. Location wise it‚Äôs perfect ‚Äì walk to Civic centre, cafes and restaurants. A short drive to all the major tourist destinations. The restaurant is fabulous! A simple yet well considered menu in a lively but stress free environment is partnered by professional and friendly, down to earth staff. There is a thorough and respected wine selection and the tuna tartare was superb! But the best aspect I am saving till last‚Ä¶in fact it is the main reason we decided to stay an extra night. The Capitol Bar. A relaxing yet interesting space where Jack, the Bar Manager and Gunter served up enlightened cocktails, enjoyable conversations and always with such professionalism and care ‚Äì they made us feel special without the pomp.  I recommend this hotel to couples, business ‚Äì anyone who wants to avoid the stock standard and enjoy a refreshing and professional, not to mention comfortable and terrific value for money stay.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_472514451~‚ÄúObama‚Äôs in the house‚Äù~‚ÄòObama‚Äôs in the house‚Äô I announced ecstatically when we checked into our first hotel in Canberra. Mind you, Obama wasn‚Äôt the only politician in the house, you‚Äôll easily find that numerous heads of state have taken over the quirky and artsy lobby of QT Canberra. Life size Australian politicians appear on the wallpaper as well as portraits of figures like Hilary Clinton, Angela Merkel and the like take over one side of the space while on the other side, guests can read live tweets. Being the capital city of Australia and politician central, the theme at QT won over my heart within seconds.  QT Canberra is conveniently located in the centre of Canberra and a stone throw away from the trendy NewActon precinct. Given that it‚Äôs only a ten-minute drive away from Canberra Airport, we thought it would be the perfect place to settle in.  Stepping out of the elevator on the sixth floor, my eyes were immediately drawn to the room number signs. Rather than the usual mundane ones that you see in a lot of hotels around the world, here at QT, the signs are illustrations of a voting papers being dropped into a ballot box, and on the voting paper, you will find your room number. How fitting. We reserved a junior suite, which essentially was two adjourning small rooms with en suites combined into one. Both rooms offered access to the long balcony with a panoramic view from Lake Burley Griffin to as far as the Parliament House on the left and Black Mountain on the right. In the room, you will also find quirky quotes from politicians printed on postcards with photos of, you guessed it, politicians on them. The Junior Suite was quite low-key, other than the views, so don‚Äôt expect anything too flash. The next morning, we had breakfast at the hotel‚Äôs Capitol Bar & Grill which offered a fantastic spread of food from cold cuts, smoked fish, plates of fresh fruits, to mini jars of bircher muesli, juices and breakfast favourites like streaky bacon and potato rosti. There was also a T2 tea station as well as an omelette station. I thought the breakfast was fantastic, after all, QT understands that politicians can‚Äôt run the country on an empty tummy.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever written the word ‚Äòpolitician‚Äô so many times in one post, but QT Canberra has surely done an awesome job at making the politicians shine - now if you want to take a selfie with Obama, you know where to go.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_472236580~‚ÄúRead the Reviews - Dont fall for the hype and Glitz‚Äù~I stayed on the weekend 1/9 and checked out 2/9 in room 401. I suppose our experience went sour from the moment that we tried to check in and then it was compounded by one thing after another. I was served by a young male (no name tag) who confirmed my booking passed my passkey and then basically sent me on my way. No conversation or greeting - no selling the Hotel facilities or eatery. I then walked to the lift and looked back and saw why I had been fobbed off so quickly...........an attractive blonde haired lady was now in front of the same male and I can tell you she was not being hurried along. We had been in a car for four hours and were looking forward to a relaxing and pleasant stay at a reputable hotel while enjoying the bar and restaurant (neither of which we ultimately patroned) When we got to the room we went to use the bathroom. It smelt stale and the ceiling above the shower had paint peeling and the door hinges were rusted and the back of the bathroom door looked shabby and scuffed. I do not believe that the vent was working as it took over 2 hours for the mirrors to demist when we had showered.  Now lets get to the room.........I had turned the air-conditioning on to heat the room and found that the air-conditioning unit made grating and rumbling noises intermitently and no matter what setting it was put on it continued to make the same noise. This was sound that we finally woke too. Later that evening, when we were getting ready for bed we turned down our sheets to find the bottom sheet had red stains on it. Then my wife inspected the pillows and hers had spotting all across the pillow case of the normal pillow.  By this time we were no longer surprised, or cared, to do anything about it (report to Reception) as we could not believe that (at least) some of these items must have been brought to your attention previously but have chosen not to do anything about them. We dealt with the linen in a method that we were happy to sleep with. The positive was that we slept like logs, as were bone tired. The matresses were quite comfortable. The Breakfast food was satisfactory for a buffet . We sat at a table that looks out at the garden seating area. What we spent our breakfast time looking at was the remnants of the previous evening's frevolities. We had empty bottles and wine glasses lined up along the flower beds.  Now we come to check out. There was a young lady at Reception (on her own) at 8.30am. Luckily the main exodus of guest had not begun. I advised the Receptionist that we were leaving and that I wanted to pay for the parking and coffees (that were not included as part of breakfast). I may as well have pointed a gun at her and asked for her money. She looked nervous and unsure of what she was reading on the screen (actually reminded me of a proverbial rabbit in headlights). She finally advised that my parking had been paid for and that I will be charged for the coffees. I asked how much the coffee would cost and she couldn't tell me. I didn't get asked if I used anything from the mini-bar (which we didn't). All in All a most unsatisfactory experience and I believe that I would have enjoyed my time in a 2 star motel just as much. I can assure you that you will not be having my custom again and I will ensure that none of my family, friends and associates will either or at least I will do my best to ensure that they do not fall for the fake glitz of poorly maintained and managed Hotel.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_471790244~‚ÄúFunky and cool Hotel‚Äù~I stayed in an upper floor room, the whole Hotel has been renovated with a bit of flair and old Canberra (politician) style in mind.

review_471550409~‚ÄúQuirky QT in Canberra‚Äù~A flying work visit to the capital found me trying out the rebranded Rydges which is now the QT Canberra, and boy what a funky chic difference. The mood is evident as you walk into the elevator to be faced with the press!. The rooms are spacious and light. The bed was very comfortable. The cocktail bar area is a tribute to pop icons and the famous and infamous. An excellent abode for a Canberra night!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_471365848~‚ÄúFunky hotel a stone's throw away from the convention centre‚Äù~I chose this hotel on a recommendation. I'm usually one to go for hotels with gyms but with Lake Burley Griffin so close it really was much nicer to just go for a run along the water. My room was well appointed, good bed and bathroom with nice toiletries. There is Wi-Fi included and a somewhat unusual range of minibar items - the usual standard drinks and snacks, with creative non-edibles ;-) It is located approximately 1km walk from the National Convention Centre. The room service menu seemed over-priced but no fear, there is an excellent little caf√© directly behind the hotel (Macon & Green Grout) for breakfast and the Capitol Bar & Grill downstairs also does great dinner fare. This is great for a short stay but is a reasonably long walk from the heart of the city mall so I'm not sure if I'd stay here if I wasn't going to the convention centre.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471282252~‚ÄúQuirky and functional‚Äù~I stayed recently for business which was my first trip to Canberra. I was impressed with QTs quirky flavour in keeping with the politics theme which is very appropriate considering the nature of the town. The room itself was clean with a very comfy bed and pillows. The TV system was above the usual hotel standards. The work desk had everything required including a USB plug amongst other plug styles. One very unusual bonus was ample power points at the bedhead which were readily accessible. This I have found is a shortcoming with many other hotels/motels that I have visited. Great for charging the phone overnight. I prefer the phone alarm over any provided alarm clock. Also great for using laptop on bed while relaxing. Room service menus is good but the elevation came from the presentation and the room service staff member who was cheerful and polite. Reception staff were great and cheerful. I am now planning to take "she who must be obeyed" down for a weekend as I think Canberra and QT are both destinations to be visited. I did not have time to attend the in-house old school barber but that is definitely for my next trip. Looking forward to my chivas regal while getting a cut throat shave.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471253960~‚ÄúGreat hotel with a twist‚Äù~Stayed five nights for a business trip, love how the hotel which I would describe as modern art deco with a political theme.  Liked the hand written welcome note and the chocolate cigar. Rooms are well equipped and the bed was super super comfy and very quiet to get a good nights sleep. Walking distance to all the restaurants ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471201173~‚ÄúNice hotel but‚Äù~I came to Canberra yesterday on a business trip and took the option of the prepaid breakfast. They had stacks of brewed coffee sitting on the tables but coming from Melbourne I wanted a real coffee for which I had to pay an additional $4. I ordered a late which was well presented but so bitter I had to add more sugar than I usually do. When I checked out this morning and informed the guy at checkout, he just apologised and still charged me for the coffee. I won't be back at the QT as attitude is everything~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470800150~‚ÄúTwo nights in Canberra‚Äù~I think I'm traveling too much, it's a nice hotel, but I find all QTs the same! Comfy bed, good bathroom, good parking, close to CBD restaurants. No gym though  But like I said a typical dependable QT hotel~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470721250~‚ÄúGreat Location in Canberra‚Äù~QT Canberra is in a great location overlooking Lake Burley Griffin the hotel rooms are extremely high quality and comfortable, and a very short walk to the Lake and a short walk up the road to access many restaurants it is a very beautiful hotel in a great location and has a has fantastic breakfast and dinning a little expensive for dining but extremely good food, well done QT Canberra.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470008310~‚ÄúQuite good value. ‚Äù~Quite a good value hotel. Needs decent bed side lamps so you can actually read as room very dark. Handy location and decent breakfast. Modern and quite sleek but could do with a thorough clean eg old spider webs on balcony. But does have a balcony!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469963422~‚ÄúGreat rooms, music didn't suit the demographic but suits the owners‚Äù~The restaurant has extremely loud music. When we asked if it could be turned down we were informed no because the owners like it loud. Its a pity, because the dinner food was good but I would not choose to eat here again. Music was also so loud in the drive way that 10 people attending the conference were in the street making phone calls. At breakfast the receptionist sent me to ask the chef about gluten free bread. he was busy and sent me to ask the coffee staffer. She didn't know so sent me back to the busy chef. Finally the receptionist went and found some very basic white bread. Contrast to Twin Waters last week. They had white, multi grain and fruit readily available in a basket.~3~nan~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_469941205~‚ÄúNice hotel ‚Äù~Visiting Canberra for a business trip, our stay at QT was pleasant. The facilities at the hotel are nice, restaurants, cafe and bars! Good food, great breakfasts, bar is very well stocked with a vast variety of spirits and wines.  The rooms are comfortable, although basic, and the beds and pillows are nice.  We had an alarm go off through the night, which turned out to be a false alarm, but many people were greatly upset by it! Quite unsettling! We had a bit of trouble with the card keys operating the lifts, but once that was sorted, all was good! The staff are friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469806542~‚ÄúFunky Feel, Customer Service a Bit Hit and Miss‚Äù~The Hotel has a quirky feel to it and is beautifully appointed. The room we stayed in was clean, very comfortable and well maintained. We stayed in the State Suite with some friends and our kids and it was spacious and comfortable with amazing views. We even had views of Skyfire from one side of our room. The customer service was a little hit and miss - still waiting for my receipt to be emailed to me and on check-in there was confusion as to the room status and the room we had booked. I had received notification from online check in that the room would be ready at a certain time so we arrived after this time only to find it still was not ready. Breakfast in the morning had a great selection of options however some of the presentation options (although more visually appealing than a bain-marie) meant that some of the food was cold and not as warm as it should be. Having said all I have said - the room was excellent and things just may not have coincided for the overall perfect visit. I would still come back and stay again and give them another go - it is a funky little place.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~3~nan

review_469742532~‚ÄúGreat modern and light filled rooms - Funky Fit-out makes it fun‚Äù~I stayed here for 2 nights for a business trip. On arrival the Hotel is fascinating and has been updated with many fun and quirky features. It is easy to find and get to, has plenty of parking (extra cost per night) and the room was light, had a balcony for fresh air and although it overlooked some busy roads you cannot hear it (with the exception of the fat boy motorbike club that went through one night). The bed is very comfortable. There is a desk with a proper chair to eat and work. There is an armchair to watch the TV, which has a great selection of channels. Bathroom is fabulous - the shower is wonderful, I want that shower rose at home. The staff are some of the best I have come across - no request scoffed at, were helpful and pleasant with all my dealings with them - congratualtions QT, look after them. From getting em access to the carpark, fixing a problem with payment of the credit card (hotel issue, not mine but I am tired of places that put it back on the customer - not your staff, they were absolutely professional), helping me select a wine (fab choice), to meal deliveries with a smile. The food is quite good and is normal restaurant price - my only wish was that the meals in room service had vegetables - having to pay another $20+ to have two vegetables is excessive so I didn't but a green veg would have been appreciated. I would recommend staying here and we will again - central, great rooms and food, fresh air with the balcony, quiet and great riesling. and don't forget the fun fitout - have a walk around to enjoy it.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_468657523~‚ÄúSmall but comfortable!‚Äù~The QT has a reputation in Sydney and Melbourne (the ones I have been to), however I feel the QT in Canberra falls just short of the standard I expect.  It is located centrally and close the the Newacton food and drink area.  The bar just through the Barbershop is great and had good vibes on the Saturday night. The music and cocktails were on point! The room itself was rather small and required a few things that needed attention in terms of decor. The bed was soft but comfortable and the complimentary movies is a nice touch,~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468372042~‚ÄúQuirky‚Äù~Enjoyed our stay here, somewhere different to the usual setup. I loved the views of Canberra from the (small) balcony. The rooms were clean and quiet, and there was a large selection of free and recently released movies. I missed out on the breakfast but my husband thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was a 15min walk from the city centre on the north side and only 10mins to the water side at the lake. I'd recommend here for a stay a bit out of the ordinary decor!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_468188027~‚ÄúComfortable & friendly ‚Äù~Have stayed a few times at the QT, staff always friendly and helpful.  Thoroughly enjoyed an evening drink in the well stocked bar.  Parking available but can be limited when busy.  Rooms comfortably furnished and decorated with quirky artwork.  Only a couple of minor points - no extractor in the bathroom so very steamy even after a quick shower. Secondly a note to housekeeping, not really acceptable to have one tissue artistically arranged in the top of the box to make it look full when that was the only tissue in it!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467179446~‚ÄúDate Night‚Äù~So I decided the hubby and me required a date night, so wanting somewhere close and fun I chose the QT Canberra. I have stayed at QT Sydney which definitely outdoes QT Canberra, Sydney seemed quirky and fun whereas Canberra had more of that 'run of the mill' feel!! Our Room had a balcony which I love as there is nothing better than fresh air, bed was super soft and springy but the room was a little on the small side. Overall, the stay was pleasant and I have to say the barman were cheeky little monkeys which I appreciate and breakfast was lovely especially the coffee. I would stay there again for business but for another date night for me and my hubby who I have been together with for 22 years I think a little bit more sophistication might be our next stop.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467085268~‚ÄúComfortable Stay‚Äù~Overall my stay was quite comfortable. The Wifi signal was strong and consistent. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  A couple of very minor negatives; While wonderful to have, I didn't use the coffee pod machine as it hadn't been cleaned for some time. There was old coffee residue inside the machine and it looked like it hadn't been descaled since it was purchased. The potential for mold and bacteria to grow in the damp interior of these machines is quite serious and it is important that they are cleaned and inspected thoroughly. The in-room dining team were able to locate decaffeinated instant coffee for me and said they had arranged for housekeeping to clean/replace the machine, but it didn't happen, so I didn't use it. My biggest gripe was the lack of a proper steam iron in the room. The first iron leaked over my new shirt and the second iron, which they claimed was brand new, didn't put out any steam. I couldn't be bothered to ask for a third iron. These were all very minor issues and I very much enjoyed my stay. Thank you to the team at QT.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_466608695~‚ÄúNice but there is easy room for improvement‚Äù~We had mix feeling about QT Canberra. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Could have been five star but got held back by a few little details they missed. Check in was quick but more on the too quick side. More details about my booking could be told such as hotel facilities, if my stay come with breakfast and where because I cannot remember if I booked the rates with breakfast. We asked for car park but our key card didn't work. As a black member of GHA we are entitled to some benefits such as water, 2 tier upgrade, newspaper, welcome local gift, late check out... But none of this was offered. I called up about the water and was offered one small bottle. Car park was also full but fortunately there was a staff there that helped us to find a suitable parking spot which was nice. We booked a junior suite which comes with a seperate lounge room and 2 ensuites. Glad we did coz the room is very small. No view from our room ( just staring at some roof) As other said the hotel decor and the bar is very nice. Breakfast was ok, not as good as other GHA hotels I have been to. There is not fresh vegetable option beside fresh tomatoes. The fresh juice doesn't look very inviting either. Next stay I should just skip breakfast and walk to cafe nearby. The staffs are generally welcoming. Overall I just felt that it is a bit short of other GHA hotel standard. Would we stay there again? Probably yes, but may not be our first choice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466411157~‚ÄúThis is a great place to stay‚Äù~The rooms are lovely and quiet. The staff are friendly and everything works as it should.

review_466409398~‚ÄúGood Service and Nice Atmosphere‚Äù~I really like this hotel and this time was no exception. Comfortable beds, polite and obliging staff, nice bathroom products.  Great music and really happy vibe all added to a relaxing mini break. We ate inhouse one evening and the food was delicious, and service prompt.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_466240343~‚ÄúThe rooms are like a 3 star motel‚Äù~We have previously stayed at the QT Sydney which is excellent so we decided to try the QT Canberra for an overnight trip. The accomodation is nothing short of embarrassing. We booked a junior suite hoping to have some extra space as we were taking our 4 month old. The room(s) 1006, we were given appear to have previously been adjourning rooms when the hotel was the Lakeside. The sitting room is an old bedroom that they have put a couch, TV and a chair in. Funky furniture can't hide the old carpet, fittings and tiny bathrooms. Each room had a one of the smallest bathroom areas I have seen and both showers had almost no water pressure. One proper bathroom would have been sufficient. After seeing our room had the smallest queen size bed we had ever seen we called reception asking if we could be moved to a room with a king size bed. Apparently this hotel doesn't have a room with a king size bed not even a suite. If you are looking for a comfortable, well appointed room avoid the QT Canberra at all cost. The staff were very good, the Capital Grill is excellent but the accomodation is an absolute joke. I'd hate to think what a standard room is like given we booked a junior suite.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466141967~‚ÄúGirls weekend away‚Äù~QT was funky and fun as expected. Breakfast was good and the beds were comfortable. Th e hotel is 2 mins walk to the lake. Our two twin rooms were quite different though with one of them being substantially smaller than the other. The smaller one basically had two single beds pushed against each other in what looked liked would be made up as a king normally. Fine when you are travelling with a sister but not if it was a work colleague. Make enquiries on the phone to ensure a proper twin room with space between the beds is provided if you need it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465196961~‚ÄúQuirky‚Äù~We recently stayed here and it was very good (except housekeeping forgot to fill tea bags everyday), checkin and checkout were seamless. Staff friendly and helpful.

review_465156728~‚ÄúGreat fun vibe hotel with magic views.‚Äù~Came here for a birthday weekend. It used to be a Rydges Hotel but is now a QT with all the funk,quircky and stylish vibe these hotels can muster. Themed beautifully for it's location with political wallpaper, note pads, menu covers and even 'do not disturb' signs having a parliamentary feel. The hipster staff were chatty and friendly and the cocktails excellent. the evening meal was well presented and served with a great wine that was recommended by the maitre d who was attentive and charming. The night lighting is dark and moody in the public areas and the reception/bar/restaurant/foyer/lobby is all open plan and has a great feel about it. Our room on the 7th floor was furnished in the arty/hip style. Chair and cushions very modern, pillows great and bed firm. A view across the freeway to the mountain beyond and a door to a balcony to step out onto, nice touch. It was summer during our visit. coffee shop and grocer at the back door of the hotel which is a convenience. Parking is extra and a bit costly but staff were friendly. Top hotel.~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan
review_464636963~‚ÄúGood Room, Uncomfortable Bed‚Äù~The negative things about the room was that the bed was very uncomfortable and that your hotel guide had an inaccurate security section ( ie it mentioned using the peephole but the door didn't have one) Breakfast was an overpriced and average hot buffet at $29 a head.  The lighting in the room was different with not having overhead lights just various lamps instead. A couple of positives about the nicely designed room were the pod coffee machine and and teatoo tea bags. Also they made sure that they could easily be filled at the bathroom tap.  The free Wi-Fi worked very well(not a captive portal). There was easy to reach power points in the room to plug a phone into charge, which was very nice.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463871347~‚ÄúSombre Staff & Small Rooms‚Äù~I'm a Gha and Priority Guest Black member which obviously comes with its perks of automatic upgrades, free experiences, etc...I didn't receive anything at the QT in Canberra! The staff were very sombre and just couldn't care less. The rooms were very small, the bathroom even smaller. I was so disappointed. I had meetings in the afternoon, and I actually cancelled my morning meeting so that my husband and I could drive the 3 hours home...it was that bad. We arrived home at midnight.  I will never stay at the Qt in Canberra ever again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463122969~‚ÄúGreat location QT Canberra‚Äù~Excellent location, within close walking distance to Lake B.G and to the centre of town. Surrounded by funky new buildings in New Acton, QT is itself a funky little motel. The rooms are a good size with views towards the lake and of Parliament House. The rooms are a little worn with chips of paint off in some areas. The included breakfast, offered a good range. The bar was very well stocked. The wine fridges were a piece of art in themselves. Being in Canberra, this QT theme was around Politicians in Australia and leaders( past and present) around the world. The staff were very friendly and helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461603593~‚Äúreally vibrant, well decorated & laid out hotel; great ambiance‚Äù~Could not have been more surprised at the rebirth of the tired old Lakeside hotel in Canberra: modern & vibrant, good menus, good service, centrally located, reasonably priced, especially with PriorityGuestRewards.

The air con in our room was not working the first night so we were upgraded to a suite the next day which were were very grateful for. Enjoyed the bar at night & indulged in a few cocktails.

review_460533769~‚ÄúStylish comfortable convenient‚Äù~QT has been renovated to a stylish level. The rooms are clean comfortable and sufficienty spacious. I liked the fact the windows could open onto a balcony and it was possible to walk onto the balcony for fresh air.  If I had a criticism it was that there are too many knick knacks and items for sale in each room- it means you need to clear them away for desk and shelf space.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan

review_460439971~‚ÄúGreat Hotel in Civic‚Äù~I have stayed at the QT a number of times now - and it is an excellent Hotel right in Civic in Canberra. The staff are all excellent the rooms well proportioned and very well refurbished. Certainly recommend it a a place to stay.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460319590~‚ÄúQuirky QT Canberra‚Äù~I rate this hotel for its location, its staff and its lack of boring, non-descript, beige decors favoured by so many other hotel chains. The photographer in the lift makes me flinch every time.  Staff are friendly, happy and genuinely interested. I like the crazy of the rooms and the Nespresso coffee maker. Wish the coffee pods were stronger but that's a Nespresso issue.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_459573274~‚ÄúFabulous‚Äù~The hotel was perfect, it was clean and tidy. The room had a great view. The hotel staff were very friendly and the food was good. The only thing that let the food down was the cheap advertising goods in the room~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_459055765~‚ÄúVery hot day - aircon struggle‚Äù~It was hot in Canberra last week and felt the aircon struggled during the night. I had forgotten the showers and tap had the water saving heads so make hair washing just that bit harder. However everything clean and comfy. The restaurant great as usual with fabulous food and great waiters.  Had asked for a room lakeside but got the entry side - oh well can't have everything! The open door with small balcony is always great for fresh air.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_458024932~‚ÄúGreat stay every time‚Äù~We have been loyal to the QT brand for some time now after having spent our wedding night in a suite in the QT Sydney. It has never disappointed. We love the quirky decor, friendly staff and feeling of contemporary luxury while still being very good value. The restaurant in particular (Capitol Bar and Grill) is excellent and the breakfast buffet outstanding. Love the presentation of the charcuterie station with everything you could possibly want in a breakfast buffet. Love! Will always choose a QT when we can while travelling.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456796742~‚ÄúGood for business trip‚Äù~Pleasant stay for an overnight business trip.  Rooms were comfortable and very clean. The bed felt like I was sleeping on a cloud, very comfortable which is important when travelling for work.  My only concern was the front of house staff. Their manner was neither warm nor friendly when greeting guests and processing for check in. As front of house staff that was my first impression of the QT Canberra which was disappointing.  However, overall the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms redeemed my visit.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_456679705~‚Äú10/10 Stay‚Äù~While my mum was visiting, we stayed at QT Canberra. Parking per day was a quarter of what you would pay elsewhere, the check-in process was seamless, staff were efficient and personable, and the rooms edgy and comfortable. In-room dining was as good as the dining experience in the onsite restaurant, Capitol Bar & Grill, and the hotel is located within a 10 minute walk to the city's centre and other attractions. We would absolutely stay here again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456257452~‚ÄúAmazing service, food and ambience‚Äù~I'm a massive fan of the QT Hotels but there is something about QT Canberra that is really different to all the others. The ambience is just unparalleled, the service is absolutely impeccable and the food...I can't even begin to explain how good the food is. The hotel is also very reasonably priced for the amount of quality you are receiving. Beds are great, rooms are spacious and quirky, bathrooms are modern and clean and the barber shop does a great beard trim and hair cut.  Now for the food - I'll start back to front: The dessert...pump your own mini jam balls!? By far one of the most innovative takes on such a simple dessert and the single most engaging desserts I've ever come across. It was the small simple things that added such character, like having honey on your plate from their hive on the roof. For the main, I had the 600g Black Angus Rib Eye and I do not say this lightly as I have tried steaks from all around NSW: It was by far, one of the best steaks I have ever had. Perfect cut, cooked to perfection and immaculately presented.  The wine list was also quite extensive which is important when a hotel's main theme is meat.  I will definitely be coming back.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455338927~‚ÄúGood location, good service‚Äù~This hotel is well located in central Canberra - you are only a all or short drive from most of the well known attractions. Check in was quick and efficient and there is also a secure underground carpark.  This is an older hotel (c1980s?) that has been 'done up' with a funky politician based decor, the rooms are smallish but comfortable and quiet. There is a decent coffee machine in each room and the air conditioner works well. There is good reliable FREE internet (well done!) and free movies on the TV. Breakfast is typical hotel fair but is tasty enough, espresso coffee is extra and not that good. Surprisingly there is no gym.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455311295~‚ÄúGreat stay‚Äù~Great little quirky hotel in Canberra. Cool hotel rooms with heaps of room comfy beds and big bathrooms. Staff were lovely and check in was easy.

review_455082990~‚ÄúThin walls in a tired hotel‚Äù~The hotel looks pretty funky from the foyer but once you get into the room, the quirky touches are just cosmetic distractions and don't really translate in the drab, small and tired rooms.  Had a few nice cocktails in the bar downstairs over the course of the weekend getaway and the service was nice enough. Drinks were inventive and fun, atmosphere was a little bit corporate but I guess that can't be helped in a town like Canberra. My husband and I were given a room right infront of the elevators and all we heard was the sound of people conversing while waiting for the lift all throughout the night. Sorry, that's a mistake... we actually heard more than this when the couple next door to us stumbled home drunk at 2.30am and proceeded to keep us awake for hours with their loud foreplay and eventual bed antics. Thankfully we were only there for one night.~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan~5~nan
review_454832792~‚ÄúQuality stay and great staff‚Äù~Stayed one night only.  Staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. regardless of hotel location or shift. Room was great and CLEAN - mattress and pillows wonderfully comfortable, decor upto date.  I dislike using bathrooms not my own, but found this one to be clean. Just a couple of spots of mould at the foot of the shower, but hey that can happen anywhere.  I stayed in Room 308 which was at the back of the hotel and found it to be very quiet. Also, I could not hear the lift from this location Buffet breakfast for $21 ( this price if booked the day before) was GREAT ! Apart from the usual hot and cold selections there was a variety of cold meats - prosciutto, hams - and cheeses. Also a baked ricotta tart - yummy. I might mention that the hot selection (and there was a lot to choose from) was made to order ie not your usual congealed mess sitting in bainmaries for hours. Parking underneath was secure. Oh, and free room wifi - yay ! All in all, I can't fault my stay and believe me I can be rather critical. Will definitely choose to stay here again and nooo, not affiliated with the hotel in any way.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_454645226~‚ÄúGreat vibe. Great view ‚Äù~Stayed in a Queen room overlooking Lake Burley Griffin, absolutely stunning of an evening. Bar had a great vibe with very friendly staff. Shout out to the reception girls who served me, great job. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454587255~‚ÄúPerfect location and lots of lovely extra touches‚Äù~My second stay here and it did not disappoint. We were checked in promptly and given a room on the 4th floor facing the London Circuit roundabout - I did ask for a lake view room but they were unable to help me. A knock at the door in our room delivered a little box of macaroons and chocolates which was a nice surprise. We asked for ice from room service and it was brought up in a matter of minutes. As a Priority Guest Rewards member we received free drinks and 20% off the restaurant bills which is a great saving. Breakfast was great and we ate twice at the restaurant (Capital Bar and Grill). Macaroni & cheese was dry and disappointing but my friend's steak was perfect. I would suggest the hotel brief their housekeeping staff on how to dust. The top of the toilet was very dusty was was the mini bar stock. The small balcony is completely neglected, covered in spider webs and dirt - not an inviting place to stand and look at the views.  Will certainly come again and I hope next time to receive a room on a higher floor and facing the lake.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454403952~‚ÄúGood location!‚Äù~Had an awesome two day stay ... Room was fantastic, we were given a room overlooking city hill and got to see fireworks from the hotel balcony at 12 midnight!

review_452292858~‚ÄúDisappointed‚Äù~I don't often give bad reviews of hotels, but this one I was really disappointed in. Check-in - we swear the French-speaking staff member was totally put out by the fact we had turned up to check-in. Nothing against the French, but her attitude was really snooty and unwelcoming. Foyer of hotel very funky, and bar area very nice (did not use the restaurant). As a Priority Rewards Member was given a free drink on arrival. They would not extend themselves to a free drink for my husband. Nice way to greet guests by totally making my husband feel like a hanger-on - lovely attitude - not. Told them as such, and they could shove their free drink. Funnily enough, free drink hastily removed from my card when I tried to redeem later. Poor customer service indeed. Room was okay - good view, funky fixtures and fittings, clean and comfortable. But tired around the edges - small balcony very dirty, parts of the windows breaking away or bent out of shape, the building was very shabby on the outside. But for the price we paid it was fine. Bathroom clean but very small - water pressure was woeful, especially to the hand basin. Room fridge wasn't working, but they were quick to replace. Parking was $12 a day which we were okay with. The only saving grace was the barman Jacob who made us feel very welcome. We quickly struck up a friendship with him, and we were actually sad to say goodbye. He is a definite asset to the hotel. But overall, I can't say I would stay there again - I would definitely think twice about it.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_450553546~‚ÄúStarts in laughter ends in tears‚Äù~I gotta say that first impressions at this hotel were great. It was easy to check in, the music was very cool, the room full of fun and character (although small). The atmosphere at the ground floor bar was also really great for a Thursday night. On the down side...no pool or gym. The bar and restaurant closed early. Breakfast is either 60 bucks for 2 or go eat elsewhere. But the most disappointing thing...the rollaway bed instead of being $50 extra (quoted over the phone) turned out to be $200 extra. Even when I booked an extra night on site to extend our stay I was quoted 10% off the extra $169 for the night (as long as I join the membership program). But in actuality the extra night was $202 and now I have a useless membership card. This could have all been easily resolved at check out....oh well. I guess there's lots of other places to stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450336897~‚ÄúUpdate the doors/windows‚Äù~I find it frustrating when a hotel updates the interior but doesn't do the doors/windows. I know they are very expensive but for me it takes away a fair amount of the new interior. Noise, look of them etc. I did have some trouble initially with the restaurant requesting vege food (hardly any options), but after speaking with one of the chefs, they did make it very nice.  Although i am a Black member with PGR, it wouldn't be my first choice when i come to Canberra again.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_449801486~‚ÄúGreat decor, just needs a pool and porter‚Äù~Hotel bar is great at night with its fireplace and fully stocked bar. Short walk to Hotel Hotel next door for other dining / drinking options. Rooms have a great mini-bar with essentials - especially the 'Emergency Bow-Tie' and souvenirs. Needs some sort of relaxation zone like a pool or spa. Needs a more 'confident' entrance so to speak. Hotel staff look rushed (I would presume understaffed?) The vacant concierge desk-thingy to the right as you enter should be a porter / valet station. You are often left adrift as you double park in the front driveway and lug your luggage in the foyer with no assistance from hotel staff. I presume this may be considered too 'stuffy' or 'old fashioned' for a hotel that appears to pride itself on modernity and avant-garde design.   New Years Eve event on Level 15 was great. Would come back for that. Staff felt more personable at this event.~3~5~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_449723411~‚ÄúNYE Debacle‚Äù~We were Staying 2 nights during the New Year weekend and booked the package for NYE. Upon check-in the receptionist was rude, arrogant and obviously didn't want to be there. On the next day our room wasn't checked over to see if we needed any fresh toiletries or the bin to be emptied by the cleaners until we came back in the afternoon. We went down for dinner that night and upon being greeted by the wait staff, we were told that it would be a bar menu instead of the full menu, which we weren't told about upon check-in, if we were then we would have opted for the breakfast offer instead. After dinner we complained to a lady at the check-in desk and she tried to offer us as little compensation as possible. Upon check-out we complained to a gentleman who ended up only reimbursing us for the dinner. It was the 3rd time we have stayed at the QT, and thankfully it was the only stay so far that had ended up a disaster. I believe that more could have been done to compensate us for the treatment we endured from the Check-in staff, I understand about the cleaning staff not getting to our room until the afternoon as I have numerous years of experience within the industry, but the treatment we got from the lady and gentleman who both were trying to offer as little reimbursement possible was like they were more interested in saving the hotels bottom dollar rather than saving a customer from continuing to use their hotel. Thankfully it is the 1st time we have experienced anything bad with this hotel, however I hope that it will be the last time we have such an experience.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449392645~‚Äú2 night stay a dissapointment‚Äù~Only stayed here as we were going to Spilt Milk and this hotel was the closest, so we had the chance to walk home. We were on the 2nd floor and had 2 rooms, when we woke up our windows had the view of the balcony which was a concrete ledge that was covered in rubbish and toilet paper. Not a nice thing to wake up to.  The room was neat and tidy however while we were at the festival someone from the hotel reception let someone up into our room who wasn't staying there to grab there stuff so we were upset to see if anything was missing and they could of helped themselves to the minibar which was disappointing to see staff letting people in without permission.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_449049185~‚ÄúQuirky, comfortable, friendly and great breakfast‚Äù~We decided on an impromptu visit to Canberra mainly based on a great deal from the QT. We had wanted to attend the 'History of the World in 100 Objects' exhibition on in Canberra and the QT offered a great 'Stay and See' package including one night accommodation, breakfast, parking, wifi, exhibition tickets and exhibition book which was unbelievable value. Nothing was a problem, we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful person on the front desk and admired the interesting political spin on the theme of the foyer while we were being checked in. The room was very comfortable and in keeping with the hotel theme, decked out in a very pop art Modigliani way. While we did not have dinner in the one hatted restaurant on site, the Capitol Bar and Grill, we did have a delicious dessert (after a slightly disappointing meal at another Canberra restaurant) and the breakfast buffet the next day was very satisfying with plenty of option to please all. Check out is a very civilised 11am. Would definitely recommend.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_448212703~‚ÄúVery close to everything‚Äù~Well been coming here for awhile now , this time great check-in, young male receptionist very helpful just new to Canberra, advised re parking and hotel booked us into a room so we could see the fireworks.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_448175873~‚ÄúNYE 2016 package ‚Äù~We purchased their NYE package ($345 as a member and we got a balcony view over the fireworks, bottle of champagne, 2 x free cocktails at the bar and breakfast) and were very impressed. The view was unbeatable and the room was clean, modern and had lots of funky touches that I really liked. One word of warning for families - I didn't feel this place would be family friendly for NYE. There were some VERY drunk people outside the hotel before/during/after the fireworks both at 9pm and midnight, some so drunk they were unable to stand or walking into traffic. To each their own, but people with kids were looking quite uncomfortable and it is something to consider. Didn't brother us as we had the private balcony view!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447960043~‚ÄúGood but not amazing....‚Äù~My beautiful wife and I recently spent 2 nights at the QT. I loved the historical nature of the hotel and loved the 70's mix with modern, although I suspect some of the 70's was a refurbishment cost saving. The rooms are small but adequate. We got a junior suite which really wasn't worth it as the second room felt disconnected from the main room. The restaurant was amazing, great food and wine. Most of the staff were great. The one thing we didn't like (and others too given previous reviews) was the loud piped music.....I think the hotel would do well to turn it down a little. All in all a positive experience.  Would we stay again ? maybe, we will check out some other hotels next time we are in Canberra before we return.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447914644~‚ÄúQT: Quirky Time‚Äù~An older hotel which has reinvented itself quite beautifully. Rooms really clean, service great. It has gone bold, quirky and a little kitsch - but it works. The hotel embraces the irreverent side of canberra and the political life which lies at the heart of the city. Views offer the quintessential Canberra skyline - old telecom tower, lake burley griffin, parliament house, mountain backdrop and the distinctive orange glow of canberra's street lights at night. Food is great too, except for the loud free-form jazz which blasts your continental breakfast.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Scrupulously clean, all mod cons, quiet rooms & a great funky feel. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant great food & wine choices & OMG... The desserts .., fabulous. We had a wonderful breakfast & again the food was terrific we certainly didn't return to Sydney feeling hungry. Thanks QT we will be back.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_447317771~‚ÄúA million little things‚Äù~Service at QT is the real let down. Notably they did not supply the "complimentary drink on arrival" they also missed out on delivering a bottle of Champagne that a friend had organised for us as a surprise - and then tried to charge us for it!! We only found out about it when the friend rang us to ask how it was! After chasing with staff it arrived with a complimentary cheese platter - pity it was as we were on the way out to dinner. In the room we had dirty cups and glasses in the cupboards, and the shower cap seemed to have been opened and repacked, then left on the sink. There were no single major dramas, but a million little things that you expect to be thought about at this level were simply overlooked. The room we had was quite large and very impressive upon opening the door, however there were a few pieces of furniture damaged or showing their age that was also a bit of a let down.~2~2~nan~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_445920704~‚ÄúIF YOU LIKE VERY LOUD MUSIC STAY AT THIS HOTEL.‚Äù~Room,staff,buffet breakfast all excellent,but the hotel insists on playing very,very LOUD music in the reception,dining area and bar. I asked the staff if the sound could be turned down but was unformed this was not possible despite many complaints from other guests.The loud music drove us [ 4 people ] away from the bar and dining room and we,on two nights went elsewhere for drinks and dinner. We would never stay in this hotel again.~1~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
