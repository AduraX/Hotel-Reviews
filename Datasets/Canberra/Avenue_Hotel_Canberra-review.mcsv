review_478394222~“Comfortable luxe”~This newish hotel is soooo comfortable: from the kingsize bed, lovely bedlinen, the quality T2 selection, the stunning bathroom with modern fit out to the large screen TV, seats and don't forget the big, fluffy, quality towels. Overnight, secure underground parking for $10 a night is a bargain. The restaurant at the rear is superb. Reception staff were brilliant, helpful and caring. Located close to most of Canberra's attractions, this is now on our list for return visits.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478348551~“Avenue Hotel Canberra”~Very modern hotel, close to shops and restaurants The room was comfortable and clean except the mattress was too soft  The bedside lamps are not adequate for reading in bed overall we had very pleasant stay~3~3~5~2~4~5~3~nan
review_478108319~“Avenue Hotel Canberra”~Great location, fantastic staff, spacious and elegant décor. Very happy we chose the one-bedroom apartment. So convenient to have our breakfast and also well located to cafes and restaurants in Civic for other meals.~5~4~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_478096014~“Great Overnight Stay”~An overnight stay in a one bedroom suite. We were very impressed with the hotel. The facilities were very clean and well kept, the room extremely quite, and the reception staff very polite and helpful. We will be back to stay again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477962316~“Great location”~Hotel very convenient location. Friendly staff. Great restaurant. Marble and Grain for breakfast and dinner. Value for money. Awesome room. Bed was extremely comfortable. Great views. Balcony was a bonus. Can't wait to come back again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477630910~“Great location, convenient and a touch of luxury”~Certainly this is not one of the cheapest accommodation in Canberra, however, it was certainly good value. We stayed in a 2-bedroom apartment and have a functioning kitchen (complete with pots, pans, dishwasher, cutlery and a Nespresso machine. So for the 3 mornings out of four, we made our own breakfast. We also ordered room service for dinner one night, ate at Marble and Grain on another night and the remaining nights we bought some stuff in the grocery and cooked our own dinner. So it worked out really good value for us. The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable. I like that the rooms had their own air conditioning unit and can be adjusted to your desired temperature.  The location is very convenient. It is walking distance to Canberra Central and the bus depot. There is underground parking available for free because we booked directly with the hotel -- this was very handy. Great hotel and fantastic service overall!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477609676~“Fantastic modern hotel”~An awesome find for Canberra stays. Quiet, modern, beautifully appointed rooms with excellent customer service. We stayed in a spacious one bedroom suite. It is a great location, close to numerous tourist spots and restaurants.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477587000~“Stunning Avenue Hotel”~We had a truly super stay at this hotel over the Easter break : if you have a family then spend the extra $ on the twin rooms as they are for their value, far superior than what most offer ! The fit outs are stunning and contemporary with the food at their in-house restaurant Marble & Grain superb . . . they even offer large sized kids meals for $12 . . . happy hour every day and a location right on the door step to Canberra's main shopping strip - will definitely be staying again ! ! !~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477569128~“" Very Classy Hotel "”~From the minute you walk into the hotel lobby you know the Avenue is something special.. 3 check in desks all manned by immaculately dressed, friendly staff that genuinely welcome you to the hotel like a valued guest and not a walking dollar sign set the tone for a great stay over Easter. The room we had was ultra modern, spotless and had the thickest mattress I've ever seen in a hotel. Bathroom was large, again spotless and the 2 styles of shower head was nice.. had a very luxurious feel in the whole room. The addition of planter boxes outside the room in the courtyard area that were draped in tiny lights added a nice ambience and a real touch of class at night. The buffet breakfast in the hotel's on site restaurant (Marble and Grain) was excellent as was the dinner we had on the Saturday night... if you do choose to go out and explore the hotel is well located near a myriad of shops, restaurants, cafes and bars as well as being central to most of the tourist attractions in Canberra. All in all a fantastic hotel I'd fully recommend and I can't wait to get back down there... Great stuff!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_477293808~“Clean and modern”~We loved this hotel. Fantastic location, spotlessly clean and very modern. Staff were very friendly too. Our room opened up to the courtyard but it was super quiet. There are some fun things for kids to do and the complimentary minties and papers in the foyer were a nice touch~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477209073~“Excellent hotel and location”~Excellent stay, clean, spacious and quiet room, fantastic location within 5 minutes walk from Braddon's cafes and eateries and the Canberra Centre. Enjoyed the little touches the Hotel offered such as satchets of T-2 Herbal tea bags and chocolates left on our bed each day. You can't go wrong with this one.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477033480~“Great location and hotel”~We stayed over Easter with primary school children.The Avenue was a great home away from home - a great spot to recharge after sightseeing. Clean and modern and still looks as new. Would definitely stay again with our family.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476973838~“Perfect Stay”~We decide on a last minute trip to Canberra. Booked this place directly through their website. Seamless experience and even received an immediate call to check on bed set-up requirements. Check-in easy and 2 bedroom apartment was fantastic. This is a new place all fittings etc are in great condition. Good play area for kids too. Great location with bar and food places an easy walk. Parking underneath.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476949922~“Luxurious, stylish surroundings”~Location was excellent and close to plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes. We weren't able to secure a booking at the in-house restaurant, Marble and Grain but the menu looked amazing so I would recommend making a booking if you can. The buffet breakfast was excellent value for money.  Decor of room/apartment was luxurious and stylish. We will definitely stay here next time we visit Canberra.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476774627~“Avenue Hotel”~Disappointed to find that we were to be charged extra for parking due to our third party booking. How were we to know? We used a website to find a hotel for he night because we didn't know Canberra and wanted to scan what's available. But The Avenue was beautifully appointed- clean,fresh, and new.~4~4~5~5~5~5~3~nan
review_476719541~“Staying in Style”~Excellent rooms and quality, staff were excellent and well presented. Located in central Canberra, close access to shops, war memorial and other places of interest. Recommend this for anyone staying for a night or two. The quality of rooms overshadows the average view but not concerned with this. Will return for sure~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476691199~“weekend trip to Canberra”~Excellent room appeared exactly as the pictures. Very well-appointed, clean, comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful.

review_476616765~“Better than Quest.”~Very spacious apartment. Very homely unlike Quest which I now find sterile. Centrally located and will be even more conveniently located when the light rail is finished. Value for money compared to a larger hotel chain and being confronted with 4 walls.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_476301237~“Been here 3 times, been great every time”~We love staying at the Avenue hotel. Our third visit, been of very high quality every time. We travel quite a lot and have stayed in many hotels, I think the Avenue is one of my favourites. Such comfortable beds, everythings so well thought of. Twice we have been upgraded to a one bedroom suite. Free wifi and parking is such a bonus, you don't get that at many hotels these days. I would highly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476016843~“Home like apartment in downtown Canberra”~Excellent, clean and modern hotel and quite spacious 1 bedroom apartment awaited us. We have requested a quiet room and were placed on opposite site of hotel from Northbourne Ave (which was appreciated). Unfortunately a popular Canberra night spot is nearby in Mort St, but on a Saturday night in downtown I will not complain. Double glazing was effective and room on high floor (7) had lovely views to the mountain range. Bed very comfortable and bathroom had all required amenities at this level and satisfactory water pressure and hot water. Having choice of overhead rain shower or more conventional adjustable wall mounted shower head was a nice touch. Shower door not closing completely is not a problem unique to this property but still frustrating when bathroom floor is sopping wet after a shower. Only real complaint was parking. Very tight turning into and out of the underground car park meant hanging out of the car on more than 1 occasion to reach the swipe. Do note that this appears to be a public car park (not limited to hotel guests) so although we did manage to find a park each time upon return it was a close run thing a couple of times. There was a helpful digital sign showing how many spaces were available at the boom gate. It is unclear what happens if you are a hotel guest but could not get a space if the car park were full. Much more annoying at checkout was the $10.00 per night parking charge added to my bill - but mentioned no where in the booking, including on the aggregate web site we used to make said booking.  Parking free or Parking fee is clear enough on any web site. Silence on the issue leads to a quite reasonable assumption that it is included in the tariff (you should not have to visit the hotel web site fine print for this information, as it was suggested we should have done), and the $30.00 hit at check out left an unpleasant feeling that may well affect our choice of venue when we visit Canberra again.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_475680280~“Nice place to stay but...”~Many positives about this hotel - great room: lighting excellent; spacious and clean. Good facilities (iron and ironing board hidden behind panel between sliding cupboard doors!) tea/coffee making etc. Beware the bar-fridge - a little too policed for my liking and make sure you read the Info card! Balcony is a huge plus and would stay again if only for this reason as it means not living in A/C. Both food and service at the "Bar" was great - though, disappointingly, the same cannot be said for the actual Restaurant (breakfast and dinner included!) On arrival, Front desk service was great and staff very helpful - this is always appreciated. Would I recommend this hotel (notwithstanding lack of service and value for money at the Restaurant)? Yes - but check out other places to eat. (Note - Food service is available only during limited hours at the Bar) Note: Service rating dragged down by lack of same at Restaurant - but very good elsewhere in this nice hotel.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~3~nan
review_475504314~“A great place to stay”~I stayed at The Avenue Hotel Canberra last weekend. The hotel is very comfortable, and an apartment gives you so much more space than a single room. The apartment is tastefully furnished, and the bed was very comfortable. I loved the shower! This hotel is very centrally located so you can walk to some great restaurants in a few minutes.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475422943~“Excellent Overnight Stay”~We found the Avenue Hotel excellent on every aspect for an overnight stay in Canberra to attend a friends birthday.

review_475371166~“Great comfort and facilities”~This is a very comfortable and well managed establishment offering good service and features. Rooms extremely well appointed although they need to introduce regular maintenance or standard will fall as small things fail. Staff helpful and informative, friendly right down to housekeeping staff Rooms extremely well fitted out and comfortable and spacious, we had a 1 bed apartment.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_475114141~“The hotel that thinks of everything”~From coffee machines and T2 teas to makeup wipes, this hotel provides all the little things that make a traveller feel appreciated. As a regular traveller this is one of my favourite hotels - and it is in Canberra! Highly recommend the Avenue Canberra. Oh and the staff are awesome!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475110094~“The Avenue Hotel”~Great location & very nice modern Hotel and car parking was free.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff & buffet breakfast was very nice. There was a deal of $19 for breakfast which was fantastic for that weekend. Overall would recommend staying there again without any hesitation.~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_474934079~“Emily”~2nd time back to the Avenue! Great hotel indeed. My mum and I had a 1 bedroom apt each. The rooms were huge! I found everything I needed. Staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was very clean. We got room service one night which was definitely worth the $$. There is no doubt that I'll stay here again during next years running festival too. The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of eateries, shops, etc. free wifi which is always an added bonus. We got the parking too which is $10 per day, but it's very secure especially at night where they have a roller door shut (as well as the usual boom gate) which needs your room key to open. I heard some drunks from the restaurant below having a confrontation on the street one night but that's what happens in a city at the end of the week - I was able to get back to sleep easily enough. We had the all you can eat breakfast one morning too which has a large selection of goodies. Thanks for having us - see you next year!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474533602~“Top notch ”~Fantastic, from check in to check out and everything between. Nice friendly welcome and good service when we arrived and our one-bedroom apartment was great. It was pretty plush and spacious, the kitchen had everything we needed, there was a decent balcony area, and it had great soundproofing - I didn't hear any noise from other rooms and slept like a log. The WiFi was fast and free, and there was free parking. And it had a well equipped, well maintained gym open 24/7. And it is in a great location, being five minutes walk to the CBD and only a couple of minutes away from the Braddon cafe strip. I could go on but you get the picture - it's a seriously good hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474488685~“Great Bed”~Overall we were very pleased with our stay here. Our greeting late evening was professional and very helpful. All staff interactions were pleasant. Housekeeping is exceptional and our one bedroom apartment was one of the cleanest we have ever enjoyed. (Although they did have the annoying habit of forgetting to lock the sliding door to the balcony). Great linen and although the bed was a little soft for my taste, it was still very comfortable. Excellent bathroom with walk-in shower and laundry facilities behind doors. My only advice to those that are light sensitive is to use a sleeping mask. There are excellent curtains on the windows but with so many electronic items the unit was a bit like a Christmas tree at night.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_474412343~“Great Hotel! This is my Canberra stay place! ”~Fantastic location! Great spa and a clean modern room. My only little ( and I say little) is the pillows are way to soft and flatten to next to nothing.. the mattress was comfortable, air con working well!  Staff were helpful and I will be back:)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474373938~“Modern apartment hotel”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment at the Avenue Hotel for 3 nights. The apartment was on the 8th floor with a view over the main road. It was spotless, light and with a comfy bed. The bathroom has a rain head shower and lots of fluffy white towels. There was a balcony along the length of the apartment with a table and chairs. The location is walking distance to many restaurants and we found a Coles and IGA about 10 mins away. I would definitely stay at the Avenue Hotel again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474325773~“THE GETAWAY”~We decided to have a getaway and Canberra was our choice, besides the fact we do have a close friend living there. The hotel (AVENUE) was chosen for 2 reasons 1-Location, 2-a different choice. The choice of the AVENUE turned out to be a pleasant surprise, quality with a high rated service for the time we stayed there.The B & B breakfast was really good. A big WELL DONE to all the staff of the Avenue~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473982219~“As centrally located as anything can be in Canberra”~Avenue Hotel is a very good place to stay, and it is as centrally located as anything can be in Canberra. The staff are helpful, there is no cost wifi, the rooms have small balconies, there is in room coffee service (although no creamers), and the beds are comfortable. We found the lighting to be very unusual as there is a very bright main light that you can't dim, and some side lights that don't give a great deal of light, so there is no in-between. You do need a cab to get just about everywhere; the bus service is not great and there is no light rail (yet).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473968544~“Great city centric location”~We came here on the recommendation of family members and have not been disappointed. We booked two king-size spa suites and have loved them. We have taken advantage of a special offer received by our son in law with free parking and a 30% discount on breakfast in the restaurant. The bed was really comfortable and each room really well lit with lots of options with side lamps and overhead lights that can be selected to alter the ambience. I've taken advantage of the free wifi (to submit this review as well) for checking travel information. We had dinner here last night which was excellent. Breakfast this morning was also excellent. Thoroughly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The hotel is very stylish and looks new. You can chose from staying in a hotel room or a self contained apartment. The apartment we stayed in was roomy and functional.

Our apartment faced an internal courtyard and was very quiet with no road noise. The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in and I wanted to take it home! Pillows not so good but I think there was a pillow menu to choose from. I took my own so had a comfortable night's sleep. There are TV's in both the bedroom and the lounge area. The kitchenette is well set up with everything you would need for a longer stay. There is undercover car parking if you have a vehicle. It is well positioned being close to shops and restaurants. A great place to stay in Canberra.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_470945713~“Avenue Canberra”~Avenue is in a fantastic location, our 1 bedroom apartment was amazing, awesome buffet breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff!! I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying here again!!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470935687~“Clean and Classy”~If you are particular about clean rooms, then this is the place to be. We loved the serene decor both inside our room and in the public areas. The location is central and within walking distance of shopping centres as well as funky Lonsdale Street. The bed was super comfy but might be too soft if you like a hard mattress. It didn't worry me. Check out was quick and there is loads of secure parking.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_470735437~“Luxurious”~Lovely place to stay, easy to find, although next time I would ask for a room not at the front of hotel and on the ground floor. Dinner and Breakfast at the Marble & Grain Restaurant was great. Wish we could have stayed longer.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470724945~“Good and not so good.”~I've just checked out form The Avenue and I'm ambivalent about my stay. Staff weren't exactly rude but weren't very friendly either. Internet access was easy and worked the whole time I was there. The bed is very soft - that might suite some people but I found it uncomfortable and didn't sleep well as a result. I had a spa suite - the spa was huge and very relaxing but the jets had a mind of their own and randomly started and stopped. Room service is ok although I'm pretty sure that they didn't replace my wet towel once - I left it on the floor but when I got back to my room it was neatly folded back on the rack, and still wet. Do not touch the mini bar unless you are prepared to pay for what you touch. It's one of those monitored mini bars and if you pick something up and do not replace it within 15 seconds, you've bought it regardless of whether or not you've used it. Breakfast is not included. It's an extra $19 per day for a buffet breakfast as long as you book ahead otherwise I think it's $26. Breakfast is ok but not spectacular. Considering how much I was paying for the room I would expect breakfast to be included. Room service has a $15 minimum - not a problem if you'd like a full meal but if you're after a midnight snack then it's not worth the effort.  The gym is accessible 24 hours a day but the equipment is hit and miss. One of the bikes has it's seat permanently set at a ridiculous height and the other bike's computer isn't working. There are three treadmills - all in mph (we're in Australia for goodness sake!) and two of them set to foreign languages. Ellipticals are ok. The music is loud and not adjustable so forget going in there with your own headsets.  I wanted to arrange a late check-out as my flight wasn't due to leave until 5pm. Best they could do was midday as long as I was prepared to pay an extra $20 per hour - I wasn't. They will charge a surcharge if you pay by credit card - unbelievable! I enjoyed the space in my room and I was grateful that the hotel is only a short walk to Civic . I can't say that I enjoyed my stay here but I didn't hate it either. For every good thing about this hotel there was something that took the shine off the experience.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_470723787~“Quick visit to Canberra”~Easy to find. Easy and helpful checking in and out. Great breakfasts. I had an apartment which was bigger than I needed but it was nice to have the space. Bed was deliciously comfortable. Shower door was gratingly noisy. My room faced the street and traffic started at 6 am. Taxis were a nightmare to get even when we had booked them the night before. Will stay here again but ask for a room away from the street. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470466185~“Room so big I could have got lost in it”~The room was massive! It was basically a 1 bedroom apartment. There was a lounge, kitchenette with dining area, and the bedroom. It was clearly renovated relatively recently because it has a very new feel. In terms of value for money it certainly delivers. Just prepare for it to feel huge if you are a solo traveler.  The bathroom design was interesting but it had everything you would want. Everything was clean and comfortable with ample pillows etc and good temperature control. The restaurant food was nice, the buffet was the usual but a good price if you pre-booked.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470384731~“Note sure”~We visited for 2 nights last week. We were looking for a medium priced hotel that was clean and presentable. That was all true. It was close to the main shopping complex and many restaurants and bars. The staff were excellent. The room looked good we were on the 7th floor of tower two. Unfortunately the view on the balcony was of people in offices or accross to another hotel. A bit clostraphobic. The bathroom was modern and clean with a nice shower with good pressure on one of the shower heads. The bed was disappointing it was like sleeping on a marshmallow it was so soft we sank about 15cm as we laid down. The air con was a system on the wall. All hotel rooms get hot overnight so we put the cooling on and it blew in our face all night. Tried to stop the oscillation but nothing worked. So if you like supersoft beds and no aircon this place is perfect for you.~3~4~5~1~4~5~5~nan
review_470369457~“Avenue delivers”~Always a great option when working in Canberra, well located and lovely rooms, staff friendly and efficient . The hotel is modern and rooms well appointed, the rain showers are a bonus. Complimentary paper and T2 condiments are a bonus~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470195467~““Superior quality and value””~We stayed on the ground floor in Tower 1. To our surprise and delight we were provided with an upgrade to a one bedroom apartment. It was faultless to a Tee. The room was spotless - and I mean not even a piece of dust on any of the surfaces. The cleaning staff need to be commended. Bed was super comfortable and even though we took our own pillows ...didn't need to use them. We couldn't hear any noise from other rooms nor was there any traffic noise - making sleep quality at the top of the scoring range. Convenient onsite parking and a relaxing ten minute walk to the CBD's restaurant hub makes this an excellent location. I have no hesitation in rating this stay as one of the highest quality and outstanding value I have experienced anywhere and will not look elsewhere whenever visiting Canberra in the future!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470185320~“Accommodated us, clean, modern and sheek. Great location! ”~Very clean and modern, located in the heart of the city. We booked a standard room and really needed an early check in around 11am. The Avenue upgraded us to a one bedroom apartment at no extra cost and really accommodated us. Breakfast was really good for $19pp. Definitely stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470174549~“Great hotel experience”~This hotel is excellent in all respects except for the bathroom which turns on a noisy exhaust fan whenever the light is turned on. The marble and grain restaurant was superb with a good selection of wines.The special of the day was spatchcock which my client and I rated excellent.~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_470153326~“Magnificent Accommodation”~Could not have wished for better. We had been booked for a deluxe room at a competitive price and were amazed to be upgraded for free to an amazing like-new apartment for our 3 night stay. Spacious with every mod-con you could wish for. Two TV's, efficient air conditioning, comfortable in every way. Good coffee machine, washing machine/dryer etc, etc. Servicing excellent. Friendly staff. Highly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_469992349~“Good apartment, good location”~Apartment had a good range of amenities including washer dryer, dishwasher and most importantly a decent coffee pod machine.

review_469961481~“Well worth the 7 1/2 hour drive”~Brilliant stay, the rooms were thoroughly cleaned everyday. Just loved the restaurant.

review_469719091~“Wonderful Stay”~Terrific location, clean and spacious - the first night we had problem with noise on Northbourne Ave, and requested if we could have a room change as we were staying for 6 nights - absolutely no problem with our request carried out with no fuss and with a smile. Very impressed and the second room we thought was better than the first! Very happy with service and all of the reception staff were very accommodating and helpful as to any queries about various places to see in Canberra. Overall a wonderful stay. Would not hesitate to rebook when next visiting.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

The facilities were excellent, everything had been provided for. The level of cleanliness was second to none, everything was gleaming and clean. I could not have wished for anything better.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_469525926~“Overnight in Canberra”~Bed great. Rooms great. Air conditioner a bit tricky. A big notice on the mini bar about the 15 seconds removal from both the fridge and the food on top. We didn't consume anything but it could have been very easy to take items out and not return them within the time limit.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469320774~“Outstanding accommodation at Avenue Canberra”~We stayed at Avenue Hotel for 3 nights, and were delighted to find on arrival we had been upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment, which was just fabulous. The room was immaculate, spacious and very comfortable. It would be difficult to find fault with this hotel. We enjoyed a buffet breakfast each morning, which was delicious and a great variety. Staff were friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_468989294~“Very comfortable and modern”~I have been staying in Canberra for a few months at different hotels. This is the most clean and modern one I have stayed at. Staff are friendly and I especially liked the bath robes and slippers. The bathroom also has decent space for toiletries, which is a change. Very comfy beds too.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

As an avid coffee drinker there was even a nespresso coffee machine and pods included. Icing on the cake. It was in a great location, so we walked everywhere.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_468427112~“Great Place to Stay, Great Location”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment on the fourth floor. We enjoyed every bit of our stay. Clean and comfortable. Husband thought the bed was too soft but I didn't mind it. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468409109~“Best in town”~I usually stay at one of two other Canberra properties when needed just out of habit. My appointment was at a location I was not used to so decided to stay close. That was fortuitous. The Avenue is truly the best accommodation I have had in Canberra. The standout was the room. I stayed in a spa suite and it was extremely spacious and beautifully presented. For either one night or a longer stay I will be looking at The Avenue first on all future Canberra visits.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468217670~“Fabulous modern Canberra hotel with wonderful staff”~My 2 friends and I stayed at the Avenue as we were attending a concert at AIS arena. Check-in was prompt and the staff were super friendly. We had a car which we had valet parked for $20 overnight. We had 2 inter-connecting rooms which were opened up. One friend had a king bed, bathroom and lounge area/kitchenette on her side and myself & another friend had a twin room and bathroom on our side. It was all open for us to share the space and this would be perfect if you were traveling as a family or like us as a group of friends.  The rooms were ultra modern, very spacious and with great amenities. There was a mini bar as well as a large fridge in the kitchenette area. The bathroom was great, well lit with a large mirror and a fabulous shower. The beds were super comfy.  We ordered room service from Marble and Grain and although the menu is a bit limited in the sense that it's mostly meat based, the quality of the food is great. We had a burger & chips before heading out for the evening and it was seriously delicious. Thought it was pretty reasonably priced too.  Our room was on the second floor and although the hotel is on a busy main road, we didn't encounter much street noise and had a decent night's sleep. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Avenue. From the moment we booked, the hotel made contact with me to offer assistance in order to make our stay more enjoyable. The service was outstanding and we couldn't fault anything with this hotel. We will definitely stay here again when next in Canberra.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
