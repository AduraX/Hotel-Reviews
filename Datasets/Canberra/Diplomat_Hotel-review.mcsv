review_478069937~“Diplomat”~The restaurant was brilliant buffalo wings where the best food ever tasted and that service was top class. Convenience to the Kingston railway station was terrific. We will certainly stay at the diplomat next time we stay in Canberra and we will recommend it to others.  ~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478067772~“Great overnight stay”~Stayed as family of 5. Spacious room. Facilities all there. Surprisingly Quiet rooms. Lobby/foyer great for kids: dinosaur display, books, games, lovely ambiance. Buffet breakfast expensive, but adequate.~4~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476623237~“Perfect spot to stay”~Everyone was very welcoming. Made you feel at home. Had everything you are looking for. Certainly stay again whenever I get to Canberra. Parking excellent. WiFi spot on. Bar was great but overall the staff were the best as a team I have experienced in Canberra.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476347940~“Unfortunate experience”~Household attention to detail let the hotel down. We have staid in this hotel many times over the past years and have always enjoyed our stay. This time an oversight by housekeeping and a real lack of interest by the reception staff resulted in an unpleasant experience.~4~5~5~5~5~1~1~nan
review_476273113~“Great Location, comfy bed”~We stayed for 1 night. The contemporary rooms where clean, tidy and bedding nice and. Comfortable. Well equipped with bar fridge, iron, ironing board, hairdryer & TV. The location. Was fantastic! Close to Kingston & Manuka cafes & restaurants. Easy to get to city, Parliament House and other sites of attraction.~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_476242097~“Old World Charm & Friendly Faces”~What a delight to be made welcome not just at check-in but throughout the whole stay! Great staff, comfortable, well appointed rooms and an air of old world charm made for a memorable stay. The current refurbishments will only further elevate this special property.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475976857~“Value for money.”~Quiet and friendly hotel that is easy to find. Clean and comfortable rooms with blackout curtains and quiet. Wifi was great. Helpful desk staff . Checked in vet Kate and staff were extremely helpful. Ample parking. Close to Kingston and the foreshore.~5~5~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_475857103~“A luxurious time to relax”~Not one complaint . The bed was perfect. The meal was delicious. Great staff. Quiet and peaceful. The spa was amazing. Having Wi-Fi is excellent and the smart t.v. with foxtel channels was a nice surprise~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475697898~“Perfect overnight stay”~Great service, helpful staff, clean and tidy rooms. Relaxing atrium to read a book and enjoy a drink, or play a few board games with the kids.  Happy hour was a bonus, we did the evening meal in the hotel as been travelling which was great and very reasonably priced.  Negatives was an outside pool and that was shut for winter.  Breakfast hot buffet was perfect to set us up for the day, especially as we have unfillable teenagers.  Would stay again.~5~3~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475674280~“Old but comfortable”~Older hotel a bit dated and rather tired around the edges, but was being refitted during our stay. Very clean and comfortable with everything you need for a reasonable price. Note it is located on a fairly major intersection so there can be some traffic noise. Secure basement parking is free which is rare in Canberra. Checkout was problematic - polite staff confused bills and we were overcharged but that was cheerfully corrected after some discussion.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_475396507~“Hotel with a B & B feel”~We love staying here. The atmosphere is warm and intimate and yet the service is highly professional. The chess board was a winner. For my daughter. The meals were lovely. I like having a balcony as I love fresh air so that is a great feature. The smell from the Reno was a bit of a problem as we got headaches from the fumes but the rooms were comfortable.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_474008166~“sleeping on a cloud”~We had a twin room with one queen and one single bed. The linen was lovely and the beds superbly comfortable. The ensuite and furnishings were modest but very clean and fresh. There is a wonderful lounge/eating area with shelves of books of all kinds and the food is delicious. We really enjoyed our stay.~4~4~4~5~4~4~4~nan
review_473970095~“Weekend in ACT”~Just what we need when we stay in Canberra. Close to Manuka, the Kingston Market and most other attractions around Canberra. We normally attend a sporting event at the AIS in December and find the Diplomat well located between the AIS and Canberra Airport.~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_473935635~“Clean and comfortable”~Close to all Canberra has to offer very clean and comfortable  Would have liked a nice coffee in the morning ! In stead of instant and maybe a good quaility coffee house coffee like penny university which we found on the corner of Wentworth and Giles! Great~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473930739~“Tired but Friendly”~The hotel is very tired and I need of total refurb (I think may be ubderway). That said the staff were VERY friendly and helpful dealing with issues as they arise and making me feel welcome. My room was dirty when I checked in but when I 'complained'I was immediately upgraded to a suite which was an appreciated gesture. Bed comfortable and shower powerful and hot. Furniture old and worn, decir dated and paint peeling. Breakfast was a good buffet style affair. Food for dinner was average - focus was more on quantity than quality food. If the hotel was refurbished it could be stunning (as I suspect it once was) but st present it is passed its best. Best asset we're the staff who I couldn't have been more friendly or done more for me. Thanks guys.~3~3~4~4~3~2~4~nan
review_473912407~“Great venue will definitely stay again”~After finishing my marathon the lady at reception was so kind letting us stay a passed our check out time so I could shower then offering to make coffee for me for the drive home definitely surprise and delight thank you~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473681619~“It's ok I guess.”~Reception was friendly. Rooms are fairly generous in size. Very outdated hotel.  If having breakfast there make sure they have enough of everything before paying $25 pp. As we were left not getting what we specifically wanted.  ~3~3~3~3~3~4~3~nan
review_473172579~“Great place to stay”~Room was clean and tidy with lots of room and had secure underground parking   and the bar and food area was nice and enjoyable the staff were very helpful and understanding in getting me my room back for 1 extra night after I checked out and need to stay in Canberra for 1 more night and gave me the same price I got if for first night  ~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472579077~“Great hotel - lovely feel”~Lovely feel. Great lounge area with bar, and fun happy hour. Large rooms, functional clean bathroom. Very reasonable price. Close to Manuka and Kingston for restaurants.  Very welcoming and helpful staff.~4~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472542842~“Friendly place to stay”~I have stayed here often because it is comfortable and close to all major attractions, venues, etc. You are always made welcome and the little touches like fruit bowls and newspapers available make it a pleasant experience.~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_472270015~“Friendly and welcoming reception”~Had a weekend with friends. The front staff at the desk were very friendly and welcoming. The beds were comfortable. The place is a little tired but I am sure they are in the middle of renovations but you would not have known this as there was no disruption. They have a restaurant at the motel. We did not eat there as we had already arranged another venue for our get together. It is an easy drive to the City centre and close to the Markets which were great. Good experience.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_471753571~“Review by M. Berry”~Whilst we enjoyed the comfort of the King Bed, there was very limited shelf space for clothes and I was forced to lay my clothes out on the board room table! We also found there was limited shelf space in the bathroom~3~3~4~5~3~4~4~nan
review_471483114~“Overnighter”~Was comfortable and good service checking in. Music at dinner was a pleasing distraction away from a day of business travels. Hotel is getting at the point I would say in the need of a makeover but seemed clean and value for money. Rates was $290 compared to $460 average. My tip don't travel if the politicians are in town accomodation rates go thru the roof. If you want 5 star then you would suggest this was a tired 4 star but it depends on your attitude and expectations. Its a roof over the head and safe,clean and being Canberra close to everything.~4~4~4~3~3~3~4~nan
review_470514758~“Incredible service but in an aging hotel”~The staff were a standout here. Efficient and professional throughout, they were also very warm and friendly. It's a shame that the hotel feels so aged, however good to see this is in the process of being rectified.~3~4~3~4~2~4~5~nan
review_470113107~“Amazing service”~Didn't get to spend long here, but they looked after us so well. Wish we could have used the facilities a bit more as they looked very nice and welcoming. They knew our group was leaving on an early hot air balloon ride and they even gave us little gift bags to prepare. great attention to detail.~4~4~nan~4~4~4~5~nan
review_469925975~“Very clean & nice restaurant”~I've stayed here for many years but have recently come back as it was getting quite expensive. I found you can get a good deal online with some of the hotel sites. The atrium restaurant is very nice and the staff are very pleasant and friendly. The room is spacious and comfortable and most importantly very clean.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468631155~“Great service at small hotel with character”~We stayed for a night with the kids & it was perfect for us. The hotel is a bit run down but had a lot of character which we all enjoyed. Staff were lovely & accommodating. The meals were good & the kids loved the dinosaurs displayed between the floors!~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_468482648~“Comfortable and Quiet”~It started with a lovely receptionist to check us in and it was such an easy process. Parking was free which was even better. Hot buffet breakfast was in the deal too and this was a big improvement on the continental breakfast on offer in other hotels. Cost was great value, room clean and modern with good tv reception across a good channel selection on the hd tv. Plenty of room in the suite with table and chairs for an in room dining experience. We loved the ground floor reading area complete with books and mags. Also the happy hour with half price drinks was popular too.. Would happily stay again. The dinosaurs were an interesting addition to the decor too..~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468225276~“Poor”~It was very noisy because of undergoing renovations (no information about it). We ordered a room with balcony and there was no balcony but the roof of the entrance area in front of our window towards a noisy street.~2~3~3~2~2~3~3~nan
review_468207021~“Comfortable hotel on public transport route for city”~Hotel was clean and comfortable, slightly dated. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Book library was a nice touch and treat table was too tempting. Only criticism was that there was no safe in room.~5~4~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468205764~“Great place to stay in the heart if Canberra”~Welcoming staff upon arrival, comfortable & quiet room (except for the TV being left to automatically blast the unsuspecting guest awake at stupid o'clock in the morning!), super attentive staff & delicious food from the restaurant...all in a central location~4~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_468196257~“Diplomat Hotel”~Good location for what we wanted to do and see. Staff very friendly whilst we were there and very helpful on our arrival with the location of restaurants shops etc. Room was good and the bed provided a good nights sleep The only irritation was the lack of milk for our coffee /tea on the second day~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_467049999~“Nice hotel in need of some TLC”~Cons: Carpets and furniture in general require an update. Nice building structure in need of some reno to modernise it. Pros: Super friendly staff and a very convenient location as well as free parking.~3~4~5~4~3~4~5~nan
review_467006542~“Old hotel good service”~The hotel is away from shops but central for commuting to most parts of Canberra. Hotel is about to be refurbished so it should rate higher in the future. Staff were quick to accommodate my requests. Bed was comfortable.~3~4~3~4~3~4~5~nan
review_466646777~“A great place to stay”~We stay here every time we visit Canberra , clean friendly staff lots of extras you don't see in other hotels and the best pillows. Beds are comfortable quiet location nice pool if you visit in the summer 24hr service.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466626660~“looking tired.”~needs to be refreshed ..looking very tired, stayed there a couple of years ago and you could notice the difference this time, good location but needs to be modernised., rooms are a good size and beds were comfortable, just needs a coat of paint.~3~3~4~3~3~3~nan~nan
review_466494807~“Diplomat average”~Booking.com indicated reduced tariff for 2 nights but only 1 night was at the discount price. Dinner and breakfast were good value. Bathroom could do with a refitting. Older building was good for noise reduction with nice thick walls.~3~3~4~2~4~4~3~nan
review_466383590~“Canberra stay”~Very helpful staff. Decore is a little tied. Good location. Good on site free parking. Restaurant has a limited menu but the food is good value and tastes great. Bar has a happy hour with half price drinks which are not that badly priced anyway.~4~4~5~3~3~4~5~nan
review_466354893~“Friendly service, clean and comfortable”~Great friendly service, clean and reasonably comfortable. I wouldnt recommend the food or coffee. The decor is in need of a major update as the name Diplomat and the style do not go hand in hand. It felt more like Id walked into a council library.~3~3~4~4~3~4~5~nan
review_465702511~“Very neat and clean hotel”~A great hotel for the price. Lovely gardens, easy parking. Rooms clean and spacious. A very lovely central atrium. Staff friendly. Loved the jelly beans near the newspapers! Good breakfast buffet. Soft clean bed.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_464841400~“Comfort and clean”~Worth every $$$ nice and clean and room for the kids. Bathroom had shower and bath so u could relax. Had a great night sleep with comfort.

review_464648426~“Water Pressure!!!”~Service and staff at this hotel are very friendly and efficient. Parking is great and very convenient. Rooms are large and have ample space for whatever your into. Tv is good and has a few movie channels. Furniture and decor are very dated and need a refresh, was pretty happy to give this place 3 stars however, the water pressure in the showers is unbelievable and i had to give them another star for that alone. All in all pretty decent value for the price but wont blow your mind.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463659770~“Good location, poor service!!”~We were disappointed with this hotel.  Book via online sites for best deals. Room service is advertised as available to 9:30pm. I was refused room service at 9pm.  Rooms are very hot, air conditioning is poor and the noise from neighbouring Go Kart centre  can be loud at night. Shower pressure is great and rooms were very clean.~2~3~5~2~3~5~1~nan
review_463088763~“Room 3017”~The room was nice, the Reception staff were great and the food was nice. The only thing was is the Hair dryer was ineffective and there needs to be another seat so that 2 people can sit out on the Balcony.~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_463082641~“Short stay”~The staff were friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was delicious The king size bed was clean and comfortable as was our room. We would definitely return to this hotel in the future. Ample parking.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463064493~“A little past it's use by date”~The hotel is well located near Kingston and Manuka however it is in need of refurbishment. The rooms were noisy and neighbours could be heard easily. The breakfast was basic but OK. There was also a half empty bottle of water in the refridgerator. Probably a little too expensive for what you get.~3~3~3~2~3~3~4~nan
review_462550693~“The staff was exceptional, food amazing”~My partner and I were celebrating our anniversary and saw the reviews on the diplomat, and heard friends rave about the food. So I went in two nights prior to see what I could do to enhance the night. After speaking with Casey at reception and Juana the restaurant manager, who were extremely friendly and approachable, I had my night sorted.  Come our anniversary, they treated us like royalty, laying out my table exactly as I wanted, and making sure our evening was as romantic and pleasant as possible. The food was some of the best I've eaten at a restaurant, and my partner agreed!  Would definitely eat here again, and looking forward to trying their king spa suite.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461336627~“My home away from home”~The Diplomat is my home away from home for ACT business trips. Between the excellent service, comfortable rooms and tasty meals I look forward to my returns after a busy day. Meals can be enjoyed privately via the punctual and courteous room service or in the friendly atmosphere of Booked, the on-site restaurant. Centrally located with ample parking, the Diplomat provides a quiet space for working and relaxing.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461291279~“Great place - very convenient”~Great place with excellent facilities and very polite staff. Beds very comfy. Would happily staff here again in the future. Loved the open staff and the lounge areas to sit around with friends. Excellent!!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461278761~“Great hotel - Super comfy beds!”~We stay at the Diplomat from time to time when visiting family. It's convenient for us, the staff are friendly and helpful and the beds are really comfortable. Rooms are spacious and the hotel is has a lovely dining and relaxing area in the atrium in the middle.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461264052~“A Beautiful Weekend”~This is our fourth stay as we like the relaxed atmosphere and the excellent service. The rooms are well presented and the atrium provides a relaxed place to eat, drink and relax. Its position to the restaurants of Manuka and Kingston foreshores makes it ideal for foody lovers.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461256588~“Great Value for money”~We have stayed here many times over the years and keep coming back as it's great value for money,great central location and usually quiet.The bar and restaurant are never too busy and noisy and a great meeting place for friends and family~4~5~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_460528471~“Over priced and under whelmed.”~Wether it's supply & demand due to Parliament or not but at $375 for one night in a aged room is absurd. Not all of us have the Tax payers picking up the bills and to charge that is nothing short of robbery. Yes the staff pleasant & helpful and the surrounds are nice but for that price I didn't have anyone tuck me into bed let alone spooned with me all night....which thinking about it at that price I probably could of found a service that could have provided that. I hate being taken advantage of and in this case myself along with the other 11 work colleagues that stayed the same night where taken for a ride. I can sleep well at night I hope you can and if so try the bed in 2015 it will keep you awake as it's that old it was like a hammock but that's another story for later....~3~1~4~1~3~3~4~nan
review_460259733~“Lovely staff and hotel!”~Stayed for a weekend, was easy to come and go as we pleased, staff were attentive and helpful. Loved that the candles they burned were available to purchase!! Would definitely recommend to others to try out!!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459841148~“Friendly and Good Location”~We found the staff friendly and efficient. The room was a good size but the bed was very soft and lacked support. The location is very good and if you're up for it, within walking distance of Kingston and Manuka and the great facilities at the Griffith Shops.  All in all a good stay~4~4~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_459792210~“It's so much about the people!”~I tried somewhere different on my last visit to Canberra, just for a change, and hated it. It was nice to be back at the Diplomat, it's nothing super flash, but the staff are lovely and friendly, you feel safe, it's clean and tidy. And the steak...fantastic!! Felt like coming home.~4~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_459014843~“Very comfortable, staff were lovely!”~We stayed in the twin room with two double beds. Beds were very comfortable. The room was a good size. It was nice to be able to sit in the sofas next to the bar and have bar snacks and a drink. Would stay again.~5~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_458866089~“Friendly, comfortable place to stay, very close to Canberra railway station”~I spent three nights at the Diplomat Hotel in January. I travelled into Canberra on the rail link bus from Yass Junction (having taken the XPT from Melbourne) and was leaving by train for Sydney so wanted to be close to the station and this is, just a five minute walk. The hotel looks to be mid 70s but everything was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. In terms of getting around without a car, the bus network is pretty good in Canberra and there is a stop close by. On Sundays, there are a lot fewer buses so you need to walk another five - ten minutes to the shops at Kingston. The hotel is only about ten - fifteen minutes walk from the famous Sunday Old Bus Depot Markets. While in Canberra, I visited both the current and old Parliaments (the old one is the Museum of Democracy). Both are a short walk from the Barton Bus Station, served by direct bus from the stop close to the hotel on weekdays and Kingston shops on Sundays. When you first do this, make sure you ask the driver to tell you when you have arrived as, like me, you might be expecting Barton Bus Station to be something bigger than it actually is. Breakfast at the hotel was good, as was dinner the time I eat there too. The restaurant is closed on Sunday evenings but there are several places to eat at Kingston shops. Happy Hour between 5 and 6PM is half price beers and they have a good range, including several changing craft ones. I enjoyed my stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_458841127~“Great Weekend Getaway ”~Staid here with the frankly for 2 nights. Check in was easy. Undercover parking complimentary. Breakfast was basic but good. Room was clean and spacious. Pool facilities were great. Not a large pool, but had all the accessories you need to be in the pool kids (floaties, noodles, etc). Very friendly staff. Had diner at the restaurant and the service was a bit slow, but we were told about this before we wet even seated and as a thank you for our patience, all the drinks were complementary.  Would defiantly come back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458785036~“Girls Getaway”~Great central location with friendly staff and very homely atmosphere. Rooms are a good size with plenty of room. Good secure undercover parking which was free and easily accessible. We booked 3 twin rooms and each room had a Queen Bed and single which were comfortable. Only downside was that one of the Queen beds sheets hadn't been changed but overall would definitely go back to stay. ~4~4~4~4~5~3~4~nan
review_458517132~“Unique hotel”~This is a very unusual hotel. It's like a cross between an old-time country town motel (they still use actual room keys!) and a quirky QT-style hotel.  They have books - loads of books - games, communal TVs for watching sport,  free fruit, and dinosaurs. The staff are great. The restaurant was surprisingly good for dinner (breakfast - not so much). Highly recommended if you want to try something different in Canberra.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_457500635~“Tired but affordable”~Hotel needs renovating but the staff are very helpful. Good beds and great position. Enjoyed our stay but the hotel is very tired Children would enjoy this place as it seems to cater for them with games and books~3~4~5~4~3~3~3~nan

review_456037786~“Okay stay.”~Overall a okay stay, good value, nothing too bad, but nothing too great either. Room was large and bed was reasonably comfortable. Loud noises from kitchen/dining area was a bit disappointing. Good location - very close to public transport busses and trains.~3~3~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_454387732~“I will be most certainly be back.”~Yes, this hotel has seen grander days, but it absolutely provides value for money. The staff were outstanding. Unlike most hotels these days, I couldn't hear a thing once the door to our room was closed. Free underground parking, free Wi-Fi, books and board games in the common area downstairs, a sauna and pool, and an in-house restaurant and bar. What more could we need? Our suite included a spa and air conditioning in both rooms. I have CRPS, so these added comforts ensured that I felt rested and pampered after long days exploring Canberra. The bed was comfy and the sheets were crisp and fresh. I was happy to have an option to refuse housekeeping in order to receive a 10 dollar food voucher as well. Smart!~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454120515~“Weekend Stay @ the Diplomat Hotel Canberra”~Thank you for the opportunity to offer feedback on our stay over the weekend past. Initially we did find that the images of the room gave the impression of a larger room and it did feel tight. There is most probably no need for three chairs around the corner table. The balcony and screen door could have done with a sweep. Other than that your staff are amazing! gracious, courteous, friendly.. they ticked all the boxes and then some more!! If a hotel received its STARS based on service and staff - you would definitely be a 5 Star + My daughter loved the pool and I have to say that this was very well maintained and kept. We found the hotel to be quaint, different and our stay was pleasant!  Will we be back or recommend the Diplomat? ... most certainly!!!~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_452208053~“Excellent Weekend Retreat”~The staff were very friendly and helpful, the food in Booked Restaurant very good and the dinner was excellent especially the steak. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well appointed. We will definitely be back. Lollies in the lobby were a BONUS.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451858104~“Just want we needed”~Travelling to Perisher Valley from Sydney, stopping in Canberra makes the drive much more enjoyable. the hotel is abit aged with some serviced such as the gym, pool and sauna well past prime. the lobby was beautiful and although we didn't use it, the restaurant looked pretty good considering how most hotel restaurants go. the rooms were fine, just what was needed for a good nights sleep. The rooms stayed warm and pleasant through the cold winter night. would highly recommend for both long and short stays.~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_451549928~“A little disappointed”~This hotel used to be magnificent, but has since fallen on hard times. We stayed here four years ago, and more recently this month. Difficult to book a queen room only - really squeezed to choose queen single room (even though I suspect there were some available; not very romantic for couples). This room was cramped, I couldn't move around because of the large dining area, kept hitting my leg on the corner of the bed and chair. Leather chair was worn and pinches your bum when you sit. Not enough space for the large furniture in this room. (Complete different experience to four years ago when we were in a queen room, lots of space...) Carpet worn, lift looking tardy. Pool area has seen better days. Generally the hotel looks very tired. For the money you pay, you definitely need to look for other options.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451389572~“worth a stay”~Excellent staff, very clean yes I use a white tissue and check everything as well we had a basic room that was large and had a decent bathroom. Crispy clean sheets!Restaurant meals we had were very nice and value for money. Close to rail and local buses .five minute drive to city. Don't be put off by the hotels few rough edges due to age it is a good place to stay.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451102567~“Summernats Weekend”~Lovely foyer - sat and watched TV for a little relief from the heat outside. Clean and comfortable rooms. Used the swimming pool, which was not overcrowded. Secure undercover carpark was excellent. Staff very friendly and attentive. Enjoyed our stay.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450577550~“Happy to stay again”~This is the second time we have stayed here and will be happy to stay again. The rooms are quiet and large compared to other hotel rooms. Plenty of bench space in the bathroom which is handy. Rooms were clean and serviced well. Free parking is a bonus in Canberra. Also free wifi. Unfortunately the lifts were not working for a few days of a our stay and so on checking out we needed to carry our luggage down the stairs. My only disappointment was being charged $10 to pay by mastercard which I wasn't aware of until I checked my bank statement. No mention of the charge was made on check in and no alternative payment options were suggested. I didn't even know that payment had been taken. When people are budgeting down to their last dollar or searching for the cheapest rates, this might make all the difference. Other than that it was a great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_450536985~“Easy Family Accomodation”~We rocked up to the Diplomat after camping on the Sapphire Coast and were greeted warmly. There was parking space for our trailer, a family friendly lobby with games and books and a pool to relax in. We will try to return here. The location is convenient to Manuka shops for food, shopping and coffee. It's a nice morning stroll to the lake front for early morning coffee and a short car/bus ride to the the Galleries and Questacon. An added bonus was being able to leave our trailer in the under-building car park whilst we took in the sights the day after our stay.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_449353797~“Very Comfortable”~The only thing that let this hotel down was the housekeeping but other than that we had an excellent stay here and would go back again. On arrival, and throughout our stay, the front-of-house staff were so welcoming, polite, interested, and very helpful, especially the lovely young man on the afternoon shift - Casey, I believe his name is. This young man has a very bright future. I do hope his employers recognise the value he adds to their business. The hotel is situated in a good place with easy access to the city and beyond. Our bed was very comfy. I usually hate hotel beds as they are like sleeping on a concrete block. Not so at The Diplomat. The bed was not too soft and not too hard. Just lovely. Overall, I would give this hotel a 9 out of 10, with the housekeeping letting it down.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_449072210~“New Year's Eve”~One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!! Staff were outstanding - efficient, friendly and accomodating. Very happy that I got an upgrade.  Handing having a nice restaurant and bar Available.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_448755741~“Exellent and very comfortable hotel, great location”~The Diplomat Hotel is in an excellent location, you can walk to the restaurants and cafes of nearby Kingston and Manuka along Canberra's tree-lined streets. The rooms are of a good size, the beds were excellent, there is free wifi, coffe and tea making facilities and the usual bathroom requisites. the hotel has a very pleasant and atmospheric atrium, with many bookshelves and cozy lounges - it feels almost like you are a guest in somebody's house. There is an outside pool, sauna and fitness room. The staff were very helpful and efficient. The breakfast was adequate although perhaps not outstanding. What were no cold cuts and cheese, something overseas visitors from Europe might have expected. Otherwise, highly recommended, a very pleasant experience.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_448375859~“Outstanding staff. Comfortable stay”~This is now our third stay at Diplomat in three years. It won't be our last. We travelled this time with our two girls - 2 and 5 year olds, and stayed in a spa king suite. I would recommend them - they are spacious with a separate bedroom. Dining table, coffee table, lounge suite, two tvs and a bath - which is what we need as a family. The king bed is a bonus... little on the soft side for me but I'm fussy. Love the choice of pillows - they have a pillow room where you can choose the perfect one! We also stay here for the pool - it was perfect for the hot weather we just had while we were in Canberra. There are pool noodles, and a few chairs (would love to see a couple more recliner type chairs though :-) ) There is also a gym with treadmill, cross trainer, etc and sauna. Car parking is included in the cost of the stay - also an added bonus because a number of places we have looked at to stay charge extra. The location is great - short drive to Parliament House and Questacon. Next time we stay we will bring our bike child trailer (there are adult bikes for hire at the hotel) and take a ride along the Kingston Foreshore (we didn't realise how close we were to the lake!). There's also restaurants a very short drive away (if you want to use somewhere other than the Diplomat) at Manuka and Kingston. We also love staying here for the breakfast. Always delicious with lots of variety - juices, fruit, cereal, lots of hot food variety.... And if they don't have the eggs you want - you just order them and chef cooks them on the spot. We also had dinner here one night - the girls loved their kids meals, and good variety for us adults to choose from... We also took advantage of the guest laundry this time - quick laundering meant that we got to go home from our holidays without having to do a tonne of washing :-) We also had the added advantage of being on the third floor looking towards the lake when the 9pm fireworks went off on New Years Eve... couldn't see heaps but we did get a bit of a view! :-) You need to be aware that it is a slightly older hotel, and I believe that renovations are coming. But some of the rooms do need a face lift. We actually were very unlucky with the room we stayed in. I was tempted to give the stay four stars this time. There were a couple of issues (which we have never experienced before). I believe that a number of the issues compounded on each other.... So why the five stars then? The staff at this hotel are outstanding and a true credit to the Diplomat! They went above and beyond to rectify the issues, we had staff members doing all they could to firstly correct the issues, then compensate for them. We were inconvenienced, but were very impressed with all that was done. Special mention to the reception staff - Kasey and Sharon. Both of these women did a brilliant job in coordinating housekeeping and maintenance. Nothing was ever too much trouble for either of them. They were courteous, helpful and do a brilliant job in supporting their customers. Scarlett and Melina were incredible wait staff. Again - nothing was ever too much trouble. They were attentive and also recognised my children and addressed special needs they had due to their age. And finally Nathan did a great job as the front end manager. We loved our stay. We hope that the new renovations include the kitchenette with cooking facilities that our room had - there's only two of them at the moment and they are perfect for travelling families!!! Fridge, plates, cutlery, hot plate, microwave.... yes please Diplomat - more of these!!! :-) Looking forward to returning again :-)~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_448149984~“Comfortable ”~Stayed for 2 nights on a business trip and found this hotel to be very comfortable. All staff were welcoming and friendly.  The rooms are fine with a mini bar, flatscreen TV, tea & coffee facilities and a small balcony. There is also free undercover parking.  I did find the layout in the bar/restaurant area to be a little bizarre and quite disjointed, but that's just my opinion. The food was great with generous portion sizes and great value for money.  The hotel is quite a distance from the city so there didn't appear to be much around within walking distance, but all in all a comfortable stay for a couple of nights.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447617845~“Value for money”~Great place to stay rooms are Clean and spacious. We had dinner in the Restaurant was good value meals were large and tasty. Staff are very friendly and helpful. There is plenty of parking. Great pool.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446960210~“Lovely staff”~Staff were very helpful and friendly. Value for money with a family of 5. We were disappointed with the lack of hot food for the buffet breakfast, but it was Boxing Day. Rooms are clean with comfortable beds. Loved the area for Christmas photos! Great idea~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_446846215~“Pleasant Surprise”~We were a bit worried that the price was so good that there must be something wrong. We could fault nothing. The accommodation, the cleanliness, the staff, the ambience, the location. If you want fantastic value, a very warm welcome and everything you could possibly need stay here. A really exceptional note.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445699639~“Friendly and Welcoming”~We stayed at the Diplomat in Canberra for 3 nights and were impressed by the Friendly, Professional staff. The Breakfast in Provided were really good, fresh food with a great selection, certainly didn't have that assembly line or packaged food feel. The room was clean and, although small, well organised with a comfortable bed.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_445415266~“JR ”~Excellent hotel. Rates are very reasonable. Rooms very clean and well maintained. Close to major attractions and good eateries. Staff are fantastic and very professional. Great place to stay. Ideal for families. Room service was great. Very reasonably priced food in the restaurant.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445403508~“Second Try, mostly good”~We love the character of this place, the feel is fantastic, she may be a bit tired but she has warmth. That being said some attention to details would be helpful. The last time we stayed I made a comment on the shower over the bath being rather difficult to manage, management responded by advising that they also have rooms with straight showers which can be requested which we did and found to be fine. The "wobbly: seat of the toilet was one of those little things that needed attention. Room service forgot to clean up the coffee cups or give us some more milk (easily fixed) and I would love it if they could add a coffee plunger and some real coffee! We go to Canberra 4 to 5 times a year as our daughter is at Uni there and have tried many hotels with diverse results and this is one of two within this price point that we are happy to use again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_443694618~“A shame but the Diplomat is a tired old lady !”~We have stayed at the Diplomat many times over the years - the staff are lovely, the rooms are a decent size, the location is fantastic especially if you want to visit the Art Gallery etc plus the breakfast is always nice BUT after our last stay we were extremely disappointed how the hotel was so run down - worn carpet in all areas, dirty chairs in the restaurant and the lounge in our room was ready for the garbage tip. We mentioned our disappointment to reception when leaving and we were told that a refurbishment was planned. PLEASE management refurbish as a matter of urgency otherwise you will lose many loyal patrons like us who have always loved the Diplomat !~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_442986425~“Welcoming and comfortable”~I stayed here for a few days and it was my first stay at the Diplomat Hotel. The staff was welcoming, and one of the nice touches was the chilled water and confectionary near the reception desk (I had my hand in the jar a lot!). I also like the free wi-fi, thank you.  The room was very comfortable, and I could have slept in the bed all day! But alas I had to go to work. If you don't have a car, you'll need a taxi (or hitchhike) to get to nearby eateries in Manuka. Talking about taxis, I was impressed by the promptness of the taxi arriving just minutes after hotel staff kindly booked for me. The hotel has room service but I didn't need to utilize it, but still, good to know it was there. Just some things...the wall insulation could be improved, as I could hear a guest sneezing in adjoining room. The bathroom lights was a bit quaint, with lightbulbs around the window (sort of like a dressing room). It took awhile for the lights to reach capacity in the bathroom. I think the lights need to be more modern in the bathroom.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_442480473~“Great stay”~This was one of the best hotels we stayed in on our holidays. Bonus of $10 if you don't have yr room cleaned, used the vouchers to come of our food, drinks..... Thanks guys for a great stay, staff are helpful, kind and go out of there way to help.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442287517~“Interesting place”~Upon first glance i wasnt overly happy considering the price we paid BUT it was a very busy weekend so assume it was peak rates.  The 2 important things (bed and shower) were AMAZING. Interesting toiletries- the usual shampoo and whatevz but also shoe shine? And makeup remover wipes? Cute i thought. Decor tired and damaged but clean and tiny. Awesome little bar with a good range of beer/wine and HALF PRICE happy hour! Food at the restaurant not great but the service was excellent. Despite seeing a lot of guests going to and from room ( including a bunch of youngins i assume were there for the music fest) it was so quiet. Breakfast was pretty great too. Didnt get to check out the gym of pool. All round quite an enjoyable stay!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441670256~“Welcoming Hotel”~Not having been to Canberra since I was 10 and needing to find somewhere close to Parliament House we stumbled upon this little gem. This hotel had it all.  The staff were amazing (although the bar lady had her moments with dinner guests and drinks) Apart from that the staff didn't charge for a couple of photocopies, were helpful with information and basically anything you could want. They accomodated a dinner on a Sunday night for approx. 40 (and they don't normally open) which was wonderful! The meals in the hotel were quite good and the dining room a little quirky. Plenty of relaxing in the bar area with couches, tables, tv and games. The rooms were spacious and clean and offered a $10.00 voucher for a meal or drinks if you didn't want the room cleaned! I thought this was a fabulous idea and more hotels should take this on board. Well Done Diplomat. I am sure next time I have to book a hotel in Canberra, I will make sure you are high on the list.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_440402980~“Quiet and clean Hotel”~We stayed as a family of 5 (three kids under 8 years) for a family event nearby. Room was spacious, clean and had everything you'd see at a hotel. Obviously this hotel is a little older than most in the area, but was price competitive and we will be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439643445~“Relaxed Comfort”~The Diplomat delivers both and I also received a great deal on the room online. The food is great and the serves are generous. I rate the happy hour bar prices too. No getting hit for paid parking here either and plenty of room for larger vehicles ie. 4WD and trailers. Unsure if I missed it last time but the hotel's 'Green, incentive (declining a daily room clean/towel change) also puts $$ back into pocket - highly recommended. So good I stayed here again twice more in November!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439173224~“Outdated and tired but clean”~Large room but very old and in need of update. Bathroom 60s style very tiny shower but water was hot. Took about 15 pumps to get enough body wash or shampoo for one application. No conditioner. Meals basic. Coffee tasty but consistently cold!  Staff helpful and friendly but not always easy to understand. Easy parking no shops in easy walking distance. Air con works well.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438648454~“Quirky, friendly, great value for money”~Such a lovely hotel, conveniently out of town, yet close enough to all the "must-see" attractions. The rooms were so much bigger than we were expecting. so many positives - breakfast and dinner were great, the happy hour after a day of sightseeing was brilliant! Special little touches such as the lemon water dispenser and lollies in the foyer, free newspapers, the use of their computer and printer and the books and board games all added up to a very enjoyable stay.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_433339190~“Massive rooms, a little quirky”~We stayed for 2 nights in a standard twin room. The room was huge, much bigger than standard modern hotels. Carpet seemed new, and it was all really clean. I quite liked all the little quirks in the main atrium/ foyer/ dining area. The arm chairs, books, games, random dinosaurs! Parking, wifi and breakfast were all included and the rate was very reasonable. Breakfast had everything you could want. We had a look at the pool but it was a bit cold for a swim. I think the "gym" is a slight exaggeration but we didn't need it so it didn't matter. All the staff were lovely. Location wise it is slightly out of the centre, but an easy walk to Kingston restaurants, and I always find you need to drive in Canberra anyhow so it wasn't an issue. Overall we would definitely stay again. So much more personality than your normal city hotels. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432554619~“Comfortable stay”~Rooms were large. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Restaurant was convenient and tastey. Meal Prices were competitive. Parking was provided for free. Location central to most of Canberras attractions. Complimentary magazines.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_432279142~“A great motel but guests need own transport”~Deluxe Rooms were spacious, well appointed, and reasonably quiet. Guide lights on switches and press button door handles were a great innovation to help us find our way in the dark but had a 'treasure hunt' for the bedside light switches! A lack of communication first placed us in a room with with a shower over bath en-suite which was difficult to negotiate and towels were hard to reach for short people. When The friendly staff were aware of our needs another room became available with just a shower recess. The breakfast and dining room was convenient, food was well prepared and tastefully presented. Compliments for the well thought out display and variety of buffet breakfast food. The only drawback was the closed dining room on Sunday as no other eateries were nearby. A real inconvenience for guests with no vehicle.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_431380593~“deserves 'good rating' as better than average but not quite very good (so stick another rating in guys)”~hotel somewhat tired and our room was very dark because of small window and large bushes and tree growing right in front of it (I guess this is a 'good deal room' - shame we weren't given something better as the hotel didn't seem full at all. A relative staying at the same time had a much better room). Staff pleasant and breakfast quite good but restaurant wasn't open Sunday evening! Their $10 reward for not having the room seviced does NOT apply if you have a room/breakfast deal - how pathetic! The relaxing lounge area is very pleasant~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_431016183~“Friendy Hotel with lovely staff and large comfortable room”~The restaurant staff at the diplomat were really helpful and friendly. We had a great dinner on our first night and breakfast on both mornings.. the cold breakfast on the second morning was more than adequate with a range of cereals but the winner for me was the nut and fruit filled Muesli which I was told was from a local provider..  Parking was so easy and close to the lift to the room. Will definitely stay there next time we visit. We visited the Australian Museum which had an exhibition of Artifacts from the British Museum.. There is a wonderful App of the exhibition "The Loop" if this is still on in the museum it is well worth seeing. Café restaurant area in Kingston is very close to the hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
