review_478345066~“Great location, engaged staff but very tired hotel in need of attention”~We travelled to Sydney over Easter and stayed here because of its excellent location. We booked online using Booking.com and got a good rate. We stayed in a room with two double beds.  The beds were comfortable, the pillows were a little lumpy, they had seen many nights of use. The paint work was scuffed with marks on the wall. The television was difficult to control, the buttons on the remote had been pushed too many times. The bathroom has new tiles on the floor and tap ware but no hiding it is an old bathroom, with a step in bath / shower. They do courage express check out as they are popular with bus tours and want to ensure good flow in the morning. Not sure we will stay there until it is refurbished. There are better options for the price.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_463876250~“Excellent hotel”~We stayed for two nights in this hotel following a cruise from San Fransisco to Sydney. On arrival at just after 8am we were offered an upgraded room (at a small cost) which was immediately available. On the top floor, with a panoramic view of the city skyline, the room was bright, airy and spacious. The bathroom was a good size, clean and with a good supply of miniature toiletries. The extra towels requested were brought quickly to the room and the tea and coffee facilities were adequate. Positioned very close to the city's central railway station, the hotel is in a really good position and within walking distance of many of Sydney's main attractions including the opera house, the botanical gardens China Town and Darling Harbour. There was a limited supply of complimentary tea and coffee as well as a well stocked (if expensive) mini bar. Even though extremely busy (the hotel appeared to be the one of choice for airline crew) there was a calm and pleasant atmosphere throughout the hotel. The concierge team was outstanding! Our cases were delivered to our room quickly and before we had completed check in; a member of the team quickly had us booked onto the hop on hop off bus with a stop just around the corner; and they provided excellent assistance with our on- line check in/boarding procedures. Although we didn't use the restaurant or the pool/gym they were available and looked inviting. We would certInly use this hotel again and recommend it to others.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477650065~“Certainly met my needs”~I arrived way early and was offered a Superior Room with a view that was ready for an extra $20 a night. It was a good view too. Yes I might have a few trivial gripes but I won't even bother. It is situated on major bus routes and right beside Central Station. Super easy to get to anywhere I wanted and we went a few different directions. Must say I was impressed with the blackout curtain that could be lowered to keep the moving sun out of the room. Would I stay here again YES.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_477528650~“Needs updating”~Hi all . So this trip to Sydney was due to overseas family visiting and wanting to give them a taste of the big city. We decided on this hotel because of position and pricing. On reflection it was a bad choice. Service was average. Decor left a lot to be desired. It was a dirty hotel. We won't be returning.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476714331~“Not a great experience”~I got to this hotel after the end of a long day only to be given a room that wasn't made up but I found out later that I had been given the wrong room so had to move again. Was put in a room that had been used by a smoker and had a shower cap over the smoke alarm. To say it stunk was an understatement. Not a great experience.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_476253216~“Average, but good location”~I've stayed here several times for work, and the location makes it a good choice, but other than that, there is nothing special about this hotel. The hotel staff here also are not the most pleasant. I wouldn't say they were rude during my last stay, but they just weren't that good either.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_476035668~“Ideal location to see Sydney”~My host at UTS booked this hotel for me. It's so close to the UTS campus.  It's also close the the metro station, China Town, Sydney Harbor, and Hyde Park.  The room is nice. I had a room with the Captain's view of the area that leads to the metro station, China Town, and Hyde Park.  Many airlines use this hotel for their crews.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475767945~“Show”~The overall stay was ok but had some problems.  We checked in early and left our bags with the conceige as we would be away all day and was told that our bags will be in our room when we come back. We arrived back very late and no bags in our room and the sofa bed for the kids was not made up and when it was there was no mattress protector. We also only had two towels instead of four and only one face washer Matt at reception did appolagise but these things shouldn't happen. The room was very clean and breakfast was great both morning. ~3~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_475735589~“Mrs G A Dennis”~1: The hotel was lovely right by central station and near darling harbour. 2: We were greeted by the the staff at reception and show to our room, The only downside I had was the room they gave us looked over the roofs at the back so the view wasn't good but I went to reception and told them I had requested a room with a city view which I had and there was no problem to change us. Nothing was a problem and things were sorted asap lovely staff, and the guys at the concierge desk were more than happy to help out with any trips or beaches we wished to go to. 3: The breakfast is ok but it's more unless the same every morning, I asked if they served fried eyes but that wasn't an option. 4: We will definitely return to this hotel in the future. It will be great when the light rail is up and running from george street to circular quay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475702290~“Great location, friendly staff”~Second time I stayed at this hotel. Staff are always very friendly and welcoming. Great, central location. Easy to get to from the Airport, easy to access the CBD. Love the fact that they have a pillow menu (I love a good feather pillow). Swimming pool a bit underwhelming... Room was clean and bed comfy. Room had a lovely view of the CBD. Will choose this hotel again for any future trips to Sydney.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475687296~“Delighted to have enjoyed an upgrade”~Was delighted upon check-in to find that we were given an upgrade to a Privilege room, despite using a free night I get for being a silver member of the Accor Club. The hotel is very close to Sydney's Central Station. We ate dinner and breakfast in the hotel dining room which was very nice.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475406458~“Great location”~Very close to Central Station and in walking distance to many attractions. Room was clean and confortable and the staff very helpful.

review_475333817~“Great service”~We didn't spend very long in the hotel as we had a very early flight back to London but the staff were fantastic, booked a taxi for us without asking, upgraded our room and couldn't do enough to help. Ideally suited for the airport, the room was large and comfortable and clean.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_475261376~“Absolutely the worst wifi ever”~The Mercure Sydney has one of the slowest wifi speeds I have ever encountered in a first world country. Emails took forever to load and the wifi kept on disconnecting every 5 mins. I was unable to work effectively in the hotel and conference calls were cut off halfway. It is unacceptable in this day and age for a business hotel like the Mercure to have such poor wifi. Will never stay here for business again. Another aspects of the hotel were ok. Simple gym and room. Cleanliness was not a problem. Bed was ok but aircon was loud.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474506945~“Big Welcome”~What a terrific welcome I received on my visit to the Mercure in Sydney. It was the first time that I have stayed there, but the welcome will ensure that I return. Special recognition to Sonia and Matthew on the front desk. I arrived from Shanghai and took the train from Sydney International Airport to Central Station; extremely convenient. It was well before check-in time and I was offered the use of a room to freshen up so that i could get to meetings. It was done without fuss or fanfare, and was greatly appreciated. The Mercure location is great for getting to and from the airport, but just a little out of the way from the central business district. But right on George Street and on the Sydney subway, so getting around was easy. The room met all of the needs. The color scheme was probably a little gaudy; not sure if all rooms are in a mauve/violet color scheme. But that is a very minor distraction from what was a very pleasant stay.  I have tried many of the upmarket hotels in Sydney and most of them are now terribly expensive. I thought that the Mercure was very good value for money and then the welcome reception convinced me that i should return to the Mercure when I'm next in Sydney~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474387528~“Great location”~Very nice rooms and even better location. Food at your door step and public transport very useful.  Staff lovely and the hotel seems to be always humming. Day or night.  bar on floor level very hospitable and not bad priced.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474326069~“Convenient Location”~Room was clean and relatively spacious. Rates were reasonable (booked direct in advance) and staff courteous. The buffet breakfast was delicious. Located close to Central Station in walking distance of main shopping area and Darling Harbour, which has plenty of restaurants and fast food outlets. We walked to Sydney Harbour (bridge, Opera House, Royal Botanics) which is 2.5km away.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474050869~“Good mid-range hotel; OK location”~Hotel was clean, well appointed, and comfortable. Front desk staff was friendly but clueless - they kept confusing our booking with our friends'.

review_473918823~“Great location, small rooms”~The staff are very professional and helpful. The best about this hotel is the location, next to grand central station. The rooms are a bit small, though in a good shape. The gym is tiny, a shame for such a large-sized hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_473765767~“Comfortable stay and close to central station.”~Staying at the Mercure for a holiday to Sydney and I was pleased with my stay. As a accor member I like staying at the Mercure Sydney and I took advantage of the Bed and Breakfast deal offered. I stayed in the city view room, I found the bed comfortable and the view of the city was really good. On level 12 there was little noise from the outside. The hotel is very close to central station which I used to get around Sydney and surroundings with ease. The reception and concierge staff were friendly and welcoming, also helped me with travels around Sydney. The breakfast buffet at Four Elements was very good with there food offerings and there was a separate room for accor members. I would recommend staying at the Mercure and I will say here again in the future.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473722114~“ideal location Central station”~Spent a day in Sydney on return from a cruise. There is covered/underground access pretty much from the door of the Mercure to Central rail station (appreciated this as the weather was showery!) From Central you have easy access to anywhere in Sydney including the domestic and international airports. We were impressed with the rail system, which was fast, clean and frequent. From Mercure to any of our destinations including Art Gallery of NSW, The Rocks, Circular Quay, Opera House, etc was only a couple of minutes with hardly any waiting on platform, at cost of about $2.50 per adult. About $15 and 12 minutes to domestic airport. There was nothing bad to say about the Mercure; service was prompt and efficient, room clean and bed very large and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is worth the extra cost. There were a number of airline flight crews checking in/out when we stayed, a good recommendation for standard of accommodation and customer service. We paid a little extra for a room upgrade to level 13 so had the additional luxury of our own coffee machine and WiFi connection. Concierge was very helpful - in fact all staff deserve a pat on the back, they were lovely.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473716402~“Made our 50th Anniversary Very Special”~When they knew it was our 50th Wedding Anniversary they immediately upgraded us to one of their best rooms, placed a bottle of wine and chocolates with a handwritten card congratulating us in our room and gave us a complimentary drink from the bar. We were very impressed with this level of service. Our room on the 9th floor was large and had city views, breakfast was good as was our dinner in their restaurant- the staff very efficient in all areas. It is in a great spot close to Chinatown and public transport(train station and bus station very close.)~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473332175~“Good”~The hotel is just outside of China town and some of the area feels a bit suspect, but the area actually has a bunch of culture. A 4km walk to the opera house.

review_471937517~“Sort out your IT”~Although I had booked and confirmed in my own name and email address and received confirmation emails to my email in my name, when I arrived at the hotel (Mercure, Sydney) with my wife, the receptionist could not find our booking. A flurry of searching for the paperwork to find the booking number followed and the booking was found - it was in my wife's name (different surname). Now at some time in the past, my wife may have made a booking and used the same home address, but how and why could a booking made months or years later be recorded by the booking system in another person's name and unable to be detected by the surname or email address of the person making the booking?? With the booking found and noting that the reservation had already been paid for (charged to my credit card), the receptionist gave us the room cards in my wife's name and we were told to use her surname for internet access and room charges. So although my wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times this incident at reception caused unnecessary stress. The solution as relayed by the receptionist was that we should always use our own individual Accor Club numbers when booking. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!~2~3~5~5~4~4~3~nan
review_471842874~“Never lets us down”~This remains our Accor hotel of choice in Sydney. It is an easy walk from Central Station, and there was no need for taxis at all even though the free bus that used to run from Central to Circular Quay has ceased to exist. As an Accor Plus member we get good deals, even though prices were very high for this particular weekend – perhaps because there was an Adele concert on? Our room, with two double beds, was roomy and comfortable. Perhaps housekeeping needs a bit of a push – there was no milk at all, and there was an old bobby pin and toenail clipping on the bathroom floor – neither of them ours! As with many hotels these days they are a bit mean with teabags and sugar etc. Yes, when requested they are provided, but it would be so much easier if they were there in the first place. We have stayed here a number of times and will continue to consider it as our first choice when visiting Sydney.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_471158112~“Well managed, central hotel.”~Lovely staff welcoming us on arrival after a long flight from the UK. The offer of an upgrade for just 50 dollars a night was gratefully accepted as we were tired and in need of sleep. The room was huge, a sweeping semi circular window took up half the size of the room, the view was off both side of the road, floor 7 provided silence at night from the traffic below, hence a good sleep. Copious amounts of tea, coffee and milk was provided freely in the room.There was a mini bar, although the prices were high so we didn't use it. There was an iron, ironing board and hairdryer with washing line over the bath .Free wifi in the room made keeping in touch easy. Aircon made for a comfortable temperature in the room during the heat of the day. All staff were pleasant and friendly. The hotel is in walking distance to Paddys Market, a big indoor market where you can buy fresh food stuffs and souvenirs.. Nearby are nice bars for food and drink, McDonalds, and a couple of shopping mals, including Woolworths for if you wanted a carpet picnic as we did..~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_471131233~“Good for the price”~I stayed here one night on business and it is a typical Mercure good clean accomodation  The bar and restaurant weee good and staff courteous  My room was good although a little small but still tucked all the boxes  I guess the only issue was the area  This is st the far end of George st and the rocks and other attractions is about 2.7 k away I took a taxi which wa about 18 to 20 dollars however tube or bus would of been cheaper Still you would be paying a good 150 dollars per night more for staying closer the the attractions  The area looks very lively at night so if you are into the clubs and that this is your cup of tea Overall for me pretty good standard but just wished the room was bigger~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470759991~“Great location”~We stayed here on a Friday night and then again on a Sunday night. This hotel has a great location and was very reasonably priced. Because of our early morning flight we were offered an earlier check in at a deluxe room for $20. We stayed both nights on 12th floors. Both the rooms we stayed at were dated but clean. Because we were only there to sleep due to busy schedule we enjoyed it. The hotel is opposite fast food resturants (McDonald's & KFC) and the train station is right at the door step~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Room was clean and bed comfortable - what more can you ask for. We both had breakfast in the morning which was ok, nothing over the top but adequate. Check out was a breeze, we were double charged for the breakfast but this was rectified after drawing their attention to it by email. We would be more than happy to stay there again, it is conveniently situated and the price was right. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470561759~“Quality brand in just the right place”~I travel frequently for business and have become accustomed to the quality provided by the Accor and particularly the Mercure Hotel brand. Their hotels offer a consistent quality at most destinations and they are usually in just the right place. The Mercure in Sydney is located at the top end of George Street near Central Station. Easy access to public transport, easy to drive too and park and very near to some great restaurants and quick eats. Try Kensington Lane.  While the quality remains this way I will continue to choose this brand.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_470448932~“Central spot”~Hotel was comfortable and staff were pleasant and helpful. The room had plenty of space and bathroom okay.  I asked for a room with a view as i was there for 3 days but got a wall outside the window but the bed was comfy and clean and it was quiet...so 2 out of 3 is ok.

review_470434784~“Good location but room not properly clean daily...”~Good location on George Street with close proximity to shopping and tourist attractions such as Darling Harbour, Paddy's market, Chinatown, etc. Room size is good for the four adults with the 2 double beds in the room which I have booked.  Only complaint - the room is not probably cleaned as the carpet is still dirty with daily housekeeping.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_470127387~“Centrally Located, Easy Walk to Train Station, Small Rooms”~We appreciated being in such close proximity to the train station from the Mercure, since the best Sydney has to offer is accessible by train. However, since this is so central, the rooms are much smaller than all the other hotels we stayed in in Australia. The breakfast buffet was ample and large, the beds comfortable, and the a/c kept up. Their housekeeping staff needs a little help - we had no hand towels or washcloths the first night, and they didn't make up the room till we called at 3PM the next day. Their were no luggage racks for our 2 large suitcases, and this made the smaller room more noticeable.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_469965493~“Convenient Location”~If you are looking for a decent 4 stars hotel with good access to the Central train station in CBD Sydney, this is the hotel I would recommend. Its back entrance opens out directly to the underground entrance or access to the Central Train Station which is the biggest interchange in Sydney. The rooms are reasonably sized, well kept, clean and quiet although some facilitilies may soon need to be refurbished. It is within walking distance to Haymarket, China Town and even Darling Harbour. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby so there are good alternative options if you do not want to spend too much on hotel breakfast which is a bit over priced. Staffs are generally friendly and well trained. Rates of room fluctuates significantly over time so it is better to book well in advance.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

It's very close to lots of great amenities e.g train and bus stations, and a very central place to stay for exploring the city. Great pool on the top floor which was always quiet when we used it. Our room was well presented and comfortable, good blackout curtains and comfy bed. Used the self service laundry which was easy to use and cheap. Staff were all very pleasant and helpful.

review_469243917~“Terribly disappointed”~I stayed here in April 2013 and found this hotel extremely comfortable so as I was joining a ship from here, I had no hesitation in booking the same hotel for two nights pre-cruise. I requested a high floor, overlooking Geoge Street. I got a room on floor 12 but the view was awful - room 1217. Unfortunately, upon checking in very late, a guest was unwell and the Duty Manager had other priorities so I did not complain. The beds were hard. Considering this hotel was undergoing refurbishment the last time I stayed here, I found the veneer furnishings to be of a poor quality. The corridor on this floor stank of stale cigarettes - fortunately, our room did not. Underneath the beds could do with a good clean as could the bathroom. Today at breakfast, there was an unruly group of children running wild in the breakfast room. Many people were using mobile phones which I find totally unacceptable. The food quality was not terribly good. The staff are friendly and the Hotel itself is in a good location. I am spending 3 nights post cruise in September but do not think I will be using this hotel.~2~nan~5~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_468652984~“Convenient place to stay”~I stayed in this hotel after having to move from a backpackers that was not up to standard.

Very handy to a lot that this part of Sydney has to offer - Great food in easy walking distance and if we didn't want to walk to get anything, the bar downstairs was great.

Check in was super easy and the staff were so helpful and lovely. A special thank you to Jennifer at Reception for making us feel so welcome and special. Our room on the top floor had amazing views over the city and the hotel is in the best location opposite central station. It was so easy to jump on a train to anywhere we wanted to go. The breakfast was lovely too and we were really happy to find some gluten free choices. Thank you to Ajith and Riley - your happy and smiling faces that greeted us every morning were a lovely way to start the day. We totally recommend the Mercure and hope to be back one day soon.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467410461~“Central location for public train transport”~Stay 5-nights, and I need to juggling creating multiple reservations to trick the promo rate. The booking engine is quite weird. The promo rate on the first 2-days is available, however if I book for 5-nights in single reservation, the booking engine give me full-rate for 5-nights. So I end up with multiple reservations. Explaining the situation via email to Hotel, and they accommodate to ensure no hassle during stay. Just once check-in and check-out and I get the same room for all stay. Taxi is cheaper than train from Airport. It is just 35$ including airport surcharge. And even the trip back to Airport is only 25$ using Uber. Taking train is also possible since the train station is nearby, however it is more expensive using train if two person travelling together. Arrive at around 12noon, and the agent allow me to check-in. It is the lowest category, so I get a railway view to the east. The best view is to the north, since you will get unobstructed city view. My room consist of two single beds, comfortable, all minimum amenities are there. Bathroom is standard and oldish. The hot water and cold water is in separate valve and you need to play around to get the expected water temperature. I get free wifi internet in the room since I am silver member of AccorAdvantagePlus. Try to connect 3 gadgets and all can connect.  Good thing for this hotel: express check-out, reliable wifi internet, early check-in (in my case), very good location for public transport (all train city and suburb start from Central station), bus stop nearby, supermarket woolworth is nearby, fastfood chain nearby open up to late night. Bad experience during stay: There were two-days where the housekeeping forget to provide floormat and one towel in the room. Cleaning is not good, I found hair remain beneath the bed.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467368531~“Great location, nice room size, skip the breakfast”~Great location, lots of sining options around, all within walking distance of hotel. Good room size and comfort, wonky TV remote and system. Breakfast spread average, value just below average. Vegetable curry too sweet, poached eggs looked overdone, strange and incompatible condiments for congee e.g. kimchii?~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467187775~“Great service”~As a LeClub Accor member my wife and I have stayed in a few Accor chain hotels now and we are yet to have a bad experience with service. That said, the service here sets a new benchmark for us. From check in where we were offered a discounted upgrade, through to breakfast and a very fast check out the next morning we felt like special guests. We stayed in a city view king room which has an eastern aspect. The room was clean and well appointed, the bed and pillows were comfortable and the block out blinds do a brilliant job of keeping the morning sun out. The buffet breakfast was one of the best that we've had. There is parking if you drive but the place can be tricky to navigate into and out of for the first time, even with a GPS.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_467094953~“City overnight stay”~Stayed at this hotel a few times of late when going out for the night in the city. Went to the ADEL concert and stayed here. Well positioned for the train station and buses. Plenty of places to eat nearby. The rooms are a little dated but very clean and fresh. Facilities such as the restaurant etc are well staffed and clean and tidy. Price wise an excellent choice for a CBD stay or somewhere to base yourself when doing the sights and sounds of Sydney without the huge price tag of some other hotels.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_466174646~“Mercure Review”~We have stayed at the Mercure Sydney many times and have always found the hotel to be ideally located close to central train station and light rail. Rooms are very clean and tidy, staff are always helpful and the restaurant serves high quality food.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_465706380~“Okay”~The location for this hotel is one of its main high points as it is just a short walk from central station which is ideal as this is onky 20 minutes train ride from the airport.  However it is a fairly long walk to the main attractions such as sydney harbour so if this is one of the main reasons for visiting sydney I'd suggest finding a hotek closer to the harbour and its attractions.  Upon arrival the staff we were greeted by were not rude however very blunt, which is the complete opposite to the friendly staff we dealt with upon checkout and the concierge desk. The rooms are very basic which in fairness is what should be expected for this hotel.  The main down points for this hotel is that you are unable to even slightly open the room windows which makes the air in the room feel very stale, the air con does help with this slightly but doesn't completely resolve the issue.  Just before leaving the hotel we noticed that one of the beds had a stain on the bedsheets which if we had noticed earlier would of brought to the attention of the staff. Dirty used plates were also left in the corridor outside our room from another room for at least a day which I would have thought would of been noticed by staff and dealt with accordingly? If I was to return to sydney I would pay more money to stay in a slightly nicer hotel towards the harbour area.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465188688~“Business Overnight”~Great location just a short walk from Central Station and not far to Chinatown. The rooms are good and the service friendly. I quite like the small bar downstairs that opens onto the street, good range of beer and pub food. For a quieter time the lounge bar on the 1st floor is quite nice.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_464856735~“Tour of Australia”~Not impressed with this hotel was supposed to be staying at Holiday Inn Darling Harbour but ended up here. After a 12 hour flight from London was not happy that my room would not be ready till 2pm. After 2pm was told my room was still not ready but they did have a room that was a bit lower standard. I was so tired by this time I accepted this offer. The room was not good though it was across from a block that had a light on all night and day which means you could not get much sleep at night. Would definitely not stay at this hotel again.~2~1~3~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_464816144~“Perfectly situated for a complete Sydney Novice”~I arrived early off the night flight from London so although I was rested I was disorientated. The short train ride to central found myself walking a mere 5 minutes to the hotel entrance. The concierge was quick to help with my bags and the checkin guy gave me the room immediately even although it shouldn't have been till 2pm I was very happy.  Stayed here for 5 nights and it was great, although it was just a place to drop after each day of exploring and sight seeing the service was impeccable and I would stay here again. I didn't use the pool or gym but I never heard anyone complain so I guess they were great too. Perfect for getting around Sydney and for escaping to the blue mountains as the station is on its door step. Really couldn't fault it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464598727~“Great location, poor front servixe”~We've stayed here a few times as it is great proximity to central station (coming from the airport) and central Sydney. Front desk service is always somewhat chaotic and disorganized.  Reception staff do not seem to process people checking in or out quickly enough hence the queuing is frustratingly slow.  Rooms have great city views and are very adequate size - maybe because we were upgraded being Accor Gold Members.  Very good value for money~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_463132349~“3 Night Stay with Overseas visitors”~Arrived early and left bags at Concierge and told bags will be taken to rooms when ready and will be sent an SMS to let me know......still waiting on the text and bags still at Concierge at 4pm! Good start to holiday. Friends room overlooked street with rubbish all over pavement with people overlooking their room and massage printed over windows. Saturday morning went out and had a lovely day only to find bangle missing from toiletry bag in bathroom to which I reported immediately, only to be told 'our staff are not allowed to take anything or touch anything' and unless I reported it to police there is nothing that can be done. This was very disappointing and upsetting. No drawers in room so not enough space for 4 people staying. Dirty dishes lying in hallway and not on trays and not being lifted or removed. Overall was a great time with visitors, but the bangle 'disappearing ' spoilt things.~4~2~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_463128749~“Great location”~This hotel is perfectly located right near Central Station, so it's easy to go anywhere in Sydney from here, either by bus or train. You can also walk to Darling Harbour or into the main part of the city, or Glebe, or Surry Hills etc. The staff here was very friendly. I arrived early and was able to leave a bag with the concierge. The lady at the desk said that the cleaning staff were almost done (at 10am), so if I wanted to return earlier than 2, a room would be ready. Maybe she shouldn't have said that, since I showed up at 1 and there were no rooms ready, so I had to wait until 2 anyway. There was a really strong smell in the foyer both days I was there, it smelled like men's deodorant, quite unpleasant. But the room was very nice and clean and I had a good view of the railway square intersection. It was fairly quiet, even though my room was close to the lifts. I did hear some loud drilling down on the street in the morning but that was at about 9am so it didn't bother me. The room had everything I needed, including hair dryer, ironing board etc. Overall I would recommend staying here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462375945~“Excited to be in Australia but....”~The first night, I checked in, I couldn't even get in the room. After 11 hours of traveling. Having a problem with the key, When the concierge finally let me in, I can't seem to remember his name, at this time, but he did try his best to assist me, so that I could get into the room with no problem, the view, was amazing. But I found the air in the room was a bit stale.  They worked out the kinks, and I just went about my touring around town.  It's Centrally located close to the train station, and bus and the hop on and hop off Bus. Too pricey ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462362260~“Great location”~I have stayed at the Mecure Sydney about 80 times in the past few years. I have always found the staff from the cleaners to management to be friendly & helpful, from my first booking to the last one last week, it never changes. The rooms are clean & comfortable. The location to resturants, nightclubs, transport & shows in the city is the best, lots within walking distance. I always recommend this hotel to everyone.~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan

review_459593448~“Not pleased with the service or city view”~Seriously, I am told that my room has a city view. I look at a building and if I lean out I can see two buildings to the right. City View - NO. Air conditioners need a key to run so, hopefully it is not hot during the day - rooms would be very warm and they only provide a single key, so the ability to leave the air conditioner on if it is hot is taken away. Bathrooms are small and mine smells bad - not sure but hopefully it gets better over the next day or two. Two beds in the room so, not sure how I can use the ironing board in any sustainable manner! Desk is small, well, enough said. I promised myself never to stay at a Mecure again; I broke my promise to myself and I regret it.~2~nan~1~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_459468336~“Almost deserves a rating of 5”~Stayed here for two nights on business and really enjoyed my stay. The staff were exceptional, the bed comfortable and the breakfast was fantastic.

The location is also pretty good.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459059092~“A few days down under......”~We arrived after our cruise to absolute chaos at the Mercure reception. After a very early disembarkation we really did not need the very long wait, 35 mins. to go thro the check-in process. The "on duty manager" a young girl complete in "career suit" was strutting about doing absolutely nothing! When I suggested she went to one of the empty desks to help speed things along she was horrified at the thought......tried to tell me she was the "duty manager" what this actually entails she was not able to explain! We left our luggage with the concierge who again was totally stressed with so many people leaving & collecting luggage. We were told our room would not be ready before  2pm. On our return our room was ready & the luggage had arrived. Room was a good size with 2 queen beds, beds were good, pillows too. What fascinated us was that there was NOT one drawer in the room! The bathroom was reasonable altho the shower was in the bath, no bath rail & taps situated so that when turned on for the first time the chance of getting soaked was 100%! When we arrived it appeared that the room had been used for single use as there was only 1 set of towels. Called housekeeping who rectified this immediately. View from our window was abysmal, looking onto a virtually derelict buliding about 50meters from our window. Having said this, our room was quiet & we slept well. Breakfast & dinner in the restaurant were OK, as we didn't think the hotel was very central at all, we made regular use of the restaurant. Staff very friendly & a special mention for Victoria & Aleksandra who were both excellent. This is a very busy hotel & very popular with airline crews. We felt the overall running of the hotel was poor, the check-in/check-out facilities being totally inadequate even tho the staff tried their very best.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_459051316~“Conveniently situated near Central Station”~Stayed five nights for our grandson's first trip to Sydney. Good friendly staff at reception for our arrival as after seeing our booked room we needed to upgrade to a suite as the twin Queen bed room was a little too small for a lengthy stay. The upgrade saw us with a full sofa as well as a tub chair and the two queen beds but it came at a considerable extra cost but worth it in the long run. The restaurant staff were excellent and extremely attentive especially in the Accor breakfast room. Our grandson was very well catered for indeed and it was appreciated by all. We were on the 14th floor and on a corner with a view to the south and east so a view out to Botany Bay. Long days sight seeing saw us have some in room meals in the evenings which were of a fairly good standard. The roof top indoor pool proved a bit of nice relief from the hot weather encountered during our stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_458417491~“Everything we needed”~We stayed here for 4 nights. The area itself is very central, although a bit soulless. Very handy for the central train station and bus hub. Quick, efficient check in. Fairly spacious room, although bathroom was a little dated. Good air con during a 36 degree heat wave. Not much street noise despite being near a busy road, so we slept well. Comfy beds and choice of pillows. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, if fairly standard choices. The only negatives were the high charge for WIFI, and the carpet in the hallways needed a good vacuum clean - looked like it hadn't been done for ages! All in all, it was good value for us and I would stay there again.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_458251708~“Disappointing”~We arrived at the Mecure after our cruise, sadly we had to cue and wait to check in for over 20minutes, as many had arrived from our cruise and others were checking out. Our room was not available until 2.00pm which was fine. The room was small and a little disappointing, although it did have everything we needed but the bed was not of a good quality and rather firm.

review_463876250~“Excellent hotel”~We stayed for two nights in this hotel following a cruise from San Fransisco to Sydney. On arrival at just after 8am we were offered an upgraded room (at a small cost) which was immediately available. On the top floor, with a panoramic view of the city skyline, the room was bright, airy and spacious. The bathroom was a good size, clean and with a good supply of miniature toiletries. The extra towels requested were brought quickly to the room and the tea and coffee facilities were adequate. Positioned very close to the city's central railway station, the hotel is in a really good position and within walking distance of many of Sydney's main attractions including the opera house, the botanical gardens China Town and Darling Harbour. There was a limited supply of complimentary tea and coffee as well as a well stocked (if expensive) mini bar. Even though extremely busy (the hotel appeared to be the one of choice for airline crew) there was a calm and pleasant atmosphere throughout the hotel. The concierge team was outstanding! Our cases were delivered to our room quickly and before we had completed check in; a member of the team quickly had us booked onto the hop on hop off bus with a stop just around the corner; and they provided excellent assistance with our on- line check in/boarding procedures. Although we didn't use the restaurant or the pool/gym they were available and looked inviting. We would certInly use this hotel again and recommend it to others.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

We last stayed here 15 years and remembered the breakfast so we had it again. Truly one of the great buffets in a mid range hotel so terrific value. There is even an Accor lounge with a coffee machine. The guy running breakfast was also good. Big shout. Days since last room upgrade due to platinum Accor. - Never.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_478345066~“Great location, engaged staff but very tired hotel in need of attention”~We travelled to Sydney over Easter and stayed here because of its excellent location. We booked online using Booking.com and got a good rate. We stayed in a room with two double beds.  The beds were comfortable, the pillows were a little lumpy, they had seen many nights of use. The paint work was scuffed with marks on the wall. The television was difficult to control, the buttons on the remote had been pushed too many times. The bathroom has new tiles on the floor and tap ware but no hiding it is an old bathroom, with a step in bath / shower. They do courage express check out as they are popular with bus tours and want to ensure good flow in the morning. Not sure we will stay there until it is refurbished. There are better options for the price.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_477650065~“Certainly met my needs”~I arrived way early and was offered a Superior Room with a view that was ready for an extra $20 a night. It was a good view too. Yes I might have a few trivial gripes but I won't even bother. It is situated on major bus routes and right beside Central Station. Super easy to get to anywhere I wanted and we went a few different directions. Must say I was impressed with the blackout curtain that could be lowered to keep the moving sun out of the room. Would I stay here again YES.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan

We arrived back very late and no bags in our room and the sofa bed for the kids was not made up and when it was there was no mattress protector.

review_475735589~“Mrs G A Dennis”~1: The hotel was lovely right by central station and near darling harbour. 2: We were greeted by the the staff at reception and show to our room, The only downside I had was the room they gave us looked over the roofs at the back so the view wasn't good but I went to reception and told them I had requested a room with a city view which I had and there was no problem to change us. Nothing was a problem and things were sorted asap lovely staff, and the guys at the concierge desk were more than happy to help out with any trips or beaches we wished to go to. 3: The breakfast is ok but it's more unless the same every morning, I asked if they served fried eyes but that wasn't an option. 4: We will definitely return to this hotel in the future. It will be great when the light rail is up and running from george street to circular quay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475261376~“Absolutely the worst wifi ever”~The Mercure Sydney has one of the slowest wifi speeds I have ever encountered in a first world country. Emails took forever to load and the wifi kept on disconnecting every 5 mins. I was unable to work effectively in the hotel and conference calls were cut off halfway. It is unacceptable in this day and age for a business hotel like the Mercure to have such poor wifi. Will never stay here for business again. Another aspects of the hotel were ok. Simple gym and room. Cleanliness was not a problem. Bed was ok but aircon was loud.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474506945~“Big Welcome”~What a terrific welcome I received on my visit to the Mercure in Sydney. It was the first time that I have stayed there, but the welcome will ensure that I return. Special recognition to Sonia and Matthew on the front desk. I arrived from Shanghai and took the train from Sydney International Airport to Central Station; extremely convenient. It was well before check-in time and I was offered the use of a room to freshen up so that i could get to meetings. It was done without fuss or fanfare, and was greatly appreciated. The Mercure location is great for getting to and from the airport, but just a little out of the way from the central business district. But right on George Street and on the Sydney subway, so getting around was easy. The room met all of the needs. The color scheme was probably a little gaudy; not sure if all rooms are in a mauve/violet color scheme. But that is a very minor distraction from what was a very pleasant stay.  I have tried many of the upmarket hotels in Sydney and most of them are now terribly expensive. I thought that the Mercure was very good value for money and then the welcome reception convinced me that i should return to the Mercure when I'm next in Sydney~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_473765767~“Comfortable stay and close to central station.”~Staying at the Mercure for a holiday to Sydney and I was pleased with my stay. As a accor member I like staying at the Mercure Sydney and I took advantage of the Bed and Breakfast deal offered. I stayed in the city view room, I found the bed comfortable and the view of the city was really good. On level 12 there was little noise from the outside. The hotel is very close to central station which I used to get around Sydney and surroundings with ease. The reception and concierge staff were friendly and welcoming, also helped me with travels around Sydney.

review_473722114~“ideal location Central station”~Spent a day in Sydney on return from a cruise. There is covered/underground access pretty much from the door of the Mercure to Central rail station (appreciated this as the weather was showery!) From Central you have easy access to anywhere in Sydney including the domestic and international airports. We were impressed with the rail system, which was fast, clean and frequent. From Mercure to any of our destinations including Art Gallery of NSW, The Rocks, Circular Quay, Opera House, etc was only a couple of minutes with hardly any waiting on platform, at cost of about $2.50 per adult. About $15 and 12 minutes to domestic airport. There was nothing bad to say about the Mercure; service was prompt and efficient, room clean and bed very large and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is worth the extra cost. There were a number of airline flight crews checking in/out when we stayed, a good recommendation for standard of accommodation and customer service. We paid a little extra for a room upgrade to level 13 so had the additional luxury of our own coffee machine and WiFi connection. Concierge was very helpful - in fact all staff deserve a pat on the back, they were lovely.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473716402~“Made our 50th Anniversary Very Special”~When they knew it was our 50th Wedding Anniversary they immediately upgraded us to one of their best rooms, placed a bottle of wine and chocolates with a handwritten card congratulating us in our room and gave us a complimentary drink from the bar. We were very impressed with this level of service. Our room on the 9th floor was large and had city views, breakfast was good as was our dinner in their restaurant- the staff very efficient in all areas. It is in a great spot close to Chinatown and public transport(train station and bus station very close.)~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473332175~“Good”~The hotel is just outside of China town and some of the area feels a bit suspect, but the area actually has a bunch of culture. A 4km walk to the opera house.

review_473054251~“Good without being great”~I recently stayed at the Mercure Sydney for 3 nights for business.  Location: the hotel is located at far end of the CBD away from circular quay / harbour bridge / opera house. The location is next to central station so if you are using public transport to get around it is a great location (trains from the airport etc)  The rooms are OK, but feel a little dirty eg walls are heavily marked.  They're comfortable enough though. Restaurant: I ate breakfast on 3 occasions and would only rate the food as average. Nothing exciting and no dedicated chef cooking eggs etc Hotel is lacks equipment.  Pool though not large looked good. Overall, not a bad hotel but there are better options.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472864915~“Worst Mercure property I've stayed in”~Easily the worst Mercure property I've stayed in. The rooms were tired, carpets dirty (moist / damp) despite having been vacuumed, beds very springy / uncomfortable. Additionally, we were initially put in a smoking room (which I didn't realise still existed?) and were only moved to an equivalent room when I said we'd go to another hotel.

review_471937517~“Sort out your IT”~Although I had booked and confirmed in my own name and email address and received confirmation emails to my email in my name, when I arrived at the hotel (Mercure, Sydney) with my wife, the receptionist could not find our booking. A flurry of searching for the paperwork to find the booking number followed and the booking was found - it was in my wife's name (different surname). Now at some time in the past, my wife may have made a booking and used the same home address, but how and why could a booking made months or years later be recorded by the booking system in another person's name and unable to be detected by the surname or email address of the person making the booking?? With the booking found and noting that the reservation had already been paid for (charged to my credit card), the receptionist gave us the room cards in my wife's name and we were told to use her surname for internet access and room charges. So although my wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times this incident at reception caused unnecessary stress. The solution as relayed by the receptionist was that we should always use our own individual Accor Club numbers when booking. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!~2~3~5~5~4~4~3~nan
review_471842874~“Never lets us down”~This remains our Accor hotel of choice in Sydney. It is an easy walk from Central Station, and there was no need for taxis at all even though the free bus that used to run from Central to Circular Quay has ceased to exist. As an Accor Plus member we get good deals, even though prices were very high for this particular weekend – perhaps because there was an Adele concert on? Our room, with two double beds, was roomy and comfortable. Perhaps housekeeping needs a bit of a push – there was no milk at all, and there was an old bobby pin and toenail clipping on the bathroom floor – neither of them ours! As with many hotels these days they are a bit mean with teabags and sugar etc. Yes, when requested they are provided, but it would be so much easier if they were there in the first place. We have stayed here a number of times and will continue to consider it as our first choice when visiting Sydney.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_463876250~“Excellent hotel”~We stayed for two nights in this hotel following a cruise from San Fransisco to Sydney. On arrival at just after 8am we were offered an upgraded room (at a small cost) which was immediately available. On the top floor, with a panoramic view of the city skyline, the room was bright, airy and spacious. The bathroom was a good size, clean and with a good supply of miniature toiletries. The extra towels requested were brought quickly to the room and the tea and coffee facilities were adequate. Positioned very close to the city's central railway station, the hotel is in a really good position and within walking distance of many of Sydney's main attractions including the opera house, the botanical gardens China Town and Darling Harbour. There was a limited supply of complimentary tea and coffee as well as a well stocked (if expensive) mini bar. Even though extremely busy (the hotel appeared to be the one of choice for airline crew) there was a calm and pleasant atmosphere throughout the hotel. The concierge team was outstanding! Our cases were delivered to our room quickly and before we had completed check in; a member of the team quickly had us booked onto the hop on hop off bus with a stop just around the corner; and they provided excellent assistance with our on- line check in/boarding procedures. Although we didn't use the restaurant or the pool/gym they were available and looked inviting. We would certInly use this hotel again and recommend it to others.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_478715010~“The breakfast is the star”~It's a solid Mercure like many across big cities across the world. Usually a 3 or 4 rating. Why the 4 here? We last stayed here 15 years and remembered the breakfast so we had it again. Truly one of the great buffets in a mid range hotel so terrific value. There is even an Accor lounge with a coffee machine. The guy running breakfast was also good. Big shout. Days since last room upgrade due to platinum Accor. - Never.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_478345066~“Great location, engaged staff but very tired hotel in need of attention”~We travelled to Sydney over Easter and stayed here because of its excellent location. We booked online using Booking.com and got a good rate. We stayed in a room with two double beds.  The beds were comfortable, the pillows were a little lumpy, they had seen many nights of use. The paint work was scuffed with marks on the wall. The television was difficult to control, the buttons on the remote had been pushed too many times. The bathroom has new tiles on the floor and tap ware but no hiding it is an old bathroom, with a step in bath / shower. They do courage express check out as they are popular with bus tours and want to ensure good flow in the morning. Not sure we will stay there until it is refurbished. There are better options for the price.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_477650065~“Certainly met my needs”~I arrived way early and was offered a Superior Room with a view that was ready for an extra $20 a night. It was a good view too. Yes I might have a few trivial gripes but I won't even bother. It is situated on major bus routes and right beside Central Station. Super easy to get to anywhere I wanted and we went a few different directions. Must say I was impressed with the blackout curtain that could be lowered to keep the moving sun out of the room. Would I stay here again YES.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_477528650~“Needs updating”~Hi all . So this trip to Sydney was due to overseas family visiting and wanting to give them a taste of the big city.

review_475767945~“Show”~The overall stay was ok but had some problems.  We checked in early and left our bags with the conceige as we would be away all day and was told that our bags will be in our room when we come back. We arrived back very late and no bags in our room and the sofa bed for the kids was not made up and when it was there was no mattress protector. We also only had two towels instead of four and only one face washer Matt at reception did appolagise but these things shouldn't happen. The room was very clean and breakfast was great both morning. ~3~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_474506945~“Big Welcome”~What a terrific welcome I received on my visit to the Mercure in Sydney. It was the first time that I have stayed there, but the welcome will ensure that I return. Special recognition to Sonia and Matthew on the front desk. I arrived from Shanghai and took the train from Sydney International Airport to Central Station; extremely convenient. It was well before check-in time and I was offered the use of a room to freshen up so that i could get to meetings. It was done without fuss or fanfare, and was greatly appreciated. The Mercure location is great for getting to and from the airport, but just a little out of the way from the central business district. But right on George Street and on the Sydney subway, so getting around was easy. The room met all of the needs. The color scheme was probably a little gaudy; not sure if all rooms are in a mauve/violet color scheme. But that is a very minor distraction from what was a very pleasant stay.  I have tried many of the upmarket hotels in Sydney and most of them are now terribly expensive. I thought that the Mercure was very good value for money and then the welcome reception convinced me that i should return to the Mercure when I'm next in Sydney~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_471158112~“Well managed, central hotel.”~Lovely staff welcoming us on arrival after a long flight from the UK. The offer of an upgrade for just 50 dollars a night was gratefully accepted as we were tired and in need of sleep. The room was huge, a sweeping semi circular window took up half the size of the room, the view was off both side of the road, floor 7 provided silence at night from the traffic below, hence a good sleep. Copious amounts of tea, coffee and milk was provided freely in the room.There was a mini bar, although the prices were high so we didn't use it. There was an iron, ironing board and hairdryer with washing line over the bath .Free wifi in the room made keeping in touch easy. Aircon made for a comfortable temperature in the room during the heat of the day. All staff were pleasant and friendly. The hotel is in walking distance to Paddys Market, a big indoor market where you can buy fresh food stuffs and souvenirs..

review_471131233~“Good for the price”~I stayed here one night on business and it is a typical Mercure good clean accomodation  The bar and restaurant weee good and staff courteous  My room was good although a little small but still tucked all the boxes  I guess the only issue was the area  This is st the far end of George st and the rocks and other attractions is about 2.7 k away I took a taxi which wa about 18 to 20 dollars however tube or bus would of been cheaper Still you would be paying a good 150 dollars per night more for staying closer the the attractions  The area looks very lively at night so if you are into the clubs and that this is your cup of tea Overall for me pretty good standard but just wished the room was bigger~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470759991~“Great location”~We stayed here on a Friday night and then again on a Sunday night. This hotel has a great location and was very reasonably priced. Because of our early morning flight we were offered an earlier check in at a deluxe room for $20. We stayed both nights on 12th floors. Both the rooms we stayed at were dated but clean. Because we were only there to sleep due to busy schedule we enjoyed it. The hotel is opposite fast food resturants (McDonald's & KFC) and the train station is right at the door step~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470736609~“Night stopover ”~My wife and I spent a night at the hotel and were very happy with our stay. Check in went smoothly with no delay and then shown to our room on the tenth floor.  Room was clean and bed comfortable - what more can you ask for. We both had breakfast in the morning which was ok, nothing over the top but adequate. Check out was a breeze, we were double charged for the breakfast but this was rectified after drawing their attention to it by email. We would be more than happy to stay there again, it is conveniently situated and the price was right. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470561759~“Quality brand in just the right place”~I travel frequently for business and have become accustomed to the quality provided by the Accor and particularly the Mercure Hotel brand. Their hotels offer a consistent quality at most destinations and they are usually in just the right place. The Mercure in Sydney is located at the top end of George Street near Central Station. Easy access to public transport, easy to drive too and park and very near to some great restaurants and quick eats. Try Kensington Lane.  While the quality remains this way I will continue to choose this brand.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_470448932~“Central spot”~Hotel was comfortable and staff were pleasant and helpful. The room had plenty of space and bathroom okay.  I asked for a room with a view as i was there for 3 days but got a wall outside the window but the bed was comfy and clean and it was quiet...so 2 out of 3 is ok. One elevator closed too quickly and knocked me down. Pool was nice and breakfast was great with loads of choices. Overrall I'd stay there again.~4~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_470434784~“Good location but room not properly clean daily...”~Good location on George Street with close proximity to shopping and tourist attractions such as Darling Harbour, Paddy's market, Chinatown, etc. Room size is good for the four adults with the 2 double beds in the room which I have booked.  Only complaint - the room is not probably cleaned as the carpet is still dirty with daily housekeeping.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_479051874~“Perfect”~Thanks Sydney Mercure for a great stay. Great positive vibe and super attentive service that goes the extra mile! So, we had such a good stay.

Congrats and thanks.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463876250~“Excellent hotel”~We stayed for two nights in this hotel following a cruise from San Fransisco to Sydney. On arrival at just after 8am we were offered an upgraded room (at a small cost) which was immediately available. On the top floor, with a panoramic view of the city skyline, the room was bright, airy and spacious. The bathroom was a good size, clean and with a good supply of miniature toiletries. The extra towels requested were brought quickly to the room and the tea and coffee facilities were adequate. Positioned very close to the city's central railway station, the hotel is in a really good position and within walking distance of many of Sydney's main attractions including the opera house, the botanical gardens China Town and Darling Harbour. There was a limited supply of complimentary tea and coffee as well as a well stocked (if expensive) mini bar. Even though extremely busy (the hotel appeared to be the one of choice for airline crew) there was a calm and pleasant atmosphere throughout the hotel. The concierge team was outstanding! Our cases were delivered to our room quickly and before we had completed check in; a member of the team quickly had us booked onto the hop on hop off bus with a stop just around the corner; and they provided excellent assistance with our on- line check in/boarding procedures. Although we didn't use the restaurant or the pool/gym they were available and looked inviting. We would certInly use this hotel again and recommend it to others.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_478715010~“The breakfast is the star”~It's a solid Mercure like many across big cities across the world. Usually a 3 or 4 rating. Why the 4 here? We last stayed here 15 years and remembered the breakfast so we had it again. Truly one of the great buffets in a mid range hotel so terrific value. There is even an Accor lounge with a coffee machine. The guy running breakfast was also good. Big shout. Days since last room upgrade due to platinum Accor. - Never.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_478345066~“Great location, engaged staff but very tired hotel in need of attention”~We travelled to Sydney over Easter and stayed here because of its excellent location. We booked online using Booking.com and got a good rate. We stayed in a room with two double beds.  The beds were comfortable, the pillows were a little lumpy, they had seen many nights of use. The paint work was scuffed with marks on the wall. The television was difficult to control, the buttons on the remote had been pushed too many times. The bathroom has new tiles on the floor and tap ware but no hiding it is an old bathroom, with a step in bath / shower. They do courage express check out as they are popular with bus tours and want to ensure good flow in the morning. Not sure we will stay there until it is refurbished. There are better options for the price.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_477650065~“Certainly met my needs”~I arrived way early and was offered a Superior Room with a view that was ready for an extra $20 a night. It was a good view too. Yes I might have a few trivial gripes but I won't even bother. It is situated on major bus routes and right beside Central Station. Super easy to get to anywhere I wanted and we went a few different directions. Must say I was impressed with the blackout curtain that could be lowered to keep the moving sun out of the room. Would I stay here again YES.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_477528650~“Needs updating”~Hi all . So this trip to Sydney was due to overseas family visiting and wanting to give them a taste of the big city. We decided on this hotel because of position and pricing. On reflection it was a bad choice. Service was average. Decor left a lot to be desired. It was a dirty hotel. We won't be returning.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476714331~“Not a great experience”~I got to this hotel after the end of a long day only to be given a room that wasn't made up but I found out later that I had been given the wrong room so had to move again. Was put in a room that had been used by a smoker and had a shower cap over the smoke alarm. To say it stunk was an understatement. Not a great experience.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_476253216~“Average, but good location”~I've stayed here several times for work, and the location makes it a good choice, but other than that, there is nothing special about this hotel.

review_476035668~“Ideal location to see Sydney”~My host at UTS booked this hotel for me. It's so close to the UTS campus.  It's also close the the metro station, China Town, Sydney Harbor, and Hyde Park.  The room is nice. I had a room with the Captain's view of the area that leads to the metro station, China Town, and Hyde Park.  Many airlines use this hotel for their crews.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475767945~“Show”~The overall stay was ok but had some problems.  We checked in early and left our bags with the conceige as we would be away all day and was told that our bags will be in our room when we come back. We arrived back very late and no bags in our room and the sofa bed for the kids was not made up and when it was there was no mattress protector. We also only had two towels instead of four and only one face washer Matt at reception did appolagise but these things shouldn't happen. The room was very clean and breakfast was great both morning. ~3~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_475735589~“Mrs G A Dennis”~1: The hotel was lovely right by central station and near darling harbour. 2: We were greeted by the the staff at reception and show to our room, The only downside I had was the room they gave us looked over the roofs at the back so the view wasn't good but I went to reception and told them I had requested a room with a city view which I had and there was no problem to change us. Nothing was a problem and things were sorted asap lovely staff, and the guys at the concierge desk were more than happy to help out with any trips or beaches we wished to go to. 3: The breakfast is ok but it's more unless the same every morning, I asked if they served fried eyes but that wasn't an option. 4: We will definitely return to this hotel in the future. It will be great when the light rail is up and running from george street to circular quay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475702290~“Great location, friendly staff”~Second time I stayed at this hotel. Staff are always very friendly and welcoming. Great, central location. Easy to get to from the Airport, easy to access the CBD. Love the fact that they have a pillow menu (I love a good feather pillow). Swimming pool a bit underwhelming... Room was clean and bed comfy. Room had a lovely view of the CBD. Will choose this hotel again for any future trips to Sydney.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475687296~“Delighted to have enjoyed an upgrade”~Was delighted upon check-in to find that we were given an upgrade to a Privilege room, despite using a free night I get for being a silver member of the Accor Club.

review_475333817~“Great service”~We didn't spend very long in the hotel as we had a very early flight back to London but the staff were fantastic, booked a taxi for us without asking, upgraded our room and couldn't do enough to help. Ideally suited for the airport, the room was large and comfortable and clean.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_475261376~“Absolutely the worst wifi ever”~The Mercure Sydney has one of the slowest wifi speeds I have ever encountered in a first world country. Emails took forever to load and the wifi kept on disconnecting every 5 mins. I was unable to work effectively in the hotel and conference calls were cut off halfway. It is unacceptable in this day and age for a business hotel like the Mercure to have such poor wifi. Will never stay here for business again. Another aspects of the hotel were ok. Simple gym and room. Cleanliness was not a problem. Bed was ok but aircon was loud.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474506945~“Big Welcome”~What a terrific welcome I received on my visit to the Mercure in Sydney. It was the first time that I have stayed there, but the welcome will ensure that I return. Special recognition to Sonia and Matthew on the front desk. I arrived from Shanghai and took the train from Sydney International Airport to Central Station; extremely convenient. It was well before check-in time and I was offered the use of a room to freshen up so that i could get to meetings. It was done without fuss or fanfare, and was greatly appreciated. The Mercure location is great for getting to and from the airport, but just a little out of the way from the central business district. But right on George Street and on the Sydney subway, so getting around was easy. The room met all of the needs. The color scheme was probably a little gaudy; not sure if all rooms are in a mauve/violet color scheme. But that is a very minor distraction from what was a very pleasant stay.  I have tried many of the upmarket hotels in Sydney and most of them are now terribly expensive. I thought that the Mercure was very good value for money and then the welcome reception convinced me that i should return to the Mercure when I'm next in Sydney~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan

We walked to Sydney Harbour (bridge, Opera House, Royal Botanics) which is 2.5km away.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474050869~“Good mid-range hotel; OK location”~Hotel was clean, well appointed, and comfortable. Front desk staff was friendly but clueless - they kept confusing our booking with our friends'.

review_473918823~“Great location, small rooms”~The staff are very professional and helpful. The best about this hotel is the location, next to grand central station. The rooms are a bit small, though in a good shape. The gym is tiny, a shame for such a large-sized hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_473765767~“Comfortable stay and close to central station.”~Staying at the Mercure for a holiday to Sydney and I was pleased with my stay. As a accor member I like staying at the Mercure Sydney and I took advantage of the Bed and Breakfast deal offered. I stayed in the city view room, I found the bed comfortable and the view of the city was really good. On level 12 there was little noise from the outside. The hotel is very close to central station which I used to get around Sydney and surroundings with ease. The reception and concierge staff were friendly and welcoming, also helped me with travels around Sydney. The breakfast buffet at Four Elements was very good with there food offerings and there was a separate room for accor members. I would recommend staying at the Mercure and I will say here again in the future.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473722114~“ideal location Central station”~Spent a day in Sydney on return from a cruise. There is covered/underground access pretty much from the door of the Mercure to Central rail station (appreciated this as the weather was showery!) From Central you have easy access to anywhere in Sydney including the domestic and international airports. We were impressed with the rail system, which was fast, clean and frequent. From Mercure to any of our destinations including Art Gallery of NSW, The Rocks, Circular Quay, Opera House, etc was only a couple of minutes with hardly any waiting on platform, at cost of about $2.50 per adult. About $15 and 12 minutes to domestic airport. There was nothing bad to say about the Mercure; service was prompt and efficient, room clean and bed very large and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is worth the extra cost. There were a number of airline flight crews checking in/out when we stayed, a good recommendation for standard of accommodation and customer service. We paid a little extra for a room upgrade to level 13 so had the additional luxury of our own coffee machine and WiFi connection. Concierge was very helpful - in fact all staff deserve a pat on the back, they were lovely.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473716402~“Made our 50th Anniversary Very Special”~When they knew it was our 50th Wedding Anniversary they immediately upgraded us to one of their best rooms, placed a bottle of wine and chocolates with a handwritten card congratulating us in our room and gave us a complimentary drink from the bar. We were very impressed with this level of service. Our room on the 9th floor was large and had city views, breakfast was good as was our dinner in their restaurant- the staff very efficient in all areas. It is in a great spot close to Chinatown and public transport(train station and bus station very close.)~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473332175~“Good”~The hotel is just outside of China town and some of the area feels a bit suspect, but the area actually has a bunch of culture. A 4km walk to the opera house. Lots of parks around and tons of restaurants. The hotel itself has a good feel. Friendly staff and lots of amenities.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473054251~“Good without being great”~I recently stayed at the Mercure Sydney for 3 nights for business.  Location: the hotel is located at far end of the CBD away from circular quay / harbour bridge / opera house. The location is next to central station so if you are using public transport to get around it is a great location (trains from the airport etc)  The rooms are OK, but feel a little dirty eg walls are heavily marked.  They're comfortable enough though. Restaurant: I ate breakfast on 3 occasions and would only rate the food as average. Nothing exciting and no dedicated chef cooking eggs etc Hotel is lacks equipment.  Pool though not large looked good. Overall, not a bad hotel but there are better options.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472864915~“Worst Mercure property I've stayed in”~Easily the worst Mercure property I've stayed in. The rooms were tired, carpets dirty (moist / damp) despite having been vacuumed, beds very springy / uncomfortable. Additionally, we were initially put in a smoking room (which I didn't realise still existed?) and were only moved to an equivalent room when I said we'd go to another hotel. Pretty disappointing overall.~1~1~4~2~1~2~3~nan

There was no free Wi-Fi available in our room, it states on the website that their is a "pillow menu" although I couldn't even get an extra pillow, the toilet in our room was leaking, we had a family room and it was very small and cramped, beds were not great, "fresh" towels smelt like cigarette smoke although were replaced, no opening window and the fridge was loud and got very hot. The concierge desk was fantastic very helpful! Great central location but the hotel needs some improvement!~2~nan~5~nan~2~nan~4~nan

review_471937517~“Sort out your IT”~Although I had booked and confirmed in my own name and email address and received confirmation emails to my email in my name, when I arrived at the hotel (Mercure, Sydney) with my wife, the receptionist could not find our booking. A flurry of searching for the paperwork to find the booking number followed and the booking was found - it was in my wife's name (different surname). Now at some time in the past, my wife may have made a booking and used the same home address, but how and why could a booking made months or years later be recorded by the booking system in another person's name and unable to be detected by the surname or email address of the person making the booking?? With the booking found and noting that the reservation had already been paid for (charged to my credit card), the receptionist gave us the room cards in my wife's name and we were told to use her surname for internet access and room charges. So although my wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times this incident at reception caused unnecessary stress. The solution as relayed by the receptionist was that we should always use our own individual Accor Club numbers when booking. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!~2~3~5~5~4~4~3~nan
review_471842874~“Never lets us down”~This remains our Accor hotel of choice in Sydney. It is an easy walk from Central Station, and there was no need for taxis at all even though the free bus that used to run from Central to Circular Quay has ceased to exist. As an Accor Plus member we get good deals, even though prices were very high for this particular weekend – perhaps because there was an Adele concert on? Our room, with two double beds, was roomy and comfortable. Perhaps housekeeping needs a bit of a push – there was no milk at all, and there was an old bobby pin and toenail clipping on the bathroom floor – neither of them ours! As with many hotels these days they are a bit mean with teabags and sugar etc. Yes, when requested they are provided, but it would be so much easier if they were there in the first place. We have stayed here a number of times and will continue to consider it as our first choice when visiting Sydney.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_471158112~“Well managed, central hotel.”~Lovely staff welcoming us on arrival after a long flight from the UK. The offer of an upgrade for just 50 dollars a night was gratefully accepted as we were tired and in need of sleep. The room was huge, a sweeping semi circular window took up half the size of the room, the view was off both side of the road, floor 7 provided silence at night from the traffic below, hence a good sleep. Copious amounts of tea, coffee and milk was provided freely in the room.There was a mini bar, although the prices were high so we didn't use it. There was an iron, ironing board and hairdryer with washing line over the bath .Free wifi in the room made keeping in touch easy. Aircon made for a comfortable temperature in the room during the heat of the day. All staff were pleasant and friendly. The hotel is in walking distance to Paddys Market, a big indoor market where you can buy fresh food stuffs and souvenirs..

Their hotels offer a consistent quality at most destinations and they are usually in just the right place. The Mercure in Sydney is located at the top end of George Street near Central Station. Easy access to public transport, easy to drive too and park and very near to some great restaurants and quick eats. Try Kensington Lane.

Only complaint - the room is not probably cleaned as the carpet is still dirty with daily housekeeping.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
