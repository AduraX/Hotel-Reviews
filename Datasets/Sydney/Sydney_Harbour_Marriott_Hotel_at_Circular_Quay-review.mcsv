review_478607002~“Best Location in Sydney”~We recently took a cruise from Sydney to Auckland, staying at the Marriott before and after the cruise. There is no better location to the Circular Quay Cruise Port, not to mention the great views of the Harbour from most of the hotel rooms. This hotel recently completely a major renovation, sporting a brand new lobby, restaurant, meeting facilities and executive lounge. The rooms too looked fairly recently refreshed. We arrived very early in the morning on the pre-cruise stay and our room was not ready. As a gold elite member, they allowed us to eat breakfast in the executive lounge while waiting a couple of hours for the room to be ready. We found the room to be well-appointed and comfortable with the exception of the pillows which were dense and lumpy. For me, a less than fluffy pillow can ruin the most comfortable bed. Also, I'm going to keep mentioning the next item every time I stay at a Marriott until finally someone gets it right. I am a repeat customer with status at the chain. My profile under preferences states "two extra foam pillows please" for every stay. Not one Marriott property ANYWHERE has ever surprised me and had 2 extra pillows waiting in my room for me even when the room was ready in advance. I always have to ask. On our second stay post-cruise, I used the app to check in ahead of time. When we arrived at the hotel, the lobby was packed. We were able to skip the line and just pick up our key at the concierge desk. This impressed me! We found all staff members we encountered to be professional and courteous, especially in the executive lounge.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478386717~“After cruise vacation”~Very close to passenger cruise ship terminal. We were able to walk to the hotel after our cruise. Hotel is in a great location and you can walk to the Rocks, Opera House, and all ferries. There are a lot of restaurants in the area as well. Rooms are very nice and modern. They have an early check in lounge if you arrive and your room isn't ready. Very happy with our stay even though the lobby was being renovated while we were there. Indoor pool was very well maintained.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478078775~“Great Location - Solid Hotel”~About what you would expect from a world class Marriott. Staff was exceptionally friendly. Room was well appointed and modern. Location can't be beat. Exactly what you want when traveling on vacation. Try to get harbor view if you can.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478000306~“Perfect location”~This hotel is a 2 minute walk from Circular Quay so you can get to many of the tourist attractions very quickly. There's tons of restaurants around but watch out for the prices since you're in the tourist area.  The hotel is quite comfortable. I arrived around 8am from the US and luckily got into my room right away. However, they do have an "early arrivals" area for folks like me to hang out if the room is not ready. The room was clean and comfortable. Nothing too special but nothing to complain about either.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_477649477~“Overnight stay pre cruise”~Chose this hotel as it was walking distance from Circular Quay train station and the overseas passenger terminal where our cruise was leaving from. We paid extra for a bridge view and could see the cruise ship in dock. Room was quite large, had some comfy chairs, nice bathroom so loved it~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477618874~“Very very average ”~This Marriott doesn't really do service to the Marriott brand. Whilst lots of money has clearly been spent on refurbishing the reception area, the rooms remain tired and are no better than a three star. The housekeeping staff ignore privacy signs and make as much noise as possible from 730am (complaining to reception made no difference) and there is generally poor sound insulation. Staff on check in and check out were unfriendly at best, rude at worst. Wouldn't stay again - and wouldn't recommend The Intercontinental as a true 5* rather than here. The gym is excellent however - very well furnished.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477436258~“Great hotel !!!!! ”~Beautiful location with great views of the harbour and opera. The renovation looks amazing specially the new restaurant and bar. The front desk staff are very helpful and courteous. I will definitely return to the property on my next visit to sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476964078~“Marriott Hotel Sydney Harbour”~Excellent location. Had a room overlooking the bridge. Excellent view. Hotel was doing some remodeling of the common areas while we were there. It is close to everything a visitor wants to see. I will stay here next visit for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476635844~“Limited services during holiday”~We stayed here overnight on last day in town and found the room to be small but nevertheless comfortable. This is not a high-star hotel, as there is only 1 resto. Seems more aimed towards mass tourism. Upside is that the location is excellent, near Circular Quay, Opera House, Botanic Garden. Main complaint was that cafe and bar were closed every evening of the Easter weekend. Seems unconscionable that an international hotel cannot manage to staff these services even on a holiday.~2~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_476623162~“Fantastic Location - Showing its Age”~The primary draw for this hotel is its prime location right by the Sydney waterfront. It's literally only steps to the cruise ship pier, the famous Opera House and has views of the nearby Sydney Harbour Bridge. So, for location, you really cannot beat this place. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the selection of pillows was quite nice. The bathroom was a mix between contemporary and classic. We've stayed here twice on one time had a room with a bathroom sink with faucets that were quite retro - more like original than by design. But, the room and bathroom were quite functional and nice.  The gym on the fourth floor is technically a separate business but Marriott guests can use it. The machines are really showing their age but there is a good variety of free weights and machines (both strength training and cardio) to meet the needs of even a picky person who just has to work out on vacation or business. Co-located with the gym is a small pool (not great for laps but for lounging) and saunas for men and woman. There is bottled water available at the gym but notably no fruit bowl. I thought all Marriott gyms had fruit. Not a big deal.  We did not eat in the restaurants for any meals. Look, they are super-overpriced and you're literally surrounded by fantastic dining options. Brave the outside world and find an interesting place nearby. That's what we did. I've always been terribly annoyed with the fact that, the more expensive the hotel, the less likely it is to provide complementary food. At least the high-speed internet was free and was apparently not limited in the number of devices you can connect. Lastly, I have to give a shout-out to the desk staff. They know that many of the flights from the US land early in the morning and that cranky and tired travelers are going to want a place to clean up and relax upon arrival. Likewise, the cruises return to Sydney early in the morning with the same dynamic. The staff was fantastic about putting people in their rooms (within reason - we had to forego a room on a higher floor but didn't care). The front desk folks were amazing.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_476088788~“basic hotel standards but good location”~Fully agree with another reviewer--- this is a basic Marriott. It's ok for tourists and families, but not as helpful for business travelers. I had a slightly better experience staying here two years ago, but it feels like standards may be lowering. Checkin and checkout were both slow--- long lines. And further, even at checkout people were not friendly. Beware-- -there is also a 'merchant fee' for paying by credit cards, which in the USA is illegal, but apparently not in Sydney. Room was ok--- comfy bed, fairly modest size of room, clean but basic bathroom. Wifi was good. Fitness center was small, and pool was very small and not appealing. The executive lounge offers food and snacks and beverages throughout the day, but quality and selection are not very good. I believe one evening's snacks made me ill--- food quality issues. Unfortunately I will seek another hotel for my next visit to Sydney.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_476038348~“EXCELLENT -Great Location and Great facilities”~Checked in at 11 am : the receptionist was very helpful and manage to find me a room. High Floor given as requested.

review_475874461~“Good location ”~A very nice hotel with good friendly service. The hotel is showing a lot of wear and tear but I understand they are planning for a refurbishment. Nice views. The lounge is nice but very crowded. Rooms are descent size.  4*~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475706316~“Lovely Stay”~We had a lovely stay here and the staff were very friendly. We did find it disappointing that not one of their restaurants was open for dinner on the Sunday night so we had to go elsewhere. Great location for exploring the Rocks area.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475677427~“Not a JW MARRIOTT ”~This is not the more up scale JW Marriott. It's "Just" a pedestrian Marriott. Consequently the amenities and service is less than one would expect.  Rooms have been refurbished but have problems: nearly no water pressure in the showers, lights that flicker on and off, burned out lights, a shower shelf that is not level causing your shampoo to slide to the floor. The Maid comes to clean oblivious to burned out lights and forgets to replenish shampoos and conditioners daily. This is not normal for a Marriott. The management must be held at fault. The executive lounge has been transformed from a cozy, relaxing space to a charmless institutionalized cafeteria with very poor food. We stayed here 5 nights and gave up even trying to eat the poor quality snacks and food on offer after 1.5 days. Also poor quality wines on offer. Quite a disappointing lounge compared to most executive lounges around the world. I've stayed here 4-5 times over the past 20 years. This will probably be my last stay at the Sydney Harbour Marriott unless management improves this property with proper management.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475675798~“Typical high quality hotel room and facilities”~Not much to say as you get what you expect: a great hotel, with quality facilities, great location at a great cost. We spent one night here before flying off to Fiji and had everything we needed. Valet parking was no hassle, rooms were spacious and my son made use of the pool.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_475485211~“Marriott brand - disappointing”~Hotel is in a great location close to the harbour and circular quay!! You are met by expensive prices and not a great deal of quality!! Front reception staff were not friendly and welcoming and no assistance with luggage offered!! Rooms were okay but could do with a good clean! Beds were comfortable! Gym small and reasonably equipped! Needs to improve on the service side and make some aspects more affordable!! Won't be rushing back anytime soon!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475217371~“Second time staying there -- great location and great staff”~We stayed two nights pre cruise and even though the lobby was under extensive construction we enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect, the staff is great and the executive lounge is excellent. We arranged a get together for about 30 cruise passengers and the hotel gave us a lounge to use. I really like this Marriott and highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_474805279~“Great location ”~Located next to the harbour with a view of the bridge or the opera house. Great gym, very disappointing pool and no hot tub even though there is room for one. The executive lounge has just been renovated which is lovely but it's far too small. There is a constant fight for seats in there and the selections could be slightly better. Also, please get a proper kettle for tea, water from the coffee machine tastes of coffee..... it's very unpleasant. UHT milk for breakfast cereal...... I have no words. The staff at this hotel are all very pleasant. The rooms are basic but comfortable with only a few tv channels. We ordered a platinum gift which never turned up. A few issues which could be easily fixed, otherwise a good hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474516717~“Friends Getaway”~Everything was perfect, from the wonderful room, very comfortable beds, extremely courteous and friendly staff, excellent position for walking to shops, cafes and restaurants, to the outstanding breakfast!~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474462223~“A room with a view”~When ever we're in Sydney we love staying at The Sydney Harbor Marriott because we're never disappointed. This stay was even better as the hotel was recently renovated and it's beautiful! Our view this time was of the bridge. Never get tired of of that view. The service is terrific and the people are friendly!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474378520~“Will keep coming back”~I love the Sydney harbour Marriott. Always feel welcomed there. I visit once a year with friends for an annual girls get together and it's always effortless. Easy check in and out, friendly staff, comfy rooms, nice bar in foyer for a glass of wine and really great location in respect to circular quay and shopping. There may be more upmarket establishments (for a price) but we keep coming back to the Marriott.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474297823~“Good location, service could improve”~It is conveniently located at 100 meters from Circular Quay, where you can take the ferrys to anywhere in Sydney bay, and it is also just 400 meters from the Rocks, and also not far from pedestrian area of Pitt street (ab. 500 metres). Some rooms have view on the bridge. Hotel is quite clean and nice looking. Indoor swimming pool is very small. Breakfast is low average for such type of hotel, and also the quality of service could be improved. Staff does not smile much, you have to wait to be served (both at breakfast and at reception). Overall, if you don't care too much about "feeling spoiled" but more about location, it is a good choice. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473931366~“Great hotel, great location!!”~This hotel is everything you would expect from a Marriott property along with an amazing location! The only reason I did not give a five star rating is because their was a major lobby renovation going on, which created some problems! Although we expected to see construction going on, we didn't expect one of five elevators working, resulting in long waits and extremely crowded elevators! The concierge lounge was nice but crowded and not replenished as much as it could have been. The concierge workers themselves were very helpful as were front desk staff. But the one thing that was amazing about this hotel is the easy walk to the waterfront, opera house, transit trains and buses, and the Rocks district!! This includes about 50 plus restaurants within a ten minute walk from the hotel! After construction is complete this place should be really amazing!!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_473839922~“Slightly disappointing ”~Hotel is lovely good location to sydney harbour and close to train station. But unfortunately our family room was very disappointing the size of the room was a joke and was made to wait 3 hours for the room. Stayed in a lot better Marriott's around the world. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473780432~“Very nice first impression of Sydney!”~I am not usually a Marriott visitor.. This i s not because of Marriott, the AF just seems to always put me up at a Hilton. On my latest trip to Sydney, I had not pre-booked a room. Options were getting thin, so I booked the Marriott. I am glad I did. Front desk staff was exceedingly helpful and the hotel is minutes from the Opera House and bridge, which allowed me to maximize by very limited gound time.  The rooms are modern and recently updated. Overall, a great stay!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473742225~“Great location”~Spent 3 days in this hotel at the start of our holiday. The location is perfect as it is only a couple of minutes away from the buzz of Circular Quay and many restaurants and bars. The area is lively and convenient for catching a ferry to Manly or elsewhere. Our room was very comfortable and we were able to check into it mid morning which was appreciated after a 14 hour flight. Only minor disappointment were the ongoing renovations in the lobby area as I had emailed the hotel to check that they would be completed by March to be assured they would be, however despite that I'm delighted we stayed there and would have no hesitation in recommending it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473727526~“Perfect spot...concierge was excellent”~Such an ideal location to stay in Sydney. 5-10 minute walk to Opera House, Rocks, Botanical Garden and Ferries,and the Hop On/Off Bus is across the street (which is good value) Hotel is well maintained, rooms were very clean and modern and ours had a lovely view of the harbor. Breakfast was quite good. Big callout to Concierge named Greg as he not only gave us great suggestions on things to do, but helped us navigate the local transportation network in a way that saved us $50.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473722086~“Great location”~Easy walk to downtown shopping, the Rocks and Sydney Harbor, this hotel was a wonderful starting point for our daily adventures. Service was top notch. When I was disappointed to learn I could not earn double points because of not using the hotel chain's booking website the desk clerk made it up to me by upgrading our room! Beautiful views!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_473274654~“Great location! Renovation should be amazing.”~The location is stellar, it's close to the Rocks, the Harbour and shipping. Excellent service and friendly staff. There is a large lobby renovation going on which they emailed us about. It looks like it will be a wonderful renovation with new spaces and restaurants. The rooms are freshly renovated and very comfortable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473049107~“Great Location, great service”~Stayed for a week at Marriott in Sydney.  The location is amazing, right at the Circular Quay, walking distance from the rocks, Harbor Bridge and the Opera house.  The rooms are well appointed - spacious and clean. The staff was courteous. The health club and the pool are good - there is also an early check in lounge - but I was offered a room at 9 in the morning with an early check in - the staff was courteous and helpful. The TV had very few international channel options - which was a disappointment considering Sydney is a international city. The breakfast spread was great.  There was renovation work going near the front lobby, which was a little difficult to navigate to the lifts~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473033356~“Great service - great location”~The property was always very good - walking distance from many of the city sights, lots of restaurants nearby, great Marriott service as usual - but with the upgrades, it is even nicer. They've moved the executive lounge down and opened up rooms with exceptional views in its place. Just not a big fan of the larger properties. You lose the personal touch as no one knows your name or connects. The lounge was nice but the food only average and I missed being able to relax and have a nightcap before heading off to bed - something more than a beer or glass of wine. Great gym and sauna though!~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473016801~“Location is Perfect”~Spent 4 nights at the end of our N Zealand/Australia vacation. Wonderful room with a great view of the opera house on the 32nd floor. Nice to have a round glass table with 2 chairs instead of a typical desk, and also a seating area with another 2 comfy chairs. Construction was still going on in the lobby but was not disruptive. We did experience a fire alarm at 2:30 am on our 1st night there. The fire alarms are restricted to each floor. When we opened our door there was no evidence that there was anyone else even on the floor. An announcement finally came over the speaker but we couldn't understand what it was saying. Decided we should investigate. Surprised to find that the elevator was till operational, so we took it to the lobby. When we got off the elevator we were met by a worker sweeping the floor who greeted us with "good morning". There was no alarm going on in the lobby. The receptionist told us it had been set off by steam in the shower of the presidential suite which was located next to our room. Weird, doesn't the shower always produce steam?? They offered to send us a complimentary bottle of wine for our inconvenience. When we arrived back on the 32nd floor we were met by a hotel employee who asked us if the alarm had disturbed us......I started laughing at him and said "you've got to be kidding". He also apologized for the inconvenience. The next morning when we left our room there was a cigarette butt in the hall not far from our door. Hmmmm....... The disturbing part is that the white cigarette butt remained on the navy carpet in the hall for a couple of days. I'd say housekeeping needs to be a little more observant. Despite the disturbing fire alarm I would stay there again. We did receive a bottle of Pinot Noir 2 days later.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_472847180~“A few nights in Sydney”~Minus the construction out front the location is ideal and the service was great. The room was clean with a great view. One strange thing I experienced was the toilet paper was hidden deep under the vanity. I called downstairs for help because there was not toilet paper and they assured me it was there under the sink. I looked and didn't see anything. The guy came up and reached under and it was there. Strange hidden paper. WOW. But no problem. Nice room. Good price. Great location.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_472726332~“Aniko very helpful in arranging for the right room for our family”~We especially appreciated being contacted prior to our arrival by Aniko to make sure the room we had reserved would meet our needs. Somehow our reservation for 3 in a room with 2 beds had become a reservation for a room with one king size bed for 3 persons! Aniko noticed this and straightened the situation out for us prior to our arrival so that check in was swift, easy, and got us to the correct size room immediately. Thank you!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472708091~“The Perfect Location”~With Marriott you can always expect excellent accommodations and service. This property is no exception. There are two exceptional aspects of this hotel: The views and the location. If seeing the city is your priority, this is the place to stay. It is steps away from Sydney's transportation hub, Circular Quay, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, the Rocks, the Royal Botanic Gardens. With that location comes great views. Our room overlooked the hustle bustle of Circular Quay and the Opera House. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, including the short walk to the Cruise Terminal to board our ship, the Seabourn Encore. The Sydney Harbour Marriott is a wonderful place to stay....It hits all the right buttons: for food, service, accommodations, location and views!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472692397~“Second home!”~Stayed at the Sydney Marriott for close to 2 months for work. It is almost next door to my office and just a stone's throw away from my clients. The location is great- just steps away from the Circular Quay.  The room is standard sized with the usual facilities. The lifts are the only negative aspect of the hotel. You end up waiting minutes to be served by the seemingly slow lifts. There were loads of renovation activity recently, but it seems to be over now. The new restaurants and the lounge are truly world class. The staff are friendly and never hesitant to go the extra mile to please you. Special mention to Luke and Narene.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471963565~“Great Hotel and Great Staff!”~We had a wonderful 4-night stay at the Sydney Harbour Marriott in a beautiful room with a harbour view. Although we arrived early in the morning, the front desk staff was welcoming and we were thrilled to find that our room was ready. The location of the hotel couldn't have been more convenient for seeing the sights on our first trip to Sydney and the concierge was very helpful in answering our questions. We especially enjoyed the staff in the executive lounge. We've been lucky to have visited executive lounges in Marriotts all over the world, and this staff was the warmest of any we've found. Special thanks to Jye, Luke, and Rodrigo. We can't wait to go back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_471686106~“Disappointing”~I was surprised on checking in to find refurbishment taking place, as having had no previous notification of it. This room was booked about a year ago and would have thought the hotel should have informed us of this disruption. The lift area was a building site that required navigating around workmen and scaffolding in order to get to the few remaining lifts left working. Housekeeping was about the worst I have ever experienced given that this is supposedly a 5* hotel. Wardrobe space was very poor considering we were a couple staying for 5 nights and generally not fit for purpose. On the positive side the bed was comfortable and the hotel location was ideal for getting around Sydney on public transport.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~2~1~nan
review_471532836~“Great Hotel and what a Location!”~I really loved this hotel which is very close to Circular Quay, so access to everything - the Rocks, Ferries, the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, CBD, open bus tours...I could go on... The hotel has been going through modernization and was really close to being complete when I visited. Teams were going through their paces in anticipation of the new restaurants and bar opening. The result is going to be spectacular but while I was there there was limited opportunity to dine. It wasn't a problem for us at all because there are loads of places to eat in very close vicinity. I can't wait to try it out next trip! Our room was lovely. Very clean, modern and a decent size for this kind of hotel. The bed was a little firmer than some of the other chains but i found it extremely comfortable and really appreciated it. The staff were wonderful from the first moment we were greeted at the door. I have found the staff lovely everywhere we have stayed in Australia this trip but these folks were exceptional. They just could not do enough for you. Prior to this trip, Marriott was not on my husband's radar for business travel - now it's at the top.  The gym and pool were also excellent and very clean. The pool is indoors and the gym is very comprehensive for a hotel. I just can't say enough about this place....all the more reason to return:-)~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_470416912~“Convenient Location, Front Desk needs help”~My colleague and I stayed 4 nights at the hotel. They are undergoing renovation of their lounge/dining area. Their front desk is what needs help! We waited a very long time to check in (10 minutes at least) and over the course of 4 days we always observed people waiting in line. I hope they are going to scale up the number of people working. The concierge area on the second floor was very nice. Most people working there were helpful and friendly. Rooms were very clean and the beds VERY comfortable. It was very humid out so I'm glad we were within easy walking distance of the opera house, bridge, and wonderful public gardens.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470393705~“Conveniently Located”~We stayed at this hotel 11 years ago (for New Years Eve- fantastic!) This time we stayed before and after a wonderful cruise out of Sydney. It is in a great location, within walking distance of the harbor, opera house and The Rocks. This time the hotel was undergoing renovations, which we knew about in advance. It did not impact us however. There is a dining room in-house which has a nice breakfast buffet. The rooms are clean and contain all the amenities one would expect. Front desk is pleasant and extremely helpful, we were allowed to check into our room early in the morning after a 10 hr. flight which we appreciated! Will stay here again on our next trip to Sydney.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_470321507~“Wish we were there to see the finished result”~Stayed for one night using my points. The hotel was in its final day of renovations and although it didn't interfere in the slightest with our sleep it did have an impact on our overall stay. Walking through reception to the lifts was walking through a building site, noisy, dusty, messy. Actually, the screening around the works was poor. Scraggy, ripped curtains was all that separated the public area from the work.  The weather wasn't good when we were there and in an ideal world we would have utilised the hotel dining/drink facilities in the afternoon. The only option for drinks was an outside bar at the back of the hotel. The hotel was charging full rates during renovation and I would have been annoyed had I been paying full price in cash but not having access to full facilities.  Our room was a good size and comfortable but will probably look old in comparison to the brand new modern public areas once unveiled. Likewise with the hotel corridors. They are rather dull and this will be highlighted further after the unveiling.  The staff were friendly and professional and made us feel welcome. This goes such a long way especially when things are a bit up in the air.  When we were checking out the works curtains had been taken down and we got a glimpse of what was to come and it looks wonderful. I wish we'd had a couple more nights to experience all this hotel has to offer. If we were to come to Sydney again we wouldn't hesitate in booking a stay here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469991345~“Great location. Great hotel.”~The hotel is very well located. Walking distance from Circular Quay and Sydney Harbour. It's on Pitt Street, with good options of cafés around and a mall on the corner.  We stayed 3 nights and it was a great stay. The hotel was in renovations, but that didn't interfere at all. The room was a good size, clean and comfy.  We didn't try the breakfast, which seems to be really good. But they do serve free coffee and snacks in the morning on the lobby - great experience for guests.  Hint: book a room and ask not to be near the staff door, as it can be quite noisy in the morning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469967844~“Good stay but not Marriott Level facility (construction in disruptive progress)”~We had a decent stay in this hotel but somewhat surprised at the extensive construction going on and extent it disrupted what likely will be better services going forward. Construction going on 15 feet of where we were having dinner in the temporary dining space allocated. Elevators were sometimes unavailable, actually had to exit an elevator under huge stepladder over opening of doors..... good thing clients aren't superstitious. Very friendly staff trying to work with what they have ... No hot tub available, women's sauna not working, pool very cool water temps. No microwave in rooms nor any available anywhere in building from what we could tell. Small rooms. Based on what it appears is being done , it may be a nice facility when construction is done but was not up to stanards while we were there.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469760502~“Very good”~Was here for the fourth time since 2012 and every time just amazed by the beautiful view of the opera house if you choose the right room. Valet and staff still dedicated and prompt to help you. Can't hardly wait to come back to enjoy the new reception and restaurant. Rooms are convenient, for me a real 5 stars hotel in the middle of the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469544952~“Great Location but too big”~The Marriott at Sydney Harbour is a very big hotel. The location is brilliant and its walking distance from the harbour. The hotel was under renovation (which we were informed about prior to booking) which is probably a good thing as it needed refurbishment. The rooms were a bit old and definitely need to be spruced up. The elevators take forever as it - So plan for that if you need to be on time. The staff was quite good and helpful. Housekeeping was very prompt.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469024605~“Comfortable hotel in a great location”~Spent just one night there. Great location, short walk from Circular Quay Station, The Sydney Opera House and other nearby attractions. Nice and specious room with lovely comfortable bed. We appreciate we could use hotel “early check-in” facilities after the check-out. It was very convenient as our flight back home was in the evening and we wanted to get some rest and take a shower. Friendly, helpful and professional staff.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_469021638~“Excellent hotel”~Excellent hotel and services. We arrived early and they were able to give us a room with an upgrade before 12:00. The hotel room was clean and offered great view of the opera house. Walking distance to the harbour.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468982793~“Great location but under construction”~The Sydney Harbour Marriott is in a great location near the harbour. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately it is under heavy construction. Many of the elevators were not working so there were very long wait to get to and from the lobby. Many times each elevator is packed. They have a temporary business lounge which is OK but not great. I would probably not stay here until the construction is complete.~2~2~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468769538~“Outstanding”~My family and I were in Sydney for 3 nights and naturally as a Platinum Elite Member of the Marriott's reward, we chose this hotel. Unlucky for us that they were renovating their lobby so the appearance was not desirable. However, the experience and service that we received were above expectations from the minute we walked in to check-in to the time we check-out. Everyone was outstanding! Hats off to the staff! We got a room overlook the quay so needless to say it has a very nice view. We can't ask for a better location for such short stay period, we were able to walk to the Opera house, the Quay, the Botanical garden, downtown and all of its glories. Special thanks to the Concierge Lounge staff, they were exceptional (one of the best we have in all of the Marriott's lounges that we've been to). It's experience like this that make us proud to be their Elite members. THANK YOU!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468689817~“Excellent position!”~We were upgraded to a room with a view sf Sydney opera house. Very quiet rooms. Good location for sightseeing.  They are working on a new lobby which will be very good when finished. Caused us no problems.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468604309~“Great Location for jumping off to adventure”~After a short drive from the International airport, we arrived at our hotel with mixed anticipation. The construction was nearing completion of the lobby, but caused little to no inconvenience. Our check-in, receiving the room requested, was fast and we were on our way to the elevators. After a 30 second wait for the elevator, we arrived at our room. The requested roll-in-shower was adequate but required additional towels to prevent overflow onto the carpet even with multiple drains in the floor even though the water pressure was greatly reduced in all the faucets. The King-size bed made us feel like we were at home. Even the roll-in bed was comfortable like all Marriotts. The $28 US buffet breakfast barely met the standard for a Marriott, but all the amenities were present.  The location of the hotel was outstanding. Two short blocks to the harbor where the life of the city takes off. Ferries, the opera house and street lined cafes and restaurants were everywhere. The magnificent opera house was just another 5 block walk and yes, we saw the fat lady sing prior to her death. A fast ferry ride took us to the City of Manly where we found better priced stores for souvenirs of our trip. The beach was beautiful with resaurants lining the walk to and from the ferry. Prices improved the farther away from the ferry you ventured. The return trip to Sydney on the ferrry was a bit rough but it went with the weather outside. Foretunately, the Marriott provided umbrellas that came in handy. Plastic ponchos could be bought from local vendors at a hefty price.  Returning to the the airport required a very early arrival to make it to one's depature time. One lane led to the departure zone so having ample time to make your connection is a must.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468366472~“Hotel in good location, but improvements needed”~Hotel is located within a few minutes walk from the Opera House, Quay and the Rocks area. Rooms nice and spacious. Beds are very good as allways with Marriott very good sleeping quality. The breakfast restaurnat is not living up the standard for a Mariott hotel. Breakfast quality ok, but the surroundings extremely boring - no comfy feeling. Long que in the morning before entering the restaurant, ineffecient organized. Even more worse are the elevators. It seems this hotel has too little elevators or they do no work properly. Fitness room well equiped, but very crowded. In general a nice stay, but not much above average considering the hotel is expensive.~3~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467914361~“whats going on with this hotel”~This will be a great hotel located in a great location. My wife and I loved Sydney. It is a happening city with great attractions and eats. This Marriott could not be in a better location if you are interested in the harbor area or the opera house. Having said that, when we were there a couple of weeks ago the construction is a little overwhelming. It's really noisy, but only in the lobby (we were on the 23rd floor) and there were always a couple of elevators out of service because of floor work. I would still go back there today but would have like d to know what was going on before I got there.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467735875~“Excellent location, average hotel”~If you are looking for the right location this is it. It was close to all the activities and all the walks, shopping etc. Perfect! However for a standard room there is nothing much to say as it was standard room. Unfortunately Marriott was under renovations so wait for it to be unwrapped soon.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_467440718~“Below average stay”~We are frequent Marriott travelers and have come to rely on Marriott for quality and comfort. Our Sydney stay was disappointing.  We were in town on personal travel for 3 nights during a major lobby renovation. Unfortunately, there were no dining options on site for dinner. (This was compensated for by a "20% off drinks coupon" for a neighboring restaurant.)  Although the lobby is receiving a facelift, the rooms need attention also. (There was black mold in the bathroom, in both the shower and on the tile floor.) Carpets are worn and stained. While we were offered an "early arrival" area to freshen up in when our room wasn't ready, of the 3 "stations" in the lounge only one was available for use--and occupied.  Our housekeeping staff was quite slack and hastily "freshened" the room without much commitment to quality.  Overall, our stay lacked the luster we have come to expect from the Marriott brand.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467309147~“Great location”~This hotel is in a great location, close to bus, ferry, train, opera house, and harbour. A lot of restaurants and bars nearby. The hotel staff was very accommodating. The offered to clean our room daily. When we didn't need our room cleaned, the would call and make sure we didn't need anything. We stayed for 5 days and enjoyed it. The only reason it isn't given the highest rating is because of the construction. I wouldn't normally let it get to me but a few times we witnessed customers tripping with heavy luggage over uneven floor covered with floor mats. If you can wait until the construction is over, do it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467289420~“Wow”~Stayed here while in Sydney and the room was great and so was the staff however, during my stay they were doing some renovations and the area near the elevators were not appeasing to the eye and it took a while for the elevators to come. Other than that the area was very close to the opera house and to the ferry docks where you could grab a ferry to virtually anywhere you wanted to go and we did go. The rooms were clean and spacious and the bathroom was fully stock along with the refrigerator. There were eateries within walking distance that were amazing and I would stay here again.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_467105850~“Great location”~Very nice hotel even with the construction going. The staff are all friendly, room service was nice and quick. Very close to opera house, train station and the OPT for cruise customers. There is also a 24/7 store right across the road, and a very nice little cafe on the corner.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_466822834~“Fabulous hotel or will be when the building work is finished!!”~Lovely room on the 30th floor with magnificent views of the Opera House. Very comfortable bed, bathroom etc. Staff helpful & friendly but as soon as you walk into the Reception area there are major building works going on which we were informed would be finished in January but quite clearly were not. When you call the lift in Reception it's quite hazardous, no 'Health & Safety' rules here! There is no restaurant at the moment, just a makeshift room for breakfast or evening meal but nothing like we expected on our very special holiday. If we had known this beforehand we would have cancelled this booking & found another hotel. Due to this disruption we ate breakfast & dinner out all the time, very disappointing! No Bar either for pre dinner drinks or a nightcap!~3~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_466697585~“Good, but couldve been better”~Great location of this Marriott Property, a 3-4 min walk from Circular Quay Station and a 8-10 min walk from The Sydney Opera House, and Westfield (the other way)  I was advised while making the booking that the hotel was under going extensive renovations - just the one make shift restaurant was operational on level 3 and the Executive Lounge which was also cramped to the otherside of the same floor. Check in was quick and as I had arrived at noon (3 hours before the indicated check in time), I wasn't expecting my room to be ready. however, i got my room at 12.30. Clean, spacious well appointed rooms. initially i was given the twin room with the harbour bridge but was upgraded the next day (after I reminded the reception that I was a Gold Elite Member) to the Opera House View King room. Break fast at the executive lounge was simple but just about right for a quick meal before work. Concierge was helpful, they helped me make bookings at a restaurant by the Rocks, (came with special privileges, first drink was free !). However, a small hiccup in all of this; during my room upgrade shift, i had left a shirt behind -I called housekeeping the same evening, they said they'd check and get back, never did. called again the next morning, the said they'd check, no response again - on check out, asked the lady at the reception who called the housekeeping right away, only to tell me that nothing was found !! Expecting great things after the renovations, so will give the property another try.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_466687560~“Great hotel, great location”~Marriott warned us that the lobby is being renovated - everything else was typical Marriott, high quality, predictable room, concierge, etc. Renovation is soon to be completed. Location couldn't be better - take the train ($15 AUD) from the International terminal at the airport, ~2 minute walk to the hotel. Hotel is right in the key location in the city. We are taking a cruise tomorrow and the port is a very short walk from the hotel.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466550992~“Great stay”~Wife, daughter and I stayed twice in last 2 weeks. Could not have been happier with entire staff. Everyone was friendly and went the extra mile to please. Though under construction, much effort is being made to accommodate guests including showers upon early arrival and a free coffee stand in lobby. Great location to many points if interest. Bellmen, especially Geoff, particularly helpful with suggestions and how to instructions. When we go back, this will be our home away from home...again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466403487~“Vacation”~Great location, easy walking distance to harbor, the rocks and downtown. The room was great with a great view and the executive lounge was very good. The hotel lobby was still under renovation making the elevators a challenge at times.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466370693~“Great property with some improvements needed”~I'll address the several reviews regarding the construction activity straight off: don't worry about it! The reception area is attractive and there's a place for people to have a seat if meeting guests there to head out. No, it's not a lounging spot, but that's what happens during construction. As the saying goes "If you want to make an omelette, you've got to break some eggs." The advance messages sent to guests completely set expectations about the construction in progress. The reception staff are to be commended for their efficiency and good nature amidst the banging noises; the guests are just there briefly before heading to their rooms but the staff have to work in that environment. The ground-floor elevator area is dismaying at first glance, but that's quickly gotten over by the second time you use it. And as for the tales of people waiting 15 minutes to get an elevator, I say "do you know just how long 15 minutes really is?" I had the usual elevator experience of a 30+ story hotel: a few times I got an express right to 31st floor; other times (especially mornings when people are either heading to breakfast or checking out), the elevators make many stops and fill up. I guess that I'm just a seasoned traveler. As a Platinum guest I was upgraded to an Opera House view room and had a lovely welcome gift from the GM. The room had a great arrangement of table-as-desk, with drawers adjacent. Closet drawers ample. Hanging closet space a bit tight for two people, but manageable. Very efficient use of space; lovely bathroom; impeccable housekeeping. The only sour note was the temporary Executive Lounge. Not enough was done by hotel management to limit the guests eligible to be in the lounge. I understand that "Concierge" rooms were not being up-sold upon check-in, but I noticed lots of availability in on-line reservations and this practice overloads the lounge. Lounge staff were amazing, to a person. They were always moving at the speed of light to keep the place tidy and supplies filled, but one more staff member clearly was needed to deal with the sheer volume of activity (and the fact that many of the up-sold guests looked as if they were only newly acquainted with indoor plumbing, never mind an Executive Lounge -- the behavior often resembled feeding time at the zoo). Not one day went by that one of the two coffee makers was out of service and I had to inform staff that they were out of whatever the machine needed. A big positive: The food choices were varied by day, were very well prepared, and replenished promptly. I get that in summer months there's more of a leisure clientele than business people to be found in the lounges, but the staff was not enforcing even the minimal dress code of no bedroom slippers or thongs, so the lounge experience was degraded. I'm not sure that when construction has concluded that the hotel management will strive provide a restful Executive Lounge experience. Something for them to keep an eye on, because posting the "smart casual" and "no thongs / flip flops" at the door and turning away guests who are just in their beachwear sets a tone for what's the ambience of the club should be. Either that or just give up and don't put the rule on the lounge card issued at check-in. If you're going to essentially sell Elite benefits for cash to the masses, you need to staff-up accordingly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466229204~“Construction Cacaphony”~I'll cut to the chase. The racket from the construction was annoying. Room service ok  Bed was dated and saggy  Had to ask for Fresh Towels and bedding was made up worse that I do at home, and that is saying something !! Charged for 2 beers in the mini bar, but we don't drink :) Only noticed when the charge came through via e-mail 12 hours afer the fact I wish I had known about the construction othewise i would have booked elsewhere . I'm normally a fan of Marriot properties~2~2~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_466180094~“construction & havoc not maintained”~we visited Australia for the first time and this facility was fairly central to everything, it was in CBD, close to the transportation, buses and ferries, Opera House and Harbour Bridge. When we booked, we did get warned of the lobby construction, but there was also a lot of other constructions outside, which was noisy. We had the AC pretty much all the time, but after a few hours, we were getting congested and realized that the filter was removed and the vents were dusty. Maintenance didn't do anything. We didn't have toilet paper and had to ask. Our city view was behind buildings. The gym was decent. The pool is indoor so no sun. The beds were a bit uncomfortable and squeaks and you might need more than 2 pillows to get comfortable.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465832459~“Constant, continuous, incessant aggravation. AVOID during construction!”~Yes, the hotel in under construction, so I highly recommend you avoid this location. There is constant drilling, banging, scraping, you can't hear anyone in the lobby. The bellhops wore earplugs. Some of the elevators were not working, so getting from your floor to the lobby in the morning is an enormous production of hurry up and wait...a long time.....there is a maze of dividers and separation walls that you have to navigate to get in to the hotel, and through the lobby. That said, my updated room was up to normal international hotel standards, however the hallways, interior, etc. all have a 1980s feel, even after the reno. Despite fantastic location, I will not go back!! No construction discount was offered.~2~2~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_465642392~“Location can't be Beat!”~This hotel is in an airport excellent location; it's only minutes to the CBD which hosts the shopping experience of a lifetime. There, you'll find stores such as COTTON, ZARA, TOP SHOP, Myers Department Dtore, and many stores local to Australia. My favorite was the Queen Elizabeth building. Not only does it make for excellent photo oops, it also offers unique clothing stores and wonderful coffee shops. They are also steps from Circular Quay we chose the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge.  The rooms here are great and the beds very comfortable. I was spoiled by my upgraded room that offered an awesome view of Circular Quay. Service was consistent with the Marriott brand - it was great. The front desk personal and bell hops offered excellent recommendations for coffee and light meals nearby. They were also nice enough to take photos of me in front of the building. I was sad to leave, but only one night was necessary as my sister lived nearby in Rushcutters Bay, not far from Kings Cross.  You will not regret your stay here! Can't wait to return!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464990098~“Renovations do impact your stay”~While they say renovations will be done in March, it is highly unlikely based on the progress we saw. The renovations do impact our stay. Much of the front of the hotel is block by construction. The entire lobby is under renovation, as is the third floor where the restaurant and Executive Lounge are located. From what we could see of the final product will be great, but it does not make the hotel currently an inviting place to stay. As a Platinum member I received an upgrade to a very nice two room suite. While the living area was nicely furnished, the furniture was some of the most uncomfortable I have ever tried to sit on. The sleeping area was up to Marriott standards. It would have been a great room if the furniture was a little more comfortable. Service was very good. I did check in early with the Marriott app, but have noticed that my request for extra towels in my Rewards profile is never accommodated. We also never received the requested text that our room was ready. The app would be great if the promised features worked. The location of the hotel is perfect for most leisure visitors to Sydney. Once the construction is completed this will be a great hotel. Until it is finished be aware that there are a few issues.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_464868353~“Good location, but shortfall in service”~The hotel is about 5 min walk to the opera house and 10 min to Rocks area. The location is convenient and some high floor rooms can get you the harbor bridge views.  The hotel is undergoing renovation and there is a lot of chaos everywhere.  1. It take 7-10 min to get an elevator during morning and evening hours. Once you get the elevator, it literally stops on all floors. There is no presence of the hotel staff to direct guest or coordinate elevators. 2. The check-in and check-out could take 5+ min as there is always a queue at the front desk 3. The people traffic is usually from the cruise with guests for 1-2 nights stay - so that leads to additional chaos at the lobby area - sometime it resembles like a waiting area at a train station. 4. Overall staff is friendly, but not attentive. There is always a coordination delay from service operator and the room service. I had to remind 2-3 times to replenish water or bathroom amenities - but seemed never a priority. 5. Rooms are average size with visible wear and tears in the bathroom, This is not a family friendly hotel and I felt for the price and quality, Marriott can do better. This is a direct reflection of the management team as well.~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_464649649~“TERRIFIC LOCATION”~Although there were noisy renovations being undertaken, it did not affect our stay and I gave it 5 stars because of the location. Lovely room - we could just see the bridge and a bit of a harbor - but it was only a few minutes walk to the ferry and harbour tour area. We were close to The Rocks and went around the weekend market. It's also about a 10 minute walk to the beautiful botanical gardens.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_464609691~“Great location. Decent hotel.”~Visited this hotel for business. They warned us about construction. While that was a nuance, it was to be accepted. The location is great as was the wheelchair accessible room (805 roll in shower). All people super friendly. Each room had a converter. The hotel needs new furniture and a better breakfast chef (every damn day they burnt my raisin toast). The decor is o.k.at best.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464543479~“Great Service Moment”~Visited this hotel under renovation but the staff were so well drilled at ensuring any shortfall to the norm was filled by fantastic customer service. I think service in Sydney is not the best but this team is world class.  19th February was booking out at 4 am my car service provided by my airline had really let me down the guys in reception especially the young gent really saw I was stuck and in danger of missing my flight. These guys sorted everything out including phoning the airline and the chauffeur service to try and work everything through to a successful conclusion. Great Service Moments are what people really remember and this is up there as one of the best. This is where I will always stay on future visits to Sydney no questions asked !!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464455640~“Still good but currently some minor issues”~As usual my choice for the initial jet lag busting night on arrival in Australia.  Usually pay for the night before to ensure early morning access to room, and room was ready as booked. Was given one of the smaller rooms on this occasion, which is adequate but still small given room price and if two suitcases etc, it's a little snug.  Hotel currently undergoing major works in lobby area, looks a sight but check in was fast and friendly. Lounge is still relocated at the moment, but no issues. Did not experience any noise or inconvenience from works. Biggest complaint by far was availability and speed of lifts, many angry guests and folks launching themselves into full lifts due to wait times. Assume this is due to building works as not normally this bad. Still a sound choice for Sydney, but will be glad when work is over.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464438074~“Good location”~We arrived fairly early in the morning and were quickly checked in. While I don't recall the hotel l having much in the way of charm or a local vibe it is located close to the ferries, the park and the Opera House. The staff were helpful and everything in our rather standard Marriott room.worked. it is a well run hotel in the touristy Rock's area which is a tourist favorite for all the nearby sites. I would return.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_464179882~“Worst Marriott Hotel Experience”~Hotel under major construction that we were told about approximately 2 weeks before arrival. Letter stated construction to be completed by mid March. There is no way this is a valid date. Hotel is an absolute mess and not just because of the cosmetic changes to lobby and top floor where they have added 7 rooms by taking away executive lounge. However there is major, very loud construction underway with hazards created out front including a cement truck. Room are old and beat up. We were told we were given an upgraded room because of our platinum status. If that room was upgraded then god help where regular guests are staying. Rugs coming up bathroom sink didn't drain properly and when draining made loud noise and was leaking onto floor. Other then the "cheery" misleading front desk staff most of the other staff far from customer focused. Phone system, routes all calls to "at your service" and they refuse to connect you to the area you want like the front desk. They insist on taking a message.  The temporary executive lounge is VERY poorly managed, staff is frazzled keeping up with demand, constantly out of staples like sugar packets, water etc. Floor hallways are dark and dingy. Guests openly complaining to each other. Other couple we were traveling with didn't get room cleaned until after 8:00pm and had to call for towels in order to get ready to go out for the evening. Asked front desk for GM contact info and would only be given information for director of operations. We will never stay there again.~1~nan~5~nan~1~nan~2~nan
review_463924505~“Lesson learnt, never again.”~My first stay at this hotel and I'm sorry to say my last. I had an early morning start, 4am, this morning so I jumped into the shower only to find there were no bathroom amenities, no shampoo, no shower gel etc. Not a biggie in the scheme of things but one would expect more from a. A hotel that prides themselves on their luxury rooms, b. Charge a substantial amount per night! It took several calls and over an hour to finally get housekeeping to deliver the missing items. Last time I was in Sydney I stayed at the Tank Stream Hotel, it was a big mistake not to stay there again. Lesson learnt.~1~nan~nan~4~nan~3~1~nan
review_463774978~“Hotel is under construction”~The location is good but they didn't tell me this hotel is under construction until February. We were missing some toiletries and multiple bottles were partially used. The accommodation generally were just okay and not worth the price.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463655699~“Nothing out of the ordinary but well located”~The staff is perhaps the best part of this hotel. Welcoming and helpful. The early check-in lounge was much appreciated since it offered somewhere to rest upon early arrival, with coffee, a few snacks, wifi and a shower. Unfortunately, our least favorite part of our stay was the room itself which felt cold and lacked that certain "je ne sais quoi" that you would expect from the Marriott. We have stayed at 3 star hotels where the room was more cozy and warm. Only the lobby is under renovation, however feels like the rooms should also undergo some revamping and redesigning. The elevators were quite slow one morning. We had to wait some 20 minutes to get to the lobby and in the end had to force ourselves into an overjammed elevator. Sure did not feel like a Marriott experience. On a more positive note, location is great. A very short walk from the Circular Quay station which makes it easy to get to and from the airport by train. Also many wonderful restaurants within walking distance and a 10 minute walk to the Opera House and Botanic Gardens. We would say 3 stars for the hotel itself and 5 for location which gives it an average of 4 overall.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463622599~“Australia to New Zealand”~Our trip "down under " Sydney was fabulous.Custom would have been a breeze except for the fact that our Visas were not properly filled out . Be advised that you should expect to not be at your best after 24+ hours of flying. We booked our 2 days at Marriott near the Sea terminal to see some of Sydney We should have booked 4. Jet Lag is something else. I digress, you need those days to recover and truly see Sydney it is a fantastic city. From this hotel it is easy walking to shopping,restaurants and attractions. The room was adequate and the bed was comfortable. We had a wonderful view of the harbor. Food was great service was also excellent. I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463613052~“Renovations damper the experience”~The rooms were modern and nice to have a table and 2 chairs that acted as the desk as well. The lobby area was too small for the number of guests checking in and out at certain times of the day. The executive lounge had nothing special about it- one white one red one sparkling wine and beer for evening drinks ( cheap wine). Food was extremely basic eg bowl of spinach leaves, samosa, mini pies, and repetative. The room rates fluctuated daily and suddenly I became locked in at a higher rate.The hotel didn't want to care about this at all.Mistakes were made with my billing instructions and now I need to make the claim for rewards points myself as I gave up dealing with the hotel. Hotel seems full of promises but no delivery and it is clear that there was no guest relations manager to be found.~3~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan
