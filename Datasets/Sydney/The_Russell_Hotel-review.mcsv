review_478601486~“Hotel was full of character, although dated in places”~We stayed for 5 nights in a superior ensuite and the room was clean but was in need of decoration, chocolates on the pillow at bedtime was a nice touch. Breakfast was cereal, toast, pastries, fruit, juices and coffee which we found perfectly adequate. All the staff we met were extremely helpful. The location was perfect, a short walk to Circular Quay, the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_478345776~“After cruise drinks”~Friends were staying here so made sense to stop in at the bar for a few refreshing ales... Staff were friendly, the guitarist was pretty good too. Close to Will be keen to go back again soon. Check out the rooms of you get a chance. It's a bit of a rabbit warren to get around but very quirky and is an old nurses quarters. Supposed to be haunted if that's your cup of tea!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478226303~“location, location, location”~This is such an amazing value centrally located in Sydney. It's in the rocks district so it is surrounded by great restaurants, beautiful views (the bridge, the waterfront, the opera house and garden) and close to the metro and cruise quays for easy access to the airport, ferries, or just visiting any area of sydney. On the day we boarded our cruise ship it took us 5 minutes to wheel our bags across the street to a ship. Easy! The cons would be that there are shared bathrooms (they're kept very clean by staff and we bought shower shoes and they provided robes so even middle of the night visits weren't uncomfortable), that the wifi service is poor and often messages couldn't even go through text in the middle of the night because it took forever to load and connect, and we didn't have air conditioning- in summer that might have been a problem but in April the fan provided in the room kept us comfortable enough. Also this is kind of a busy area of Sydney with lots of people out around the bar area on the street outfront at night and they are doing construction along the side alley (during the day) across the street and they leave all the lights on in the construction area at night- so coupled with jet lag I often had trouble sleeping through the night because of the light and noise on street below. The hotel's best features are the location and the amazing breakfasts. Fresh fruit daily (and they rotate the choices so if you stay for a week like we did you don't eat the same exact fruit daily), amazing pastries and breads like pain au chocolat and nutty fresh loaves of bread with choices of jams, vegemite, and butter daily, coffee, tea, and several juices daily, tasty greek style yogurt and a variety of granolas daily. We considered it a hearty breakfast daily and on the day that we couldn't stay for breakfast because we had an early surf lesson we popped in quickly and made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to go and nobody minded. That was awesome because I was afraid we might arrive hungry at our lesson but instead we were fueled for 4 hours! The breakfast area is in a commercial bar beneath the hotel which is clean and private and does not stink like people were drinking there hours before (which you might be afraid of if you hear that you're eating in a bar). Instead it reminded me of a little european bistro that serves cocktails and wine in the evenings. It has a big picture window and the sun shines in and the news is on quietly in the background so you can see whats going on in the world if you wish. We really enjoyed every breakfast we had here! All in all I highly recommend this hotel particularly to people who want to stay and tour extensively around sydney using metro or have easy access to all the tourist sites and dining in the rocks area or who plan to cruise because the location could not have been better for that. We got a great value booking for a week!~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476249371~“One night at The Russell”~We spent one night at The Russell Hotel before our cruise and found it to be perfect for us. Since we arrived Sunday morning and our room was ready when we arrived, we were able to enjoy the Market not far from the hotel. It's held every weekend and could be characterized as a large craft fair alongside permanent eateries. We also enjoyed a 1 1/2 hr walking tour with Josh at 6:30 and then joined some others at 8 at one of the gathering spots near the Opera House. It was so simple to wheel our suitcases down to the cruise port terminal in the morning after having complimentary breakfast downstairs in the bar area and using the wifi for emails in the sitting room. One must be able enough to handle a suitcase with wheels going back down the side street after check out but other than that it was fine. Warning: the building is historic and contains many levels and although it has an elevator, one can hardly get anywhere in the building without going up at least one step or set of stairs. I would not recommend for granny in a wheelchair. We chose a room with a bath down the hall (Rm #4 across from elevator) which was not a problem as we woke at 4 am (different time zones) and had no competition for the shower or bathroom which were separate. It had a fan and was high enough that we left the window open. It was quiet and we felt safe.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475056794~“Great boutique hotel in the historic heart of Sydney ”~Tucked in behind and old pub, this hotel is packed with charm. It is also in an excellent location close to the rocks, the museum of contemporary art, and circular quay. The rooms aren't large, but they are comfortable and quaint. The hotel also has a nice communal lounge and a rooftop terrace.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474490245~“close to Circular Quay”~We wanted a Hotel close to Circular Quay for our cruise. This was perfect. Just out the door and across the road and the ship was almost on our doorstep. Very close to the station also and to the Circular Quay shops and Opera House~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_473185156~“Value for money”~A warm welcome, a comfortable bed (in a compact room) and a very good location make this hotel hard to beat in terms of value for money. Considerably cheaper than most other central location hotels it provides a totally adequate base if you are planning to spend most of you waking hours exploring the city. It is a warren made up of several buildings and even the lift cannot remove the need to carry luggage up and down some stairs, but staff are helpful and will lend a hand if you need help. We were departing on a cruise from Circular Quay cruise terminal and that is little more than 100 metres away if you use a few steps and 200 metres if you take the sloping road. Breakfast is included, but basic, and when we arrived later than most guests it was well sought into and the duty staff that morning seemed more interested in chatting to her colleague than replenishing the stock, She did so eventually and it was O.K considering it was included in an already reasonable price for the room.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_472767286~“Historic & Uncomfortable”~I knew I was in for an adventure when the cab was unable to drop us off at the front door of the hotel. We had to be dropped off across the street and once we crossed the street we had to walk up a 40 yard- 45 degree incline because the main entrance to the hotel is on a pedestrian only pathway. A difficult task when you are traveling with your mother who has a bad leg and there are 4 rolling suitcases between you.  Another unfortunate happenstance was due to two cruise ships being in town, it seemed as though the entire hotel was checking out and in at the same time. The tiny elevator (singular because there is only one) and extremely narrow hallways are not set up to accommodate this mass exodus and entrance at the same time. Check in is situated on the 2nd floor of this hotel, when we took the elevator up one floor the door opened to hallways full of luggage, we could not even get off the elevator - it was quite comical. For me the difficulties of this hotel outnumbered its charm. There are numerous stairs you must go up and down in between floors, making it hard for people with disabilities. The beds are NOT comfortable - at least not the one in room 26. We were confirmed for a room with two twin beds and got a room with one full size bed. The view from the windows in our room were other rooms' windows, if everyone opened their windows we could all see each other. The decor of the rooms kept with the decor and theme of this 1800s establishment which was nice to look at but not comfortable to sit on. To open the doors you had to use a skeleton key and only one key is given per room which is not convenient if you and your roommate are doing different activities. The walls are very thin so we were able to hear other members of the party we were traveling with coughing all night - they were in a room two doors down. The reception desk is only open from 7AM to 10PM so if you have to leave prior to 7AM to catch a flight you will miss the free breakfast and need to check out the night before. The bathroom had a beautiful and very large shower / tub but we were too afraid to use it because of the sign posted on the bathroom mirror (I have included a photo). In essence to ensure you don't set off the smoke detector (for which you will be fined) with steam from the shower you must open the bathroom window but doing that allows your neighbors a complete view.  In all fairness I do want to say that the staff at this hotel is extremely helpful, accommodating and nice. They handled the absolute craziness of check in with grace under pressure. We stayed at this hotel because it was chosen by a member of our larger group - this is typically not the kind of hotel I would normally stay at, while I appreciate historical hotels I prefer them to have a little more comfort. (Think Waldorf Astoria or Hotel Danieli). The price we paid to stay at this hotel was more than what other friends paid to stay at other hotels in the Rocks area of Sydney and they had larger more comfortable rooms.  If you are looking for historic and charm you will probably be happy here but if you are looking for comfort I do not recommend this hotel.~3~2~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472229441~“Lived up to all expectations”~Nice room, efficient and friendly check in, our room had a delightful garden balcony. Close to everything ... Fortune of War ... restaurants.

review_470726472~“No AC in some rooms”~It's a very nice hotel, this we the second time we stayed there this month. Our last visit we had a room with AC and ceiling fan. This time the room had no AC but had a ceiling fan. The weather was nice but you needed to keep the window open. I love the fresh air. It was a Saturday night and with the windows open the parties in the alley we quite loud and obnoxious. I understand the hotel is not responsible for the noise in the street but, if there we AC we could have slept through the night. For just a little more you could stay 2 blocks down the street. Everyone was extremely friendly and polite at the hotel, along with just about everyone in Australia. Hope I can return some day!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470362968~“Nice enough, but no air conditioning”~The Russell Hotel calls itself a "boutique" hotel, and I guess that's so. My room was nicely appointed, antique furniture, a nice bay window seat, the bed comfortable, attentive staff, and good housekeeping. The building itself is old and quaint. My view was just into an office building across an alley. The MAJOR downside is that my room (and I believe none of the rooms) was NOT air conditioned. Fortunately there was a ceiling fan that made it tolerable, but Sydney was hot and humid, with frequent rains during my stay. AC would have made my stay much nicer. The room did have a small dorm-sized frig mini-bar with expensive drinks in it for purchase, but enough room for a bottle or two of what I bought elsewhere to keep myself hydrated. The hotel's location is good, a 5 minute walk to the Circular Quay, the central transportation hub for Sydney. There was also a booking mix-up and I ended up double booked for two rooms. I didn't know that until I arrived. They charged me one night for the unused room. I guess the error was mine, but booking months earlier was confusing, and I fault them for not clearly notifying me: "are you sure you want two rooms?". They did send me two confirmation notices, but I did not notice that each had different reservation numbers. It started my stay on a sour note and didn't get much better when I discovered the lack of AC. The other caution is that the obvious entrance to the Russell coming from the Circular Quay is only the entrance to the downstairs pub. There is a narrow set of stairs from the pub to the second floor reception desk, but you have to carry your luggage up those stairs. The preferable hotel entrance is on the opposite side of the building, with either wider stairs or a lift to get you and your luggage to reception. So keep going around to the other side. The final negative factor is that there was a clear warning sign in my room to keep the bathroom door slid shut while showering or the steam from the shower could trigger the fire alarm. Should that happen I would be fined $1,250 by the local fire company for a false alarm. Perhaps in an old building like that there is nothing that could be done to mitigate that = move or change the sensor, etc., and I certainly made sure the door was shut, and kept my showers short, but yet another "you're kidding me!" moment. All in all I wish I booked elsewhere. The positives did not outweigh the negatives for me.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~4~nan
review_469498016~“Great location, boutique hotel with quirks”~I've stayed at the Russell before and now they have installed a lift and upgraded a part of the hotel. The breakfast is OK (used to be a cooked breakfast but now continental style). I like the sitting room and the rooftop area and my room was quite nice but no view. It's a bit of a hassle lugging suitcases up and down the rabbit warren type building because of the steps to get to the room once you have exited from the lift and no one offers to help so best to ask. Its best features are the historic building itself and the location(easy walk to Barangaroo). It was quite pricey but rates were higher I guess for the days around Australia Day.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468673631~“Boutique Hotel - Great Location!”~The Russell is ideally located in The Rocks area – you can walk to all the top sights i.e. Circular Quay (and the ferry system); Opera House; Sydney Harbour Bridge and CBD. The people at the Russell were wonderful. The rooms were clean and the free wifi worked great! We reserved a “standard double room with ensuite bath” and they were a little small and the bed was “full” size so we got two of those rooms and I’m glad we did. Fresh flowers in the rooms were a nice touch. Continental Breakfast (in the downstairs bar area) is included in the room rate and was plentiful and delicious. Each room had a little mini bar refrigerator stocked with wine; beer, water; soda and snacks (for an additional charge). The common rooms – the Sitting Room/Library lounge and Outdoor Rooftop Terrace were great additions to our stay. This was a non-smoking property but people were allowed to smoke up on the rooftop terrace. Only issues to point out – 1) stairs (they have an elevator – but it doesn’t necessarily stop exactly at a floor) for example – we took the elevator from the ground floor to the reception area – got out of the elevator and then stepped down 3 or 4 steps to the reception area. Back up the steps to the elevator. This could be an issue for some. 2) no air conditioning in our rooms (although I guess some rooms do have air) and it was HOT when we were there end of January. Now you can open the windows for fresh air and they do have ceiling fans. I found it a little loud at night with the window open but HAD to have the window open for cool air. 3) no in-room safe to lock up valuables. Would I stay here again? Yes! It is a little old and creaky (boutique) but it was comfortable, clean, and ideally located.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_468535373~“Historic hotel with character in a perfect location”~We stayed at the Hotel Russell during a brief visit to Sydney. The location is perfect for a visit to the city, convenient to the major sites in the city. Our room, number 21, was a good size for an older hotel. The staff were friendly and provided assistance as needed. Definitely a better choice then a typical cookie cutter modern hotel. We would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467940940~“Quirky!!!”~For those who like a bit of history, this quirky hotel is great! It's an old building, but is worth a stay. Great choice of rooms, with private or shared bathroom options. We had a shared bathroom and it was fine....no lines! Lovely staff.....very helpful and friendly. There is a lift, but a few stairs too, so watch that if you have mobility issues. Perfect for those going on a cruise from Circular Quay as the ship docks 5 minutes away!!!! Lovely restaurants downstairs and in the near vicinity. Breakfast was a very good continental. Happy with our stay and would stay again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_467929728~“Quaint Hoel in Perfect Location”~A 10 minute walk from the cruise terminal and Central Quay; 20 minute walk to the Opera House and Harbour Bridge; and in the heart of the historic district. This boutique hotel was perfectly located for us as we came off a cruise and wanted to spend a few days exploring the city. Staff and management are very helpful and the service is excellent. The rooms are small especially if you have lots of luggage; the beds are comfortable. There is a pub below the hotel for food or drink. Expect to pay a little more because of the location but it's worth it. Some rooms have shared baths but robes are provided. We had a nice experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467380561~“Brilliant location boutique hotel ”~I love this hotel! We wanted to stay for one night in Sydney and not pay too much I found this hotel and booked 8 months prior to our trip so I got a really good deal! I was really wary because we booked a shared bathroom but I had no need to be. The bathroom was so lovely with a large full glass shower and Molton Brown toiletries! Our bedroom was small but beautifully decorated with antique furniture it was quirky and boutique with little chocolates on the pillow! The only downside is we were opposite the lift and because the building is old the floorboards creaked so we could hear people using it early in the morning but for what we paid and how beautiful it was I didn't mind! Thanks for a lovely stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467134497~“Friendly”~This was a five star experience rather than a five star hotel. We were in room 26 which is a large room and large bathroom, with nice antiques. It was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was ok. The room only had views of hotel walls but it was very quiet. There are small flights of stairs to get to it but there are rooms available with no stairs if this is an issue. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. I left my phone charger there and they were kind enough to get it to the ship we were leaving on which was much appreciated. We had lunch in the bistro which was delicious, and the waitress was very friendly. This hotel is in such a great spot we would love to stay again, when not in a hurry to get on a cruise.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466968052~“Historic, charming with an ideal location”~Morning breakfast in the polished brass and wood pub room is the ideal way to start your Sydney day in this charming, historic hotel in the Rocks! From our hotel we walked along the Quay to the bridge and Opera House, took the harbor ferry to Manly Beach. We even took the ferry from our cruise ship to the Quay and easily walked to the Hotel. Our room was tastefully appointed in keeping with its historic nature; also included a hot pot for tea, coffee; hair dryer, etc. We paid a bit extra for a private in-room bath. The pub is well used by both locals and tourists; we ate in the pub one evening and enjoyed the meal.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_466507195~“Perfect location, perfect accommodation. ”~Staying just north of Brisbane but knew we couldn't travel all the way from the UK without visiting this beautiful city. Get off the the train at Circular Quay just a few minutes walk to this lovely Hotel. Queen Mary II tied up at the dock side with the bridge to its left and the Opera House to the right. Room 20 was a generous size with a nice bathroom and a door to a small courtyard with a table and chairs for you and the room next door. The hotel is full of character and comfort with a nice size guests lounge. All the way downstairs for the all you can eat and drink breakfast. This area doubles up as a pub but exclusive use for guests in the morning. All the way to the top of the building for a roof terrace and smoking area if you are looking for that. Recommend this accommodation, not just for the location in the rocks, for the great staff that keep the place in really good condition and deal with your queries with a smile.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462818283~“Great location”~We stayed in the Russel hotel for a few nights in December and changed a few rooms. Location is perfect. Very close to Circular Quay and therefore no need for taxi when going from or to the airport. Main spots for a tourist are nearby, Circular Quay as a boat hub is also near. Perfect especially for a first time visitors to Sydney! This is relatively small hotel, and has several different kind of rooms. We really liked room 10 (large double), which doesn't have ensuite bathroom - but that was not a problem, as the bathroom was used only by one other room. Room is located on the second floor, overlooking quite busy street. It is large and very bright - though some could be bothered by the noise. It could also get quite hot in summer (i don't think it has an air-con), but we didn't have such high temperatures. On the other hand, when we booked on a different day a small double without ensuite bathroom (nr. 11), we changed the next day to a different room. Room was small, cramped and bed was quite narrow. It would be nice for a budget hotel, but this was not a budget price. Afterwards we changed to larger double with ensuite bathroom, which was perfectly fine. It overlooked on the internal courtyard, and was therefore very quiet - the downside was the fact that it had limited light and privacy, as the windows looked on a internal corridor. There is an elevator in the hotel, though one will have to carry the luggage over a few stairs.  Pricewise the hotel is a mixed bag... you can get a really good bargains on some days, while on other days even this hotel can be quite expensive even for the cheapest rooms. I would suggest picking the room carefully and i would small doubles. As i said, my favorite room was spacious, but without ensuite bathroom. Regarding noise, its again hit and miss. Some rooms are quieter than others - on a busy evening you could hear music from the pub below in the rooms directly above it. But again, in my opinion, those rooms are the best value and size-wise. WIFI is free, but do not expect it to be fast.  Buffet breakfast was included and served downstairs in the pub. It was OK, with fresh pastry, fruits, yogurts, and a selection of jams. Nothing really special, just a good start of the day. Staff was always very helpful and accommodating. When we changed the rooms, all we needed was to leave our luggage in the room and they would carry it to the new location. Shared bathroom was clean.  There is a small lounge area by the reception, with fresh lemon water available.  Next time I'm in Sydney i will certainly return to the hotel as the location is excellent and the hotel itself is more than adequate! I value this hotel 4 out 5 just because the selection of the rooms can be a hit or miss and sometimes prices can be quite high.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_461588236~“It is certainly quaint ”~A short trip to Sydney, used an app to find this small hotel in the rocks. High 30's and no rooms with AC resulted in having to leave the one small window open to try to get a little air. Bed very small and mattress well beyond use by date. Very noisy at night because of location. Room may be part of a historical hotel but the rate is similar to a modern hotel. Breakfast very limited in choice. Good location but can't really recommend unless you are an aficionado of older NSW buildings.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461049570~“Wonderful Visit”~If you've read reviews on the hotel, you know it's an historic property and therefore not the same as staying in a modern hotel. We had a room with an ensuite bath and A/C - not all have these features. Next to our room was a lovely sitting room and there is a neat outside roof deck.  Breakfast is included and was a pretty good buffet. The best feature was the location in the Rocks. Convenient to many things and just a neat area. We booked as a pre-cruise package so transportation for us and another couple we were traveling with was included - $55 value.  Lots of stairs in the building but they do have some accessible rooms. Not all spaces are.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459534081~“Good fun at The Russell! ”~If you are looking for good, unpretentious accommodation in a fantastic location, unrivalled by grand hotels, then this is it! Set, literally paces away, from Circular Quay this hotel is a perfect base for all activities.  We stayed in Room 22, which is street facing, but we heard no noise. The room was large, the bed comfortable, the bathroom small, but shower perfectly adequate.  Breakfast was taken in the bar below each morning and there was plenty of choice.  A big thank you to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable, but particularly Maxine who kindly let me have a shower, before going to catch our plane, on one of the hottest days recently, very much appreciated.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458598541~“Girls weekend”~My sister and I spent a lovely 4 days at the Russell Hotel in The Rocks, Sydney. The Russell is across the road from the Museum of Contemporary Art, a couple of hundred meters from Circular Quay and a couple more from the Opera House. Right in the heart of the Rocks and around the corner from the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge you can't go wrong staying at the Russell. It's a lovely old style hotel with beautiful rooms. I loved looking out the window every morning across the road to Circular Quay which is where you catch the Manly Ferry across the most beautiful harbour in the world the the lovely beachside suburb of Manly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457637019~“Best location!”~This was our second third visit to Sydney and we couldn't have been happier with this hotels location. Literally a 5 minute walk to Circular Quay. The staff are extremely lovely and helpful, note to Fiona and Maxine! Fiona allowed us to freshen up as we were early so we got to take a shower and leave our bags etc. Maxine was very helpful as I left a piece of clothing at the hotel and she posted it out to me at another hotel further North which I was very grateful. The hotel is full of character, with really comfy beds, pillows etc. Breakfast is downstairs in the bar area and is ample. There was no air conditioning in our room which was a little rough as the heat was stifling whilst we were there, but it certainly wouldn't put us off going back and I think other rooms did have it. Would highly recommend this hotel for location, friendliness, value for money etc. We'll go back!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

Situated in the "Rocks" area of Sydney. (Artsy, with an old town feel near some of the best restaurants.) The harbor attractions, water taxis are a walk across the street from the front of the hotel. Its clean, air conditioned, quiet, big rooms and a bit dated . . . or I should say a vintage hotel experience. It has rooms with and without bathrooms. The bottom floor of the hotel is the bar, and restaurant. The front desk is on the second floor. Central to art galleries, quaint back streets, and great eateries.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_453231563~“THE LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE RUSSELL HOTEL CONTINUES WITH A PASSION”~The first stay at the Russell 2 years ago began an infatuation with this quaint, quirky, idiosyncratic mouse-house of a hotel. (See my previous reviews). A second stay a year later confirmed that my romance with this place and its people was blossoming into something stronger. And this time around, New Years 2018, real love is in he air for this unique hotel and the ultimate guest experience. From a warm welcoming check-in, where our room was available and ready for this weary traveller at 9-30 a.m.!!!  Room 10 in the tower was old-world elegance, even a fireplace to give the room a sense of time and history that has vanished elsewhere in the chrome and plastic accomodation world. We watched the New Years fireworks from the rooftop garden, just 6 guests and mucho vino flowing to usher in the new year with strangers who became friends, which seems to be the motto and intention of the Russell Hotel and its perfect staff. The location of the Russell, in the heart of the Rocks is always appealing, but really it is the consistency of the high standards of the management and staff, and the genuine care for the happiness of its guests which draws us back again and again, to a place where you LOVE to return. So, yes folks, it is love which makes this a special place in our hearts. So when you check in, tell 'em Sam says je t'aime.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_453182526~“Boutique Hotel Close to The Circular Quay”~This 1840 era hotel is across the street from the Circular Quay and walking distance to both the opera house and harbor bridge.Located in The Rocks historic area of Sydney. Breakfast was available in the bar located below the hotel every morning. Drawbacks of the hotel is that some rooms share bathrooms ( we didn't) and the lack of air conditioning. Some room are quite small. There are two lounge area to stretch out and relax since it would be hard to do in the rooms. There is a lounge/ sitting area near the reception desk which has a balcony overlooking George Street and a rooftop sitting area with tables and umbrellas. The reception staff is friendly and helpful.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_451361812~“Central to circular quay”~Very nice original part of Sydney rocks area & very central to a circular Quay.If you are picking up a cruise ship than you wont get closer. Nice B&B to stay. We picked room 27 which is in the Japanese tourist adds and were happy with the room. Very nice little B&B showing the original hotel with some modern comforts as air & refurbished baths.More than happy.Access is a little hard if you are elderly with suitcases but has a lift to the first floor.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_451225208~“Great Stay in The Rocks, Sydney Australia”~My husband and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Sydney, Australia over New Years Eve. The Russell Hotel is a quaint, historic, great location, to stay at while visiting Sydney. You will have to climb some stairs to get to your room. Rooms are nice and clean. Staff is wonderful and very helpful. Thank you Maxine and Fiona!! Rooftop, very nice to see the city views and relax. Breakfast served downstairs in the pub.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_451062231~“Location, Location, Location!”~We stayed at The Russell over New Year and could not fault its fabulous location within walking distance of the Opera House, Circular Quay & Harbour Bridge. We were in room 1 right next to reception which was spacious and incredibly quiet ... considering it was right above the bar the room was very soundproof. It had a shared bathroom which was practically en suite and always clean. Maxine on reception was lovely, very pleasant and helpful, really friendly and helped us arrange Blue Mountain tours and advise on buses to Bondi and seemed genuinely interested in what we had been up to each day. The only thing which lets this hotel down is the lack of Air Conditioning - in summer its a bit warm! There are strong ceiling fans but it depends on how used to the heat you are.. being from the UK we struggled a bit. Overall an amazing hotel and couldn't fault the staff or location for the money it was great value!~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_450470309~“Perfect location - lovely quaint old hotel in Rocks”~I've just spent 2 nights at the Russell Hotel. I was in room 11 which was a small double with a shared bathroom. I was a bit anxious about the shared bathroom but it was absolutely fine. It was just across the corridor from my room & was huge, spotless, lots of piping hot water in a good shower. My bed was comfortable & I slept well. There was a ceiling fan & the window opened fully so I was able to get a nice breeze. Location was perfect as it was just a short walk across the park to the Circular Quays area. I could reach most of the 'must see' tourist areas by walking. The hotel is a 'boutique style' hotel. It is a bit of a rabbit warren of rooms but that adds to its charm. There's a lift but you still might have a few steps to get to your room. There's no TV in the room. I didn't spot the kettle/tea tray/hairdryer/robes etc until the evening before I left - it was all stored inside the wardrobe & I don't ever bother to unpack or hang my clothes up if I'm only in a place for a couple of nights. That was a shame as I really missed being able to make hot drinks when I wanted.  The breakfast buffet was excellent with plenty of choices. Everything was fresh & replenished so even if you were late then all was still good. I'd definitely stay at the Russell Hotel again & happy to recommend it.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_450332036~“New Year's Eve at The Russell”~We had two ensuite rooms (21 and 22) from Dec. 30-Jan. 6. Our 3 adult children were in a room with two twin beds and a rollaway. Parents had a queen size bed. Both rooms had coolers which blocked any street noise. The sitting room at the end of the hall with a balcony was a nice meeting place for the family. We ate the continental breakfast downstairs every morning and enjoyed it. We loved the location at The Rocks, even though there is a lot of foot traffic from the cruise ships. I don't know if the hotel helps with luggage--I could see where an elderly person or someone with physical disabilities would be unable to get their luggage to/from their rooms. Maxine at the front desk was very helpful. She tried to give us her best recommendations on New Year's Eve vantage points (through no fault of hers, Macquarie's Point was a bust). She was also always willing to ring a restaurant for us or make a recommendation on things to do. My biggest regret is not paying out the big bucks to reserve a dinner cruise on the Harbour for New Year's Eve. Yes, I know it is expensive, but having experienced it, I now understand why they can get those prices. It is going to be one of the best and most stress-free locations to see the fireworks. The free vantage points have some very ruthless people that will run over you to get the best spots. I found there to be inadequate security, at least at Macquarie's Point, so it ended up to be a chaotic free-for-all, and it mattered not if you were there earlier than the rest of the crowd--they would just run over you. Also, Macquarie's Point is full of trees, so viewing is limited in most spots. The Harbour Bridge is a very small part of the fireworks, so DO NOT plan to watch them from The Russell--you will miss most of them. We found the best vantage to be the park across the street from the hotel, but even there viewing is limited.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_446863745~“Lack of facilities”~Stayed two nights, did not bother with so called continental breakfast after 1st night, pushing continental to the limits, could not be bothered to cook anything And informed so by the staff as soon as asked, asked directions for parking directions Due to road closures, they could not assist, returned to bar after lunch, seating limited To about twelve, a very ordinary hotel relying completely on location, and there are Better available.~3~1~nan~1~nan~nan~2~nan
review_446363902~“Good accommodation and terrific location”~Having 3 nights over Christmas. Rooms are not that big but have everything we needed. Very clean, confortable and good bed. Our only problem was the stairs to reception and to our room. Otherwise great.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445473856~“Russell Hotel at Circular Key”~Wow, how convenient to your cruise ship and Circular Key. Its one of the oldest hotels in Sydney and it was just great as well as being convenient. Staff were so friendly, bathroom and toilet facilities were spotless and had all the whistles and bells. The room does not have a TV or bathroom, or air conditioning, but has a ceiling fan and comfortable bed, we had continental breakfast which was great. Would definitely go there again~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444890110~“Very nice”~The deluxe room was lovely. Even though I slept on a fold out bed, It was great. We were only in our room to sleep.  The Russell is in a great location. Middle of everything.  Even better when you are catching a cruise ship. It's only a short walk across to the passenger terminal.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444752541~“Amazing location ”~We love the cocktail bar downstairs (The Push) so we thought we'd try the hotel. The hotel is very charming and historic with corridors and stairs going in all sorts of directions, and our room at the back of the hotel was very spacious. (No 25) The common room was cosy and the roof garden looked lovely, though unfortunately it was very wet when we visited so we didn't use it. The room was a little sparse when it came to furniture, a table/desk and a chair would have been great (there is plenty of room for it). There wasn't really anywhere to put your suitcase other than the floor, and nowhere in the spacious bathroom to put your toiletries case. If you're a light sleeper you might want to consider another room or earplugs as we were unfortunate enough to have a very rainy night and the down pipes made a stack of noise all through the night and the pub downstairs was also quite loud in our room. The wifi is a bit slow (don't try to stream anything to watch, but browsing is ok) and the aircon is a mobile unit with a hose out the window, so it might be hot in summer, we were quite warm on a wet and cool night with the windows open.  Overall it was fine, we liked the atmosphere and might stay there again and try a different room. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444320482~“Nice location”~Great location, circular quay just accross the street. Within a walkable distance from the train station. Free breakfast and wifi. Amenities : iron, hair dryer Non smoking There's a bar downstairs, but its not that noisy, imo. However there's another bar which a bit noisy in the neighbourhood, but I kinda like it as its sing a nice old song.. and its just till around 11 anyway..~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444067763~“A Stay in the Rocks”~The location of the Russell Hotel can't be beat. It's right by the Circular Quay and in the Rocks neighborhood. This historic neighborhood has lots of restaurants and sights to see. You are close to all the transportation and the central attractions. So great to walk around at night. The staff were friendly and answered all my questions, but when it came to getting help with the poor WIFI, no luck. I asked two different people for assistance and after trying their suggestions with my mobile devices, nothing helped. Don't expect to have good WIFI at this hotel. The hotel is historic and arranged like a guest house with shared bathrooms. I stayed from a Sunday to Wednesday, so I never had trouble getting into the bathroom in the mornings, luckily. There is an elevator to lug your stuff up to the top floor and the rooftop patio is lovely for taking a pause in your day. My room was directly across from the Elevator on Floor 2 and there was construction right outside my window - which was always open because there is no air conditioning and it was warm and humid during my trip. The construction was quite loud in the mornings, FYI.  The room was clean but the carpet had traces of - something - scattered about. I saw the cleaning crew and their vacuum may be a bit old. I do have to complain about the mattress - which seemed as old as the hotel itself. It bent up at the corners, was very stiff and not comfortable to sleep on at all. The morning breakfast was down in the Push bar and was always good. Simple continental with boiled eggs, bread, fruit, cereals, juices and coffee/tea. I enjoyed eating there and talking to other travelers there. Overall, it is a quaint and well situated hotel. However, I would not stay here again because I never had a good nights sleep due to the mattress and construction noises.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_443942112~“Location, Location, Location.”~If you want something other than a chain hotel room then this could be the place. OK there is a bit of street noise, but what do you expect in the middle of one of Sydney's most vibrant areas? The hotel is clean, beds are comfy, the breakfast though limited is adequate. There is a lift (elevator) but be aware there are different levels on each floor with three or four steps to negotiate. Other than that a top spot to explore the fab city of Sydney.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_443883291~“Fantastic boutique style hotel in perfect location while visiting the Harbour City”~We recently stayed 3 nights at The Russell Hotel together with friends from Brisbane for my 60th birthday celebrations. We all loved the rooms, plenty of space, air con & ceiling fan, very comfortable beds and nice furniture. We chose to have en-suited rooms rather than the shared bathroom option and had Rooms 19 & 20 adjacent to each other with a shared courtyard near Reception (would recommend these rooms if staying with friends). The staff were extremely helpful & friendly. The breakfast was continental rather than a fully cooked 'eggs & bacon' version but was perfectly adequate, loved the sourdough breads and hard boiled eggs. The breakfast room is downstairs in the pub and very pleasant, don't worry there is no smell of spilt beer or alcohol. There were only 4 tables that could sit us 4 but why do couples/singles choose to sit at a 4 share table rather than the many smaller ones??? The Russell is in the most convenient location within walking distance of all the major tourist sights Sydney has to offer - The Rocks, Circular Quay to catch the ferries anywhere around the harbour, Bridge Climb & Sydney CBD etc. Parking was easy at the Wilson Parking Station next door and with your accommodation you get a flat rate of $25 per day which is very good value for Sydney parking. I would have no hesitation in recommending The Russell and would definitely stay there again, no worries!~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_443691538~“Great hotel in a prime location without the huge cost!”~We had room 21 which is a large open room situated just above the bar and we heard no noise from the bar (to be fair it was mid week, so have no idea what it would be like on weekends). The staff were ever helpful and the place was just lovely for access to all of sydneys "rocks" area. We also walked into the main Shopping area in the city and found that easy to find.  Breakfast was in the pub downstairs and plentiful for us. We would stay there again if we get chance. Wifi was a little flaky in our room, but could be obtained in the sitting area outside the room.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_443398982~“Location, but not much else. More quirky than quaint”~The location is fabulous. All else lacking; quite surprised, as this site and others, and guidebooks rave about the place.  It's a maze of rooms, no two alike-could be quaint, but was quirky. Our room, queen en suite facing nurse's walk was small, musty smelling, cobwebs, broken Roman shade, etc.The worst was the bath. A very large (dominated the space that could have been part of actual room) completely tiled bathroom made for someone in a wheelchair w/assistant.Taking a shower made the entire room a lake-a slippery lake. I'm not impaired, but at 60 sliding all over in ankle high water is not my idea of fun. We requested piles of towels to create berm, at least contain the water so to step out on non-wet surface. Sign posted not to open door while showering as moisture sets off the fire alarm, resulting in a $250 fine to guest. I told the desk about cobwebs & blind;next day they cleared most cobwebs and sort of fixed the blind.I was told if we didn't like the shower we could move the next day, but had early all-day plans.They didn't offer to physically move us while we were out, but more importantly we could not see the potential new room. With the Russell quirkiness, we didn't know what the new room might have that could be worst than the shower lake.  Lady@ desk had attitude about my not liking the shower. Said no one ever complained and was incredulous that I didn't like it. I've traveled all over the world-had some crazy shower/bath set-ups. This was most dangerous I have encountered.  The breakfast was ok. The day we left early, husband asked for coffee to go, they said no, but they were open and how much trouble would that have been? Standard continental b'fast. Hot chocolate croissants were good. Stayed 3 nights and thrilled to get on cruise ship. The stateroom felt like a palace after our time at The Russell.  Ideal location, but there are many choices in the area.Yes, it's quaint, but ... My home is in an historic district, so I like old, but the charm of The Russell escaped me. Cannot recommend, especially to anyone with disability as the place is a labyrinth.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan

review_442953266~“What a Gem”~A boutique hotel in such a convenient location. The location is perfect for the Rocks and surrounds, everything is within comfortable walking distance. The service is first rate and room 20 is wonderfull. Very comfortable bed and decor that befits the character of the building, very homely and welcoming. The room opens onto a little courtyard and also has an ensuite which is nicely fitted out. The included continental breakfast downstairs in the Push pub is first rate. There is a good variety of cereals, juices, brewed coffee, croissants and breads with Beerenberg preserves. A bonus of an 11 am checkout is also included. Will definitely stay here again when jumping off on a cruise.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442768527~“Nice old hotel ”~Nice little hotel for an overnight stay, we had a double bed standard room which was small and noisy being near the lift and stairs. Share bathrooms were clean and tidy with basic supplies provided. Hotel has lots of stairs of course being an original in the rocks area. Breakfast was included for us but when we got there at 9am it go s till 10:30 scrambled eggs all gone only cold boiled eggs:( but plenty of cereal, fruit, juice some breads to toast and pastries so we still enjoyed it. Parking was $25 extra for ticket validating which we thought might be included!. Only bedside lamps for lighting and the ceiling fan only worked on a slow speed(no aircon in our room) so it was very hot if you didn't have the window open which was noisy as next door is undergoing construction and had trucks, work going on at midnight which made it hard to sleep :( no tv either but free wifi was ok. Maxine at reception was more than helpful with every part of check in and check out !!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442714825~“Great location, historic hotel needing refurbishment. ”~Great location in The Rocks. Clean rooms. Approachable staff. Rooms are small and tired.

review_442304682~“Completely and utterly terrible ”~I tried posting this the first night of our stay but much to my disappointment it didn't work..?  We stayed for three nights from the 28th of November to the 1st of December in Room 5. We payed close to $550 which is really expensive for two 19 year old students. The hotel is in a great area, hence why we booked there and not anywhere else. But we didn't get one ounce of sleep the whole time. Room 5 is right next to entrance where people come and leave whenever they want. People above stomp loudly.  Room 5 is directly across from a construction site, where workers start at 6:30am and work until 8pm. If the curtains are open they look in. No aircon in the room, fan only and faulty cupboard. I was getting changed and smashed my head on the open cupboard door and dropped to the ground in pain, a week later and I still have an egg on my head.  The room is so small! Hot boiling Kettle can only be used on the ground as it does not reach to the bed side tables from the PowerPoint. Dangerous and hazardous!!!!  Closest bathroom is so small and faulty. Shower door comes off hinges. So we started to use other bathrooms further away but other guests were rude to us and complained as they wanted it all for themselves. Hogs. This lead to us holding on to our wee and not showering as much as we would've liked.  I feel like you have taken advantage of us seeing as we are young, naive and slim. If we were any bigger or if we were elderly the shower closest to room 5 would be impossible to use. Very unhappy and still have a sore head. :( sorry but it's a 1 star from us.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442136617~“3 star hotel but a 5 star stay”~We stayed in the Russell hotel for four nights where our teenage son joined us. Location, location, location - couldn't have been better. Out the door and everything you could possibly ask for is at hand. Restaurants, shops, transport and of course Sydney opera house, Sydney harbour bridge and circular quay all within a few minutes walk. Reception very helpful and answered all out questions with good knowledge. Room was very homely and shower really good. Roof top terrace was a lovely relaxing place to go for a coffee or a cool drink with fantastic. Even a tip where to get a cheap barber! And 20 dollars for a bag of laundry which was returned quickly all folded and sorted. Will be back hopefully in the near future. Regards from Ireland.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441488475~“Poor value for money ”~Average room for exorbitant price. Staff ok but not what Id call particularly welcoming or friendly either. The room was a big disappointment for the price.

review_439808815~“Historic accommodation in the city centre”~This old hotel in Sydney's famous historic Rocks is a warren of rooms above a street level piano bar which doubles as a breakfast room. This is not a place for seniors as the place is full of stairs and even the main entrance is at the end of a steep hike up the "walkway" at the side. Taxi access is difficult if not impossible ( had to hike our baggage to another street several flights of stairs above the entrance due to roadworks . It is extremely central close to ferries city circle rail and a block to ferries which take you everywhere. Parking is an extra $20 ($60 o/night if not a guest. The rooms are nicely historic with 14 ft ceilings and aged fans. Modernized bathrooms and added aircon make it comfortable. Ask for a room close to the roof garden and have an almost completely private vantage point to enjoy your own picnics of takeout from any of dozens of nearby eateries. I have mobility difficulties and the staff were wonderful but I would recommend something with easier access if you have ANY physical handicaps that need to be accommodated. But hats off to the roof garden part. Lovely spot.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439425979~“Avoid room 23 if you like space! ”~We checked in here for 6 nights. Location was absolutely perfect, count beat it. Room 23 however, wasn't the best. Air con wasn't working, we were told it would be within a couple of days. We also had to boil kettle on the toilet seat. We were then then told the air con wouldn't be fixed until after we left we then requested a room change. Gary was most helpful and managed to move us to a different room, unlike another receptionist who told us if we weren't happy we'd have to move hotels. It was also rather small for 2 people. Room 7 however, great.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437626385~“Great stay, please read.”~The hotel is different. As an old building its hallways meander a bit and there are a few stairs. (lifts too) That said it is all very in keeping with the character of the building. Its not modern, its more traditional with furniture made of wood instead of MDF. Lots of room in comparison to most others. The location is great and staff were most helpful.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_436767432~“Historic hotel”~A very unique place to stay and nice change from the older skyscraper type of hotel. Sharing a bathroom was a different experience, but no problem! Room decor was very nice and the room was clean. There is no a/c, however good ceiling fan and windows opened. The pub downstairs, The Push served a delish fish and chip meal. Ambience was great.  Excellent continental breakfast provided with the room. Loved the close proximity to Circular Quay and transportation, or just walking about. A bit pricey, but worth it for uniqueness, excellent reception staff, ambience, decor, and ease of access. Definitely would recommend a stay here.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_436301471~“Nice and central”~Perfect place to stop for the night before and after your cruise with friendly and helpful staff. "Old world charm" right at circular key - straight onto the ferries or trains, or take a short walk to The Rocks or the Sydney Opera House. Lots (and lots) of stairs, even in all the corridors, so not easy for those with limited ability. Even the Reception needs you to take a lift and a short flight of steps. Lots of noise from building works next door, but that's not their fault and they gave us a good deal on a room over the other side when we returned after our cruise. Cute rooftop garden, but up more stairs. Food in the pub downstairs (and alomg a corridor) was very nice, and the included continental breakfast was "just for guests" in the old-style bar/cafe downstairs. Would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436214194~“Found our Sydney bolt hole !!!!”~I stayed here more than 25 years ago, I enjoyed it then, I LOVED it this time! We had Room 9 at the front - delightful spacious room and added bonus we could open the windows so had a lovely breeze through. Charming, with quality furnishings bathrobes and mini bar (first ever inexpensive one I have seen -water at $2.....saved trip to convenience store) and super clean, I wish I had taken photos to share! I was warned about noises it is a front room, but it only did I not notice, I had the best sleep I've had in months on their extremely comfortable well made king bed. We snaffled the last room so had a 'shared bathroom' - normally this would have detracted my experience but quaint , super clean and with Milton Brown products I was more than happy to share, though I will get one of the rooms with a bathroom for our next visit. Gary, the hotel manager, totally charming obviously loves his job and The Russell, I was touched that he enquires as to my wellness after arriving with a horrid migraine. Will we stay again - absolutely - every time we stay in Sydney as it comes personable service, is comfortable , quaint, well appointed, super clean, well positioned and caters well above hotels with their impersonal SOP (standard operational procedures).  Being in the hospitality game I am delighted when I experience a hotel that gets it right!  Gary.........we will be back ......sooner rather than later at The Russell..........sad to leave, happy to have rediscovered it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434708741~“Still my favourite!”~Once again I met my elderly mother in Sydney for a catch-up and to take her out after recent illness. This charming little establishment suits our needs so well. It remains unchanged in its old-world charm, home-away-from home cleanliness and comfort, and the excellent location. We were very pleased to see the same lovely, professional staff there who continue to go out of their way to accommodate requests and assist wherever necessary. Having the included and generous continental breakfast is such a helpful way to start your day of activities. My mum came away refreshed and very content. Love this place!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

Lovely start to our holiday and would definitely go back if we visit Sydney again (very expensive city!)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433480550~“Nice place in great location”~We stayed here for 3 nights in a superior room and loved it.  It is located in The Rocks so its not far too walk to the first sightseeing spots. The rooms were spacious and clean.  Only the noise at night from some machinery outsinde our room (air con or kitchen?) was disturbing. Breakfast was good and many places nearby to find something for dinner. Staff was friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_429512487~“Such a Cozy Hotel!”~Pros: great location, clean room and property Cons: the noise level Tips: It may help some to have a set of ear plugs The style of The Russell Hotel is really old fashioned but felt extremely homey and welcoming. All of which I was expecting when I booked the reservation. So I was really looking forward to my stay here! And I was not disappointed! I wasn't able to check-in early but the host was very helpful in recommending some nearby eats and activities to kill some time. Upon entering the room, it reminded me of perhaps a spare bedroom your grandmother would provide. So I instantly felt comfortable and very happy with my choice to stay at The Russell. My only issue I had during my stay was the noise level that you hear in the room. The hotel is older so I'm assuming there isn't any sound proofing. But even that issue hasn't changed my overall sanctification with the hotel. I think the best asset of this hotel is the location. It's walking distance to the Opera House (10min), Circular Quay (5min), CBD, and the Royal Botanical Gardens (15-20min). Overall I absolutely enjoyed my stay at The Russell Hotel and definitely will book again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426821454~“Perfect for Cruise passengers, and oh so close to the airport rail network .”~Superb location and so close to both Cruise terminal and rail station to the airport. An easy walk , even with luggage, for both. We are in our 70s and found it no problem. The character of this place has been lovingly preserved (built in the 1800s) yet plumbing, bathrooms and beds are all modern and efficient. We loved our room, which was actually two small room, (ours was number 23) making it easy for one partner to read while the other slept. Very quiet, clean and gracious. Lovely little touches like delightful local soaps. Breakfast was good, varied and plentiful. Don't expect big glitzy windows or modern decor, this place has the style of a past era... huge carved stair wells wonderful ceilings....all beautifully cared for. Spotlessly clean where ever we looked. Staff are delightful and helpful.. no problem leaving your bags if you arrive too early in the day.  This hotel is under half the price of the other we were looking at in the same location (The Rocks) and we are so glad we chose it... this freed up cash for sightseeing. An easy 3 minute walk to Circular Quay and the ferries around the harbour.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_424552614~“A Hidden Gem”~A quaint Boutique style hotel with 30 rooms that traverse three buildings on top of shops and restaurants in the heart of The Rocks. Rooms are individually decorated, very clean and well maintained. One of the nicest we have stayed in. There is a lovely sitting room overlooking George Street, and a top floor garden. The Push Bar downstairs provides entertainment with live music and reasonably priced meals. A 5 minute walk to The Pier the Opera House, and the markets. Everything you need for a wonderful stay is right at hand. Shopping, restaurants, views. Parking is next door and at $25 for 24 hours, is also excellent value. The staff were very friendly and helpful.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_424245274~“Old, new, and convenience together.”~Only 30 rooms (across three buildings). It's well maintained, clean, has a bar with music and food below, a top floor garden, a great sitting / TV / quiet room, markets nearby, the Opera House, ferries, the CBD. And parking is next door @ $25 for 24 hours. You can't expect cheap in this location, but it's worth it, here.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_424245029~“Excellent location.”~I stayed here for one night, and was more than happy with this hotel. Very easy train trip from the airport by train to Circular Quay, then short walk across a park, up steps, across the road and you are at the Russell Hotel. I arrived about 9am and checked in , was given my room key to leave luggage and was off for the day. The room decor was old world and lovely,with a comfortable bed, well appointed bathroom, and I could even see the top of harbour bridge from my window. Being in George Street made city access easy, and also close to ferries, all in all I loved my stay here and will hopefully be back.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_424190511~“VERY Convenient”~We were in Sydney for 3 nights and stayed at the Russell Hotel, based on other reviews and location. it was a great choice! Right in the heart of The Rocks where the shops and restaurants are, close enough to walk to the museums, etc. There is no view of the Opera House, because the Hotel is not tall enough to see over the other buildings. But, who needs views when the Opera House is a 5 minute walk, right across the street!? Just cross the street and you're at the Harbour where the boats and ferries dock, and where the train is. Walk past those and you're at the Opera House. So very, very convenient. And the grounds around the Opera House are all well maintained with scenic walk ways and gardens.  The hotel is so comfortable, it's like staying with you're family - but with better privacy. The bar/restaurant area has great atmosphere, and the food is fabulous. The 2 bed room was very large and clean. The en-suite bathroom is small, but the shower makes up for that -- great water pressure and a better shower head than we have at home (I've never encountered it's like in a hotel or resort anywhere else in the world). The staff were friendly and accommodating as well.  If you choose The Russel, you will not be disappointed.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_423358305~“Perfect location, beautiful decor”~My Mum and I came for a quick girls getaway and we're thrilled with the location of this place. The decor is quaint and sweet, love that they celebrated this buildings heritage. The ONLY downside is that the bathroom is shared, there isn't one in your room and the sound travels from the restaurant downstair. This didn't bother us, but if you are a super light sleeper, you should perhaps request a room on a higher floor. Otherwise, the CBD and Circular Quay are all within easy walking distance and I would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422339704~“great value for money, great location”~We stayed here for three nights. The rooms are very nice and beautifully decorated, but the staff is really welcoming and warm. The help with any doubts, getting around and suggesting things. Their tips are really useful. The bar downstairs offers a very good breakfast, with no t many choices but enough to enojy a great start of the day. I would definetly go back.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_420026904~“Over nighter before Cruise”~The Russell Hotel, The Rocks Sydney. Right next to Circular Quay Train Station, Ferries and Overseas Shipping Terminal. Small and very personable and pleasant. Room we had was small but cosy. Alot of stairs so may need to check if need Accesabilty. Lovely bar/dining room with breakfast included. Close to all transport and within walking distance to CBD and popular sights. Only stayed overnight as i didnt want to miss the Ship! But would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419741845~“The privilige of a different place to stay at the center of The Rocks”~The Russell Hotel is different. Forget all your usual concern about the noise from neighbors, neighboring bars or traffic. In the Russell you will hear them all. You are in the middle of the vibrant Rocks quarter, and the bar downstairs will regularly be crowded with locals and tourists, particularly in the weekend when the music is on. The Russell is perfectly located next to Circular Bay. The rooms are tastefully oldfashioned - some have bathrooms down the corridor. The food is good, the staff is more than friendly and the atmosphere is really something else.~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan~5~nan
review_419324657~“Lovely old world charm in a fabulous location”~Loved this hotel . I'm a push over for historical buildings . It might not be your cup of tea if you want to lie in an enormous bed all day watching TV getting room service however if you want a taste of the rocks and a dose of old world charm this is a lovely hotel . At sunset we had drinks on the roof top garden , staff were helpful & friendly and the breakfast was great . You can walk to all of the Sydney sights or catch a ferry . Loved it !~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417767938~“Great place and location”~Stayed at this boutique hotel for my daughters wedding in september, great old world pub, room spacious, clean, very comfy bed. Food good Staff great Rooftop garden was great for a cold beer Would recommend.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_416700801~“Great little hotel with perfect location”~Ideally located hotel, within 5 minutes of the rocks area of Sydney and 10 minute walk of the opera house. The rooms are smaller but well furnished and the hotel has a really 'comfortable' feel about it. The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We had a room without a bathroom which, in retrospect, was a small mistake and we wished we'd had one with a bathroom. Breakfast is good. Basic but good and good value for money. The hotel can be a little noisy at night but that's the trade off against having such a central location. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413734027~“Historic hotel with all comforts”~No two rooms are the same in this interesting hotel. There are a few internal stairs to connect the three buildings that house the hotel on the top two floors, and a lift up from the ground floor to the first and second levels. Or you can take the stairs from the pub, The Push, on street level. This is where the complimentary continental breakfast is served. Fresh fruit with thick creamy Greek yoghurt, croissants, cereals, really tasty healthy wholemeal bread, hard boiled eggs and juice. A great start.  We were in room 25, a corner Superior room with windows on two sides overlooking the quiet back street. It even had a (non-working) beautifully tiled fireplace and a modern ensuite bathroom with instant hot water and a powerful shower. There was no noise from the pub, but a building nearby is being renovated so workmen start about 7am. We were at breakfast then so it didn't bother us. There's a very comfortable 1st floor sitting room for guests with TV and small balcony overlooking the quiet end of George Street as well as a roofgarden with a side view of the Harbour Bridge.  The central heating in August was very welcome. The staff were all very welcoming and friendly, and even put chocolates on our bed every night.  You can walk to Circular Quay in five minutes for the ferries and trains, and the Opera House is a 10 minute walk away. What a great location. We will most certainly stay here again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_412529749~“I'd come back here in a heartbeat! Homely, comfortable and friendly!”~Firstly, when you get here, there's a steep path to the main door (and initially you confuse the entrance to The Push, which is a bar below). There is a lift to get you to reception level....when you get there, leave your suitcases just by the lift before descending a few steps to get to reception (as you will probably have to drag them back up the steps again once you've checked in). The welcome we had from the dude on reception was amazing. He was so helpful! Initially, we were concerned about the happy noise that was coming from the bar below (The Push) and wondered if that would disturb us. We needn't have been worried, we heard nothing at all! Inside The Russell, it reminded me of Dr Who's TARDIS! It's so big!! We found our room (I think it was 29). We were right near an exit door to the roof terrace (lovely smoking area). I don't smoke, but this was a little bit of paradise in the throbbing metropolis that is Sydney. Potted plants and table and chairs are available for use. Inside our room it was a little small. We initially found problems finding enough electric sockets to charge our phones and the like, and then our adaptors kept 'falling out' the sockets. So, duly wedged with socks and anything that would work, we eventually charged our electronic devices. The shower room was clean, but having a sprung door was a bit of a nuisance (necessary one, as the smoke alarm could activate via steam). We had all the usual complimentary soaps and shampoos and plenty of tea and coffee. The bed was a little soft for our tastes and the furniture somewhat old fashioned. We had not view out of our window (a brick wall!) However, we really, REALLY enjoyed being here. If we come here again, and this would be our hotel of choice, we'd opt for a different room. Breakfast in the morning was continental and served in The Push downstairs. The music first thing is rather loud (but I'm guessing that's Australia all over) but the whole atmosphere is really lovely. We enjoyed having breakfast whilst looking out the window and watching the world go by. The food was excellent, ambiance brilliant and highly recommended. The location is something else! I don't think I've ever been somewhere where EVERYTHING is right on your doorstep! The consierge (dude on the desk) helped us with choosing things to do on our very limited time in Sydney.  I don't think I'd recommend this place to someone with disabilities (we had to bend down a great deal on the floor to deal with the plugs etc). And also because of the steps inside the building, but I'd go there again in a heartbeat (preferring it to some of the posher places) just because the atmosphere, friendliness and convenience of being located right in the heart of The Rocks.  Do check out the reviews for The Push (the downstairs bar) as that is also amazing.  To summarise: Not everyone's cup of tea, but friendly and clean and everything you need for your stop over in Sydney.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_412083278~“Sisters weekend away”~My sister and I spent the weekend at The Russell right in the heart of The Rocks. We loved waking in the morning to a view of the Gallery of Contemporary Art and Circular Quay. The hotel is a lovely old building. It isn't flashy and doesn't have the latest touches but the staff were pleasant and nothing was too hard. I'll stay here next time I'm in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412059329~“Highly recommend!”~I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. My boyfriend and I stayed at The Russell for 4 nights in July 2016. It is in a great location for tourists but with its small size did not feel super touristy. It is less than 5 minutes walk from the trains and ferries at Circular Quay, so it's a great base for exploring other parts of the city. It was very convenient for us coming straight from the airport by train. And its easy to walk from here to the big tourist attractions (Sydney Harbor Bridge, Botanical Gardens, Opera House, Contemporary Art Museum, other downtown museums, even to Darling Harbour if you don't mind a longer walk). Our room was on the small size but it was clean and comfortable and quiet. The staff were all very friendly and gave us great suggestions for dining out. We were able to drop our luggage here early in the morning with no problem. The complimentary breakfast is excellent -- really nice selection of breads, pastries, cereals, eggs, jams, coffee, even soy milk!  The hotel is made up of two buildings that have been joined together so there are stairs everywhere. They do have an elevator, but it seemed like it would be hard to navigate if steps are an issue for you!~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_411736750~“Perfect location !!!!!!”~My wife and I stayed here for two nights enroute to Tonga and were happy with our choice. The hotel is in an ideal location for visiting the major Sydney attractions. It is not too far from the airport (approx. 25 min drive depending on traffic) and you can access the Circular Quay area within a few hundred metres, particularly useful if you wish to take a ferry to Manly, Darling Harbour etc.  When we arrived it wasn't obvious where the hotel entrance was located, though a quick chat with the doorman at The Push (a bar which turned out to be part of the hotel) pointed us in the right direction. We located the reception area on the first floor - there are either stairs or a lift to these upper floor areas. The reception desk in not the easiest place to access if you have mobility problems, and my advice would be to leave your luggage at the top of the stairs (I think there are about 3 or 4 of these) before approaching the reception desk otherwise you will only have to lift them back up the stairs when you go to your room. The reception staff were first class, very helpful, attentive, polite and always willing to chat and offer advice should you so wish. We took up the suggestion of a ferry ride to Manly, a brilliant trip that allowed us to witness the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney harbour Bridge being silhouetted against the setting sun - highly recommended.  Our room was at the rear of the hotel and this was very quiet, though it didn't have much of a view - not really a problem as we were out and about anyway. The room was compact and a little dated, though everything that was readily accessible was clean, though it was dusty underneath the bed. The room had all the facilities you would expect such as tea and coffee making, complimentary toiletries etc but didn't have air conditioning, though a fan was provided. Free wifi was also available. If I was to single anything out for criticism then it would definitely be the bed.......it was a metal framed type that felt flimsy, and made awful noises every time you moved. As it was only for two nights we put up with the dodgy bed and still managed to sleep ok. A breakfast was included in the room rate and this consisted of a continental style breakfast downstairs in the bar area of the hotel bar, called The Push (a good place to spend the evening relaxing with a beer). Access was gained directly from the upper floors via a stairway, again something to note if you have mobility issues. The service here was good, the staff friendly and the food was good, though choice was a little limited and could possibly get a little repetitive over a longer stay. Checking in and out was pretty straightforward, and your suitcases could be left in the lobby area after check out if you had time to spend before leaving. Overall this was a good place to stay, and given its location I feel it was very good value for money.  A couple of points of interest.......there is supposedly a haunted room at the hotel (room 8 I think) and room 25 is always in demand by the Japanese following the making of an animated film there.........~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_411665274~“Nice cosy hotel. Shared Bathrooms and bad wifi.”~The rooms were really lovely. They were homely and comfortable. The beds were really nice and the whole look was just great. The breakfast down stairs in the morning was nice too, just standard coles/woolies pastries, cereal and some juice but eating in the bar was nice. The bar couldn't be heard at all so that was perfectly fine. Shared bathrooms are fairly annoying but you know that's what you're paying for so that's fine. The wifi was really terrible and we ended up just not using it, nothing would load in our room. So that was probably the biggest downside.  The location was great, the rocks has plenty of food and it's a couple minutes from the train station. Would definitely recommend.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_411612829~“great location”~We loved the location, perfect for a trip to the Opera House and exploring the Rocks and harbour. We were above the kitchen so a little noisy first thing in the morning but the staff and everything else was very good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_411221718~“Cute boutique hotel in a good location”~Small hotel with an interesting topological arrangement. We had an old fashioned small room, perhaps not ideal for a long stay but perfect for a weekend in Sydney. The location at The Rocks and near Circular Quay is ideal for experiencing Sydney, and associated with the hotel is The Push, a lovely bar for cocktails and snacks, with live music (piano) on the weekend.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_411220020~“Location and comfort”~Helen and I recently took a 10 night Carnival cruise from Sydney to New Caledonia and back. We were looking for a good hotel close to the Circular Quay cruise terminal. On our travel agents advice we booked overnight at the Russell. GREAT decision. Nice room, great king-size bed and en-suite bathroom. Breakfast included in the price. Next morning, a short 6 minute walk and we were at the check-in for the ship.I would recommend the hotel for location, The Rocks and it was a charming little piece of Rocks history.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_409061423~“Lovely hotel in a fantastic position”~We stayed at The Russell on the night we did a Ghost Tour of The Rocks. We had a room with its own ensuite, I think it was a superior room. I really liked this hotel and have always wanted to stay there so it was wonderful to finally do so. Its a different experience from staying in a big hotel. I really liked the room and its cosy decor topped off with a vase of fresh flowers. We had a meal in the bar and everything was delicious. I would love to stay again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_408611576~“Easy, relaxed, handy. ”~We loved staying here it was so handy to circular quay and we could walk to darling harbour and down town shopping. Best of all is the breakfast. So convenient and easy to help yourself. Great bar and friendly staff. Shared bathroom was no problem and bed was fine.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408524919~“great place to chill before your cruise”~This quaint hotel is very personable- and friendly - unlike the bigger hotels adjacent to Circular Quay. Being built in 1887 be aware that it is a piece of history in a great location. The rooms, while somewhat creaky and old, are clean and comfortable, the staff are friendly, and there is a nice rooftop area where you can sit too. There is a bar and eating area downstairs where you can have a continental breakfast or a great evening meal and a few drinks to unwind. Whilst its not the Four Seasons or Shangri La this hotel is conveniently located at The Rocks and is within walking distance to the Overseas Passenger terminal and so we were able to go to the Bag Drop early leaving us free to enjoy those extra hours prior to departure. If you are cruising make sure your boat are departing from Circular Quay and not White Bay.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
