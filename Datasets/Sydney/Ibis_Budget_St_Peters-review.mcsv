review_478995537~“We would consider staying here again”~Okay here are the good points about this Ibis: the location is good. Close enough to Sydney domestic airport (approx 3km) to get Free Parking on site, smack in the middle of fast foods chains (KFC & Maccas), quiet air con unit, comfy king size bed, our room 216 was quiet enough to get a good night rest, reasonable prices. Now the other points about this Ibis: compact room, compact bathroom which only has tight shower are and toilet, water splashing from having a shower and Ibis should provide bath mat as we had nothing to wipe wet area down, no elevator to get up to higher levels - all stairs which may be tiny inconvenience for elderly individuals with their luggages, sink is located next to bed and weren't fond of the spout, very tight breakfast serving area . Overall, you get what you pay for. We think Ibis St Peters is fine.Okay for 1 to 2 nights stay. We would consider staying here again. Also, nearby eateries offer delivery to this Ibis.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_472881113~“Good value for a quick stop-over”~Everything clean, everything worked. The only issue was I booked online with my credit card details. At another one of the properties I have stayed at a number of times, the credit card payment went through, and there was no payment required at the hotel. This time the payment was not taken online, but I had a reservation and paid at the hotel. Not a big deal but some consistency would be good.~4~5~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_469725711~“Budget hotel but 5* coffee ”~I slept like a rock. No disturbances. Surprisingly quite. Sure it's a budget hotel but that is all I wanted.

review_467132983~“Ibis St Peters 2017”~Clean and tidy. Easy Check in and Out. Free Parking. Close to airport. Keen price. Don't take more than an overnight bag there's nowhere to stow it. Otherwise good value. Shower awkward for large people. Big step up for short people. Shower wets toilet floor.~3~4~4~4~3~4~3~nan
review_467014316~“I have been to more comfortable kennels ”~This place is what I call a crap hole.  As we turned up to the hotel we were welcomed by a few patrons having a fag out side smelling of low grade crack and paid sex.  We entered the lobby to be greated by a really lovley staff member who was very helpful and friendly.  We then took the stairs up to our rooms because there are no lifts. One of our rooms had easy access from a previous incident where the door had been kicked in most likley from law enforcement. We enter our hotel rooms which could only be described as a decent jail cell fridge pubic hair on the bed and the sink next to the bed the air conditioner was held together with high grade masking tape. Luckly the toilet and shower shared a floor and stunk of stale urine. But be careful not to leave the door open because you will get a $1000 dollar fine if the steam from the shower sets off the smoke alarm. Don't let that bother you as you will be lixky if the shower is hot enough to wven produce steam  The view from my cell was epic I could hear people ordering macdonalds from the drive thru from the comfort of my own room. I highly recommend bringing your thongs with you because I am not sure if you actually get cleaner having a shower in this room or dirtier.  If your after adventure this is the place for you.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465549338~“Hotel is ok but local food options limited and check transport carefully!”~The hotel itself is ok - the usual budget no frills which is fine for a one night airport stopover. Cheerful lady on reception and laundry/ironing facilities and kettle, tea & coffee in the room. It is close enough to the airport but in a run down industrial area with no other food options but KFC or McDonalds - yuk, no good for vegetarians! However the the strangest thing (and I'm not blaming the hotel for this) was the airport transfer bus (Skybus I think) which the airport marshalls told us to wait for and which clearly had Budget Ibis as one of the drop offs printed on the side. We paid our $20 and the driver told us to get on and then didn't appear to know where the hotel was! He dumped us at a random train station which didn't even serve the hotel and we ended up getting the service bus the rest of the way - very weird. The hotel booked us a taxi back to the airport next day. Better option!~3~nan~1~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_463914822~“basic but good”~Thought it would be closer to the airport, but still very good. A simple straight no frills motel, with everybody food place close by.

review_462336350~“Excellent Budget Hotel ”~I stayed here for 1 night pre cruise with my partner because CBD prices were out of control. We got an uber from the airport which was $20 and took around 10-15 minutes.  Room was very clean, very comfortable and did not hear one bit of noise from neighbours or outside noise. It is located between McDonald's and KFC which is handy and the train is a 10 min walk away.  If you expect luxury for the price then this isn't the place for you but if you just want a clean place to sleep then this is a great choice.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462135567~“Thanks for taking care of me”~I booked this hotel through Wotif at the last minute after Jetstar cancelled my flight at 930pm (no, Jetstar didn't pay, but that's another story...). I arrived at the hotel somewhat distressed, as you can imagine, I thought I was going home, after spending a day in Sydney, I had no clothes or anything with me. The staff on the front desk were very sympathetic and looked after me really well, and even offered me a late checkout as I told them I couldn't fly home till 2pm the next day. The room was clean and comfortable. Overall very happy with my experience. Thank you!!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_461053844~“Not as close to the airport as I thought.”~Going to the hotel took about 25 minutes due to rail construction detours. Going back to the airport was a 10-minute ride. Room, bath and bedding were clean, but we did see one big bug in the room. I would stay closer to the airport and save cab fare.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460280038~“Shame on you ACCOR”~Stayed in this hotel booked by my company, was not expecting much and that's exactly what I got. This place is for backpackers. Probably what is the worst is the cleanliness of this hotel. Toilet not cleaned properly, you would see cleaner at the airport, mold on the walls , dirty window and the walls are very thin. Positive, the chap at reception was friendly and helpful. Last words, prices in Sydney for hotel rooms are expensive and for what you pay you expect it to be clean. Managing company of Mecure, Novotel and Sofitel - ACCOR, shame on you. See my pictures.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458687076~“Disappointed”~I have been there for 1 night only, before my long flight to Europe and as it is budget hotel I didnt expect a luxury but this was really not a hotel where I would like to stay again. It is next to the airport so you expect a bit of noise but the isolation of the windows is so poor that you feel like if you would sleep in a runway and unfortunately there is reasently also some reconstruction going on so better take your ear plugs. Bathroom was tiny, what would be ok but it was actually really dirty and I was washing my hair in a flipflop and with a close eyes so I dont see it. Aircon was in the place where it was blowing straight on my face all nigh. Somebody likes that, somebody not. I didn't ;) Staff was very nice and helpful and breakfast are only for 9chf here. As I came really late and leaved very soon I didnt complane about my room.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458583221~“Ok but very basic.”~If you're just looking for a place to stay the night this is probably o one of the cheapest around Sydney. It's good but the rooms are small amd the shower/bathroom is one plastic door away from the bedroom/lounge/everything else.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455713892~“Shudder”~I just needed a bed for an early flight. I wasn't expecting much, but I wasn't expecting roaches, mould & mildew, the smell of cigarette smoke whenever I opened the toilet/shower cubicle (not a bathroom) supposedly non smoking rooms. Same circumstances I'll pay an extra $100 to get a decent room elsewhere. (Do not look under the bed-I dropped my pen- it stays there...)~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448743787~“Not a good experience for an over prices budget hotel”~I drove into Sydney with friends on a AFL Grand Final weekend from Melbourne.I was a bit taken aback with the setting of the room. The good: *Clean room when we walked in. *Closer to KFC and Mc Donald, a quick bite when everything else is closed is definitely welcome. *Sufficiently large Parking space area  The Bad: *Overpriced. *Ultra Small and looks much smaller than images in the ad. *Ultra Tiny bathroom. *Not very safe as the ground floor rooms have windows that can easily be broken into. *The air conditioner made the room moist overnight. *Just cold breakfast options. The ugly: *The towels and bedding are not changed every day. *Only shower towels are provided and no hand towels was given even upon request. *The ground floor windows have a deceiving see through tint were outsides can see through.  *I defintely do not recommend this for anything greater than $100/Night~2~2~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan

review_447732381~“Budget doesn't equal value here ”~This is a budget hotel, so my expectations were low for a one night stay in a convenient location. I would not recommend this hotel at all - basic is fine, but if you're looking for a clean room this isn't the place for you. The room was very dirty, especially when looking under the bed for the large cockroach that ran underneath. Walking across the bedroom floor left my feet filthy. The bathroom and shower were also really unclean.  A comfy bed and friendly reception staff were not enough to redeem this hotel.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446837952~“You get what you pay for. Bed is good but shower/toilet cabinet is tiny”~We slept well here and it is surprisingly quiet. But there is no need for a king bed (which is what you get) at the expense of all other room space. No room for anything more than small luggage and the bathroom/shower cabinet is a fibreglass tiny shell where everything gets wet when you shower. But the price is very good and you do get a kettle and a small fridge in each room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446376318~“Dont swing the cat round in your room.”~I know its budget, but come on. As the saying goes about not enough room to swing a cat, its true here. You would give it brain damage. The shower and toilet in our room was like being in a small cupboard. I could watch the telly while I was sitting on the toilet if I wanted to. Very compact. WIFI is in the lobby. Have to admit, the staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful. Full marks to them. McDonalds and KFC are right next door. Not a bad bar serving good food is just down the road, past the traffic lights.~3~2~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445959471~“Budget Accomadation in St Peters”~This accomodation was what you would expect for the money you pay. The bathroom was small and and compact. The room was suitable for two people. There was a small balcony that you could go out on but not much of a view.~3~3~2~4~3~5~4~nan
review_445056098~“Disappointing stay”~I was looking for a place to stay near the airport as I had an early morning flight. Unfortunately, there are three Ibis hotels near the airport, two of which are the Ibis budget brand. So, when you land in Sydney and are planning to use the airport shuttle service, be sure to identify the right budget hotel to the driver.  As a budget hotel located near the airport, the Ibis Budget St Peter's had many things going for it. The room was clean and functional; the hotel provided free WIFI in the bedroom which was also equipped with a small fridge and a kettle; the receptionist on the front desk was extremely helpful; and the quoted room rate was $89 AUS (a good price for the airport area). There are two fast food restaurants on either side of the hotel - a MacDonald's and a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet - but the better eating place is the Southern Cross hotel, located 200m down the road. It offered a reasonable variety of draft beer and a good value daily dinner special. I had steak, chips and a salad for $13 AUS on the Wednesday evening. The special changes each day. Now for some of the less attractive aspects of the Ibis Budget St Peter's. First, there is no elevator, so be prepared to carry your suitcases up four flights of stairs if you are staying on the top floor. Second, if you decide to sleep with the window open, be prepared for the aroma of "Eau de MacDonald", if your room is located on the MacDonald side of the building. And lastly, be sure to get something in writing if you are told that there is a shuttle service to and from the airport. The day before I arrived the shuttle service provider had abruptly quit and the service wasn't available. This meant I had to take a cab and pay an additional $26 AUS over and above what I would have paid for the round-trip shuttle ride. Consequently, the room ended up costing me $115 AUS. There was no offer of any form from the manager on duty in the morning to compensate me for the additional cost incurred, despite the fact that I had phoned the hotel several weeks earlier to find out about the transportation to and from the airport. Assuming the shuttle service is back up and running when you consider staying there, I would recommend this budget hotel for single male adults and couples. I'm not so sure about single females or families with children. Certainly, the lady on duty at the front desk in the evening did her best to be helpful despite the situation with the non-existent shuttle bus service.~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_445010098~“Dirty and dusty ”~Stayed here for a night before our flight. It was just horrible. I understand that budget hotel rooms are usually small and I don't mind about that. But how about keeping it clean?? The airway in the shower was so dirty (I can't even identify what's blocking the airway). We decided not to take shower at all because of this. :( And the cups and spoons they provided were all dusty. :( We came in the middle of the night and left really early so I had no energy to go down to complain about it.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444979206~“How to do budget right”~After my third stay at this hotel I have decided that this is where I will be staying when in Sydney. The rooms are clean and neat. Because it is a budget hotel the rooms are small but they are well designed to make good use of the limited space. There is a small fridge and tea and coffee making facilities, although I confess to visiting the McDonalds next door for coffee more than once during my stay. The stool and small desk type area is enough to sit and write out a postcard if you were so inclined. There are a few coathangers on the wall in lieu of a wardrobe and this meets my needs for a short stay. The window looks like it is double glazed so there is no street noise at all. The free wifi is advertised as only available in the lobby but it worked for me on the top floor and in the car park. There is good access to buses nearby and the railway station is within walkable distance. Only a couple of negatives. The seats for smokers could be moved away from the front door. Actually I'd prefer that smoking not be allowed near the entrance to the building at all. My floor had a prominent sign warning about heavy penalties for interfering with the operation of the fire door, but then the door was held permanently open with one of those little triangular blocks of wood wedged underneath. I'm pretty sure that fire doors don't work when stuck open.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan

review_443759422~“Small utilitarian hotel”~The rooms are really tiny and nothing prepared me for the crampy-ness despite seeing the hotel photos before booking. There’s literally only space for a large-sized luggage bag. That said, you get what you pay for so no complaints there. The rooms look relatively new which is a plus and very clean. Staff manning the front desk are extremely friendly, helpful and very accommodating when I ask for extra pillows or towels. Each room has a mini bar fridge but I don’t suggest putting any drinks in there, the temperature cannot be controlled and all my drinks turned to slushies because it was just too cold! Ensuites are the size of airplane bathrooms (no kidding) and the sink is on the other side of the room (which means after taking a dump, you literally have to exit the toilet and walk past the bed to get to the sink). Basic amenities are provided (small packets of bar soaps, Lipton tea bags, sugar packets, a kettle and mugs). There are 4 power points and 2 USB ports (very useful!), strangely none of the near the bed (2 just beneath the TV and 2 at the sink). Bed was made every day (again strangely only the queen bed was made but not the bunk bed) and fresh towels provided. Extra toilet rolls were automatically provided when they noticed that the ones in the bathroom were running out. There is no space at all to put your toiletries in the shower area (our bottles wouldn’t fit the small soap dish) so we had to leave them on the floor. No problems with the heater and we had nice hot showers daily. Guests could use the microwave at the café area next to the reception free-of-charge. Laundry amenities were useful (AUD4 per wash and another AUD4 for the dryer – coins only) though you are kind of ‘forced’ to use the dryer because there’s just no space for drying clothes in the room. There’re drinks and snacks vending machines on the ground floor which accepts cash and credit cards. I didn’t see any lifts near the reception area and fortunately was given a ground floor unit so we didn’t have to lug my luggage up flights of stairs. Parking was free and safe but lots were limited as hotel has very high occupancy and you sometimes had to ‘compete’ for lots with the fast food customers from KFC and McDonald’s next door.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan

A taxi ride from the airport cost between 23-30 dollars depending on how honest your taxi cab driver is. An Uber taxi is another option that might be just a little cheaper The rooms have double glass and are quiet enough, i stayed in room 124 a bottom floor which was easy for carting luggage. My room had coffee and kettle, bar fridge, heater/aircon, and tv. The bed was very comfortable, the room was clean enough but probably not for those white glove types, the shower had good water pressure.  Located next door to KFC and McDonalds, Their is also an onsite coin operated laundry. Over all happy with my stay!~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan

Car parking each evening was difficult but again we found a spot although one night a stolen car was dumped next to our vehicle.
