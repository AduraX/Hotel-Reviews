review_475454443~“A rare gem in the heart of Sydney”~Not long ago I had the greatest luck on finding the Mercantile Hotel in The Rocks, Sydney when searching for a place to stay for the first weekend in April. The website looked great, the reviews really positive and it is situated right beside The Rocks weekend market. It is the longest running Irish pub in Australia and we looked forward to arriving.  We got there in the middle of Saturday afternoon and the pub was rocking with lots of patrons and live Irish music. No sooner had we rolled our suitcases to the door when a friendly young man grabbed a case and we followed him straight upstairs to our room, which was fresh and clean and had all the things required for a great stay. The bathrooms were right across the hall and they also were fresh and clean. We went straight downstairs to grab a drink, a table and began people watching in the market. A lovely way to spend the afternoon, we had already booked a table for dinner - the food was fantastic and plentiful.  This hotel is for everyone except people who need absolute quiet, as the music is live and loud, the market can be noisy, and the road traffic from the harbour bridge may disturb a light sleeper. Don't let that put you off staying, it is really a great place to stay right in the thick of things to do and see in Sydney, the staff friendly and helpful and breakfast was included in the very reasonable tariff.....~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474620046~“Ideal location in the Rocks/Circular Quay (Cruises)- shared bathrooms!”~The allure of this hotel is location location location! situated only blocks from the main cruiseport and circular quay train station- it's right in the Rocks and is bustling during the weekends for the market! Also one of the oldest pubs in Sydney, a lovely irish pub with great food. Be wary of the room and hotel set up as it's not for everyone. Rooms are older and bathrooms are shared like a hostel set up. But if you don't mind 4 star accommodations, it's worthwhile to stay here if you are embarking on a cruise or looking to wake up and be right next to the wonderful weekend markets and Sydney harbor bridge. Staff is attentive, breakfast is included (basic brekky), and live music is wonderful on the weekends. BEWARE- rooms on the lower levels are directly above the bar and live music and don't plan on getting some sleep before 1AM! Feels like you are literally in the bar.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_474408604~“Lovely little stop for lunch”~Went for a stroll in Sydney and came across this little Irish gem. It was lunch time so we had fish and chips and a pint.

review_474233898~“Very handy if going on a cruise”~As we were boarding a cruise ship in Circular Quay we found that this hotel was an ideal spot to stay the night before as it is only a couple of minutes walk through the Rocks area downhill to the terminal. Very basic rooms with shared bathrooms across the hallway which by the way were nice and clean. We believe it is one of the oldest Irish Pubs in the country and the place was really humming being a Friday night. We had a good meal there before retiring for the night and a nice cooked breakfast in the morning. Quite noisy in the rooms coming from the bar downstairs where a band were playing, most of the staff seemed to be Irish I think which is a nice touch , all friendly. No lifts so we had to carry our luggage up a couple of flights of narrow stairs something to keep in mind as could be a problem for some people. Quite expensive for an old pub , but it has character and is ideally suited if your off on a cruise. Good free wifi.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan

Also perfect location if you're going on a cruise as the terminal is a street over. Would definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_468896589~“Irish Hospitality at the Mercantile Hotel”~The staff at the Mercantile Hotel are very welcoming and efficient. When we arrived in February after their usual hours, they were available to give us our key and Martin even provided a cold beer! They also gave us some breakfast provisions since our two-day sightseeing tour left before the breakfast hour at the hotel. The area - the "Rocks" is steeped in history and the Mercantile is an excellent location for seeing the sights. It is also walking distance to the Cruise Ship pier where we were taking a cruise the next week. Highly recommended!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460451829~“Prime Location ”~Here for two nights. Five minute walk to Circular Quay with Sydney Opera House and Ferry, train and bus services. Literally hotel is under Sydney Harbour Bridge. Hotel is basic. We shared bathrooms but plenty of them. Pub grub really tasty. Rooms cleaned daily with fresh linen and towels. Would recommend hotel for short break early in week (belive it's noisy at weekends with market and music). Great value for money, location superb.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459824009~“Very disappointed”~Nice Irish pub with friendly staff however the amenities let this place down. The check in process is not good when there is loud music playing and you have to go to the bar to check in. The room was stuffy and hot with a portable air conditioner turned on as we arrived. Loud live music until 11:30pm on a Sunday night. During the night the bed was covered in ants and crawling all over me, also at breakfast the next morning a very large cockroach walked across the kitchen floor.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~1~3~nan

review_457271283~“Great Location, very friendly staff”~The location can't be beat! We were there for two nights prior to a cruise which left from a port about 500 meters from the hotel... located I. "The Rocks" there are plenty of great restaurants, pubs, attractions, circular quay, etc. the restaurant in the hotel was one of the best we tried.. very friendly and hard working staff.. all of this being said I would not stay here again. Our room was directly over the bar with live music until the early morning each night. Loud live music.. I can live with the property being somewhat run down, very old building, shared bathrooms, no elevators, but the loud music shook our room u till well after midnight.. after a long trip from the states.. on the plus side, it did sound like everybody there was having an awesome time..~2~3~nan~1~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456981342~“Authentic Heritage Aussie Pub Experience”~Sydney CBD is my preferred long weekend escape: Must do's intrical to the escape include Sydney Ferries and the Mercantile. Sitting right in the heart of The Rocks, the Mercantile Pub is a authentic experience, none of the manufactured contemporary entertainment venue about this establishment!  One of Sydney's oldest pubs in what seems original condition, beautifully maintained. Just no fuss or pretence here! Clientele are a mix: Obviously locals, regulars and tourists. Always a friendly bunch. Never seen why it's needed, but always seems to have some mature, discreet security just in case that live music scene gets a little rowdy I guess! Oh yes the music, plenty of live music, Irish and folk stuff. And that style fits wonderfully in the context. Usually an older crowd. Staff always working holidayers, you guessed it, expect an Irish lad to pull your pale ale! Meals are generous and good quality. My recommendation the house special, 'Irish Guiness Pie' with Mash, a must try! Washed down with a schooner or two of '50 Lashes  Pale Ale': Well must I really go back to worksite time! Don't visit Sydney without the Mercantile authentic experience!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455673048~“Bad experience!”~We ordered breakfast at approx. 9.50 on Sunday morning. The orange juice arrived and then 30 mins later we checked to see where our breakfast was. We were told our order hadn't reached the kitchen from the bar but we decided to wait as we were really looking forward to our big Irish breakfast. We were talking to a lovely staff member from Ireland during this time and realised that another 30 mins had passed. Next of all we see two breakfasts being served to another table ... they had forgot our order .... TWICE ! The attitude we got when we complained was appauling. No apology, only reason was that the chef was stupid! An older male member of staff was totally rude by ignoring my daughter when she spoke to him. We asked to see the manager who looked dumbfounded when we told him what happened!!! SHAME ON YOU ALL FOR YOUR ATTITUDE AND TOTAL LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT THE WORST PART WAS ..... "YOU JUST DIDNT CARE"!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_453581745~“Disgusting”~Do not consider going to this pub for a drink or to stay.

review_452900718~“Great spot for a short stay before cruising.”~We stayed one night before leaving on our cruise.  I loved it, very touristy, just what we wanted before the start to our holiday. It was noisy, but we were aware of that. The music in the bar till late and the construction of the market stalls at some ungodly hour of the morning. ( The Rocks Market is outside the Pub) Oh well. The shared bathrooms were clean and spacious. The rooms were dated but ok. The aircon was a portable one.... would have been noisy at night had we needed to use it. Luckily we didnt. Breakfast was included in our room fee and was ok.  We bought dinner at the venue one night. It was busy and there was live music playing. Food came out in reasonable time and was good for the price. Awesome place to do some sight seeing. Lots of attractions in the area only a walk away. Recommended as long as you dont mind a bit of noise.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_452496280~“Lunch in The Rocks”~I was strolling through The Rocks around lunch time and found the cozy Irish pub. The lunch special of the day was $15 for rump steak and chips. They were accommodating and subbed me a salad instead with no charge, and I ordered the steak medium...but it was served very, very well done. I know it was $15 but I was a bit disappointed (although I still ate it). I dined outside which was a great decision because it was in the shade (on a hot summer day), comfortable chairs and nice atmosphere. Because of the atmosphere I'm sure I will be back again (maybe for Friday happy hour with $1 wings!).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_451603215~“Great lunch time pub”~Looked for somewhere to have lunch on a weekday, close to Circular Quay and decided on The Rocks. We were not disappointed with the great service, reasonably priced drinks and the food. The specials were amazing. I had a 250g rump steak and mash all cooked medium to perfection and so tender and tasty, served steaming hot all for $15. I cant believe how good the steak was given the low cost. They also had chicken schnitzel and chips on the specials for $12 and looked good. They also had good looking grilled sole which I might try next time if still on the menu. My wife had the steak sandwhich and chips which was equally as good and great value. There was quite a comprehensive menu. The bar staff were very friendly and provided excellent service from behind the bar and also outside where they cleaned tables, asked about the meals and offered to serve drinks etc. So many other places charge the earth and with staff who couldn't care less. This Mercantile hotel is one of my new favourites in Sydney and will come again for drinks and a meal or snack when in the area. Well done.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_441644680~“Great location”~This hotel has character and is in a great location for exploring and as a first time visitor to the area I couldn't believe how close to the bridge and the opera house we were.  It was not quite the photos I saw, and I missed the bit on no bathrooms in the room.  Markets are right outside which is great but be warned: it's pretty noisy - all night and morning. You can shut the window, and listen to the noise of the aircon? Even earplugs weren't that helpful, although my friend reckoned she had a great sleep. Beds were comfortable, free wifi, and breakfast were included. Shared bathrooms were clean, good water pressure in the one that did work (one wasn't working but we let the staff know), hot water took a long time to show up (let the staff know about that too).  Continental breakfast was good and plentiful. We should have stayed to try dinner options (would have been cheaper than around the opera house).  Guinness and a shandy were $16 It was good for what we needed - one nights accommodation after attending a show at the Opera house, but the street noise factor would be reconsideration booking it again, for longer.~3~nan~nan~1~3~nan~1~nan
review_440708723~“Down in The Rocks ...”~The Mercantile is very good. Rooms are not modern but large. Bathroom is big. Not noisy in your room as you may imagine. I had Room 16. Sorry I missed The Irish Breakfast which I think is part of the tariff in the weekends. The markets are right outside your door & singing in the bar down below your room but it didn't bother me.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_424037384~“it is a hotel/Irish pub; I went to the pub for food”~it is almost self serve. You go the bar to get a drink. You go to the kitchen to order your dinner. You get your own utensils. But, they bring the food to you. I was first to order but last to get dinner; we all ordered the same dish. It is a pub so it is very noisy.  I had the Irish stew which was excellent.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422855612~“Perfect Location for Iconic Sydney Sights”~I was a little hesitant to book this hotel. I actually booked it, then canceled, then booked it again. I found a great deal and ensured that we had our own bathroom, so I committed completely. Its a direct train ride from international arrivals to Circular Quay ($15), or you can take a bus to the first train stop outside the airport, which cost us $3.50 instead of the $15. (opal cards are free). You are dropped right in front of the Opera House, and its a 8 minute walk up George St to the Hotel. Yes, this is above a pub, so YES on weekends it gets rather loud. I always bring ear plugs with me, and they came in very handy on Sunday Night. All other nights (stayed a total of 5) were quiet.  Keep this in mind, its a 101 year old building, it creaks, and nothing is overly fancy but that just adds to the charm. If I ever come back to Sydney, I would definitely say here again. The people who run it are so friendly, got to know us so quickly. Jodie was AMAZING. It was a block down from darling harbor, you are under the Harbor Bridge, down a block from the Opera House. And we ended up walking everywhere through out the city, even to Bondi (4 miles or so).  Great place, great people, great iconic views!~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_418401849~“Great place to stay”~Stayed for 8 nights in this old Irish pub/ hotel. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great bands on at weekends. Very reasonably priced and great location right in the heart of The rocks area so round the corner from Opera House, Harbour Bridge, great transport links. There's lots of nice places to eat and drink all around this area, as well as the weekly Rocks Market right outside the hotel. The hotel is a little dated, but that's part of the charm. The rooms are fairly basic, but clean and comfortable,so don't be expecting 5 star!~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_417553552~“Quaint Irish hotel ”~We are Irish and decided to stay here as a little taste of home before we returned to Dublin! The room price was very affordable considering the brilliant location, only a 5 minute walk to circular quay! The hotel decor was very quaint and really felt like the small inns and B&Bs back home. Our ensuite room was a good size with a very comfortable bed, smart TV and huge bathroom complete with shower and bathtub with jets! We stayed mid week so didn't experience any issues with noise from the pub but it did seem a lot busier with live music on the Friday evening when we were leaving. The only downside to the hotel was the 'continental' breakfast served during the week was quite poor with only toast, basic cereals and a few apples and bananas to choose from. Some croissants, meats/cheeses or a wider selection of fruits would improve this! They serve hot breakfasts on the weekend but we didn't stay to try these. Despite this we'd definitely recommend this hotel on the basis of its brilliant rooms, location and affordability!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416760301~“An Affordable Irish Pub”~The Mercantile Hotel in The Rocks Sydney is claimed to be the oldest running Irish Pub in Australia. It is located in an amazing location almost underneath the southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The buildings features inside and out give an indication that this establishment is certainly part of Sydney’s colourful past. The two bars have a good selection of standard and craft beers at fair prices. Tables and chairs are plentiful both inside and out but many patrons preferred to stand in the upper and lower bars. The footpath seating was popular and was the site for live musical entertainment. The menu was extensive and featured many Irish food favourites. The staff were friendly and efficient. It is obviously popular with locals (upper bar?) and visitors (lower bar?). Highly recommended.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_414122168~“A good option for a few nights stay in Sydney”~The Mercantile Hotel is a good option for a few nights stay in Sydney if you don't mind about the sound of the music coming from the pub that exists in the ground floor.  If you need to fall asleep before midnight, then run away from Mercantile because there are any kind of sound-proofing system in the rooms. The location, in the Rocks, is very good only five minutes away from Circular Quay and and the breakfast is quite better from what usually is served in Sydney B&B. Anyway, because of the noise, I really don't know if I'd ever stay in Mercantile...~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

The hotel has inside bar area and a large outside eating/drinking area. It was getting late and the place was emptying. I had the sausages with mashed potatoes and my wife had this salmon with asparagus and mash. Both were excellent (we sat next to the kitchen and watched the chef make them from scratch!! The staff were very pleasant indeed! All in all a very positive dining experience!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_468896589~“Irish Hospitality at the Mercantile Hotel”~The staff at the Mercantile Hotel are very welcoming and efficient. When we arrived in February after their usual hours, they were available to give us our key and Martin even provided a cold beer! They also gave us some breakfast provisions since our two-day sightseeing tour left before the breakfast hour at the hotel. The area - the "Rocks" is steeped in history and the Mercantile is an excellent location for seeing the sights. It is also walking distance to the Cruise Ship pier where we were taking a cruise the next week. Highly recommended!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460451829~“Prime Location ”~Here for two nights. Five minute walk to Circular Quay with Sydney Opera House and Ferry, train and bus services. Literally hotel is under Sydney Harbour Bridge. Hotel is basic. We shared bathrooms but plenty of them. Pub grub really tasty. Rooms cleaned daily with fresh linen and towels. Would recommend hotel for short break early in week (belive it's noisy at weekends with market and music). Great value for money, location superb.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459824009~“Very disappointed”~Nice Irish pub with friendly staff however the amenities let this place down. The check in process is not good when there is loud music playing and you have to go to the bar to check in. The room was stuffy and hot with a portable air conditioner turned on as we arrived. Loud live music until 11:30pm on a Sunday night. During the night the bed was covered in ants and crawling all over me, also at breakfast the next morning a very large cockroach walked across the kitchen floor.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_459696928~“Excellent Pub”~We visited the Mercantile a few times whilst staying again in Sydney. The food is now better than ever with a very good choice at reasonable prices and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere at weekends is great with live music and this is definitely the pub to visit whilst in Sydney - you won't be disappointed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457271283~“Great Location, very friendly staff”~The location can't be beat! We were there for two nights prior to a cruise which left from a port about 500 meters from the hotel... located I. "The Rocks" there are plenty of great restaurants, pubs, attractions, circular quay, etc. the restaurant in the hotel was one of the best we tried.. very friendly and hard working staff.. all of this being said I would not stay here again. Our room was directly over the bar with live music until the early morning each night. Loud live music.. I can live with the property being somewhat run down, very old building, shared bathrooms, no elevators, but the loud music shook our room u till well after midnight.. after a long trip from the states.. on the plus side, it did sound like everybody there was having an awesome time..~2~3~nan~1~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456981342~“Authentic Heritage Aussie Pub Experience”~Sydney CBD is my preferred long weekend escape: Must do's intrical to the escape include Sydney Ferries and the Mercantile. Sitting right in the heart of The Rocks, the Mercantile Pub is a authentic experience, none of the manufactured contemporary entertainment venue about this establishment!  One of Sydney's oldest pubs in what seems original condition, beautifully maintained. Just no fuss or pretence here! Clientele are a mix: Obviously locals, regulars and tourists. Always a friendly bunch. Never seen why it's needed, but always seems to have some mature, discreet security just in case that live music scene gets a little rowdy I guess! Oh yes the music, plenty of live music, Irish and folk stuff. And that style fits wonderfully in the context. Usually an older crowd. Staff always working holidayers, you guessed it, expect an Irish lad to pull your pale ale! Meals are generous and good quality. My recommendation the house special, 'Irish Guiness Pie' with Mash, a must try! Washed down with a schooner or two of '50 Lashes  Pale Ale': Well must I really go back to worksite time! Don't visit Sydney without the Mercantile authentic experience!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455673048~“Bad experience!”~We ordered breakfast at approx. 9.50 on Sunday morning. The orange juice arrived and then 30 mins later we checked to see where our breakfast was. We were told our order hadn't reached the kitchen from the bar but we decided to wait as we were really looking forward to our big Irish breakfast. We were talking to a lovely staff member from Ireland during this time and realised that another 30 mins had passed. Next of all we see two breakfasts being served to another table ... they had forgot our order .... TWICE ! The attitude we got when we complained was appauling. No apology, only reason was that the chef was stupid! An older male member of staff was totally rude by ignoring my daughter when she spoke to him. We asked to see the manager who looked dumbfounded when we told him what happened!!! SHAME ON YOU ALL FOR YOUR ATTITUDE AND TOTAL LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT THE WORST PART WAS ..... "YOU JUST DIDNT CARE"!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_453581745~“Disgusting”~Do not consider going to this pub for a drink or to stay. The door staff man handle clients because they feel they have the authority to do so instead of having a conversation. I am absolutely disgusted in the way I have been treated this evening.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452900718~“Great spot for a short stay before cruising.”~We stayed one night before leaving on our cruise.  I loved it, very touristy, just what we wanted before the start to our holiday. It was noisy, but we were aware of that. The music in the bar till late and the construction of the market stalls at some ungodly hour of the morning. ( The Rocks Market is outside the Pub) Oh well. The shared bathrooms were clean and spacious. The rooms were dated but ok. The aircon was a portable one.... would have been noisy at night had we needed to use it. Luckily we didnt. Breakfast was included in our room fee and was ok.  We bought dinner at the venue one night. It was busy and there was live music playing. Food came out in reasonable time and was good for the price. Awesome place to do some sight seeing. Lots of attractions in the area only a walk away. Recommended as long as you dont mind a bit of noise.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_452496280~“Lunch in The Rocks”~I was strolling through The Rocks around lunch time and found the cozy Irish pub. The lunch special of the day was $15 for rump steak and chips. They were accommodating and subbed me a salad instead with no charge, and I ordered the steak medium...but it was served very, very well done. I know it was $15 but I was a bit disappointed (although I still ate it). I dined outside which was a great decision because it was in the shade (on a hot summer day), comfortable chairs and nice atmosphere. Because of the atmosphere I'm sure I will be back again (maybe for Friday happy hour with $1 wings!).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_431363320~“Location, Location, Location”~Stayed 1 night Pros: Very close to Circular Quay train Station easy walk to hotel - even with luggage. So close to the opera house and circular Quay walkway . We stayed here because it was by the cruise terminal so we could board our cruise the next morning - absolutely perfect Absolutely lovely and helpful staff Cons: the air-con system was very load but at least it wasn't hot in the room~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~5~nan
review_424037384~“it is a hotel/Irish pub; I went to the pub for food”~it is almost self serve. You go the bar to get a drink. You go to the kitchen to order your dinner. You get your own utensils. But, they bring the food to you. I was first to order but last to get dinner; we all ordered the same dish. It is a pub so it is very noisy.  I had the Irish stew which was excellent.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422855612~“Perfect Location for Iconic Sydney Sights”~I was a little hesitant to book this hotel. I actually booked it, then canceled, then booked it again. I found a great deal and ensured that we had our own bathroom, so I committed completely. Its a direct train ride from international arrivals to Circular Quay ($15), or you can take a bus to the first train stop outside the airport, which cost us $3.50 instead of the $15. (opal cards are free). You are dropped right in front of the Opera House, and its a 8 minute walk up George St to the Hotel. Yes, this is above a pub, so YES on weekends it gets rather loud. I always bring ear plugs with me, and they came in very handy on Sunday Night. All other nights (stayed a total of 5) were quiet.  Keep this in mind, its a 101 year old building, it creaks, and nothing is overly fancy but that just adds to the charm. If I ever come back to Sydney, I would definitely say here again. The people who run it are so friendly, got to know us so quickly. Jodie was AMAZING. It was a block down from darling harbor, you are under the Harbor Bridge, down a block from the Opera House. And we ended up walking everywhere through out the city, even to Bondi (4 miles or so).  Great place, great people, great iconic views!~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_418401849~“Great place to stay”~Stayed for 8 nights in this old Irish pub/ hotel. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great bands on at weekends. Very reasonably priced and great location right in the heart of The rocks area so round the corner from Opera House, Harbour Bridge, great transport links. There's lots of nice places to eat and drink all around this area, as well as the weekly Rocks Market right outside the hotel. The hotel is a little dated, but that's part of the charm. The rooms are fairly basic, but clean and comfortable,so don't be expecting 5 star!~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_417553552~“Quaint Irish hotel ”~We are Irish and decided to stay here as a little taste of home before we returned to Dublin! The room price was very affordable considering the brilliant location, only a 5 minute walk to circular quay! The hotel decor was very quaint and really felt like the small inns and B&Bs back home. Our ensuite room was a good size with a very comfortable bed, smart TV and huge bathroom complete with shower and bathtub with jets! We stayed mid week so didn't experience any issues with noise from the pub but it did seem a lot busier with live music on the Friday evening when we were leaving. The only downside to the hotel was the 'continental' breakfast served during the week was quite poor with only toast, basic cereals and a few apples and bananas to choose from. Some croissants, meats/cheeses or a wider selection of fruits would improve this! They serve hot breakfasts on the weekend but we didn't stay to try these. Despite this we'd definitely recommend this hotel on the basis of its brilliant rooms, location and affordability!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416760301~“An Affordable Irish Pub”~The Mercantile Hotel in The Rocks Sydney is claimed to be the oldest running Irish Pub in Australia. It is located in an amazing location almost underneath the southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The buildings features inside and out give an indication that this establishment is certainly part of Sydney’s colourful past. The two bars have a good selection of standard and craft beers at fair prices. Tables and chairs are plentiful both inside and out but many patrons preferred to stand in the upper and lower bars. The footpath seating was popular and was the site for live musical entertainment. The menu was extensive and featured many Irish food favourites. The staff were friendly and efficient. It is obviously popular with locals (upper bar?) and visitors (lower bar?). Highly recommended.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_414122168~“A good option for a few nights stay in Sydney”~The Mercantile Hotel is a good option for a few nights stay in Sydney if you don't mind about the sound of the music coming from the pub that exists in the ground floor.  If you need to fall asleep before midnight, then run away from Mercantile because there are any kind of sound-proofing system in the rooms. The location, in the Rocks, is very good only five minutes away from Circular Quay and and the breakfast is quite better from what usually is served in Sydney B&B. Anyway, because of the noise, I really don't know if I'd ever stay in Mercantile...~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_413056710~“Recovery pint after Sydney Bridge Climb”~A great hotel pub with a nice ambiance and an Irish barmaid!Local beers on tap and the Victoria Bitter was very nice.

review_406365926~“Perfect place to relax”~Great pub to relax and chill out after The City2Surf. Great music on a Sunday afternoon, relaxed surroundings. The drink prices were cheap compared to other pubs around The Rocks. Great choice of food on the menu and large meals to satisfy everyone. Well Worth the walk to find this pub. It's not our first time and it won't be our last .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
