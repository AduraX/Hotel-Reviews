review_478532905~“Superb hotel”~We stayed March 20-24, 2017 in a suite with bedroom overlooking the Opera House and sitting room overlooking the Harbour Bridge. Spacious rooms with everything we could wish for. Separate lavatory with washbasin off the large hallway. Bathroom off the bedroom had lavatory, and large shower separate from the bathtub. Bedroom had lots of wardrobe and drawer space. Internet worked well. No hitches with the minibar. When I first booked, I assumed that Club Lounge access would come free with the room (as in US hotels) but you have to pay extra. Reservations and helpline people were quick to sort all this out for me, and it turns out that paying for the Club Lounge is well worth while. The Club Lounge is one of the best features of this hotel and offers so much more than your typical concierge lounge. Big room with full length windows on two sides, superb views, and an outside terrace. Best of all, the food is substantial and tasty and there is a full bar service. Enormous choice of lovely food for breakfast, and even the toaster worked properly. (Most hotel toasters are awful.) Drinks are free during happy hours and the buffet almost amounts to a free dinner. I really cannot fault this hotel. The room was great, all the members of staff were friendly and helpful, the Club Lounge was wonderful. Of course it was not cheap, especially with the current value of the pound sterling, but you do get what you pay for. Truly a five star experience.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478158789~“Amazing Views of both Sydney Icons”~Spent four nights at this Intercontinental Hotel. The location is ideal and the view from the higher floors of both Sydney icons, the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge is amazing. In addition since we were catching a Cruise, it was great to see Cruise Ships dock at the port. The hotel is a FIVE minute walk to the Cruise Terminal when you need to check in!! The area is full of restaurants and a lovely place to walk and see the world go by! Saw~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477395448~“Inconsistent service but otherwise a nice hotel”~I loved the way they did this hotel - the modern feel with the old bits preserved. I also love the convenience of the location -the Best. Breakfast buffet selection quite good with the juicers a definite plus! I found the hotel service quite inconsistent though as there were times when responses were slow, ie, delivery of water bottles to the room. Likewise, there was an evening when bed turn-down was not done, nor chocolates or water bottles placed beside the bed. Check-in service mislead us too. We were told that our Rooms would be ready in a hour. When we got back two hours later, not all the rooms were ready.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_477370248~“Great experience !”~Stood there already a few times over the last year and i really love it. The Club Lounge has a fantastic view on the bridge and opera house, and having breakfast or afternoon tea with such a view is stunning. Rooms also have a very nice view on the bridge, and quite clean. The gym is nice too, but the only thing I did not like was the Sauna which is small, old and without space to rest... (minor but i like it after sport). Aside this, I have been in many Intercontinental around the globe, it is part of my top 5...~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_476662688~“Clumsy and mediocre experience - despite my best efforts!”~Look if you book a night or weekend to stay here you're probably going to have a good time and enjoy your stay.  I on the other hand organised the rooms for my best friend getting married and it was lazily mishandled and mismanaged from the IHG group.  I organised the rooms 2 - 3 months before the big weekend over the phone (gave all the correct names and info) and even popped into the hotel 1 week prior to pay and check all the details would be 100% correct. Nothing confusing. Just to ensure the bride and groom's details (spelling of name etc) and penthouse room was perfect.  I had a "standard" room booked for myself.  Upon arrival (the day before the wedding) the check in process was awkward because they had spelled my name wrong and I had 2 x identities in the System. Despite that we checked in and I took the bride and groom to be up to their special Harbourview room to check it out. There was a bottle of wine waiting which was nice but the card was addressed in my surname (as if I was getting married) and the tv was welcoming me to the room (name spelt incorrectly also!) The hotel were very apologetic and sent us fruit platters and more wine but at nighttime after dinner, despite me saying tomorrow morning would be better. Also would not comp the sandwiches for the girls getting ready in the morning. The morning after the wedding the bride and groom were woken up at 10am with a knock on the door asking when they would be checking out. This is despite the fact the room has a special 2pm check out applied in the cost! Amazing! Breakfast is lovely and the view superb! I was considering booking this hotel for my fathers birthday celebrations coming up but just don't feel confident enough to do so.  For the cost I paid, it just didn't measure up to my expectations. I've travelled across many continents and received better service at cheaper and lower rates hotels. I cannot recommend this establishment.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_476631655~“Excellent hotel in highly convenient location”~We elected to stay here on a visit to Sydney to attend the opera. The location is perfect for finding nearby restaurants, visiting the Quay or even strolling into the city centre - all of which we enjoyed. The staff were welcoming and our room was very comfortable. Toward the end of our stay we had a small issue with the door key cards not working but eventually a staff member accompanied us to our room and resolved the problem and offered a small reduction in our account at check-out to compensate for the inconvenience.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476613661~“Club benefits delightful.”~Spent 3 nights here for a conference and was very impressed with this hotel. Everything was just so easy!! No wait for checkin or out, friendly unpretentious staff who were relentlessly attentive, clean comfortable room with evening turn down service and a great location a minute from circular quay or 10 minute stroll to the Pitt street mall. The club lounge was absolutely lovely. Generous food and drinks servings, exceptional views and great service. Thanks to Rachel especially for her friendly helpfulness.  This hotel gets it right.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476253762~“The best 5-star hotel during my Australian trip”~This hotel has an excellent location within walking distance to almost everything a tourist would be interested to visit. This was one of the reasons why I picked it, and also InterContinental's reputation for quality and service. All my expectations of this hotel were met starting with the moment I stepped outside the car. The bell staff helped with all my luggage, the check-in process was very smooth and efficient, the room was large with comfortable beds and pillows, good coffee machine, and all other amenities you expect to see in this types of hotels. As IHG member I was able to use free Wi-Fi (I thin it is not free for non-members). My hotel rate included buffet-style breakfast, and it was great with lots of options including different types of freshly squeezed juices. Overall, I was more than happy to stay at this hotel for a couple of days during my recent trip.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476244890~“Wonderful location and views”~We've stayed at a few Sydney hotels over the years but we think this is the best. The location is superb, close to the shops, the Opera House, ferries and the train. We stayed in the Club rooms which although a little dated were clean and well appointed. The views are the best I've seen and the staff were without fault, friendly, helpful and kind. The club rooms have the best views in the city with a great selection of food and drinks. We will return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476229735~“Lovely view hotel with friendly staff, treating guests with respect. ”~Very nice view around the darling harbour from the hotel and friendly hotel staff. Very helpful. Easy to walk around the city from the hotel and the beautiful botanic garden close by. I really enjoyed while staying in this hotel. I'll love to visit again in future.  If the swimming pool was heated pool would be perfect for the kids.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476041339~“Pre Cruise Stay”~We arrived after our flight from Darwin for our cruise that was beginning the day after. The receptionist Huong and other staff members we wonderful. We decided to splurge and upgrade to a Harbour View Room (even though it only had twin beds it didn't bother us) we loved the view and the prompt delivery of our luggage. We decided that after the long flight from Darwin that we order room service. Which was lovely, the hubby had the hamburger and I had the chicken club sandwich. Which was all delivered on a trolley which we had placed in front of the window with the wonderful view. We woke after a very restful night to the sight of the ship that we were boarding that morning We had the buffet breakfast in the morning which was lovely. Had never seen such a big selection of breakfast items there was also a self juicing machine to make your own juice which I had never seen before. Would highly recommend this property and we hope to stay here again after the cruise we are doing in March next year.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476030289~“Romantic treat”~Spent a night here with my girlfriend recently and could not have been more impressed. Greeted by very professional valet parking and reception. Our room was ready early with views to kill. Close to so many great places. Harbour view suite was Beautiful, included Buffet breakfast was amazing. And the supper club on level 32 deserves its own review~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476030057~“Excellent stay”~We were thoroughly impressed with the hotel, one of the best we have stayed in. After a mixup with our booking, the manager worked hard to ensure our room was ready on arrival, which was much appreciated. Our bridge view room was well worth the money - spectacular - and the breakfast is also one of the best we've seen. A few downsides: walls are so thin that it's easy to be disturbed by those next to you. Also, the pool was supposedly heated but was absolutely freezing. By contrast to the excellent staff elsewhere, downstairs bar staff could be better. Would stay again and would recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475872093~“Great hotel”~I stayed a couple of nights in the beginning of the year. It's an old building connected to a tower. The old building gives it a very nice feel to the hotel. It is a little bit worn down overall. Breakfast was OK, service very good. I would say 4* +~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475756841~“Worthless reception”~Arrived after a long flight from Europe. Platinum Ambassador.  Room not ready before 16:00. Reception told us not to be disappointed because we would get an upgrade to one of the most beautiful rooms in the house. They promised a welcome drink, but never delivered. Finally receiving the room key to find out we just got the (Eastern Bay View) room we already booked.  Normally you would expect your complementary water and fruit upon arrival and even more so when arriving after such long flight. I asked for some, but reception was not willing to help: wait till turn-down. The room itself was a typical InterContinetal reliable room. As expected. Although we do prefer bathrooms with separate shower. The view towards park and bay was nice, but the window seat was completely wet. Mentioned it to reception. They told us the weather was very bad the day before, but did nothing to solve the problem. Breakfast was included only the first night. I asked reception if I could have breakfast on day 2 and three. Not possible; the hotel was fully booked. Not even at 7:00 on Sunday and Monday.  Receive a check-out note after the first night, with charges for the minibar we never used.  Now we wanted to talk to a manager. As a gesture we did get the Monday breakfast for free. And we were seated in a almost empty restaurant. Breakfast was very nice. And friendly Alisha made us feel at home. She, together with the perfect location of the hotel, is the reason we still award this place with 'average'.  The hotel charges a merchant fee for using American Express. Nothing is mentioned about this during the reservation process or at check-in. In the in-room directory there is a notification. At check out reception confronted us with this extra charge. We refuged to pay, they accepted. We left with an unwelcome feeling as a guest and certainly as a platinum member and took a taxi (seems to be always available) to the InterContinental Double Bay (no assistance at the door).~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_475749258~“It should be better than this”~The staff were the highlight- very pleasant, eager to please and made up for some of the negative points below: -Heated swimming pool was small, freezing with blown up toys and noisy kids in it all day long. -No jacuzzi even though it advertises "Spa" -The neighbouring rooms could be heard through the thin walls. -Room bathroom had hair on the floor and the scales were broken. -The facilities are nothing like the leading hotel chains found elsewhere in Sydney (for the same price) Overall a little disappointed, first and last time for intercontinental.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_475696466~“Loved this hotel”~Very nice hotel in a great location just a stroll from Sydney Harbour and CBD. We stayed in Club room with access to lounge which was possibly the best lounge experience we have ever had, plus the view is astounding. Top Marks.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475520267~“Good position.”~Stayed here for a couple of nights and was pleased with the hotel. Good rooms and good facilities. Nice rooftop bar and great views of the harbour from the room.

review_475505973~“Not at par with other 5 star hotels”~I have high expectations from Intercontinental Sydney being part of a well-known 5 star international chain of hotels. First off, our eastern view room is not that clean which is what I would expect in a 5 star hotel. Room is dusty and have some black unknown dirt(?) on the windowsill and bedside table. Secondly, furnitures are dated and not as impressive as with other hotels. Third, service is ok but not at par with other hotels of the same calibre. Staff lack the hospitality and the desire to go the extra mile in terms of service. On the other side, some of the hotel's positives include an instant service button on the room phone which lets you request additional items that you might need like different types of pillows, extra toiletries and other stuff. Location is also great, near the Opera house and botanical garden, view in the room is good although we didn't have an Opera House or Harbour Bridge views. Wi-fi is free for IHG members but access to the Club Lounge will require you to add more on top of your room charge if you want to go there. However, hotel guests have free acess to indoor heated pool, fitness centre and sauna which is a plus. I have yet to try their restaurants like Cafe Opera for buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner but it is highly rated and I am looking forward to try it myself. Overall, the hotel is still good but could be better.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475480080~“Not up to "Intercontinental" Standards”~I stayed in the Intercontinental Sydney on April 12-14. This was our first trip to Sydney and my wife and I were celebrating a very special day. It was a conglomeration of small things that made this a terrible stay for us. We stay at IHG hotels quite often and we are both Platinum members. We usually love Intercontinental hotels. Here is the list of everything that went wrong: 1) I had emailed the general manager Mr. Boeckeler about a week prior to our arrival to ask if he could make this stay for us special due to our anniversary, but we never got a response from him. 2) Upon arrival the lady at check-in was friendly. However there were no notes on our account about our anniversary, which I had contacted the hotel earlier about. I politely asked her if there may be a room with a view of the Opera House. She told us there were none available for the first night, but there was one for the second night. We didn't mind switching rooms. We were looking forward to it, the pictures I had seen of the views looked amazing. However, the next day I called to see what time we could change rooms and they notified me that there would be a $75 charge to change to the new room. We declined.  3) The room was dated and there were stains on the pillow cases. The TV was also VERY small and old. We were on the 12th floor which is either the lowest or 2nd lowest floor that had rooms on it. The lady at the check-in said it had a "Harbor Bridge View" There was NO view of the Harbor Bridge. The view was not good. I guess being an IHG Platinum member means nothing when it comes to the room allocation. 4) I usually plug my laptop into the TV in the room via an HDMI cable to watch movies from my laptop. This room had a special bracket screwed into the back of the TV, simply to not allow you to plug in your HDMI cable.  5) The air conditioning system does NOT work. Both nights we were there we turned the thermostat down so the room would be cool while we slept. It did NOT work. My wife and I both woke up sweating each night and could not sleep. I spoke with someone at the front desk and they informed us that if the system does not sense movement it turns off. So I guess we weren't moving around enough in our sleep to keep the air conditioning on......  6) I have a bad back and I asked for a few extra pillows. A few HOURS later the pillows arrived. The next day we left in the morning to explore Sydney and put the "Please service our room" tag on the door. We came back around 4pm and the room was not clean. I called and they said they would send someone up right away. About an hour later she showed up and cleaned the room while we walked around in the lobby and waited in the hallway. When we went back into the room, we noticed she had taken the pillows out. I called down again and explained that housekeeping had taken our pillows and we would need more. About 45 minutes later someone came up to our room with 1 pillow. I asked him for 2 more and then he came back again with only 1 more and said they didn't have another one. An Intercontinental Hotel that doesn't have enough pillows!!!?? That's a first. At check-out I was asked how our stay was and I politely explained we had a few problems. The agent was friendly, but I could tell she just wanted me to leave and brushed off my problems as if they were nothing.  Overall this was NOT a good stay for us. We are loyal to IHG and were VERY disappointed. This is not up to the standards of an Intercontinental Hotel. Honestly, I would like a refund of my award nights or at least one of them. My wife and I saved up these award nights for something special, which this was not. I don't know who to contact as they never returned my emails in the first place.~1~nan~nan~nan~1~2~1~nan
review_475428802~“Left disappointed”~Booking a quality hotel, you expect the bell boys to whisk your luggage out of the car and into your room, the elegant and efficient check in staff, the beautiful atrium cafe, the large comfortable bed, the well appointed bathroom with far too many soft fluffy towels. Yes the InterContinental Sydney has all of this, at the usual premium price. However, I paid for a view as much as anything else. The Eastern Harbour view was more expensive than the Bridge and Opera House view rooms, so I foolishly expected a better view - possibly of one or both of the icons included. Silly boy, should have done my geography lessons before booking, as what I got was a view of the shabby roof tops below, the busy highway, and the treetops of (very nice) botanical gardens, as well as some navy ships off in the distant water. All this though windows that were so dirty, they have surely never been acquainted with a window cleaner. Yes, it was possibly my mistake, but the clever marketing sucked me in. In short, be careful what you book before hitting the submit button. Decided to go up to the swimming pool and found a small, enclosed and frankly unappealing pool which was also disappointing. As a final straw, the cleaning staff managed to take one of our private towels from the room (despite being folded up on a chair with some clothing), how they managed to mistake it for one of their own is beyond me - it was a different colour! We contacted the facilities staff, and never heard a peep before checked out. Yes it's a nice hotel, but this was our ' splash out' location, and I left feeling disappointed~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475400992~“Sydney's hospitality icons fit for stars and you”~There is no better location with immediate access to the harbour, opera house and the famous bridge. Upon arrival it feels like a boutique hotel and when you enter the Cortile Atrium you appreciate the city's 19th century heritage. After a welcoming and professional checkin service to marvel at the spectacular harbour view and as I booked Club InterContinental I was invited to the Jewel in the crown roof top lounge and bar - unforgettable views and matching service. Start a morning here at breakfast and complimentary cocktails at sunset and you will return for sure. You can feel the German general managers attention to detail and locale and their association with The Hotel School is evidence that some of Australia's future hotel leaders will come from here. The InterContinental is more than a hotel - it is synonymous with Sydney.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475389297~“Fabulous hotel, friendly staff and well located.”~I have stayed here before and have always found it to be a great quality hotel. I have to say I would never travel again without my Heddys active noise cancelling headphones though. I used them on the plane up and couldn't believe the sound quality. Blocking out all the aircraft noise seems to make the journey easier. I sat in the hotel foyer, amongst loads of other guests and listened to my podcasts without disturbing anyone. I was totally in the zone and able to shut out all the outside world and I was so relaxed so quickly. The staff were super helpful and friendly too, nothing was too much trouble. My friend and I enjoyed the food, the room was lovely and well appointed, what you would expect from a hotel of this standard. I will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475327169~“Nice Hotel”~This hotel is in a great location, it is beautiful and very clean. Unfortunately it does not compare to the Intercontinental Hong Kong but it was still a pleasant stay.

review_475228806~“You get what you pay for”~We stayed six nights in the Opera King room with a great view of Sydney Harbour. The Harbour Bridge and the Opera Housr were right outside our window. The buffet choices at the Opera Cafe were varied enough but the dishes were the same that whole week. The executive lounge on the 31st floor had the best panoramic view of the harbour but they were stingy with drinks compared to other executive lounges. Oh, they also forgot to greet us on our 30th wedding anniversary even if they were informed about it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475039515~“Beautiful hotel, excellent service”~My wife and I stayed two nights earlier this week @ this hotel. The hotel has very nice artwork and decorations. The lobby area, hallways, and our room were very clean. We had the breakfast buffet each morning. There was a nice assortment of food for various tastes - Western and Asian. There is a juice maker with various fruit, including beetroot. This is a nice touch. The food is delicious and fresh. Staff and manager are very personable and respectful. Our room was very clean. Excellent hotel!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474678623~“Superb”~This hotel has to be one of the best we have ever stayed with. The location couldn't be better, a couple of minutes walk down to Circular Quay. Reception were friendly and extremely efficient and cleanliness was spotless throughout. We are IHG Platinum Rewards card members and I'd saved enough points to stay here for two nights plus another night using a free night voucher. The hotel upgraded our room as much as they were able and gave us a corner room on the 12th floor (requested) overlooking the City, Botanical Gardens and The Harbour. What a bonus. This room was large, well equipped, great views, and spotless. Plus a large very comfortable bed. The TV didn't work, so I went downstairs to reception to ask for it to be attended to and the maintenance man was fixing it before I got back to the room. We had breakfast one morning and there was plenty of selection of everything. However, if the price of 42AUD each is a out of range, then there is a food mall literally just outside and to the right of the hotel entrance which has plenty of outlets serving breakfast and lunches. I absolutely recommend this hotel, and provided the budget, or points, allow will be back next time we fly to Sydney~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

Friday night we had a harbour bridge view room and although we had a few minor issues such as phone not working properly in the room the Staff in particular Jess couldn't help us enough.

review_474403606~“Bigger letdown than Point Break remake!”~Lets start with the best thing about this hotel, the view and the staff. We were on a girls weekend to attend Mardi Gras and couldn't have been more disappointed.  Paid to upgrade to Club Access...save your money, not worth it at all. Drinks were weak, snacks were lack luster and high tea was laughable. The room was ok and the location was good. For the amount we paid, expected a lot more. The high tea downstairs looked far better than what we received. What saved this weekend was our spa trip elsewhere and the food at Mr. Wongs. Will not be staying here again! ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474386229~“Great stay”~Fantastic service and staff. Great rooms and facilities. We had a small problem with our room and it was dealt with immediately. Would definitely recommend. We paid the extra for the club lounge access and it was worth every penny. Unlimited drinks and snacks such as cheeses, breads, fruit and more as well as two hot things that were made to order if you wanted. Could not fault. And the view from the club lounge is amazing! Be sure to get there right on 5 to get a window seat!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474289322~“Close location to Circular Quay”~Check-in staff was friendly and other staff through out our stay, tho at 4 pm our rooms were not ready, so took what was available as wanted to get settled in and go for dinner. Our room was ok, on the small side, just enough room to walk beside furniture. The room had a nice desk, along the wall a small seatee and window seating. The bathroom was very small, one sink, and the shower was in the tub. The next morning we did ask for a tub mat and it was there on our return for the day. We did not use the restaurants as we were in walking distance of the harbor area..~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473957845~“Frustratingly poor communication at Check-in ”~"Check in" is one of the most important parts of a hotel stay: it sets the tone for the visit, and can spoil one's day if done badly. The Intercontinental Sydney's communication is very poor: at 9.30am I was told the room would be ready in 30 minutes to an hour. Absolutely fine so far - I went for breakfast. Returning at 10.30am, I was told 3pm. It was ready at 11am. Frustratingly poor communication. Nice views though.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473953185~“Great location for sightseeing ”~We could not have been happier with our choice of hotel in Sydney. Everything was within walking distance, the Sydney Opera House, the harbor ferries and the Sydney Bridge. We thoroughly enjoyed the service of the concerige.. He walked us outside to help us get our bearings. The currency exchange at the desk was very helpful and they did not charge a fee.. Unlike other kiosks throughout the area that charged 15-20%. We highly recommend that you book here, you won't regret it. The coffee in the lobby area was a little pricey.. $60.00 for 4 cups + 2 refills.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473936570~“Outstanding food and hospitality”~As member of the international gourmet club La Chaine des Rôtisseurs, we had dinner in the restaurant 117 of the InterContinental Sydney, where we sampled the new autumn menu. The food showed great creativity and originality with enticing flavours, the wines were excellent and the service outstanding. The atmosphere of the hotel is impressive, with its historic ground floor area and its modern facilities. The views from the top floor Supper Club over Sydney harbour and the Opera House are breathtaking, from an intimate and elegant setting. A hotel to be highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_473764150~“Expensive and in need of a refurb ”~My husband 6yo child and I stayed here 8/4/17 on Saturday night to celebrate a special birthday. $500pn including breakfast for a room with two small doubles and harbour view. Tiny room in desperate need of a refurb with a small bathroom step in small mbath for shower and shower curtain.  When we booked we were sent an email saying we could pay $100 for an upgrade upon check in if available. It wasn't but the lady kindly told us 'we do have a beautiful double room with a harbour view' I asked if it was the one we'd paid for and she said yes.  Why thank you! We waited 45 mins for our luggage to be brought up still hadn't even after a phone call so we went back to reception grabbed what we needed and headed out. Meat and co was booked out that night reception suggested their $89pp seafood buffet so we headed out to eat.  Breakfast was of a high quality. The hotel was extremely busy. Without the view this would be more like a 3 star hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

This made our stay memorable; We appreciated the extra attention to excellence, which has inspired us to return in the near future. In particular, the staff at club level, without exception, were superb. The views from the Club Lounge and accommodation were memorable~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473515686~“Small room, obscured view, outdated styling”~We checked in this hotel for our wedding night in March 2017 and were excited given the prospect of staying in a 5 star hotel with a room including a supposed view of the harbor.  Unfortunately, once we were checked into our tiny room we noticed that a glimpse of the promised view was possible, but only if you pressed your face up to the glass.  We were also disappointed in the furnishings of the room. The bathroom in particular was outdated: old taps, wallpaper, bath/shower combo, shower curtain (in a 5 star hotel really??!). To top it off the lights to the entire room cut out whilst showering, which made it extremely dangerous trying to find out what happened when covered in soap. We have stayed at other hotels with similar ratings (Amora Jamison, Sheraton on the Park, etc) which have been 10* better in the standard of rooms, amenities and decor. There is a lot for this hotel to improve on.~2~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_473387806~“Great Location and Views…Okay Hotel”~This hotel is in a great location in Sydney. If you choose the right room(s), you can get a view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Opera House (or both). I was fortunate to get a view of both in my room.  The hotel itself was in a great location. The great views of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a great selling point for this hotel. The room looked dated and in need of a refresh. It was not as good as the rooms you get in other IC Hotels around the world and a bit small. As an Ambassador, my upgrade wasn’t much of an upgrade, but the complimentary bottle of Shiraz and plate of fresh fruit was appreciated.  If you are an IC Ambassador, you may be a little disappointed with the experience as I did not seem to experience anything different from the standard guests. However, I did get the standard Ambassador gift (as mentioned above), late checkout and the room upgrade (kind of).    I think the location of this hotel would make me stay there again, however, if there was another hotel in this category with similar views, I would happily give that one a try instead.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_473337920~“Mrs”~Most amazing experience,  Spectacular views , very well located. Beautiful hotel, very friendly, professional and helpful staff. Good food. Rooms always kept clean. I round certainly go back and would highly recommend the Intercontinental to my family and friends. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473090126~“Perfect location for sightseeing”~This was the first stop in a trip around Australia and a pleasurable place to stay. Room was available early and, after mentioning that there was a smell of stale smoke they moved us straight away with the concierge coming to do all the moving. Views down to the Botanic Gardens were great and the location made it so easy to see all the sights. One down side was that, due to the various restaurants around, it was very busy in the foyer at times. It was also a bit unclear which bits were part of the hotel and which were restricted (such as club area) and also having to sign up to loyalty programme to get free wifi. Not many places are perfect though and I would definitely stay again due to location and quality of staff.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473057643~“Expensive and disappointing”~As a Platinum Amb member i use hotels from the Intercon group as a matter of choice. For the price, we found this hotel very disappointing. Our visut wasnt helped by the Israeli PM staying there for 5 of the 6 nights we were there leading to entrance closures at the hotel and road closures in the surrounding areas. The InterCon management may reflect on the disruption to the vast majority of paying guests. The hotel is in a good location and has histotical significance. It looks good and our room was fine but we found the food (and drink) over priced and very disappointing. The staff were reasonably friendly without ever giving the impression they would go the extra mile. To cap it all at check-out the hotel tried to levy a % charge on my card transaction - no mention of this on booking or at check-in and totally unjustified. After a discussion about me paying with coins instead the surcharge was dropped.  On the same holiday we stayed at the InterCon in Singapore - like comparing chalk and cheese and less expensive.  If we go back to Sydney we will not be staying here.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473055545~“Good hotel in a prime location ”~Stayed here in Apr 2017 for a business trip. The hotel has really good views(depending on which level and side ) you get. I had the city view which wasn't bad. The hotel is in a prime location, 5 minutes walking to Circular Quay which has all the ferries. The opera house is also a 5 minute walk. The hotel also has dining which seemed expensive but there are abundance of restaurants around.  The rooms are cleaned and neat. The restrooms are a bit smaller. Housekeeping staffs are friendly. In room dining is good. Free wi-if :)  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473051544~“Very good with one exception”~Booked this stay on the Hotel's own website. As part of the process I indicated an early check in preference .  When we arrived ,after a long overnight flight,we were told that the room was empty but needed to be cleaned,with a inference that this should not take too long.  We waited in the reception lounge area for three and a half hours. No one contacted us to update us on progress. I had to go to the front desk to get any information.No one offered us coffee or refreshments. It just seemed that the concept of customer service had not reached as far as the front desk. When we did check in,the room was excellent and the staff most helpful and courteous. Would certainly recommend this hotel PROVIDED you arrive after 2 pm.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472989967~“Pleasant no upgrade reservation experience”~We also checked in because of the location close to the gardens, Quay and opera house having just left our return from Fiji cruise ship. We were very satisfied with our "low rent" room selection as it was very comfortable, clean and had the amenities we've experienced in ICs in Hawaii and Chicago.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_472790822~“The hotel with a view (club members only)”~We booked this hotel because of its location and views of The opera house, and the bridge, it is stunning but you can only use this if you are on the club levels (which for us was $1200 for a 2 night stay) The evening canapes and wine were very good and we have sampled the Hilton, Marriot and Sofitel brands club level. I was however very disappointed at the level of daytime drinks available as this was juice, water, tea or coffee. The juice was mango and orange and very sweet so I asked for a coke which I was told they didn't have any available. (for $600.00 a night I thought it was really quite disrespectful not to offer a coke as an alternative if a customer requests one) Other than this one fault we were happy with everything else and it really left a bitter taste in our mouths. I hope you will take this a constructive criticism and be able to offer an alternative if a customer requests it.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_472513275~“Awesome location & great lounge”~Stayed for three nights at Intercontinental Sydney and opted for club services for 2 out of the 3 nights. Check in service was fast and upgrade was promptly given based on ambassador status. The room was spacious and the view of the Harbor bridge was spectacular! The only downside was the washroom, which is the most dated I have seen at any Intercon hotel. TV was also very small compared to the rooms in Asia in cities like Seoul, Bangkok, HCMC or Danang. The club lounge was worth it especially if you have two occupants. I think charging 165 AUD for one person was quite expensive but the view made up for it. Will definitely go for a club room again if I come with another friend or family member. Breakfast was nothing to write home about. Evening canapés were awesome.... had rock oyster and maki and various salad, meat and fruits. Everyday, they also offered different hot dishes. Throughout the day, you can also order food from a paid menu or from a small list of complementary items. I took advantage of that instead of paying for lunch and dinner for two days. Service was also great. I bought some frozen abalone from the Fish Market and the club staff helped me store it in their freezer. In addition to the club team, I also had great service from in room dining. I only wished I checked the bill before I tipped. They charged $8 already on the bill....  Also tried Meat and Co restaurant. Awesome fillet mignon. I think I will be back.... hopefully by then their washroom will be modernized.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472488364~“Lovely views abs service but tight on the extras”~It's a while since we stayed at a luxury hotel and this one has some excellent features. The views, even on the eastern side, are spectacular. Watching the sun rise over Garden Island and the Sydney heads beautiful.  On the other hand it was a good reminder as to why we normally stay in AIRbnb accommodation these days. It is poor form to charge for internet and in this respect the hotel seems not to have moved on from 20 years ago. I did have a pod coffee, which I think may have been free but everything else in the fridge and on the shelf was grossly over priced. $10 for bottled water is an example, free tap was great.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472232727~“Excellent in Almost Everyway”~Stayed overnight in one the corner rooms with a window seat, had a great view over the Domain and part of the harbour. The room had plenty of room and was very comfortable. The only downside was that the air conditioning didn't want to cool the room much and with the lovely thick quilt it got a bit warm overnight. The staff were really good and helpful but when the Cotile was setting up for afternoon tea it would have been good if there had been another bar to sit and have a drink with family and friends. Would stay here again!~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_472045711~“One of the Best in Sydney”~I booked an overnight stay in Intercontinental Sydney because I was told by many that it is a wonderful place to stay at when in town. They were right.... Intercon has always been known for class and remarkable service. Located near the Sydney Opera House and the shopping areas of Sydney, I was able to go around to the places I wanted to go.  But who would like to go out if you have a view of the Harbour Bridge in your room. Or go to the Club Intercontinental to see all of what Sydney has to offer. Indeed, Intercon has one of the best location there is.  I checked inside the Intercontinental Club and the view was breathtaking. You can see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. It was like a postcard. The staff inside the club were really nice and very professional. I was given drinks and a variety of nuts while I was checking in. The rooms were in good condition and were big. There was a welcome note and wine as a gift. I felt very important! That's what service is all about.  You can tell the bathrooms were old but were still maintained well and very clean. Overall the room was excellent.  I did enjoy my stay and Intercontinental Sydney truly exceeded my expectations. Service, cleanliness and the feeling of importance is what you are really looking for in a hotel experience and Intercon did a great job! ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472003325~“Really nice ”~The main area at the bottom is really nice. I stayed because I wanted to go to the Vera Wang store as we don't have one in NZ. The rooms were clean and tidy. Had the room service and found it priced really reasonably. Hard to do my makeup in the bathroom mirror because of the lighting. The warmed olives from the bar were a hugggge portion!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471972166~“OUr second stay at this world class property”~We stayed at this property for two years in a row and continue to be most impressed with the service and accommodations. If your budget allows, book a room with a harbor view--you will not regret it. We splurged for a suite with access to the Club lounge and it was well worth the extra costs. The food presentations at breakfast and pre-dinner time are outstanding.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_471970714~“Excellent choice in every way”~Beautiful well located hotel in the downtown Sydney, a quick walk to Circular Quay, the Opera House and Botanical Gardens. Room was large and lovely with a spectacular view of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. Service was impeccable and I was able to check in immediately in arrival from an early morning international flight. The breakfast buffet was a bountiful delight each morning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471954539~“Roof top bar”~Situated on the 32nd floor of the inter continental hotel in Macquarie st Sydney. Excellent views of Sydney harbour with great drinks menu. Nice balcony around perimeter of the floor enables customers to walk outside. Well worth a visit~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471900445~“Top Views”~Visiting whilst in Sydney our room was superb with views over the harbour. This place was just in the right spot, over the road from the Botanical Gardens and within walking distance of the harbour.  It was a little expensive but then it is Sydney. Service was well run and overall our stay was relaxing and just right.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471798854~“In between”~I have rate the IC as very good but I really think it is not quite there. I liked the room and our view was spectacular on level 28. One could say the décor was somewhat dated but I liked that. The room was spacious with three opportunities to lie down; a window bench, a chaise lounge and the bed! The desk was generous and all the stuff for a home office was there – multiple power points etc. Some would say the bathroom was old and urgently needed sprucing up. I would say it was fine. I liked being in opulence from an earlier era. Everything worked. It had hot and cold taps - remember those? So easy to turn on and manipulate compared to the modern gizmos that result in scalding and freezing showers for the first few times. Also the hot water was instant and plentiful. Only downside was no toilet brush - I don't know why guests want to steal toilet brushes; makes it difficult to deal with the remnants of an Indian Curry. And The Spice Room, a few doors down, was the perfect venue from which to start a journey to the bathroom. Complimentary fresh fruit and wine on arrival – great. Fresh milk gratis for the room (super) and just ask for more coat hangers and they arrive. Own coffee machine that worked! Porters, doormen and front desk - all good. I would expect the various restaurants to be good but didn’t try them. Gym is good.  Fine service and coffee at the club –except late at night. I appreciated the professional dress and manners of the wait staff. Negatives: Great view but dirty windows. No where to stash the suitcases so it was easier to live out of them.. Sheets are changed every second day - that’s fine but we suspected the maid didn’t make the bed on day 2 – just a cover up job on top without pulling the sheets etc. Breakfast at the club – comprehensive but the same every day and after day 3 the selection became too familiar. Nothing special for foreigners. At least one hot dish (probably Asian or foreign) that changes every day would provide a bit of interest. Evening drinks and nibbles at the club – just fine – only regret was low quality oysters but I guess we were lucky to have oysters at all. Late night drinks at the club – we were there on a Saturday evening at about 11.00pm. Loud DJ made conversation just about impossible. Drinks took forever to arrive. Yes I ordered a cocktail but my companions shouldn’t have to wait 20-25 mins for their drinks when it is a glass of wine or a bottled beer. Really! And no one came to say there would be a 20 min wait due to ……. Had I known I would have ordered a beer too. Most frustrating. In summary - we will return.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_471773564~“Want more for $ ”~Spetacular looking hotel in common areas, loads of natural light but with that as well it was really warm from the sun light at breakfast.  Was not expecting a shower bath in a five star hotel this was disappointing. Bench space in bathroom small. Loved the oversize towel you can nearly never find these.  Pillows for order is great.  Room got serviced quite late in the day. Bar not open very late. Variety at breakfast was really good.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471653042~“Situation brilliant. A greay=t start to the Holiday”~We booked a high up harbour view. It is a lovely hotel with friendly efficient staff. The food is excellent, especially the breakfasts and afternoon coffee. Good pool and gym. Brilliantly located for the harbour. We went in March so the area was not to busy. Do eat at the Meat and wine restaurant that adjoins the hotel - sit at the bar and enjoy the food and banter. You can taste the wine before you buy and the staff certainly know what they are serving. Explore the botanical harbour, museums and galleries. Buy a travel card as soon as you arrive. This gives you access to the ferries, trains and buses which take you to vast sandy beaches. No need to take a specific tour of the harbour, the ferry trips will give you that on the trip outs.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471450650~“Great hotel fantastic views”~This is a more traditional hotel. By this I mean a little older in style. We treated ourselves and joined the executive club. Was it ever worth it! The views of the Opera House and Sydney Bridge from the exec club are beyond fantastic. The staff very pleasant and the 5-7 pm snacks and wine great. What could be more indulgent than breakfast overlooking the Opera House with the Queen Elizabeth in dock? The rooms spacious and beds comfortable. Best hotel I have stayed in for quite a while.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470791205~“Club lounge roof top view is the highlight”~A one night business trip was made after long haul flight was made easier by the lounge.

review_470435863~“Nice hotel, nice location but needs improvements”~Stayed in the this hotel for the weekend. The check in process was very slow and surprisingly, people were jumping the queue. But once they heard us talking about it, we were served efficiently. We got the room 3 hours ahead of the normal check-in time. Thank you for that. Our room had amazing view of the Opera house and the Bridge. It was mesmerizing to see the night traffic from the room. The room itself is a bit dated. Some kind of renovation will help. The breakfast was efficient, nothing unusual. The coffee filters were probably not filtering the coffee well. Vegetarian options were less than expected. The Super Club has excellent views of the harbor.  Overall, we enjoyed the 2 nights in this hotel~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470407897~“Great location, slightly disappointing experience”~Firstly, let me say that the hotel is extremely nice with good views, nice staff, lovely rooms etc etc The experience was somewhat marred by the check-in. I was one of a party of seven that had all been booked by one person. Two of the party were arriving one day later than the others. Upon arriving at check-in I attempted to book in but was told that due to the fact that another party had booked my room they would need to get his concurrence to my check-in. Strange but OK given I had photo ID, an IHG membership and was prepared to use my own credit card. I provided the phone number of my colleague and also attempted to ring him myself. He was in meetings and the call went to message bank. The person at reception said there was nothing they could do so I was just asked to sit in the lobby until it was sorted. Approx 1 hour later he was able to be contacted and the remainder of check-in went rather smoothly. Unfortunately our MD suffered a similar experience the next day and was then given a city view room when a harbour view had been booked. Otherwise, I found the hotel to be good, if a little tired in parts. The breakfast buffet was lovely, the club on level 31 was good too. Wish I had had the time to appreciate all the amenities the place offered but was a busy time.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_470004427~“A great stay!”~We stayed here after our recent cruise which ended in Sydney. The hotel was fantastic. It's very close to the harbor, the opera house and so many wonderful restaurants. The location is truly ideal for exploring the city.

review_469972194~“A hotel with a convenient location and bad service”~Since the moment we arrived in this property everything went wrong.  A strong scent of lilies is welcoming you, unfortunately the scent is so strong that it gives you headache.(I overheard an older gentleman complaining and the hotel concierge just casually answer back that he could not smell it!). That was just the beginning of the disappointment.  The rooms are small, the bathroom is tiny (certainly not suited to a double occupancy) and the service is non existent.  They advertise a rooftop, in every lift they show you picture of it during the day and at night. I wanted to go there for taking pictures at sundown but its not open to guest until 8pm! So why advertising it in every lift?~2~nan~4~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_469695797~“Beautiful place”~This hotel is amazing the room we had looked over harbour and botanical gardens. Breakfast was good plenty. Room was clean had big huge Windows to look out at views. Staff very friendly and helpful all times.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469679845~“Not up to Intercontinental standards”~Whenever I visit a place I always try to book a hotel from the Intercontinental brand, and have never been disappointed..until now. Will start with the good. The gentleman who checked me in was friendly and professional. Sorry I did not get his name, however he was an Asian gentlemen. The housekeepers and the staff that delivered room service were very nice as well. Room service portions were huge and the AC was nice and strong.  Maybe I've been spoiled with other branches of the Intercontinental brand. But this hotel just did not measure up. I felt invisible walking down the lobby or into the hotel. Staying here 4 nights and not one time did anyone approach me asking if I needed anything or even look at me or even smile. That's fine..maybe that's how things are here. No biggie.  However I do have an issue with a male at the concierge desk on Monday (3/20/17) at around 3pm. I had come into the hotel from the taxi drop off and checked in and was ready to explore the area a bit. Since I did not come in through the front door, I was having a bit of trouble finding it. I felt a little embarrassed, but asked anyway on where the front door was. He looked at me, and just pointed to the direction. Not one smile, not one word or even a nod. I thought this was a bit odd from someone in that position, but didn't think too much of it. I smiled and thanked him. Even after that, no smile, no nod or a " you're welcome ". He just stared at me like I had offended him somehow! Never had I ever been treated this way in any "highly rated" hotel. This was an awkward situation, and made a lasting impression on me.  I will continue to stay at hotels in the Intercontinental branch when I travel. But if I am ever back in Sydney, I will be staying somewhere else.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469602238~“Disappointing”~This is a difficult one. the location is fabulous only five minutes to circular quay, the staff are charming and helpful BUT SOMEHOW the hotel does not live up to its star rating. It is situated in an old building that has been sympathetically converted into a hotel but the decor is not welcoming, it is too dark, the public rooms have black bakelite tables and some of the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever encountered in a top hotel, arm chairs with thin metal arms do nothing for a visitor who wants to relax with a drink or whatever. The bedroom? I slept well, the bedding is good but the room itself was again not what I would expect of a hotel of this calibre. the breakfast is expensive $42 or $36 if booked as a package however it is an extremely good breakfast and worth the money. I enjoyed my stay but did not spend as much time in the hotel as I would normally in a hotel of this star rating.also for the first time EVER I waited for three hours for my room, check in is three PM but as with most travellers I arrived earlier as is usual when I visit Sydney and this is the first time I have waited so long and no interim waiting room or shower option as in other Hotels. Paying £500 for two nights is not warranted for this hotel and that was a deal. would I stay here again, well at that price I think there are better options.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_469539366~“Great again ”~This is the kind of establishment that seems to excel no matter the time of year or the duration of stay. We were there for a quick two day weekend with our usual late checkout. While the weather was deplorable, rain everyday, this did not hinder us from the overall experience. We had a harbour room with club access so breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks with canapés were all well taken care of, with a scrumptious arrangement of options. The view from the club level, floor thirty two, is spectacular, definitely the best in Sydney. This hotel is brilliantly situated near the Rocks, the Harbour, The Opera House and shopping is easily found in every direction. Taxis are also easy to find too.  We lament leaving the IC Sydney every time and look forward to returning - any excuse will do.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469536833~“Perfect location and outstanding service!”~We stayed in this hotel for a 3 day trip to Sydney. The main reasons we chose this hotel was because it has a roof top bar/club (more on this later) and is approximately a 2 minute down-hill walk to Circular Quay. We could not have been happier with our stay!  We checked in around 10am in the morning and our room was ready. We stayed in a city view king suite and although the room and bathroom are a little on the 'dated' side, it was comfortable and spacious. We also got free wi-fi from joining up at the concierge desk to receive future information regarding the hotel chain. Buffet breakfast was included in our package and it was definitely adequate with a vast range of options for both meat and vegetarian eaters. The dining room has a stately feel to it and is really lovely and relaxing to eat in. We also ate the seafood buffet one night for dinner and thought it was quite good value for what we paid for the standard of seafood which was available. The local Sydney rock oysters in particular were absolutely delicious! As we are not InterContinental Club Members, we did not have access to the roof-top bar until after 9pm. Highly recommend you visit this bar (even if you are not a hotel guest) for at least one drink to take in the most incredible views of Sydney!!! There is a balcony that sort of wraps around the bar too and it would have been amazing to witness the sunset. But was still so beautiful seeing the city at night - especially the harbour with the hotel being practically in it! Overall the hotel has a very beautiful and historical feel about it. A standout for us was the service we received from the concierge, to the hotel staff and dining room waiters. Everyone was unbelievably nice and accommodating and we would definitely stay here again on another trip to Sydney. Thank you so much for making our time here so comfortable and enjoyable!!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_469058579~“A feast to behold”~We were in Sydney last weekend to catch up with 4 of our children and a couple of friends. We thought it would be easier if we had a buffet dinner so we tried the Café Opera buffet in the Intercontinental at the Quay. The selection of food was amazing! Oysters, lobsters, bugs, Barramundi and the list goes on. Roast meats, veggies, salad followed by cheeses and desserts. Very pleasant staff and the surrounds were amazing ! Good selection of domestic and imported wines at reasonable prices( only some were expensive). We would be happy to go there in a shot.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468952096~“Great location and service and very comfortable”~We have stayed at the Intercontinental Sydney on many occasions when we have made the trip from Melbourne to Sydney for the weekend (often to see my wife's AFL team, Sydney Swans). On this last trip, we had an insightful tour of the Opera House, a wonderful early meal at Aria restaurant and saw a fantastic Performance of La Traviata at the Opera House. The Intercontinental is brilliantly located, overlooking the harbour, bridge, gardens and Opera House and for walking a short distance to get to all of these iconic attractions. On our last visit, we were greeted with the customary warm welcome and the service was excellent. The rooms are very comfortable and the ambience is great.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468719057~“Great Hotel ”~I came back the 3rd time and happy again. Very friendly and professional staff, nice rooms. Due to the architecture & security reasons, the windows cannot be opened (almost on the rooms I stayed & I guess it's the same for the rest). This was the only small painpoint, as I am not a big fan of running air con at night when weather is fine.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468462837~“The day that the intercontinental showed me what it’s like to be a multi-millionaire”~Regarding the subject title, to some people this is extremely important, fanatical even; to others this subject means nothing; but I would wager that no matter who you are, whether you want to or not, it’s hard not to be somewhat dazzled by the mere glimpse of what it’s TRULLY like to live the life of those in the top single digit percentile of wealth. I’ve written a review in the past about this hotel, and its theme was about how intercontinental treats loyal guests. I’ve frequented this hotel numerous times since that review, and will now stay nowhere else. Intercontinental have perfected the art of making a glamorous large hotel, still have that personal touch. This can only be achieved through the staff. Every time I stay, the front desk makes me feel like I am returning to a second home, the people I talk to on email, who greet me when I park my car, the room service guys who even remember what I like to usually eat… it all adds up to the most comfortable hotel experience I’ve ever had. Now, I’ve been fortunate on occasion to be treated to an upgrade or two. And on one such occasion, I stayed in the “Australia Suite”. There’s been articles written about this room, so I won’t attempt to do better, except to say, magnificent, magnificent… words cannot describe this (so I’ll include some pictures). This event was one example, how the intercontinental rewarded me as a returning guest; I was treated to feel what it is truly like to “live the life”. A piano in the entry (OF A HOTEL ROOM!), balcony in the sky, lavish bath with harbour view (and a tv), the list goes on and on. To conclude, the past few years have been the hardest years of my life. During this time, there has been only a small handful of experiences that have (to put it simply) made me smile. Believe it or not, my Intercontinental experiences have been within that small handful.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_468438067~“Another enjoyable stay at the InterContinental”~We stayed for 3 nights in a Harbour Bridge View room which is worth the extra money (we stayed in a similar room last year). We also had views of the Opera House. Beautiful modern hotel. Rooms spacious and quiet, great food at Cafe Opera for breakfast and cant speak highly enough of the Meat and Wine Co which is located in the Hotel. The hotel is in a fantastic location, a few minutes walk to Circular Quay, the Rocks and Opera House and a nice 10-15 minute walk to the Pitt Street Westfield Mall. The staff are all friendly. Recommend this hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468287266~“Decent but not special”~Pulled up and got a handshake and a welcome which was nice. Quick check in and up to the room. Room was comfortable and decent size . Showing a little age but ice cold AC and a strong hot shower which is mainly what I want. Comfy bed and all ok. View was an office block, very disappointing but was not in room much . Breakfast was great, lots to choose from including a make your own juice bar. Coffee bar in lobby was good place to hang out, all the coffee was terrible, just really bad. I travelled with 5 other and all agreed it was horrendous. Came back later in week, had a view of east harbor which was better (no bridge or opera house but the windows were so dirty it was badly obscured so pointless.  Overall expensive and mediocre.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468005170~“Lovely Hotel”~We stayed for a few nights before a cruise. The proximity to Circle Quay is great and an easy walk. The room was lovely - we loved the view of the Eastern Harbor. All of the hotel employees were most helpful and we were most happy that they were able to accommodate an early check in request after a 25 hour flight from the US. We would definitely stay here again!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467957674~“Just as expected!”~My girlfriend and I enjoyed a lovely weekend stay here and we were pleased with the comfort and privacy of the room. The pool area was quite nice and we loved the cafe in the foyer. We would happily stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_467723855~“How to judge a classy hotel”~Sometimes things go wrong (by accident) even in the best of hotels. Do you say unacceptable, never going there again or do you judge them by how they handle the situation? At a recent visit to the Intercontinental Sydney my beige jacket was badly stained by the accidental dropping of a dirty knife onto the sleeve - I was hoping to wear the jacket again that evening for a pre booked function. I mentioned it to Jessica Checkley a hotel supervisor - she immediately took ownership of the situation and in a courteous and friendly manner. Problem resolved efficiently and effectively - brilliant. Obviously you would judge a hotel on many other things - but they are all first class here. No doubt we will be returning - wouldn't go anywhere else in Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467674885~“Another Business Meeting”~Also great to be in Sydney and at Intercontinental. This hotel is centrally located, rooms are clean, great city views, nice restaurant attached (barbecue place) where you can enjoy a nice Australian beef at reasonable prices (make sure to make reservation in advance). Breakfast at the hotel is surprisingly expensive, though.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467672713~“"What a great hotel to stay"”~We stayed there for a weekend in March, the hotel facilities and ambiance wowed us from our check in to check out. The room was really great.since it is just 2 minutes away from the circular quay it was very convenient. The breakfast was very good with a great selection. We also had room service and it was great. What makes it really great is the staff in the hotel and their great customer service. Tanya at the roof top lounge was really nice and she did a great service. She was very professional and I think she is an asset to the hotel. Overall I recommend this hotel to all travelers. Loved it and would come back again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467657562~“Long weekend in the city”~A couple of nights in town to have a break and do a few "tourist" type things in Sydney like wandering throughout the "Rocks" area, doing the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb and taking a ferry ride to Manly. The Intercontinental Hotel is very well located just a few minutes walk from Circular Quay, the Opera House and a lot of other attractions which is why we had chosen to stay at the hotel. Good sized room with a view looking to the south on the 11th floor meant that when we came back to the room several times during the stay, we had something to look out at whilst the rain came down.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
