review_478513361~“Excellent stay at the Shangri-La”~We stayed in the Premier Grand Harbour View room and it was incredible. The view you get from the room is the best in Sydney. The room was definitely spacious and the amenities were very nice.  They asked if there was a special occasion when we were checking in and offered us a very nice bottle of champagne for our anniversary which definitely made the stay special.  We'd definitely stay here again, it was incredible watching the sunset and sunrise over the harbour from bed.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478439348~“Club Room or not to Club Room ?”~The canapés in the Club Room were VERY ordinary, sorry I hate to complain, but really ! Absolute rubbish. The views are amazing, the rooms great, but don't bother investing in a Club Room. A waste of $$$ ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478361113~“Great location”~This hotel is in a great location so close to the best Sydney has to offer. The staff do try hard to make you happy. The package deals are great value if you are a member of Shangri la. One note to consider, the windows don't open~4~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_478284472~“A very good stay... mostly!”~I arrived here after staying in the Shangri-La Kowloon. Although not always fair to compare, this was not quite at the same standard, though it was still very good. Service was good and friendly at reception and especially from the concierge and porter. I arrived early and my room was ready for me. I had booked an opera house/city view room, and I did exceptionally well with a stunning view of the cruise terminal, opera house and harbour. I was over the moon! The room was of a good size, immaculately clean with an excellent bathroom. Wonderful room! Location was very good, yes, as some may have commented, it is up a bit of a steep hill but I found it a good bit of exercise after lots of food and drink on my trip! It was a good position to get to the harbour and the shopping. I had breakfast one morning in the hotel, and it was ok. I chose to eat out other mornings, though that was more personal choice and there seemed to be a good array of food if you enjoy a hot breakfast. Service was friendly here also.  The real letdown for me was the bars. I did go out and about in Sydney but I like to have a couple of drinks back at the hotel at the end of the evening. I had partly selected the hotel for its 36th floor bar, but to be honest was disappointed by this. I only visited it once and decided not to return. There was a conference taking place in the hotel and it was full of delegates from this, as well as other non-guests. There was a lengthy wait to get a table or somewhere to take a drink in the lounge. I enquired whether hotel guests are given any preference or can book a space but was told fairly swiftly no you need to put your name on the pretty long list full of non-guests (I know this as i spoke to some in the bar). I really would expect a hotel of this standard, and of this cost, to offer some incentive to paying guests to spend time in this bar. I decided to take a drink in the smaller bar area, which was busy. There was no one waiting at the bar when I approached, but it took a long time to get served, and even part way through the service the person serving seemed to disappear. The manners of the staff were lacking somewhat to be honest. This was a real shame as it was the only down point of my entire stay. I did drink in the lobby bar for the rest of the stay, and, whilst lacking atmosphere, the service was friendly and it was comfortable. Other than the 36th floor bar, the hotel is very good and I would recommend it based on standard of room, quality of sleep, service standards in the hotel areas and location.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_478133082~“Not five star”~Beds comfortable, rooms okay, bathrooms okay. Staff are disinterested. View is nice, if you are lucky enough to get one. Bar and restaurant quite nice, food average. Location is a bit distant from everything, I think.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478075193~“Friendly staff to help create the perfect day.”~As a gift for my wife, we did a treasure hunt. The concierge, Alex, was most helpful and made a great day, the perfect day. Amazing view and fantastic staff! I highly recommend. We were fortunate enough to be able to afford a corner suite on the 33rd floor - whilst it hurt the hip pocket a bit, it is an experience that we will never forget and will treasure for the rest of our lives. If you can, do it!!! Could have sat in the room and watched the view for days and days.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478073591~“Not as good as others in the chain”~Having stayed in the Shangri-La in Kowloon a few days earlier this was bit of a disappointment. The rooms and reception area were as equally well maintained as Kowloon. The staff were not particularly friendly or efficient except in the Horizon Club where the high level of Kowlon was maintained. The bar was a cold soulless place.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_477811881~“Very Nice Hotel”~The hotel has an excellent location. It is close to the major sites and it is close to restaurants. The room was large. The bed was comfortable. The show was very good. The view from our room on the 14th floor was excellent. I would stay here again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477665199~“Not the best Shangri La in the chain”~Hotels location is terrific but that's were the great stops the staff is polite but inefficient. Need more training!! The hotel food is sub standard we stay at different Shangri la hotels frequently but this one is at the bottom of the pile. Try the four seasons hotel next door its got to be better than this~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477617643~“Excellent location, views and amenities”~Quick weekend away, placed on level 22 (great views) in a corner suite. This was located away from the lift with views in two directions. The room was large, clean and felt luxurious. The windows were also large so you could absorb the view. The corner suite also had a 'sitting room' with an additional TV - very Lux - highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_477278909~“Excellent Location and Comfy Beds!”~We booked the city & harbour view and the view was amazing, the room was spacious and and beds were comfy. there is no need to leave the hotel/room as they had everything in the room cutlery, magazine to read etc but everything was quite pricey, $8.00 for a small red bull which is double the price and $12.00 for hot chips. The Hotel is close to everything just a 5- 10 min walk to darling harbour & the opera house.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_477060986~“'Vegemite Sandwich'”~We'd both been to Sydney before - me over 20 years ago, my wife just a couple, on business, but never together. This was our big trip Down Under. We were recommended the hotel by Trailfinders & everything we read suggested it was a good choice. We arrived late on Good Friday after the long haul from London via Hong Kong, suitably exhausted, & in a lovely touch, were given a corner suite. Only the next morning did we realise it offered views over Sydney Opera House. Nice. During our brief stay everything was perfect. A short stroll to Circular Quay, not far to Darling Harbour & The Rocks on the doorstep - Sydney on a silver platter. It was busy while we were there - Easter Weekend - but if, & hopefully when, we head back, the Shangri-La will be our base. PS - the pub next door is fab ✌~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477037158~“Good”~We stayed there for 3 nights and the experience was ok overall as nothing went seriously wrong and nothing stood out. The buffet breakfast was good but cannot compete with the Shangri-La hotels in Asia countries. Gym is free for hotel customers, there was free bottled water in the lobby every morning and that was really good.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_477026000~“Pleasant stay! ”~Stayed at their Executive Suite. Room is very clean, spacious, bed and pillow is very comfortable. Great bathroom. There's a DVD player in the room and the living room.  Great location. 15-20 mins walk to Opera house, 10 mins walk to the tourist information counter where you can get your attraction pass there. 10 mins walk to Halal restaurants.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.  Will definitely come back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477004006~“Comfort, views and great service!”~I went to Sydney on a business trip and stayed at the Shangri-La. it was close to the Rocks, great restaurants, cafes are close and the hotel has the best complimentary bar/restaurant I've ever encountered. We sat at the window watching the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House while being served complementary wine. The rooms are big, decorated very well with a spacious bathroom. Best place to stay in Sydney. I'm going back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476911973~“Stay away”~Poor staff training. In room dinning is a repeated mess. They do not honor the "do not disturb" light and enter your room without your permission. there is no deadlock or chain to block entry. You simply have to trust the staff judgement to honor your "do not disturb" button. Which apparently they don't. The housekeeping staff broke my Norelco 1290x and simply picked up the parts and left it on the soap holder.~1~2~4~4~4~4~2~nan
review_476731779~“Best views in Sydney !!!!!”~This is a fantastic property a must stay if in Sydney it has the best view and room layouts of any hotel in town. It is not the cheapest but definitely worth the price and also worth paying or the horizon club rooms very good value with all the extras included and access to the best club lounge of any around. Special tanks to Tara from the horizon club for going the extra mile very much appreciated. ~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476654654~“Excellent view.”~Room was spacious and comfortable. The view was outstanding. Air con and wifi worked well. A couch in the room would have been good to relax on. Horizon club was exceptional. The service was second to none.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_476629778~“Great view and good location”~Shangri-la chain is always our first port of call so this was the first choice when booking 3 nights in Sydney for our honeymoon. We didn't go for the Horizon club as wanted to make the most of Sydney and its eateries so just went for an Exec room with view of Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The view has to to be the best thing about the stay, it was incredible! The room itself was good, nothing to shout home about, the bed was comfy and bathroom was a really good size. We did have to leave a message for housekeeping to top up the toiletries as they seemed adverse to doing so! We didn't eat at the hotel but did have a drink at the bar on the top floor, again the view was great but the bar was nothing special and if anything a bit tired and in need of a refurb. The valet staff were great outside, very helpful and easy to get taxis and advice.  Would I stay here again? Probably not, I think the location is great but the hotel didn't blow me away, it was adequate and I am not sure if a shangri-la should be just adequate.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_476569232~“Perfect Intro to Sydney”~I wanted a room with a view and a comfortable luxurious welcome to Sydney. This hotel met expectations. Great location close to The Rocks and Circular Quay. Great views of the Opera House. Buffet breakfast was the best I have ever experienced with a wide variety of foods and even had fresh guava juice. Rooms are lovely. Separate shower and tub in the bathrooms. This hotel had more of a business feel than a holiday stay feel, but for me met all expectations.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476548674~“Nice location and rooms. Too poor experience.”~Shangri-la stands for quality, central location and impeccable experience. At least it should. That's what you pay for. After having stayed for one week at The Sydney Shangri-La The Rocks, I have to conclude that the overall experience is too disappointing.  The rooms are good and are as expected: clean, comfy, spacious, luxurious. Less attractive is the breakfast / lunch place on the first floor: I found both the quality of the food as the maintenance of the buffet below standards. I had the feeling the restaurant was structurally understaffed and they couldn't cope with the buffet properly.  The bar on the top floor has a stunning view, but closes early (at midnight!). This may be a standard in Sydney, but I find it very early for a hotel bar.  The pool is one big disappointment. If they want to be taken serious, an investment here is needed.  The lobby bar is very spacious and nice, but its terrace way to small and definitely not a priority for the staff.  The location of the hotel is great. Walking distance to city harbour bridge and Opera House.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476324580~“Disappointing beds”~Twin room consists of two king single beds should be bigger and staff didn't know much about cocktails or drinks on bottom floor seafood buffet was the best and bathrooms and turn down service great view was amazing and general service was great just very disappointed in no sleep due to tiny beds~1~2~5~1~1~5~3~nan
review_476318574~“Recommended ”~All the staff was pleasant and greeted us with warm smile. I was so happy to get an early check in as we arrived a lot earlier than expected. We had a west facing room and watching the sunset was a highlight. The king room on level 24 was spacious clean and comfortable. Would love to access horizon lounge and rooftop bar next time I'm without kids. The pool was warm and pleasant and had a small outdoor patio. Thank you for a lovely 5 star stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476317313~“A cut above the rest”~From the moment we arrived we were treated so well. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The room was spotless and our requests were dealt with quickly by a most helpful team. Shangri-La should be very proud of their professional team.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476288956~“Nice view but very overrated and pricey”~When we checked in at 4pm our room was not ready yet. On both days we were interrupted by housekeeping as they had forgotten to change towels this was annoying. On the last day we were locked outside of our room and the swipe cards did not work we had to go to the front desk this was embarrassing and no apology from staff. There were too many hiccups for a 5 star hotel to make this an overall pleasant experience. I would come to use the chi spa again but not stay overnight. I felt the experience was not worth the money I have stayed at a lot better places in the city at cheaper prices and better service from staff.~3~3~5~3~3~5~3~nan
review_476288229~“Just an honest review.”~In comparison to other 5 star hotels in sydney, unfortunately this hotel was lacking. Wallpaper peeling in rooms. Shower was not clean. Remote was not working. Breakfast disorganised and food was average.~3~1~5~3~2~3~2~nan

review_476230279~“Impersonal but Luxurious Hotel in the Rocks”~The views are lovely from this hotel--we overlooked the harbor and Opera House. The rooms are large and well appointed. Nice bath products and very clean rooms. Huge bathrooms. The hotel is in a great location for walking to the harbor, botanical garden, the Rocks, Circular Quai, museums, etc. There are several cafes and bars within a minutes walk. The staff at the hotel if efficient but impersonal. We did not receive a good dinner recommendation from the concierge and were very disappointed with the restaurant suggestion. The hotel is very busy and we had to wait 15 minutes for a cab to the airport. Stay here for great views not great service.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_476157642~“The Executive Club Lounge Staff exceeded my expectations, well done !!”~We had visited Sydney previously and stayed at the Intercontinental and Hilton Hotels respectively. On this occasion we followed friends to this hotel and it was a fabulous experience. The staff were very efficient in checking us in at the Club lounge ; rooms for my children were strategically allocated nearby ours. Our corner room suite was very luxurious and boasted breathe taking views of the harbour as well as the city. Good meals , Fantastic Staff and great location made our family hoilday very pleasurable.

review_475961243~“Not a Shangri La - comedy of errors”~Stayed here for six nights. As per our Shangri la stays we booked a car transfer from the airport ti the hotel. Arrived at the airport and saw the driver waiting by baggage. Got our bags off carousel and he took one while I had to take the other. Walked us to his car which was parked off elsewhere. Normally other drivers take all bags and ask us to wait by curb while he goes and get car. Once in car no bottled water or cool towels to refresh self. Car was clean. Arrived at hotel and no one was there to meet us. Place was a zoo and only when I was wheeling in the luggage did a bell jump to help me. Went to Golden Circle desk and was helped by Christine. Was told room was not ready. Asked when and was told would be 12 maybe 1, 2 or 3!!! Advised since we are Jade level we should get a higher room if the reserved room was not ready at check in. She seemed confused by this and did not seem to know all the benefits that Jade members get. She went to discuss with someone and low and behold a room that we booked was suddenly available! She brought us up and we advised her about the transfer. She advised us that the driver did not call her to tell we were arriving so no one could greet us and she apologized and gave a discount on the transfer cost. Found out later not a Shangri la car but transfers are outsourced to Unity limos. Would not recommend using hotel transfer at this hotel.  Room was nice as was renovated in 2011. Had a nice view of the opera house. Then the first night happened. Room next door had a teenager who kept opening and closing his door and making noise. Then at 12:40 we were awoken by upstairs with loud thumping. Next am went to change rooms and they accommodated us. New room just as nice. We thought it would be better but NO - there is no sound proofing between upper and lower units. We could hear thumping from the upstairs every time they walked in their unit. So if you are a light sleeper you are not going to much sleep here. It has to be the worst soundproofing of any Shangri la we have stayed at.  Breakfast buffet is average at Mix Cafe. Food selection is not that large. People rave about it but it is half of what you might get at other Asian Shangri hotels. Plus on big tour days it is packed with tour groups and very busy. In addition many people have bad food hygiene like touching food with fingers but then not taking the food though this is not the hotels fault. Had a bad incident one morning that was very disturbing but the food manager Moon sorted it out and gave us in room breakfast or Horizon club access for rest of our stay.  Housekeeping is hit and miss. Worst thing was they did not respect the do not disturb sign not once but one two occasions. Luckily we were dressed. The first time the maid knocked and within seconds opened the door!  Horizon club has a great view and a pretty decent breakfast though staff a bit aloof.  Blu bar on the 36 floor is split into sitting lounge and standing bar. The standing overlooks darling harbour and sitting looks more over bridge. Lounge is full and mainly non guests. Standing was our only option but end of bar was filled with young Aussies yelling and swearing. Many other guests trying to get seats had to wait despite being guests. Lounge in dead and quieter though no view.  Room receipt that i asked to be printed out the night before departure had the incorrect room rates from an old reservation. They corrected it with no difficulties Clientele at the hotel is also mainly tour groups and the hotel does not separate Golden circle with others. You will have people running and talking loudly in the halls. Not your typical Shangri la guests.  In summary only good thing is close proximity to the Rocks but so does Four Seasons. Noisy rooms and inconsistent service. Too many options to stay at in Sydney and will recommend to anyone.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475685247~“Friendly customer service for a tired traveller ”~The shangri la really looked after me for my first few nights in Sydney. I arrived on a morning flight and they had my room waiting for me as soon as I arrived at 9am, all I had to do was ask.  It's worth shelling out a little extra (often hardly anything extra) to access the club room level restaurant - nice snacks and free drinks as the sun goes down (though it goes get busy!)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475417437~“Good way to kick off your day.”~By far the most comfortable bed I have slept in in any hotel in the world. It was nice to wake up in the morning with no neck or back pain. The breakfasts are also second to none.Great location, central to Sydney icons.It will be my hotel of choice on any future trips to this wonderful city.  Ian from Perth.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475259269~“Top place to stay”~My daughter and I treated ourselves to a three night stay. It didn't disappoint. Although I requested a high floor we ended up being very happy with our view from Level 9. The opera house was amazing to view leading into sunset, especially from the leather covered window seat. We appreciated the Loccitane toiletries and the complimentary water bottle. The free wifi was fast and the room was very spacious. We loved the marble bathroom! This was a wonderful stay and we hope to stay again one day.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475169533~“Wow”~Booking in we were offered an inexpensive upgrade to a Sydney harbour view room on the 14th floor. Worth every penny the view was magnificent. Room was large and luxurious. The bed fab and very comfortable. Facilities separate shower large bath. Lovely toiletries. The breakfast was truly international with a choice of everything from dim sum and fried rice through continental to American and English. Good coffee but ask for extra tea in the plunger if you like it strong. The concierge was ultra helpful and the location a little hilly but just where we needed to be. All in all exceptional hotel with excellent service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475166873~“Fabulous!”~Great hotel in every way. Wonderful concierge desk. We stayed on the 32nd floor overlooking the harbor and the views were breathtaking! Could have stayed in all day. Special access to Floor 30 where gourmet breakfasts, afternoon teas, happy hour with supper are all served free of charge. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Sydney. Congratulations Shangri-La!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474855567~“Great hotel in a fantastic location.”~Visited for 4 nights at the start of a trip round Australia. It's located pretty close (10 minute walk) from Circular Quay and the Opera House. Room was very well appointed with a nice bathroom, with separate shower. We chose a room with a view of the harbour and if you can afford it would highly recommend it. You can't tire of that view at any time. All our interactions with the staff were great.  We only ate breakfast so can't comment on the other meal choices. The food here was ok. The hot food a bit hit and miss. The only two negatives, and these are minor, was the breakfast room could do with an update and the hotel is up a steep hill from the quay. Other than that would return if we visit Sydney again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474415963~“Luxury all the Way!”~A surprise weekend in Sydney saw us spending two nights in this magnificent Hotel. We had the most wonderful views of the harbour and access to Club Horizan. We enjoyed the attention to detail in our very clean and well appointed room. The bathroom was amazing. Fresh complimentary bottled water each night with the turn down service and the most comfortable hotel bed ever!! Price was reasonable considering the location and facilities.

review_473949934~“Great Location”~Over looking the Sydney Harbor this hotel has fantastic view of the harbor and the opera house. Located in The Rocks with many great restaurants and bars. Our room had harbor view and was very spacious, the bed was very comfortable. The room had window seat to watch the comings and goings of the harbor. The Blu Bar on the 36th floor was nice to see the view - it is a very popular place. Breakfast was very good.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473795021~“Great Location - Hotel in need of updating”~Towering over the Harbour this hotel sits in a fantastic location in The Rocks. We had a room with a spectacular view of the Opera House to our right and the Harbour Bridge to our left. The room itself (a double harbour view) was very good - spacious, huge comfortable bed, lovely window seat to watch the comings and goings of the harbour.  There are communal areas that are in dire need of an update. The lobby lounge area in the foyer is one, and Cafe Mix the other. The Blu Bar on the 36th floor would be nice if residents were able to get in and see the view - hugely popular place with the whole of Sydney it would seem and so you get pushed into a side bar waiting area that is not very hospitable. It's a shame that hotel guests have difficulty experiencing it.  Had we not visited the Shangri La in Singapore a few weeks before this on our Asian adventure we would have probably given it top marks for everything, however the personal service by staff and condition of the Singapore Shangri La totally eclipses Sydney.~3~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan
review_473784856~“Lost property epic fail”~We left expensive clothing in the robe (in dry cleaning plastic) When we realised we called the hotel and after being shuffled around on phone calls were told they had it.... Our question was "who's did you think it was" ?? Such a crap experience when you're at a 5 star hotel when they don't respect you.... Bet they would have found of we'd had Pringles or a water???~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473687158~“Great view but not a five star experience”~Stayed for three nights at the 'five star' Shangri-La. Our experience was far from this. Check-in was a mess. Left our car that brought us from the airport and wheeled our bags in while the bell boys stood around in the lobby chatting. As status members we have previously been upgraded to the best available room in category or one above, neither of which were offered. I also notified the hotel well in advance that we were travelling for my wife's birthday but we didn't get so much as a happy birthday wish from the staff, let alone wine and chocolates as we had received elsewhere on our trip. The room itself was fine. Dimensions were of reasonable size - given the price paid for a stay here, you would expect it to be. Bathroom offered a separate bath and shower, and television had plenty of premium channels including sports. Wi-fi was fast and the safe was big enough for all of our items. Breakfast downstairs was like a canteen. Tables squeezed in everywhere, peeling furniture and the food itself was pretty average along with the selection. Most of your time is spent being barged by people to actually get the food, not exactly five star again given this experience and the fact you're lucky to be able to grab the overworked waiting staff for a coffee. Gym and swimming pool were very nice, plenty of equipment and quiet throughout the day. Worth stopping by if you have the time. In short, the views are great but this is an average hotel. The whole place feels dated and everything is busy, not what I would describe as a five star experience - especially at this price point. We won't be returning.~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_473657389~“Quite simply outstanding”~We just love this hotel - having stayed here 3 times and each time is excellent. The position is superb - if you want views this is the place to stay. Our room was lovely, nice king bed, separated bath and shower and the view - well it was breath taking. We asked for a high floor this time and of the bridge and Opera House and we were placed on the 35th floor. It was stunning!! Big thanks to the really helpful reception staff for this. Breakfast was great - foods from the world - something for everyone's taste.  I can only be positive because this really is a hotel I love. Next time we visit Sydney we will be back to the Shangri -La without doubt!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_473284143~“Above and beyond”~Stayed 1 night prior to cruise. When reception staff found out it was my birthday next day was very surprised and delighted with the early checkin, champagne, chocolates, birthday cake, soft toy ( plus 2 extra for my little granddaughters ) late checkout and upgrade to a full harbour view room. This was very unexpected and very much appreciated. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Good choice at the buffet breakfast and the room service dinner meal was wonderful. All in all a lovely start to my birthday celebrations. Thank you~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473129553~“Average Value”~Decent hotel, but all in all a bit pricey for what you get. Nothing special given it should be a five star hotel. The breakfast has no real wow factor or anything special about it. That said the customer service is excellent, very helpful and friendly. It is also in an excellent location - would recommend staying in this area~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473094286~“Nothing special”~The hotel offers a spectacular view on the Sydney Bay, however this seems to be the only "plus". It simply lacks any atmosphere... no magic. At all. Average quality, average service, average comfort... consequently the hotel is - in my opinion - overpriced. I will not come back, and do not recommend if not for a discounted price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473010717~“Unreal view”~First thing about this hotel is the view over the bay. We stayed in Room 2013. Waking up to the sunrise over Sydney harbour was a picturesque view. Amazing. The room it self is very spacious with 3 large windows. Check In was smooth and fast. The Buffett breakfast as everything you need to set yourself for the busy day ahead. Great hotel with a great location.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473005736~“Lovely hotel, fabulous location, and a view of the Opera House is everything.”~Prior to arriving at the Shangri-La for a business conference, we stayed at an Airbnb in the central business district. Suffice to say the Airbnb was mediocre at best, but it helped us appreciate the great location and stunning views at the Shangri-La. We also took in the views (and delicious cocktails) in the rooftop bar as well as the hotel's excellent service. I had one minor complaint; I asked twice for a hair dryer (because the one provided in the bathroom became stuck in the vanity drawer, I couldn't access it and needed to leave) and although I was assured one would be brought up around midday and asked again before dinner, it never materialized.. My husband managed to extricate the hair dryer, so it was no biggie, but I was surprised that a hotel with that level of service ignored my small request twice. The concierge was very helpful with suggestions, reservation and directions, and overall the staff was terrific.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_472864930~“Incredible views of the Sydney harbour and Opera House”~We were taking a cruise ship from Sydney Harbour and stayed at The Shangri-La Hotel Sydney the night before. Reading the other TA reviews, we booked a Harbour front view from a high floor. Wow, what a fantastic view of the whole Sydney Circular Quay harbour, Opera House and Harbour Bridge, totally mesmerizing. It was a nice size room on the 22nd floor, so we decided to have dinner there sitting by the full window enjoying the scenes of the busy harbour. In the morning we enjoyed walking around The Rocks area before checking out. We enjoyed our stay here so much we quickly booked a second night at the Shangri-La for 2 weeks later when passing through Sydney again. The incredible view was truly a magical experience leaving us with everlasting memories of Sydney Harbour.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472799574~“4 days”~Had to be in Sydney for 4 day, had a great room with perfect view of Bridge and Opera House. Pleasant staff, good hotel. Good distance from Circular Quay, Rocks, etc Don't have to cross any major traffic to get to those places.  No problems at all.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472798557~“Good hotel with EXCELLENT service ”~This is an excellent hotel. What makes it extra special is the Concierge Desk. Phil has an outstanding command of Sydney and pays extra attention to your needs. He can tell by your accent if he should give directions in meters or feet. Impressive!!! All his recommendations for restaurants and destinations were spot on. He made our stay VERY enjoyable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472779509~“Stunning Sydney Harbour!”~In March 2017 we were upgraded to room 2415 with stunning views looking at the Opera House, the cruise liner docked at Circular Quay and the blue waters of the harbour. I gave the stay a 4 star rating because the room appeared old and in need of a make-over. The appliances such as kettle, hairdryer, iron and tv remote had all past their expiry day. Furniture had been patched up with putty to conceal nicks and scratches. To assist your taste buds please do not drink the complimentary instant coffee as you will be greatly upset! I mentioned this to the front desk and they advised that feedback from other guests had the same opinion. I've stayed at other 5-star hotels and comparing value for money the room needs to improve. Guests are paying for the wonderful views of Sydney Harbour.  The leather cushioned window seat was a nice inclusion for those wanting to gaze out over the harbour. Friendliness and help by all staff was a 10 out of ten.  Would we stay again at this property - yes but only if the price reflected value for money.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472650837~“Beautiful view!”~We had a great view from our room overlooking the Opera House, the harbor and bridge. It was really exceptional. The room was very comfortable and well sound proofed. There are two things that could be improved and that is the quality of the bed and the seating. The bed wasn't particularly comfortable and they made it with a bottom sheet and a duvet, no top sheet. I called housekeeping and requested a top sheet but it was never done. There was one upholstered chair in the room and it was a one arm chair that was very uncomfortable and virtually useless. The main reason I gave this four stars is because of the breakfast buffet. This is a five star hotel and the breakfast was awful! There were plenty of options yet all were mostly inedible. The breakfast restaurant was always packed with hordes of people swarming the buffet. It was really unappetizing and not what I would expect in a hotel of this caliber. The hotel is in a great location. We walked to the Rocks area where there are lots of restaurants and shops. The bellmen as well as the front desk people were professional and pleasant. Skip the bar on the top floor unless you want to pay a high price for cocktails and look out dirty windows. We were told that the attire was resort casual. There were backpacks, jeans, shorts and kids running around. Our room had a better view.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472550437~“Interesting experience”~This was the first big city hotel on the trip to Australia, and came straight after a stay at Hamilton (before the arrival of Cyclone Debbie). Check in was interesting - as we arrived we realised that there was a serious trade delegation in town and they were in the main at the hotel - hence presence of demonstrators both pro and anti -'kept well apart, and the police in force. The taxi could not pull into the hotel due to security arrangements and dropped us off a little way up the road - we walked along the road past pro demonstrators to be met by police - who ushered us, we were then taken around the back of the hotel ( through bits not designed to be seen by guests) and checked in. We had been give a corner room which had views of the highway and Darling Quay beyond. Good sized room, with separate seating area. The room gave the impression of being a little tired. A couple of times we had difficulty in leaving the hotel as the trade delegation was on the move. At least once we had the police helicopter almost at our room level ( we were only on 11 a it's a little loud) Still next next day the group moved on during the day and peace and normal operations resumed. We found that the roadworks on the highway had been suspended during the visit but restarted as soon as the delegation left and started to make up for lost time with work into the early hours using pneumatic road breakers and cutting equipment which you could clearly hear In the room, not conducive to sleep. Some of the above is outside of the hotel's control but some advance notice would have been useful we could have made alternative arrangements as the trip had been booked for some months The concierge was good with recommendations and booking of dinner reservations but the cafe on the ground floor was dire in staff, knowledge of basics and delivery  A disappointing stay that could have been so much better~2~nan~3~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_472547179~“It's all about the view”~Another superb shangri la experience overlooking the harbour - with excellent views of the bridge and opera house. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. A separate area for suitcases is a nice touch.  The picture windows (with blackout curtains) are incredible and allow for a lot of gazing.  Let down slightly by the bar area where the tables were dirty and the staff need some training.  The location is very convenient for sight seeing in Sydney and the reception/concierge staff are fabulous, knew their stuff and made booking trips a breeze.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472334560~“Great location”~I passed a great stay at the Shangri La Hotel in Sidney. The location is absolutely fantastic and grants a great view. The lounge club is great and offers everything you need. The rooms are comfortable, spacious and clean.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_472278649~“Over priced for part views”~Over priced for part views of city. Would look around for a better deal next time as feel there are better options elsewhere. Service always good but certainly not worth the charge out rate for the king size dulux room with "views".~2~1~4~4~2~3~4~nan
review_472264961~“Great Stay and Shangri La-Sydney”~Stayed at the Shangri La-Sydney in mid march 2017. Super hotel located in the Rocks area of sydney. my executive suite was excellent as it was on the 26th Floor and a corner room with great view of the sydney harbour and the city. Breakfast was great as very comprehensive menu. Staff very helpful all round including the concierge, the reception and restaurant staff. The Blu bar on the rooftop has excellent views of the city and the harbour and is a good place to meet people.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472261004~“Good Quality chain hotel ”~Wife and i stayed here recently had a lovely room overlooking the bridge and the opera house . It's location in the rocks is excellent so you are close to circular quay , George and Pitt st with all the shops, cafes and restaurants on your doorstep .The hotel itself is what you would expect from an upmarket chain . Fast efficient check in , professional helpful staff immaculate decor and well equipped rooms . Possibly a little dated if you compare it to some of the most recently constructed premises but it's still a good hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay .  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472227953~“Nice location, service flaws”~Stayed for four nights in a very nice room overlooking Harbour Bridge and the opera house, definitely worth the extra money on the room rate compared to standard rooms. Don't see how one could get a better view of the iconic harbour, liked it a lot.  Overall rating a 3* only, since service had some issues. Firstly, at breakfast had to wait consistently for 10+ minutes on each of the four days to place orders for coffee/ menu items such as omelettes. Staff seemed more focused on any other activities (such as cleaning up empty tables) than attending new guests.  Secondly, tried to book restaurant through concierge. Got a booking for 9pm and asked to confirm next day. Next day concierge changed booking to 7pm, but didn't notify us. Luckily restaurant still had tables when we arrived at 8:30.  Thirdly, had a large tray with food left overs (t-bone steak...) from neighbour room standing next to our room overnight for more than 12 hours and it took me two calls to guest services to have it finally cleared.  Overall I do recommend the hotel for great location, but service issues should be looked at by management.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471977999~“Another beautiful hotel in the Shangri-la chain”~This is our first trip to Sydney and we booked the Shangri-La Hotel as the rooms had a good view of the bridge and/or the Opera House. On our arrival we were pleasantly surprised to have a complimentary upgrade so that our room overlooked both. The view was stunning and the room was fantastic. As with the other Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong, the staff were helpful, attentive and nothing was too much trouble.  The location of the hotel is ideal for walking into town and to the bridge or Opera House. There are a number of restaurants around the hotel so we ate out rather than in the hotel. Having said that, breakfast at the hotel was substantial enough that we skipped lunch. In short, a beautiful hotel with lovely staff. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wanted to stay at The Rocks area of Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471972813~“Amazing ”~We arrived in the morning and they checked us in right away. I don't know which hotel other reviewers stayed at but our suite was beautiful and very very current with its decor, very modern. We're on the Horizon floor and it's lovely. The Horizon lounge is spectacular and the service is beyond compare. This hotel definitely lives up to five stars.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471799818~“Just Amazing”~Lives up to reputation Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated Breakfast is one of the best I've had with Asian favorites like Miso soup Concierge and general service is top notch Around the hotel there is everything you need from shopping to restaurants - and the location is really central. Recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471753618~“Great spot”~Nice hotel in a great spot in Sydney. Note it's on a hill so bear in mind this if you intending on walking to/from and not using a taxi. Value wise it is very expensive and the rooms are nice but fairly dated now. Also, breakfast was offered at $30/per person which is fairly expensive, or $40/per person if you walk up. Best walk into town and get something instead. A good spot, nice hotel but expensive.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_471732511~“Sadly lacking”~We've stayed at this hotel in Sydney before and on our previous visit the Horizon Club was on the ground floor as the 30th floor Club room, along with many other guest rooms was being refurbished.  What a disappointment! We arrived early in the morning (0700) on a flight from Dubai and were greeted ( if that's the right word) by a receptionist who couldn't have cared less. After explaining that we'd booked a Horizon Club room and expected to check in on the 30th floor we were told  -No room is available  -Check in is from 1500  -No facility's are available to you  -Go away and if you want coffee in our cafe you'll have to pay for it yourself  We bumped into much more helpful assistant late in the morning and he was horrified at our treatment. He moved us to the Club Lounge and the room was made available shortly after. The room was on the same floor as the club which sounds nice but was plagued by doors opening and closing whilst the hotel staff tried to service the lounge.  The Club Lounge was jammed as the hotel was full for Chinese New Year. The lounge was totally oversold and further suffered uncontrolled children running amock. The staff tried their best but you have to blame the Management for allowing such an unmitigated disaster.  Our room was tired and at the very minimum in need of a complete makeover. Room service was good but it's hard to make good something that was basically worn out.  Food in the restaurant on our first night, a Chinese buffet, was inedible - some was warm, most had run out, the staff couldn't clear tables and the restaurant was grubby from overuse. Thankfully on check out the cost was waived as we obviously weren't the only unhappy guests.  We never ate in the hotel a second time.  Rather than just list the other faults and shortcomings it's easier to say that we won't be returning to the Shangri-La as Sydney is well served by other 5* hotels also situated in the Rocks.  Shame really because the concierge desk was excellent - the hotel lets them down.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471595835~“Good honeymoon spot”~My husband and I stayed here for two nights when we got married. We booked the executive level and arranged a hire car through the hotel to pick us up from our wedding reception.  One of the main reasons this hotel doesn't get 5 stars is because the hire car took us to the wrong hotel! Being rainy and dark we hadn't realised we had been dropped off at the wrong hotel, however luckily managed to get in a cab here. The check in staff were good about it and immediately gave us the cash we had paid and said he would speak to the manager.  We went up to our room, it was absolutely breathtaking with views across the harbour and with views of the bridge and opera house. We had been left out a bottle of champagne, unfortunately all the ice had melted and the pot of tea had gone cold.... fortunately this was were the disappointment ended!  Having an executive room meant we were able to enjoy breakfast overlooking the harbour, being very tentatively cared for by the staff. We enjoyed the canapés and free drinks in the evening so much so that we didn't have to go out for dinner. Our room was also very well looked after, we had multiple visits throughout the day to see if we needed anything.  I would highly recommend the Shangri La, having stayed at them in the past I wouldn't hesitate to do so again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471574232~“Spectacular view”~This hotel provided the best view I've ever had of a major city: an amazing 270 degree panorama of Sydney - with the harbour, bridge and opera house - from a high-floor corner room. It gets full marks for that alone. But the room was also extremely large and comfortable: good bed, nice sofa, well-stocked bathroom and excellent housekeeping. It's true that it's a little old-fashioned in style, and a refresh is needed in parts of the hotel, but I would honestly take this room over pretty much anywhere I've stayed in the world. Plus the staff are friendly and helpful, and the hotel is in a convenient location for anything you'd want in Sydney.  Minor negatives: not the best buffet breakfast, but perfectly adequate. More than made up for by the wonderful views from the Blu Bar, and prices which weren't as exorbitant as I expected. Also the bell desk service can get a bit patchy when they're busy. But I would recommend the Shangri-La wholeheartedly, as long as you get a harbour view from a highish floor. Any room that ends in 13 is probably a brilliant bonus...~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471297232~“This Hotel lives up to its 5 Star rating”~Well this hotel was a real surprise for me. I am lucky enough to stay in luxury hotels in India with wonderful service and rooms with ambience and have found it difficult to get the same level in other countries. So I was completely surprised that the Shangri La is of such a high standard and not only met my expectations but exceeded them. I was lucky enough to stay in a deluxe suite on the higher levels having been upgraded. The room had sensational views of Sydney harbour and the room was very tastefully decorated, clean and large. The additional facilities of a coffee machine and well thought out additional items you might need away from home and great brand toiletries was a very welcome addition. The room service menu while not comprehensive but contains very tasty fresh and local ingredients and offers a good choice. The food is delicious with good size servings and delivered promptly. I was very impressed with my waiter on my second night, he was interested, polite and ready to please. The hotel is located in a very quaint part of Sydney and close to the Opera House and Circular Quay. A very impressive hotel.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_470193468~“Comfortable Stay”~The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable! Stayed here alone for a business trip and had restful sleep for all nights. It is located within walking distance to the city center for shopping or to Sydney Harbour / Opera House.  The hotel offers an evening turndown service where the staff would drop by to offer the service or offer additional bottles of complimentary water.  In addition, when you have your items delivered to the hotel, they would thoughtfully drop it in your room even if you are not around which makes it convenient as it saves you the hassle of having to pick it up from the concierge.  Great place!~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan

We were greeted with a bottle of French champagne. The buffet breakfast was the best we have had at a luxury hotel.

review_470001169~“A dame whose age is showing”~Our family of four spent 5 nights here. The positives - Offering magnificent views of Sydney Harbour & Opera House. - Location is impeccable. The property is situated in the charming Rocks neighbourhood, and many Tourist Spots eg Botanics Garden are accessible by foot. - Friendly staff. The less positives - Despite going through a limited renovation a couple years ago, the hotel is due for a major overhaul &/or scrub. It just looks tired & it somewhat reminds me of the Manila Shang. - It can start with purchasing new mattresses & pillows. To replace the current mattresses that are saggy and the pillows that have been in use for far too long and lost all their support . The linens and towels are in good condition though. - The lift lobbies probably went through cosmetic changes of new wall-papering and carpeting but all else including the toilets are In rather original condition .  - However, Sydney 5-star hotel rooms seem to be in short supply and are easily snapped up no matter the condition . - I sort of expected, as hotel guests, to be offered a small discount e.g. 10% off, when using hotel restaurants but that's not the case. Heard that the hotel is in between owners, and will revert to the Company that owns most of the other Shangri-las. Looking forward to a face lift rather soon.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469055167~“EXCELLENT POST CRUISE STAY”~We spent two nights at this central hotel after our Queen Mary 2 cruise.  We were given a Grand harbour room on a high floor overlooking Darling Harbour and a busy freeway below. No noise was heard from traffic. Upon our arrival, it coincided with a visit/stay by The Malaysian President and his wife and entourage whereby secret service from both Malaysia and Australlia were everywhere. Service standards at this established hotel are excellent and you have a choice of buffet or full cooked breakfast depending on cost. The hotel as mentioned in previous reviews is on a steep hill but is situated within easy walking distance of many restaurants, Circular Quay & the Rocks. The rooftop bar has wonderful views over the Harbour and Opera House. We would certainly stay here again as we have used the group widely in Asia.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_469036907~“Would not stay here again if you literally paid me.”~I spent last Saturday night at the Shangri-La for my birthday. I expected a high class hotel (I certainly felt like I'd paid for it at well over $500 per night) with seamless service. What I experienced could be described as amateur hour if I was feeling generous, or fraud if I'm in a more caustic mood. I arrived and was told I had been 'upgraded' to a fifth floor room with a view of nothing that stank of mould (in a health problem-inducing way). I asked to be moved, and was then shuffled to a 21st story room (better) that had not been serviced since the previous occupant had left (nope). I then was moved to the 23rd floor, which, praise be, was inhabitable and clean. 10 mins later someone else's luggage arrived. Huh? This process took 2 hours! What a waste of time. Went to the cafe down stairs to get lunch, paid $37 for a bland and forgettable beef rendang with sparkling water. Lesson learnt. On the positive side I managed to get a booking at the Spa (this was another palaver, but that is a different story), and the treatment there was very good. Maybe just go for the spa and stay somewhere else that is interested in your business?~1~nan~nan~3~nan~3~1~nan
review_469011340~“A Sydney Sanctuary”~My husband and I stayed at Shangri-La Sydney from March 1 to March 6, and we were so pleasantly surprised. I was a bit skeptical because it only ranked 15th place on TripAdvisor, but as soon as we checked in I was SO relieved. A big plus of this hotel is its location; it's minutes away from Circular Quay.  I do need to disclose one major caveat: book a Horizon Club Deluxe (or better) Harbor view room because it's worth every penny. A Club-level room access means quiet breakfast without the rowdy kids or disgusting mess like the cafe at the main floor. A Club-level room means afternoon canapé in peace with Sydney Harbor Bridge and Sydney Opera House as your view. A Club-level room means a separate concierge service.  In the end, we are now huge fans of Shangri-La and its Horizon Club rooms. At a price that is less than Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, sign me up!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468998938~“Excellent hotel but could improve catering in some areas”~We stayed a few nights at this hotel in early March . Our spacious room overlooked the harbour with really stunning views of the bridge and opera house. The room was well furnished at a 5 star level and very confortable. We could have spent hours just watching all the activity on the harbour. The hotel is located at the Rocks which although a good vantage point does present a steep climb from the ferries and central area. Taxis were plentiful at all hours as we took one at 6.30 in the morning. We arrived early but the service at Reception was helpful and courteous in sorting out a room. We eat most breakfasts in the coffee area on the ground floor as we toolk just a coffee and croissant which we're fine. However, ordering sandwiches for lunch when we had a guest was a disaster. We all ordered toasted sandwiches with I recall, cheese and tuna. They came with melted cheese cold and the exposed bread burnt, suggesting the chef had placed the sandwich under an over hot grill. We complained to the server but just got a smile. On two occasions we dined in the first floor restaurant. The first time was a sea food buffet which was really excellent with all manner of shell fish, including oysters in copious amounts. It was crowded but the staff coped well. The second time was on a Sunday evening when we found the dishes somewhat poor, at least the ones ordered: in my case hamburger with chips and salad. Although this was a Sunday evening, there is room for improvement on the catering side in this 5 star hotel. Would we go there again ? Certainly but would be wary of the ordinary catering.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468973618~“Not as luxurious as I anticipated”~Unfortunately, for a 4.5 star hotel I have to say the rooms are in desperate need of a refurb. The décor is dated and there isn't anything luxurious about the furniture. I expect the high price is owing to the view, which of course is fantastic. I do have to say, that while the room it self was disappointing, the service was fantastic. Staff were friendly and responsive. Not sure I would stay again... might give the four seasons a go next time.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468848710~“Terrible Ambience”~My wife and I had been recommended to go the bar at Shangri-la because of it's views. When we arrived at the bar we have to admit the views of Circular Quays, Sydney Bridge, Sydney Opera House, etc. were amazing especially at night however the ambience in the bar was very poor. There are much better places with a similar view but have a much better ambience such as Henry Deane at Hotel Palisade especially if you want to enjoy expensive cocktails with your loved ones or friends.~2~3~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_468345212~“Good Location, Great Service”~We stayed for 6 days prior to a cruise. The hotel is located near everything in the Rocks area. Plenty to see and numerous dining options nearby. My wife and I love to walk so this location was perfect. If you have limited mobility please be aware that walking almost anywhere requires navigating hills or steps as the hotel is at the top. The breakfast was great with a large selection. It can be difficult to find a seat during peak hours. The Altitude restaurant is worth the splurge. We had a fantastic meal (degustation with wine pairing) at sunset. The views from the rooms are excellent. We had a view of Darling Harbor on 21st floor. Service was exemplary whenever we need it. We arrived very early due (8 Am) to our flight around arrival. We were accommodated with a room promptly. The mattress on the bed had seen better days and sleeping was a bit uncomfortable. Also the speaker in the bathroom could not be turned off, a minor annoyance. All in all, it was a great stay and perfect start to a fantastic vacation~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468119156~“Amazing hotel and service in The Rocks”~We stayed for a night at this hotel in a short stop-over in Sydney. The service was very good from the beginning till the end: i) check-in was very fast and attention to detail was given by the receptionist, ii) the concierge helped us plan our short stay and gave us some very good suggestions on where to visit and which places we can eat at and iii) on check-out we were allowed to keep the luggage in their storage, booked transport to the airport for us and even offered us the chance to use the gym facilities for anything we needed.  In terms of the room, we were given a room on floor 21 with a perfect view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House. The room decor was of high quality and the room was very spacious, clean and contained all the amenities required. When we came back in the room we found champagne and a box of chocolates, given that were on our honeymoon.  In terms of location, the hotel is perfectly placed - in between two Metro stops (just a few minutes away by walk), and in the heart of the The Rocks which contains numerous places to eat/drink, food and craft markets and shops. Several attractions are also very close such as the Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Royal Botanic Gardens and Ferry Terminal (recommend taking the Manly Ferry!).  Definitely recommend this hotel for a short stop over or a special occasion (given the price); it's worth the experience.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468116627~“Amazing stay”~We stayed at the Shangri-La on the last leg of our honeymoon and it was fantastic from start to finish. The service was top class, from the receptionists to the concierge to restaurant staff. All willing to help and do the extra mile. Our room was extremely spacious and immaculate. Would definitely recommend upgrading to an Opera House view room.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
