review_479049502~“Family Holiday”~Seemed short on staff, no-one to collect our luggae even though we were the only ones checking in at 3:30 in the afternoon. No-one to collect our vehicle for valet parking & reception staff were very average at check-in. Saying that room was great although short on storage space, location was great and breakfast was a solid 8/10. Would consider going back but they need to address staff attentiveness.~4~4~4~4~4~4~2~nan
review_479004276~“Great hotel in a good location.”~I stayed at the Pullman for 3 nights at the end of March. Very nice hotel, friendly staff, and good location. I came to the hotel early to see if I could check in, which I wasn't able to do as the room wasn't ready, which was fine as I was early. I was told they would put an priority on getting the room ready, however this ended up meaning I got into the room 15 minutes before regular check in (and 4 hours after I first arrived), so not really sure if there was any priority put on the room. I did have one issue with the room that was that the City View room, doesn't actually look at the city, it looks out over the suburbs towards Bondi. I expressed my displeasure at reception and they were able to offer me an room change for the 2nd and 3rd nights of my stay at a small cost. I was happy they were able to help me and the room change was well worth it. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning, and it was your typical nice hot buffet style food, nothing amazing, but didn't do anything poorly. I had a minor issue where the hotel tried to charge me an additional $100 for some reason that they were unable to explain to me, but it eventually sorted itself out (despite being pending on my credit card for over a week). The only complaint with the hotel was that the pool isn't heated. Otherwise a great stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Sydney.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_477568540~“Comfortable and Convienient”~Was here on a business trip - just staying the one night. Well located next to Hyde park with easy access to nearby transport and amenities. Room and bathroom were very spacious and clean, if not a little dated. Would stay again~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_476244026~“Good location, excellent service. ”~Stayed here with four young children. The hotel is centrally located opposite Hyde Park with good sized rooms at the usual Pullman standard. Found the staff at this hotel to be particularly helpful - the service was excellent. Had an evening meal at the restaurant, which caters for kids at good prices. The breakfast was excellent and the service by Amadou was outstanding. He made an extra effort to accommodate the children which added to a very pleasant stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476020451~“Mr. Robert Hoich”~The Pullman was ideally located for us. It was within easy walking distance to localities relevant to us, such as The University of Notre Dame-Darlinghurst, Surrey Hills Eateries, Kings Cross, Potts Point, and the CBD in general.  Public Transport was exceptionally good with close proximity to Museum Railway station and an abundance of bus services virtually outside the Pullman's door. The Hotel itself was beautifully presented and the staff were very friendly and willing to assist us in anyway they could.  Fantastic city views 24 hours a day. Great rooftop pool/spa/gymnasium. Thoroughly recommended.~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475607974~“Ideal location for an extraordinary City”~Visited Sydney with friends who had booked the Pullman for us ad we were not disappointed with the choice. The hotel is a decent walk away from the main attractions of the Harbour and Circular key etc. but we had a lovely view from the room overlooking Hyde Park. The Room was comfortable had had all the expected trappings of a 5* hotel. The hotel bar was reasonably priced and the staff were very obliging indeed. Although not planned and due to inclement weather we actually used the Hotel restaurant one evening for a meal for the four of us and were very pleased with the outcome. The one drawback was the pool which although had great views etc was very cold, which could have been due to the weather I am not sure. All in all a great 3 night stay~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475253229~“Good stay !!!”~We stayed at this hotel as part of our first Australian vacation in April 2017. I was travelling with my wife and two boys (aged 3 and 5). I found the staff to be professional, friendly and helpful. My room had two queen sized beds and was of a decent size. The breakfast buffet spread was the same everyday but we found good variety and quality. Location is pretty central with a 15-20 minutes walk to Circular Quay and easy access to public transport. Wifi is free if you join the hotel's loyalty programme (membership is free).  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I did not feel it had the refinement / finesse of a 5-star hotel. But that should not deter you. Overall, I was quite happy with my stay.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474569448~“Very good location in Sydney CBD”~This hotel is just beside Hyde Park in CBD area, just 5-10 min taxi drive to opera house or darling harbour. There is a nice Italian restaurant one block away. Service, food and the rooms are excellent, nothing to fault for.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474463284~“City at your front door”~We stayed here for 3 nights and the experience was enjoyable. The CBD is literally with reach, with only Hyde Park separating the two. Our room was equipped with two double beds, perfect for a family with young kids. Great service from their staff, nothing appeared to be difficult. Windows restaurant was a great setting for breakfast each day. I would like to visit again in the future.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_474420827~“Nice hotel, good location, helpful staff”~Stayed here for 1 night on a Saturday with a friend. Had booked a room with 2 x double beds to suit our requirement. While checking in, found out that the booking was made for King bed room and they had no double bed rooms available (even though my confirmation was for a double bed room) Although I wasn't happy with this, the staff and manager- Honey were very apologetic and offered some alternatives for my stay which didn't go un-noticed.  Upon entering the room, it was clean, a good size and had a view over Hyde Park. As promised, they delivered a roll-away bed for my friend. Had breakfast on the Sunday morning while there and it was lovely. Had all the essentials you would expect for a breakfast although the dining room wasn't very large to cater for the high volume of guests, but we didn't have to wait very long. Overall, would stay here again. Just check your booking prior to check in if you have a specific requirement as the booking staff make boo-boos.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474333705~“Only let down by the in-room dining.”~Stayed 2 nights for a business trip. Usually stay at Marriot or Sheraton and decided on a change. The location was perfect for my needs and convenient for sightseeing walking around Sydney CBD. Staff on arrival were very polite and helpful. Amenities and overall conditions I would unfortunately only rate as high 4 star. The building and interior including rooms are starting to show wear and age. The friendliness and professionalism of the staff stood out, however the very pleasant stay was marred by the substandard quality of my in-room dining. Service great but food not so much. Second night's try no better. Apart from that a very pleasant place to stay. (also got charged for standby upgrade without receiving it)~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_474169071~“Convenient hotel near Hyde Park”~We stayed at this hotel as we are Accor Plus members and we were going to a birthday party in Bronte that night. The hotel is right on the bus route to the Eastern Beaches. We were hoping to use our 'free night' but it was not available to us that night. The staff are very helpful and friendly on check in and check out. We were asked several times when we were checking out if we wanted to store our bags for the day. The room was a standard room and was quite spacious and a good view of Hyde Park from our window. The breakfast that morning was delicious with plenty to choose from at the buffet.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473744071~“Great location but misses some of the details”~We stayed with the family in this hotel for 2 nights in Sydney. Located opposite Hyde Park and a stone throw from the museum/station, it's a very convenient place to stay. If you like running/walking this is a great place to launch your exercise and can easily take you to the harbour/domain botanical gardens. It's also a nice 10-15 min stroll into the Pitt st Mall. When it comes to the hotel itself, I don't think it's 5 star but it's a good 4 star hotel. It has friendly attentive staff who all seem to pay attention to guests but there are some details that make it not quite a to scratch in all areas. Wifi wasn't included in our package and was quite slow. The spa wasn't working and it took quite some time for it to get fixed. In addition, the pool area(on the roof with a brilliant view of the city) was a bit dirty. Rooftop toilets not well kept and there was a mess left by some selfish guests drinking. I would definitely stay here again at the right price because the rooms are comfortable and the location is good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473734859~“Good property and great location.”~This was our 1st stay on the property. We have stayed at various hotels in Sydney & this was our 1st at the Pullman. And I must admit that this property will be our favourite on our visits to Sydney.  Hotel location is ideal as its close to the CBD and away from the noise and crowd.  The room we booked was with the garden/ park facing and it was truely beautiful. It had French windows showcasing the skyline as if it was a wall paper. The rooms are spacios and well lit. It had a good selection of amenities and mini bar. There are multiple plug sockets in the room which makes it easier to charge your devices. Be mindful to carry spare adaptors. The wifi is of good speed and no restrictions. The check in is quick and efficient. Carina was the staff who checked us in and was very efficient in passing information about the property The breakfast selection is great and has a live cooking station, however with limited offering. The staff at the restaurant were very helpful and attentive, especially Tony (service manager), Amadou, Carmen. The conceirge guys were great help in planning our day and organising the tour etc. Jose and Banu were quiet knowledgeable about the city and tour offerings.  Ther is a convinence store right next to the hotel and also few Thai restaurants for a quick bite. You will find a lot of cafes and smaller joints around the place near Pitt st which is just a walk accross the hotel (10mins).  I would definately come back to this property on my future visits.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_473721961~“Absolutely beautiful!! ”~We stayed here at the end of March early April and really enjoyed our stay, we had 2 rooms and both were beautiful, the beds was super comfy and the bath was lovely for a soak for our son who played league that day!! The room service breakfast was absolutely faultless, hubby had the Pullmans breakfast, kids had the pancakes and I had the chefs special of advocado, tomato and feta on sour dough toast, all were absolutely beautiful, I would eat that sore dough breakfast every single day given the choice!!! The pool on the roof top was lovely, although we did have the leftovers from Cyclone Debbie while we were there so it was a little bit cold and raining but the spa was nice!! We had a meeting in the bar area wen it was closed on the Sunday and the guy behind the desk brought us a tray with ice cream and chocolates on it, I wish I had got his name because it was such a lovely thing to do and I wish we had been able to thank him properly!!! It's lovely to walk thru Hyde Park on a Sunday and close enough to walk into the city and to walk down to the beautiful St Mary's Cathedral just down the road!! Parking is a bit expensive but we are just not used to paying for parking at a hotel, if we didn't need a car we would have just used the trains and bus, unfortunately we needed one so had no choice but to pay for parking!! Overall our stay was amazing and I will definitely love to stay there again, my one complaint was that the coffee machine on the 1st floor had no milk in it so we couldn't have a much needed coffee on Sunday morning BUT we could have gone back to our room and ordered one thru room service so wasn't a major deal!!! The staff were lovely and everything was nice and clean!! Thanks heaps!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473547256~“Three night stay”~The hotel is well located. We arrived in Sydney by train, and it was an easy fifteen minute walk from Central Station (we are an elderly couple). It is also only a few train stations away from the airport. We had a standard room, which had a balcony and a great view. The room was quite spacious and comfortably furnished. Everything was neat and clean and housekeeping standards were high. The bathroom was a little dated, but spacious. Tea and coffee making was provided in the room. The mini bar was quite expensive, and so I recommend you bring your own snacks. On the other hand, we ordered a room service meal and it was reasonably priced (and tasty). We were not charged extra for in room wi fi. It was fast and worked perfectly. Breakfast was good, with a variety of hot and cold dishes on offer, friendly service in the dining room and good coffee. Overall, a good place to stay in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473526208~“Great location- comfy beds”~The location and rooms were great and the staff fantastic! Special mention to Luke for going above and beyond.  Location offers easy access to city, surreyhills and Paddington/oxford street The club was nice but the room they serve it in is very sterile and uninviting.  Don't bother paying for breakfast option - it was average. So many amazing breakfast spots in Sydney to have breakfast.  Note to management: all the chairs in dining area and club are in serious need of a clean. They were filthy.~4~4~5~4~4~3~4~nan
review_473382311~“Not 5 star ”~Checked in and was originally allocated a room on level 8. Asked to change rooms and was moved to the 18th floor. Rooms were identical but I couldn't be bothered complaining again. Rooms were tired, bed was saggy, and pillows like concrete. The last refurb was probably a long time ago! Executive lounge was ok, nothing special although the hot food was actually hot, unlike some lounges you visit. Location was opposite Hyde Park and enough out of the city centre to have to have a long walk there and back. Much better properties in Sydney, won't be back in a hurry.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473236192~“Average hotel in a good location”~We stayed at the Pullman Sydney Hyde Park for five nights while my husband worked, and I took the opportunity to have a break. We recently stayed at another Pullman hotel and had a good experience so I was expecting a nice stay from the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, with an easy train ride from the airport, and is easy walking distance from the shopping district and tourist areas. The room is large with a great view, and big bathroom.  However the maintenance of the hotel, and the staff responsiveness lets the hotel down. Our tv in the room is defective and we can't turn it on. The response from the staff has been to turn it on and off at the wall before using it. Not exactly ideal. Also, the bath is broken - we can't fill the bath up using more than a slow flow of water. We had maintenance come and have a look but they didn't fix it. Also, when trying to ring to order room service or assistance with anything the phone often rings out and we've had to try to call more than once. The hotel could easily fix these issues and be a much better option than it currently is. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473038852~“Pullman Hyde Park-Excellent Hotel”~Excellent hotel staff were very professional. Stayed in Junior suite which had seperate bedroom. Quite large, very clean and well appointed.

review_472029665~“Very average”~This hotel should not be rated 5 stars. There was nothing horribly wrong with my experience, but nothing great either.  The building has obviously been renovated on a shoestring budget, and is operated in the same manner. Like a tired old showgirl, the flashy decorations, gaudy colours and slap of paint can't quite cover up the beaten old fixtures. The badly laid hallway carpet didn't help the experience either, and neither did the hasty repair job (complete with mismatched tiles) in the bathroom.  Internet is $10 per 24 hours - what 5-star hotel still charges for internet nowadays?? It's like charging for hot water. Or air conditioning. The bed was comfortable, but only queen size - another anachronism in today's accommodation market. Overall, I couldn't recommend it. I've stayed in plenty of better places in Sydney for the same price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471818461~“'Grand' feel but could've been better (Second Honeymoon attempt)”~The first thing you notice is the smell of the reception foyer area of this hotel, a very nice scent that is exclusive to this hotel we are sure. Checked in early with Samuel - very efficient guy. We booked a twin king room as that was all that was available online. Requested a room with one king bed if possible. Advised room not quite ready however hotel happy to retain our bags so we could leave to kill some time. Assured they would look at possibility of altering room by the time we were to return. Upon returning to check in, we were told there were no single king bedrooms available except a disabled room which had a disabled toilet and showering facilities. We thought this would be ok given it was the only room in the hotel at the time however didn't want to inconvenience any guests who may actually require a disabled room over the week we stayed. The check in agent assured us there were no other differences with the room except things would be a little lower down. Discovered the room was fine however no hot water in the bathroom sink (required for shaving) and shower pressure was low. Reception advised this is normal in their disabled rooms for health and safety reasons, no offer of room change, just maintenance. Wasn't satisfied with thought of a week with no hot water in bathroom basin so requested a room change and this was actioned relatively quickly which was appreciated. Given this was our second attempt at a honeymoon, we would've thought the hotel / staff would've done a bit more however, no mention of it and nothing provided by the hotel in recognition of the trip purpose (not that it is expected but would've been a nice touch like other hotels that go out of their way to mark such an occasion). Also ordered flowers for my husband and specifically requested these be kept out of sight and delivered to the room after we checked-in, this surprise was ruined when returning to check-in which was disappointing, particularly after arranging this. Definitely not a five star hotel, some noticeable paint work needed, however a very well presented, tidy, clean and comfortable property. Would recommend and would stay again however only in the most expensive room available next time or would look at the Pullman Harbour property for full comfort and satisfaction next time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471273241~“Not 5 star”~Not 5 star at all - cafe shut all weekend, restaurant shut during the day - nowhere close by to get a coffee or light snack. Seems like a ship without a captain, the staff are nice and try to be helpful but everything is slow and disorganised. Often can't call room service, housekeeping etc - no answer, need to go down to reception and stand in line. No staff by the pool, no service up there - order room service and wait an hour or more. Very small pool area. Room was OK, quiet and comfortable. Had to pay for wifi, most places this pricey its free.

review_471246772~“A weekend away..”~Although the decor in the Junior Suite was not particularly our style it was a great space for the two of us. A queen bed in this room seems a little understated though. The connectivity to the city is hard to beat. Traveling by car to Moore Park was also required, this location is a definite bonus as Anzac Parade is almost right there. The ease of walking to the Capitol Theatre was indeed a bonus this weekend. Straight down under the railway line and there in 10 minutes. Great shopping or relaxing parks in the vicinity make this our go to accommodation over the last couple of years. We noticed a couple of changes to the breakfast menu, not as diverse as previous but still more than adequate to start the day. It was relatively quiet this weekend so happy to have that too.~4~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan

review_470999568~“Bitter dissapointment!”~We have been here less than 2 hours and I feel VERY cheated. We paid top dollar for a club room on 21st floor with 24hour access to the Club Lounge. Our room is adequate but not in keeping with the rating this hotel enjoys. The decor is tired - see photos, our key did not work to access the lounge and when we finally got new keys after 3 phonecalls and an hours wait, the club lounge is a joke. Not even fresh milk for tea or coffee, one old looking banana, 1 old looking kiwi fruit and rock hard plums and pears! The biscuits are plain and cheap tasting and the coffee machine has no visible instructions. There is no one on hand to assist so bad luck, fend for yourself. Pathetic! The pool area is tiny with no shade available and only 3 lounge chairs. I had to clean old pizza boxes from the table and remove a plastic bag from the pool. Music was blaring and the other middle aged couple there like us were troubled by the volume and type of music - so unnecessary.  We were so looking forward to this treat which was booked to compliment our trip to see and hear Opera Australia 's Carmen on the habour foreshore. We have stayed in club rooms in various hotels all around the world and this one does not stack up by any stretch of the imagination.~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_469569105~“NEVER Neverever stay at this hotel”~This five star hotel did not deliver even one star for service or confidence in the hotel staff including the manager Sarah Connelly. Sheets not changed on beds, room keys not working, TV apparently over heated so not working. Laundry not collected, ineadable food in the dining room. Even something as simple as a pot of tea at breakfast turned into a comedy of errors for seven mornings in a row....leaking tea pot, wrong type of tea, no milk, no teaspoon....you name it we experience it at the Pullman Hyde Park. Upon raising my concerns in a professional and courteous manner...thnigs were unable to change and even after making contact with Sarah when she indicated she would follow up and get back to me...no contact...no change.. Basically they do care and are not in a position to change. Happy to take your money over $500 a night for two nights of our stay and over $400 for the other 7 nights. Beyond belief. I received an apology from the food and beverage manager and he agreed it is not good enough the hotel is not five star...his words. Apology after apology from the front desk managers but no resolution and the errors and issues just continue. I feel compelled to let people know....do not stay at this hotel. I can also see other reviews with a similar experience to mine.......so take advice from a number of guests....never, never stay here....you will be so disappointed.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

Decent gym, however the outdoor pool is a bit too cold for evening swimming session. There is a spa. Bathroom ventilation not so great. Mirror easily fogging up.

review_468295379~“After the awful Pullman Hyde Park experience, we no longer trust the brand.”~After this recent stay in Pullman hotel, my wife and I will never ever consider to choose Pullman again! The reason why we chose Pullman Hyde Park for our Sydney vacation was that we got wonderful experiences and services in Pullman La Defense, Paris. But Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney was a far cry from Pullman La Defense, Paris! We were so disappointed. If the former is ranked 5 Stars, the latter should be at highest 3 Stars! In terms of hardware, Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney's is dated and wore off. It is like all the settings and furnitures have never been reviewed since day one of using!  First, the room lacks proper lighting! It is way too dark! You don't expect all the visitors go back just for sleeping immediately! They do read, they do work on computer, they do put on makeup, and they do pack in the room! Please make the lighting brighter or at least let the visitors to adjust themselves by installing a system! Second, seriously, a bathroom only has a bathtub with a shower curtain instead of a slide door? It even has no slippery-free mat placed inside the bathtub? My wife and I thought that we had traveled back to 90s in a 3-star hotel! Third, the bed, the pillows, and the sofa are way too soft for human being! And that leads to another serious problem in Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney--the software (onward below)! Forth, When my wife and I made the booking online via the hotel website, we specifically made three requests: a hard mattress, two firm pillows, and two big coffee mugs (our stay in Pullman La Defense let us knew that the cups inside the room would be tiny). Unfortunately, when we checked in and got into our room at late night eleven o'clock, we found out that all our requests were being ignored. None had been responded, none! Except disappointment, we were unable to take any action nor even generate any emotion because of long-flight tiredness. Fifth, two days out of our seven days staying in the hotel, our room was not cleaned when we got back in the evening regardless the "please make up my room..." sign was hung outside the door handle when we left the room in the morning! That included one morning we even walked to a janitor at next door and asked him to make up our room but apparently in vein! Sixth, the food selections of buffet breakfast are pathetically less! No nuts, no dried fruit, no honey, no white meat.... Compare with Pullman La Defense where it had hot chicken, hot potatoes, a wide range of nuts and dried fruit, and even an organic section, the choices in Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney are laughable! And more unacceptably, the food (rice porridge and cooked tomatoes, for instance) were not hot at all! We later found out the reason was that two pots of dishes actually placed on only one heater (each one shared half of the space)! It made perfect sense to us why those food were cold! Should all these live up to your (or any other customers') expectation? My wife and I did expect all the Pullman hotels are of the same decent standard. And that was the ONLY reason that we chose to stay in Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney despite its price was much higher than many other same-ranking hotels. Last but not the least, please do not recommend the shuttle bus service "Ready To Go" to customers again! Although we booked the service and paid the fee online in advance before the trip, my wife and I were guided to wait outside the airport in a windy and cold night for 45 minutes! My wife and I had trusted Pullman brand. But after the awful Pullman Hyde Park experience, we no longer. That's all we have to say. That's it.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_467982044~“Excellent Hotel”~Hotel is well located in the city. Walking distance from harbour bridge, opera house, etc. Breakfast is really good. Giid restaurants in the area, Korean town or Darling Harbour. Relative close to the airport~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467917137~“Pleasant Stay”~On arrival, the service from Maria was outstanding. She was very friendly, efficient and professional. In regards to the hotel overall, it's very tired, especially the rooms on the 21st floor. The bathrooms need a make over. The service in the Club Lounge from Ken was excellent. I've stayed at the hotel many times, this time the service was outstanding compared to previous visits.~3~1~5~4~2~4~5~nan
review_479049502~“Family Holiday”~Seemed short on staff, no-one to collect our luggae even though we were the only ones checking in at 3:30 in the afternoon. No-one to collect our vehicle for valet parking & reception staff were very average at check-in. Saying that room was great although short on storage space, location was great and breakfast was a solid 8/10. Would consider going back but they need to address staff attentiveness.~4~4~4~4~4~4~2~nan
review_479004276~“Great hotel in a good location.”~I stayed at the Pullman for 3 nights at the end of March. Very nice hotel, friendly staff, and good location. I came to the hotel early to see if I could check in, which I wasn't able to do as the room wasn't ready, which was fine as I was early. I was told they would put an priority on getting the room ready, however this ended up meaning I got into the room 15 minutes before regular check in (and 4 hours after I first arrived), so not really sure if there was any priority put on the room. I did have one issue with the room that was that the City View room, doesn't actually look at the city, it looks out over the suburbs towards Bondi. I expressed my displeasure at reception and they were able to offer me an room change for the 2nd and 3rd nights of my stay at a small cost. I was happy they were able to help me and the room change was well worth it. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning, and it was your typical nice hot buffet style food, nothing amazing, but didn't do anything poorly. I had a minor issue where the hotel tried to charge me an additional $100 for some reason that they were unable to explain to me, but it eventually sorted itself out (despite being pending on my credit card for over a week). The only complaint with the hotel was that the pool isn't heated. Otherwise a great stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Sydney.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478174580~“The best value in Sydney”~Have stayed in a Hyde Park view room so thought I'd try the other side this time. As a platinum member, I got a welcome call from the GM and I mentioned the room was nice but a little too close the the lifts ... I was moved to a wonderful room on 18 the floor. Canopies in Executive lounge excellent. Had breakfast in the restaurant and was very good. Only negative was on day 1 I was told you can't get eggs coked to order (omelettes only) but on day 2 I was told you could. The poached eggs were perfect. Great location with very competitive prices.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477283787~“Good location, good view, but a bit old”~We stayed at a junior suite and spent 4 nights there. It's apparently a slightly old hotel, the decoration and furniture was a bit tired. But service was good, and view as well. Very spacious junior suite at 700+ sqf with two TVs. Would recommend this hotel to those who look for spacious rooms, good location, Hyde Park view, and are ok with a relatively dated (yet pretty clean) accommodation.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476956010~“Very Nice Hotel”~We stayed at the Pullman for 10 nights. The room (1201) was clean, quiet, spacious, and comfy. The staff were attentive and the breakfast (cooked + continental) was both unlimited and yummy. The hotel is next to Hyde park (south), with easy access to both the city centre and the trains. The only downside was the lifts. At busy times be prepared to wait a few minutes at rush hour. Our longest wait was 7 minutes, or though 1 of the 3 lifts were out of service that day.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476857227~“Typical characterless business hotel”~Stayed here for one night before boarding a ship because the rental car company had a location in the lobby and was pleasantly surprised with the hotel.

review_476709498~“Location, location!”~The location was perfect and convenient, just less than 5 minutes walk to Museum Station and bus stops, as well as 100's of restaurants, stores and parks. Easy commute to Darling Harbour or Circular Quay. As requested, I stayed on a high floor and the view from the 19th storey was stunning, day and night! Room service meal was fantastic, however, took its time!  The pillows could be a bit better, as one was too firm and the other too soft, bed was a bit lumpy and squeeky, however still comfortable. A bit more care when cleaning the room is required, as I found a notepad with a previous guest's writing on it when looking at the room service menu. Overall, I would say this is closer to a 4 star hotel, not 5 star as advertised, and some staff need to be a bit more friendly and welcoming, but I enjoyed my stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476706080~“Very nice hotel (but maybe not quite 5*)”~Nice room with a good view and a very comfortable bed!  The location is great, near lots of interesting sights and nightlife and an easy 30 min walk to circular quay. The staff were all friendly as well, which was a bonus! My partner used the gym and liked it as well. Breakfast is overpriced and there are lovely cafes nearby, so we skipped it at the hotel. I am not sure I would class this a 5*, more like a 4*, but for the right price, I would definitely stay again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476244026~“Good location, excellent service. ”~Stayed here with four young children. The hotel is centrally located opposite Hyde Park with good sized rooms at the usual Pullman standard. Found the staff at this hotel to be particularly helpful - the service was excellent. Had an evening meal at the restaurant, which caters for kids at good prices. The breakfast was excellent and the service by Amadou was outstanding. He made an extra effort to accommodate the children which added to a very pleasant stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476020451~“Mr. Robert Hoich”~The Pullman was ideally located for us. It was within easy walking distance to localities relevant to us, such as The University of Notre Dame-Darlinghurst, Surrey Hills Eateries, Kings Cross, Potts Point, and the CBD in general.  Public Transport was exceptionally good with close proximity to Museum Railway station and an abundance of bus services virtually outside the Pullman's door. The Hotel itself was beautifully presented and the staff were very friendly and willing to assist us in anyway they could.  Fantastic city views 24 hours a day. Great rooftop pool/spa/gymnasium. Thoroughly recommended.~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475607974~“Ideal location for an extraordinary City”~Visited Sydney with friends who had booked the Pullman for us ad we were not disappointed with the choice. The hotel is a decent walk away from the main attractions of the Harbour and Circular key etc. but we had a lovely view from the room overlooking Hyde Park. The Room was comfortable had had all the expected trappings of a 5* hotel. The hotel bar was reasonably priced and the staff were very obliging indeed. Although not planned and due to inclement weather we actually used the Hotel restaurant one evening for a meal for the four of us and were very pleased with the outcome. The one drawback was the pool which although had great views etc was very cold, which could have been due to the weather I am not sure. All in all a great 3 night stay~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475253229~“Good stay !!!”~We stayed at this hotel as part of our first Australian vacation in April 2017. I was travelling with my wife and two boys (aged 3 and 5). I found the staff to be professional, friendly and helpful. My room had two queen sized beds and was of a decent size. The breakfast buffet spread was the same everyday but we found good variety and quality. Location is pretty central with a 15-20 minutes walk to Circular Quay and easy access to public transport. Wifi is free if you join the hotel's loyalty programme (membership is free).  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I did not feel it had the refinement / finesse of a 5-star hotel. But that should not deter you. Overall, I was quite happy with my stay.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474569448~“Very good location in Sydney CBD”~This hotel is just beside Hyde Park in CBD area, just 5-10 min taxi drive to opera house or darling harbour.

review_474463284~“City at your front door”~We stayed here for 3 nights and the experience was enjoyable. The CBD is literally with reach, with only Hyde Park separating the two. Our room was equipped with two double beds, perfect for a family with young kids. Great service from their staff, nothing appeared to be difficult. Windows restaurant was a great setting for breakfast each day. I would like to visit again in the future.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_474420827~“Nice hotel, good location, helpful staff”~Stayed here for 1 night on a Saturday with a friend. Had booked a room with 2 x double beds to suit our requirement. While checking in, found out that the booking was made for King bed room and they had no double bed rooms available (even though my confirmation was for a double bed room) Although I wasn't happy with this, the staff and manager- Honey were very apologetic and offered some alternatives for my stay which didn't go un-noticed.  Upon entering the room, it was clean, a good size and had a view over Hyde Park. As promised, they delivered a roll-away bed for my friend. Had breakfast on the Sunday morning while there and it was lovely. Had all the essentials you would expect for a breakfast although the dining room wasn't very large to cater for the high volume of guests, but we didn't have to wait very long. Overall, would stay here again. Just check your booking prior to check in if you have a specific requirement as the booking staff make boo-boos.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474333705~“Only let down by the in-room dining.”~Stayed 2 nights for a business trip. Usually stay at Marriot or Sheraton and decided on a change. The location was perfect for my needs and convenient for sightseeing walking around Sydney CBD. Staff on arrival were very polite and helpful. Amenities and overall conditions I would unfortunately only rate as high 4 star. The building and interior including rooms are starting to show wear and age. The friendliness and professionalism of the staff stood out, however the very pleasant stay was marred by the substandard quality of my in-room dining. Service great but food not so much. Second night's try no better. Apart from that a very pleasant place to stay. (also got charged for standby upgrade without receiving it)~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_474169071~“Convenient hotel near Hyde Park”~We stayed at this hotel as we are Accor Plus members and we were going to a birthday party in Bronte that night. The hotel is right on the bus route to the Eastern Beaches. We were hoping to use our 'free night' but it was not available to us that night. The staff are very helpful and friendly on check in and check out. We were asked several times when we were checking out if we wanted to store our bags for the day. The room was a standard room and was quite spacious and a good view of Hyde Park from our window. The breakfast that morning was delicious with plenty to choose from at the buffet.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473744071~“Great location but misses some of the details”~We stayed with the family in this hotel for 2 nights in Sydney. Located opposite Hyde Park and a stone throw from the museum/station, it's a very convenient place to stay. If you like running/walking this is a great place to launch your exercise and can easily take you to the harbour/domain botanical gardens. It's also a nice 10-15 min stroll into the Pitt st Mall. When it comes to the hotel itself, I don't think it's 5 star but it's a good 4 star hotel. It has friendly attentive staff who all seem to pay attention to guests but there are some details that make it not quite a to scratch in all areas. Wifi wasn't included in our package and was quite slow. The spa wasn't working and it took quite some time for it to get fixed. In addition, the pool area(on the roof with a brilliant view of the city) was a bit dirty. Rooftop toilets not well kept and there was a mess left by some selfish guests drinking. I would definitely stay here again at the right price because the rooms are comfortable and the location is good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473734859~“Good property and great location.”~This was our 1st stay on the property. We have stayed at various hotels in Sydney & this was our 1st at the Pullman. And I must admit that this property will be our favourite on our visits to Sydney.  Hotel location is ideal as its close to the CBD and away from the noise and crowd.  The room we booked was with the garden/ park facing and it was truely beautiful. It had French windows showcasing the skyline as if it was a wall paper. The rooms are spacios and well lit. It had a good selection of amenities and mini bar. There are multiple plug sockets in the room which makes it easier to charge your devices. Be mindful to carry spare adaptors. The wifi is of good speed and no restrictions. The check in is quick and efficient. Carina was the staff who checked us in and was very efficient in passing information about the property The breakfast selection is great and has a live cooking station, however with limited offering. The staff at the restaurant were very helpful and attentive, especially Tony (service manager), Amadou, Carmen. The conceirge guys were great help in planning our day and organising the tour etc. Jose and Banu were quiet knowledgeable about the city and tour offerings.  Ther is a convinence store right next to the hotel and also few Thai restaurants for a quick bite. You will find a lot of cafes and smaller joints around the place near Pitt st which is just a walk accross the hotel (10mins).  I would definately come back to this property on my future visits.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_473721961~“Absolutely beautiful!! ”~We stayed here at the end of March early April and really enjoyed our stay, we had 2 rooms and both were beautiful, the beds was super comfy and the bath was lovely for a soak for our son who played league that day!! The room service breakfast was absolutely faultless, hubby had the Pullmans breakfast, kids had the pancakes and I had the chefs special of advocado, tomato and feta on sour dough toast, all were absolutely beautiful, I would eat that sore dough breakfast every single day given the choice!!! The pool on the roof top was lovely, although we did have the leftovers from Cyclone Debbie while we were there so it was a little bit cold and raining but the spa was nice!! We had a meeting in the bar area wen it was closed on the Sunday and the guy behind the desk brought us a tray with ice cream and chocolates on it, I wish I had got his name because it was such a lovely thing to do and I wish we had been able to thank him properly!!! It's lovely to walk thru Hyde Park on a Sunday and close enough to walk into the city and to walk down to the beautiful St Mary's Cathedral just down the road!! Parking is a bit expensive but we are just not used to paying for parking at a hotel, if we didn't need a car we would have just used the trains and bus, unfortunately we needed one so had no choice but to pay for parking!! Overall our stay was amazing and I will definitely love to stay there again, my one complaint was that the coffee machine on the 1st floor had no milk in it so we couldn't have a much needed coffee on Sunday morning BUT we could have gone back to our room and ordered one thru room service so wasn't a major deal!!! The staff were lovely and everything was nice and clean!! Thanks heaps!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473547256~“Three night stay”~The hotel is well located. We arrived in Sydney by train, and it was an easy fifteen minute walk from Central Station (we are an elderly couple). It is also only a few train stations away from the airport. We had a standard room, which had a balcony and a great view. The room was quite spacious and comfortably furnished. Everything was neat and clean and housekeeping standards were high. The bathroom was a little dated, but spacious. Tea and coffee making was provided in the room. The mini bar was quite expensive, and so I recommend you bring your own snacks. On the other hand, we ordered a room service meal and it was reasonably priced (and tasty). We were not charged extra for in room wi fi. It was fast and worked perfectly. Breakfast was good, with a variety of hot and cold dishes on offer, friendly service in the dining room and good coffee. Overall, a good place to stay in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473526208~“Great location- comfy beds”~The location and rooms were great and the staff fantastic! Special mention to Luke for going above and beyond.  Location offers easy access to city, surreyhills and Paddington/oxford street The club was nice but the room they serve it in is very sterile and uninviting.  Don't bother paying for breakfast option - it was average. So many amazing breakfast spots in Sydney to have breakfast.  Note to management: all the chairs in dining area and club are in serious need of a clean. They were filthy.~4~4~5~4~4~3~4~nan
review_473382311~“Not 5 star ”~Checked in and was originally allocated a room on level 8. Asked to change rooms and was moved to the 18th floor. Rooms were identical but I couldn't be bothered complaining again. Rooms were tired, bed was saggy, and pillows like concrete. The last refurb was probably a long time ago! Executive lounge was ok, nothing special although the hot food was actually hot, unlike some lounges you visit. Location was opposite Hyde Park and enough out of the city centre to have to have a long walk there and back. Much better properties in Sydney, won't be back in a hurry.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473236192~“Average hotel in a good location”~We stayed at the Pullman Sydney Hyde Park for five nights while my husband worked, and I took the opportunity to have a break. We recently stayed at another Pullman hotel and had a good experience so I was expecting a nice stay from the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, with an easy train ride from the airport, and is easy walking distance from the shopping district and tourist areas. The room is large with a great view, and big bathroom.  However the maintenance of the hotel, and the staff responsiveness lets the hotel down. Our tv in the room is defective and we can't turn it on. The response from the staff has been to turn it on and off at the wall before using it. Not exactly ideal. Also, the bath is broken - we can't fill the bath up using more than a slow flow of water. We had maintenance come and have a look but they didn't fix it. Also, when trying to ring to order room service or assistance with anything the phone often rings out and we've had to try to call more than once. The hotel could easily fix these issues and be a much better option than it currently is. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472029665~“Very average”~This hotel should not be rated 5 stars. There was nothing horribly wrong with my experience, but nothing great either.  The building has obviously been renovated on a shoestring budget, and is operated in the same manner. Like a tired old showgirl, the flashy decorations, gaudy colours and slap of paint can't quite cover up the beaten old fixtures. The badly laid hallway carpet didn't help the experience either, and neither did the hasty repair job (complete with mismatched tiles) in the bathroom.  Internet is $10 per 24 hours - what 5-star hotel still charges for internet nowadays?? It's like charging for hot water. Or air conditioning. The bed was comfortable, but only queen size - another anachronism in today's accommodation market. Overall, I couldn't recommend it. I've stayed in plenty of better places in Sydney for the same price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471818461~“'Grand' feel but could've been better (Second Honeymoon attempt)”~The first thing you notice is the smell of the reception foyer area of this hotel, a very nice scent that is exclusive to this hotel we are sure. Checked in early with Samuel - very efficient guy. We booked a twin king room as that was all that was available online. Requested a room with one king bed if possible. Advised room not quite ready however hotel happy to retain our bags so we could leave to kill some time. Assured they would look at possibility of altering room by the time we were to return. Upon returning to check in, we were told there were no single king bedrooms available except a disabled room which had a disabled toilet and showering facilities. We thought this would be ok given it was the only room in the hotel at the time however didn't want to inconvenience any guests who may actually require a disabled room over the week we stayed. The check in agent assured us there were no other differences with the room except things would be a little lower down. Discovered the room was fine however no hot water in the bathroom sink (required for shaving) and shower pressure was low. Reception advised this is normal in their disabled rooms for health and safety reasons, no offer of room change, just maintenance. Wasn't satisfied with thought of a week with no hot water in bathroom basin so requested a room change and this was actioned relatively quickly which was appreciated. Given this was our second attempt at a honeymoon, we would've thought the hotel / staff would've done a bit more however, no mention of it and nothing provided by the hotel in recognition of the trip purpose (not that it is expected but would've been a nice touch like other hotels that go out of their way to mark such an occasion). Also ordered flowers for my husband and specifically requested these be kept out of sight and delivered to the room after we checked-in, this surprise was ruined when returning to check-in which was disappointing, particularly after arranging this. Definitely not a five star hotel, some noticeable paint work needed, however a very well presented, tidy, clean and comfortable property. Would recommend and would stay again however only in the most expensive room available next time or would look at the Pullman Harbour property for full comfort and satisfaction next time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469569105~“NEVER Neverever stay at this hotel”~This five star hotel did not deliver even one star for service or confidence in the hotel staff including the manager Sarah Connelly. Sheets not changed on beds, room keys not working, TV apparently over heated so not working. Laundry not collected, ineadable food in the dining room. Even something as simple as a pot of tea at breakfast turned into a comedy of errors for seven mornings in a row....leaking tea pot, wrong type of tea, no milk, no teaspoon....you name it we experience it at the Pullman Hyde Park. Upon raising my concerns in a professional and courteous manner...thnigs were unable to change and even after making contact with Sarah when she indicated she would follow up and get back to me...no contact...no change.. Basically they do care and are not in a position to change. Happy to take your money over $500 a night for two nights of our stay and over $400 for the other 7 nights. Beyond belief. I received an apology from the food and beverage manager and he agreed it is not good enough the hotel is not five star...his words. Apology after apology from the front desk managers but no resolution and the errors and issues just continue. I feel compelled to let people know....do not stay at this hotel. I can also see other reviews with a similar experience to mine.......so take advice from a number of guests....never, never stay here....you will be so disappointed.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

I called to ask for soap at night after arriving from a Long trip the staff ask me to go down to 7 eleven. I would never recommend anyone going there please don't waste ur money!!

review_468295379~“After the awful Pullman Hyde Park experience, we no longer trust the brand.”~After this recent stay in Pullman hotel, my wife and I will never ever consider to choose Pullman again! The reason why we chose Pullman Hyde Park for our Sydney vacation was that we got wonderful experiences and services in Pullman La Defense, Paris. But Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney was a far cry from Pullman La Defense, Paris! We were so disappointed. If the former is ranked 5 Stars, the latter should be at highest 3 Stars! In terms of hardware, Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney's is dated and wore off. It is like all the settings and furnitures have never been reviewed since day one of using!  First, the room lacks proper lighting! It is way too dark! You don't expect all the visitors go back just for sleeping immediately! They do read, they do work on computer, they do put on makeup, and they do pack in the room! Please make the lighting brighter or at least let the visitors to adjust themselves by installing a system! Second, seriously, a bathroom only has a bathtub with a shower curtain instead of a slide door? It even has no slippery-free mat placed inside the bathtub? My wife and I thought that we had traveled back to 90s in a 3-star hotel! Third, the bed, the pillows, and the sofa are way too soft for human being! And that leads to another serious problem in Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney--the software (onward below)! Forth, When my wife and I made the booking online via the hotel website, we specifically made three requests: a hard mattress, two firm pillows, and two big coffee mugs (our stay in Pullman La Defense let us knew that the cups inside the room would be tiny). Unfortunately, when we checked in and got into our room at late night eleven o'clock, we found out that all our requests were being ignored. None had been responded, none! Except disappointment, we were unable to take any action nor even generate any emotion because of long-flight tiredness. Fifth, two days out of our seven days staying in the hotel, our room was not cleaned when we got back in the evening regardless the "please make up my room..." sign was hung outside the door handle when we left the room in the morning! That included one morning we even walked to a janitor at next door and asked him to make up our room but apparently in vein! Sixth, the food selections of buffet breakfast are pathetically less! No nuts, no dried fruit, no honey, no white meat.... Compare with Pullman La Defense where it had hot chicken, hot potatoes, a wide range of nuts and dried fruit, and even an organic section, the choices in Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney are laughable! And more unacceptably, the food (rice porridge and cooked tomatoes, for instance) were not hot at all! We later found out the reason was that two pots of dishes actually placed on only one heater (each one shared half of the space)! It made perfect sense to us why those food were cold! Should all these live up to your (or any other customers') expectation? My wife and I did expect all the Pullman hotels are of the same decent standard. And that was the ONLY reason that we chose to stay in Pullman Hyde Park, Sydney despite its price was much higher than many other same-ranking hotels. Last but not the least, please do not recommend the shuttle bus service "Ready To Go" to customers again! Although we booked the service and paid the fee online in advance before the trip, my wife and I were guided to wait outside the airport in a windy and cold night for 45 minutes! My wife and I had trusted Pullman brand. But after the awful Pullman Hyde Park experience, we no longer. That's all we have to say. That's it.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_467982044~“Excellent Hotel”~Hotel is well located in the city. Walking distance from harbour bridge, opera house, etc. Breakfast is really good. Giid restaurants in the area, Korean town or Darling Harbour. Relative close to the airport~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467917137~“Pleasant Stay”~On arrival, the service from Maria was outstanding. She was very friendly, efficient and professional. In regards to the hotel overall, it's very tired, especially the rooms on the 21st floor. The bathrooms need a make over. The service in the Club Lounge from Ken was excellent. I've stayed at the hotel many times, this time the service was outstanding compared to previous visits.~3~1~5~4~2~4~5~nan
