review_473030435~“Fab spot!”~We stayed in the pub style accommodation for a few days in March. What a great spot! good food and entertainment just down the stairs, buses to anywhere right out front, millions of yummy places to eat and just over the road from the beach. The room was lovely, comfy and clean and the staff were friendly. Cant wait to get back to Coogee :)~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470359665~“Comfortable Stay”~Stayed in Room 126 in Heritage area of accommodation for our last 3 days of a 2 month trip to Australia from U.K. Very comfortable + clean + quiet location, with tea/coffee facilities. Lovely beer garden within a short walk of superb Coogee Beach ( why are dogs not allowed in garden?) Delicious food served from good/varied menu - big portions, so we often shared. Friendly staff, but often too busy chatting with each other + not clearing tables - more training perhaps?~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468712108~“Good basic accommodation”~Great location, great food and service. The rooms whilst basic have all that you need, a comfortable bed, good bathroom and supplied amenities. Getting up in the morning and strolling across the road to the beach one of the highlights of this place.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467653815~“expensive very average hotel”~The room was clean and averagely furnished. Location was great but two irksome features - No sign in Vicar Street to indicate entrance to hotel which left us having to phone for instructions after driving up and down friutlessly. The second issue is the dreadful "house breakfast" which gives guests absolutely no choice but a glass of granola gloop, like it or leave it. A table with choices of cereals and breads with perhaps some cheese would be just as cheap and much more welcoming. I'd be tempted to bring my own fruit next time.~3~2~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467082123~“Pub style accommodation”~I stayed in the pub style accommodation for one night. It was clean and tidy. Great location and the pub meals were very well priced. The noise from the pub did not disturb my sleep. I was by myself visiting relatives who luve nearby and felt very safe. Would stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466437151~“Awesome place and incredible service”~We were waiting a bit more for food, however, one of the staff offered free drinks due to delay which made may day perfect. I love this place and I will by all means recommend you to all my friends. ....................................~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464657141~“Not bad...”~Great location near the beach. Ocean view was a little disappointing because you mostly saw the bottle shop parking lot. The room was clean, but the shower flooded and leaked .Room had a damp smell. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was lovely, and such a cute restaurant!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459694502~“Coogee Bay Boutique Hotel”~Spacious well appointed room, kitchenette, and a great bathroom and shower The King Bed was comfortable A very modern room and a contemporary beach feel. Made the trip to Coogee feel like a beach side stay. Reception was helpful with parking~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_456081051~“Boutique part of the hotel”~Northern lass from Northumberland. This was a lovely hotel in a great spot. Close to the beach and amenities. What we liked was the spacious room, very comfortable bed and also it was quiet. As part of the hotel there are 3 bars one for a younger crowd, one for a more mature crowd and in addition a great sports bar with several screens showing different sports where we watched the tennis. It is well run and we received lovely welcome when we checked in. Breakfast was a bonus for us as it didn't state on our booking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454345703~“Builder”~Bathroom quite dated and toilet seat was peeling. Could have been cleaner, breakfast included was not worth having. Excellent position as beach is directly accross the road,cafes and restaurants are close by.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452199102~“Great Beer Garden”~Had a lovely afternoon here with friends recently The beer Garden is the place to be. Opposite the beach. The barstaff were lovely and even let me have a beer taste before pooring The selection of Tap beer was also good And it wasn't over full like other places~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445696570~“nice place to stay”~close to everything, bed comfortable and spacious room. staff very friendly. wasn't keen on the shower, looks like it needed a new one as could barely open the door with it being installed too close to the toilet! shower leaked out onto main bathroom floor. our room was over the driveway through to back of pub and was a bit noisy with trucks reversing.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_437188691~“Tidy”~Was very clean but we had lots of luggage had to cart up 3 flights of stairs as had no elevator. This was at the pub style accommodation. Location was awesome right on coogee beach. You can catch the 353 bus to randwick shopping centre.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436469228~“The Heart Of Coogee ”~The Bay is the place to go in Coogee, the staff are nice people & it's always a fun place to visit for a meal, cold beer, watch sports, live music or have a bet. The big beer garden at the front is a fantastic spot to chill with friends but there is also several other places around the hotel where you can sit back, relax & enjoy. Open all hours is also a plus & there's a sports bar, rooms to stay & a bottle shop.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435781177~“Nice stay at Coogee”~Pretty big room, very well equiped and mantained. It included a healthy and tasty breakfast in its restaurant. The hotel has a car parking and is located in front of the coogee beach and surrounded by restaurants and shops. You have the feeling to be part of a living quartier at Sudney. Really nice stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433437800~“Holiday by the sea”~Excellent location but be sure to book in the Boutique Rooms as hotel is very popular at all times and standard rooms over the bars/restaurant area are subject to loud noise and music well into the night. Even then, try to get a room facing away from the beach and bars. Excellently staff, wide range of good quality food and drinks. Plenty of other cheap restaurants close by and regular bus service to city and other suburbs at front door. Only gripe would that in the evenings some of the entries to the bar areas are not available and monitored by security personnel and no allowance made for guests who have to walk around to one of the less convenient entries .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431724192~“Lunch with a view”~Stopped by here for some lunch. Traditional pub grub. There was plenty of choice on the menu and plenty of seating. . We sat in the window seats with views over Coogee bay - wonderful! Food was Well presented and delicious.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428998788~“Good old style pub stay”~I stayed here on a recent business trip. Not the usual place and was perhaps a little bit old style pub stay. No problems with noise. But best of was the location. I love Coogee and love doing the cliff top walk to Bondi when ever I stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427522758~“The room is big, clean and tidy. Very Comfortable”~The hotel is resided in a convenient location near Coogee Bay with 2 mins walk only. There are many restaurnats, pubs, cafes on the main road next to the hotel. Although the lobby is not sizable, the room is pretty big, clean and tidy. It gives a very good impression for the visitors and the feeling is very warm and comfortable. The ladies at the concierge is very friendly. One point to note is that, the room access card will be disable once it reaches the checkout date/time. Thus, you won't be able to operate the elevator as access card is needed for authentication. I am not sure if the card is workable for the room access at that point of time. Anyway, the receptionist may be able to help resolve it.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_425844389~“Dinning experience ”~I've eaten here a couple of times, what I will say is the first time the food was brilliant I had a coogee chicken club sandwich, the portion size was huge, service not so great I asked for garlic mayo I got mustard, completely different sauces! Second time I got pizza and a portion of chips to share with a friend and the chips were cold, the hotel was packed I think the prices are a bit overpriced but that is just Coogee in general. All in all I would go back but I recommend the quieter times of the day!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424570394~“Good couple of nights”~Stayed a couple of nights here during conference. Great location, comfortable room, well appointed bathroom. Certainly a really nice relatively economic place to stay with great access to the beach, bars and nightlife~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_422682612~“great vibe”~My second stay at the coogee bay hotel was as good as my first. I love the area for the energy, the ambience, the wonderful ocean and beach and the easy access to public transport to the opera house and the harbour area in general. My 23 year old twins loved it too and the interconnecting rooms worked well. Wonderful walking trail from coogee to bondi was so special. Restaurants are plentiful and a supermarket up the street with fresh fruit and veg available for those who wish to cook meals. Fabulous!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_420309605~“Good place to relax after long haul flight”~We were looking for a place with free parking, free wifi, relaxing and easy access to Sydney's airport but not in the CBD. We chose here. It was a really pleasant surprise with a large, spacious room, in room kitchenette and a fantastic view of the beach for AU$135 a night. There was also an in room safe, and lots of sun. We arrived around 11AM, a bit before the scheduled checkin. After explaining we'd just arrived from long international flights, they asked us to wait about a half hour and then had us in a room early. This was great because we were exhausted.  The location is nice because there are a lot of easily walkable food options. And the beach is like 5 minutes by foot. The staff were also super helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419051614~“Disapointed return”~We ate here about 6 months ago and it was good.We are staying nearby and decided to eat here on Friday night.It was very disappointing.We ordered the herb and parmasan crusted schnitzel and the grilled pork cutlet.The schnitzel was over cooked and served on a large helping of mash,swimming in the sauce.The pork was over cooked to hell.At $24 and $28 it was also over priced for what we got.You order at the counter and pick up your food when buzzed and grab your own cutlery.So zero for service.The food was served on crockery more suitable for breakfast(a bowl).We won't eat here again, Would not suggest this place to anyone as there are lots of better places in the area.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418595834~“Great venue”~I've been to this pub multiple times and it has a good vibe. It has a nice selection of beers on tap which is worth trying out. Inside and outside seating just a stone throw from Coogee Beach. Good for groups or couples. Defintely worth a visit if you are in the area. Well known among locals and for good reason.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_417774440~“Good times”~Stayed here for a weekend in between a 2 week business trip and wanted to try something different outside of the CBD. It was a great choice and we had an awesome weekend. We paid a little more to have an Ocean View room and although we weren't on a high floor we still had a great view down to the beach.  The room was massive and we had a huge bed which always goes down well. Loved the shutters on the windows which gave it a real bach feeling. Good outdoor furniture out on the ample sized deck as well. Bathroom was okay but not a whole lot of bench space around the sink. Breakfast was included in the rate and it was absolutely massive - you won't need lunch after the full monty breakfast!!! The pub itself has everything you could want and we watched a game of NZ rugby in the sports bar. A very popular garden bar was chocker almost all weekend so these guys are obviously doing things right. Will definitely go back in the summer and spend a long weekend at the Coogee Bay~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_414174312~“Be warned, this place is addictive”~When I arrived to Australia I quickly got addicted to this place. Weather is be a Sunday afternoon or an evening it is such a great place to have fun and meet people. Ther3 is sometimes live music and always gets a crown in there. Be careful though, the doorman have itchy trigger fingers. If like me you get red faced after 2 beers and look a little jolly you mite find yourself on the other side of the fence pleading with your friends who are all having a good time to come out and go elsewhere. The food isn't cheap and is a standard level, never stayed in the hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408492578~“LOVELY PLACE”~What a lovely room bright,clean and quiet.King size bed and a full size bath . Close to shops. Breakfast was fantastic in the bistro at the pub plus the view was a bonus. We also used the function room which was very close it was a lovely room with a large balconey that looked over the pub and bay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408482293~“A Sunday afternoon must !'”~Had a lovely Sunday afternoon here in the beer garden with friends. They also serve lunch. I had the steak sandwich and chips. It definitely satisfied my palate. Both food and drink are reasonably priced. Will definitely visit again when in Sydney~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408474182~“Great location, large comfy room”~Great location, just steps away from cafes and the beautiful beach. Friendly staff, modern room (9 Vicar Street in the boutique wing), very quiet, comfy stay. Grateful for the early check in and late check out too!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_404737623~“Food”~This is what a $32 salad looks like, pay for extra chicken and I'm lucky to get a whole breast apparently. Not to mention the kale Salad with to kale present. Very average. then sit down to eat to be asked to move on because we're eating in a deserted smoking area. Well done cbh, well done.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403511867~“Above average pub food”~I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. The outside area is clean and well maintained. Food pricing was mid range and wine reasonably priced. In a great location close to the beach. Staff pleasant and accommodating. Happy to go again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403507556~“Nice enough and good location”~We were only here 1 night and it did just the job. The room was modern and clean and the hotel very well placed. The staff were friendly. We didn't spend much time in the hotel or use any facilities or the bar/restaurant.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_402317997~“Family together for birthday lunch”~Arriving at Coogee Bay Hotel, with the entire family in tow for my sons 23rd B'Day. The brasserie was spacious and could accommodate us all (6). The table was wobbly but the staffer fixed that issue. The food was too pricey for what it is. I had the red snapper with the blah blah blah, when I got to the counter to order the girl called it fish and chips $26 - average meal steep price. Would I go back? Probably the location is great, the drinks great/cold.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_399184617~“Shhhhh...This is a Hidden Gem!”~Our airport cab driver had never heard of it and was hesitant to leave us but we assured him this was the right place. The room was nice and we were upgraded to an oceanview room with a balcony. NICE! The location is close to restaurants, shops, bars, the beach, bus stops etc. The hotel has meeting rooms, breakfast and dinner specials in the bar/beer garden. There is a very large liquor/beer/wine store attached to the hotel with at great selection and friendly staff members. My only complaint was the staff member that serviced the minibar came to the room one day and insisted on restocking the minibar telling me that we had used several items, which he named. We had not used anything from the minibar and reported it to the front desk. They noted it and made sure we were not charged. There were some leftover (unused) condoms in a nightstand drawer that were obviously left by a previous guest. The hotel does not have a laundrymat but there is one just past the Crown Plaza about 1 block away that is either self serve (sells soap packs) or drop off. it is diagonally across from the bus shelter.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_399116179~“Deserves nothing more.”~I went for my good friends 19th birthday. They allowed me in and I was in the venue for about 35 mins. As my mate went into the pokies I followed him and went up to the bar. I got a $50 note changed, a Carno and went to open the door to the outside smoking section. As I had a carona in my hand and notes in the other, I used my knee to lightly press the green open button. I was then approached from behind by security and asked to finish my beer and leave. I asked what I had done wrong and was told "you kicked the button, finish your drink and leave". Never go to this venue if you are intending on staying or "behaving" yourself. Worst venue in the eastern suburbs.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397164399~“Nice”~Good food, plenty of room , tab and pokies ,beer garden big, nice place for Sunday drinks, didn't do Friday or Saturday nights but I think this place would go off , wish I went there 25 years ago, the view to the beach and everyone who walks past is great, on a hot day this place will be good to have a drink or a meal at~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389917122~“Best Value in Coogee”~We stayed at the Coogee Bay Boutique Hotel and extended our stay as it was spot on. Staff were super accommodating (reception gave up their small heater on a cold evening!), and made it easy to extend. Free light breakfast was fresh and a good start for the day. Dine in at the Hotel or easy walk to numerous Coogee restaurants. Top it off with the Coastal walk across the road and the beach. Best value in Coogee.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_388636422~“Great stay”~We had investigated hotels in cbd which are pretty expensive, especially considering average parking overnight in cbd is $55. Decided on Coogee bay hotel, for $160 we received lovely balcony room, free wifi, delicious continental breakfast and parking, happy days! We will be back !!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383854263~“Food is below average and over priced”~This place is my local drinking hole so it's disappointing not being able to get a good quality steak with a beer. They give you the option of chips OR salad what a joke. The place as a whole though is awesome for a boogie on a Friday/Saturday night they always have really talented musicians playing.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383306049~“Great Location Many Options”~The staff are friendly and helpful , on a recent trip I arrived early and because my room was available they offered for me to checkin early , which makes a world of difference. I stayed in a normal hotel room which provides that base amenities like kettle, iron etc. I you need washing done there is a Landry service.  The rooms have Pay TV if your looking for that.  I travel to this area for work and staying at this location provides access to at least twenty different restaurants. The beach is also just a block away. Along the beach there is walking paths in either direction which has great scenery and views. Coogee may not be a popular for tourist as Bondi but that's one of the reasons I like it.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_382317188~“Guests Treated as Second Rate”~Don't bother staying here. Poor Service, Malfunctioning Lifts, Restaurant food and service very poor, dirty sheets, rubbish strewn on roof below balcony, fire evacuation handled very poorly (a shambles), rooms need updating, we had drunks yelling at each other all night and could hear them through the paper thin walls. We have been staying here for years but the service, rooms, food at the restaurant and cleanliness has gone downhill. The smell of stale beer is overwhelming. Balcony rooms look down on the grog being delivered for the bottle shop, where drunks stagger in and out from 10:00am to the early hours of the morning.~1~nan~nan~nan~2~2~1~nan
