review_473936374~“A few issues initially but resolved well”~Arrived on a Friday evening, 3 adults and 6 kids. There was a mix up on our first night with someone else being given a key to our room, and a bit of a rude awakening at 10:30 pm when a stranger entered the room! While the weekend receptionist wasn't the best at dealing with our concerns, the manager handled our complaint professionally, courteously and exceeded customer service expectations. As a result we would definitely return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472099105~“Good”~Good location closed to darling harbour. You can have 500 mo wifi for free. Common bathroom and toilets but very clean. Nice room with sink and fridge but don't choose a street side room (a lot of noise). Friendly staff, they can book airport shuttle for 16 $ per person. There is a luggage storage for free.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468714019~“Surprising”~I expected this to be an old-fashioned sort of place but it is in fact a hostel. No bar. Still, the room was pretty good, shared toilets and showers perfectly OK, butperhapsa bit expensive for what it was.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_468363850~“TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE”~Booked through booking.com for weekend. In the lead up received a letter warning us to produce ID on arrival ( sensible). After dinner in Darling Harbour we arrived at 9.30 - 10 pm. At this point.. we are 69/59 ...professionals, both extremely well dressed, sober ( I am a teetotaller) and drugs are a complete non issue. Booking in my name. As I am no longer a driver, I produced a Vic government working with children's check card complete with photo and address. I also produced my booking.com page. The young girl on reception frowned and said drivers licence or passport is the norm. I then offered my wife's Vic drivers licence but she told us ...no good as the booking is in my name !!!!. She then rang her boss and then told us we could not have the booking. We then had to cab it mikes out of the CBD to get a poor alternative. So, I made another booking.com booking for the Sunday night which they cancelled. I rang them and the receptionist said ....YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN EVICTED FROM THE HOTEL !!!! I add that at the time of the sat night rejection we were not rude or loud...it was simply the girl was "thrown" by ID she had not seen before...note: I also produced my medicare card and credit card in my name. Sorry sir..no photo. My Trip Advisor reviews demonstrated we have travelled the world for many years and stayed at countless hotels. NEVER have we been treated in this disgusting way.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468203261~“Great accommodation at an affordable price!”~Loved our stay at the Woolbrokers Hotel. The room was clean and tidy and for a shared bathroom property, it was sensational as there were 3 bathrooms for 6 rooms!! The breakfast was outstanding. We will be back :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462852772~“Pleasantly surprised! Must do!”~My family of five children and two adults recently stayed at the Woolbrokers Hotel in Darling Harbour, Sydney. It was so much better than I anticipated. The quality of the room was equal to that which would've cost us an extra $1000 for one night (it's true, because we had shopped around!) We chose a family room with an ensuite and to my surprise, our rooms ended up have separate quarters for the adults and children. Our room was modern and clean, with comfy bedding. The free wi-fi was a hit with the kids. The accomodation was centrally located and easy walking distance to EVERYTHING! If I had to make a suggestion, I would only ask for a t.v. in the kids' quarters (we had one in the adults room) and extra hooks to hang the towels. We will definitely be back and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459891225~“Air conditioning must feature in next reno”~My sister-in-law booked this accommodation in August last year when she booked the tickets to see Human Nature. Who knew that it would be 45 degrees that weekend. After finding parking across the road, which is subsidised by the hotel, we walked in and the lovely girl behind the desk directed us to a stairway to our room. What no elevator? No sorry. After scaling the stairs, then going through another door and 4 more stairs we came to our rooms. The main room had a king size bed, the other room had 3 bunk beds. "I bags the king bed!" There was a small but clean bathroom with shower & toilet, a small fridge in a cupboard, TV in the main room and 3 fans. The beds were surprisingly comfortable and a choice of pillows was good. It was clean and very well presented. The shower worked well though the shower head needed replacing. Proximity to Harbourside and the ICC is a plus but no air conditioning is a big minus. I would not recommend staying here in summer until that issue is fixed, unless you like the heat, however I would recommend staying here for the convenience of being close to Darling Harbour.~3~5~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_459259849~“Affordable Accommodation”~We booked a family room which catered for four adults and three children. The hotel is situated conveniently close to Darling Harbour; clean and reasonably priced. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms quite large on the top floor with an ensuite and extra shower next door. There was no air-conditioning but three fans were provided and the beds were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was provided and a leafy courtyard with tables and chairs was situated beyond the dining room. Overall, the hotel was quiet and Darling Harbour was only a short walk away.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458387544~“Cheap clean affordable ”~We had a good couple of nights stay very clean staff were lovely only problem was no airconditoning and no lifts location was perfect easy walk to the harbour and public transportation and very quiet at night~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448693679~“It's all about the location..”~Located within minutes of Darling Harbour lies the Woolbrokers Hotel. A short tram ride or walk will get you into the main CBD areas. I stayed in a standard double room and upon entry I was presented with a basic bed, modern television, fan but not much else. Bathroom facilities are shared but they are adequate and sufficiently clean. The price is definitely appealing. However, be aware that you are staying in a no-frills hotel.  With this in mind it is definitely good value for money for the budget concious traveller.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447720149~“Nice place”~For a 2 stars hotel, is a good place to stay. It's central, clean, there are more bathrooms available in each floor, with showers and without them. The Staff is kind and professional, it could be better if there would be a 24 hours service, and not 'till 10:30 pm. I didn't try breakfast, but in the city there are lots of good places to have it. In general, if you don't wanna pay too much for stay in Sydney (is very expensive) this could be a good option.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_441811487~“Woolbrokers stay”~Not 5 star accommodation but neither is the price. Good value for money considering the great location - short walk to National Maritime Museum and Star Casino, plenty of restaurants close by. Excellent place for families on a budget~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432792543~“Good for a short stay”~The best thing about this place is the location! Literally a 5 minute walk to the beautiful Darling Harbour and into Sydney CBD. The price was good too. Rooms were nice, I chose one with an ensuite and it was comfortable. Only downside was my room was right at the front of the motel at street level and it was a little noisy, but being a Saturday night it was to be expected. Breakfast was basic but for the price you can't complain. Recommended if you want a great location without the hefty price tag.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_430457123~“Family Weekend Holiday”~Good budget Hotel for large families that want to stay near the heart of Darling Harbour and close to public transport. The light rail nice and close which can get you to the central station to get out the further suburbs. The only thing missing was kitchen facilities and a bigger bar fridge to keep water cold for large family. Otherwise I was happy with the Hotel for my family of 7 for the 3 nights we stayed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429870143~“Great Location”~A very basic hotel, nothing fancy but thats what we were looking for. We got a large room as we are a family of 5 and had beds left over. Staff were nice and very helpful when it came to parking. About 5 min walk (can be quicker) to Darling Harbour so it was perfect location. We will coming back to stay here for a weekend in a couple weeks!~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_428566794~“Central Sydney on a Budget”~If you want to experience central Sydney at affordable rates it is definitely worth trying this hotel. Staff are helpful & friendly and rooms are small but clean & comfortable. Amenities are on a share basis but there is a selection available on each floor and all are clean and well presented. Of significance the amenities are private to you when in use with locks on all doors. Bath mats, hand towels and hand basin soap dispensers are provided in each bathroom. Bus, light rail and rail transport are all readily accessible from the hotel and it is an easy walk to Darling Harbour.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_426439622~“small but comfy”~we stayed here on Friday night as we were travelling after work and was a late check in close to food and the casino. Great service, small room but comfortable bed. Great price for the time we were there~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_426244565~“Great Affordable Place”~This is a piece of history - it is very affordable so don't expect fancy bits and pieces (there is no fancy price) - we got what we paid for and needed so very happy - we were going to a weddding and wanted somewhere to crash (so perfect for us) - staff were great and I loved the building !!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421326826~“An experience!!!!!!”~Arrived before reception closed however all their instructions for after hours check in very clear. No lift so had to go up 2 flights of stairs with heavy bag..room was very clean and everything you could want. Share bathroom and toilet not a big problem but the noise was unbelievable and so bad I did not get much sleep at all. For the price it is good value and I would recommend you take ear plugs.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_417762005~“Location Location Location”~This hotel is all about the location. So very close to Darling Harbour & the light rail. The shared bathrooms are modern however when the hotel is full don't expect fresh hand towels/ bath mat in the bathroom unless you are the first person to use them. Also expect a noisy night, with the window shut & the curtains drawn you can still hear people chatting on the street (even 1 floor up). However, the continental breakfast is value for money @ $7.50pp So if you are just looking for location & price then this is the hotel for you~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416110863~“WooHoo”~Stayed here on a trip to Sydney and wow what a find. Close to Darling Harbour and then easy to access to the Light Rail. Room on the Ground Floor was tops and the noise was nothing to worry about. Ill be coming back.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_397713129~“Nice stay, cant complain”~I stayed at this place with my son for 2 nights. Our room was on the ground floor opposite reception. As mentioned by other visitors this establishment is on the corner of a busy intersection that makes it noisy especially if you are on the lower levels. However, that did not bother us at all as we were so exhausted after busy days of exploring and slept perfectly fine. Beds were comfortable. Instead of twin beds as requested we got a double bed and bunk beds so that was perfect. Flat TV with lots of channels including ABCkids was a big plus. Everything was clean. Staff was very friendly and let us leave the luggage in a store room for a few hours on the day of our departure. If we are going to Sydney ever again I would definitely consider this place.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_388656236~“Basic but Clean & Convenient B & B”~Perfectly alright if all you want is a bed & shower within a 5 minute walk of Darling Harbour for about $140 a night.  Pros: Clean, economical, spare blankets, electric heater & aircon (didn't use or try). Double bed & bunkbed, fridge, kettle, tea & coffee, large TV, own key to front door, laundry & iron available, storage of luggage (@ own risk) after check out. Free Wifi. Inexpensive breakfasts available.  Cons: No storage space for clothing, no shelving or storage space in bathroom, no soap holder in shower, toilet seat unsecured,  ** not all room &/or front door keys work -ESSENTIAL you CHECK them ON ARRIVAL as there is a $50 call out fee for any 'non emergency' assistance after 10pm !! Note to All Smokers:  Apart from the courtyard, this is a strictly non smoking hotel.  You could well be fined for a brigade response to a smoke alarm!!  HenryK55 ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_387558163~“Dissapointed”~Stayed here for 3 nights pre cruise. We were here a few years ago, so decided to book again. Location is brilliant, price was right. We had an ensuite room that backed onto the main road, that was the first mistake. The room was good, bed was comfy, besides finding an empty lube container under the bed which was a bit gross. However the noise from the road, people going by, cars stopping at the traffic lights, was ongoing until the wee hours of the morning, which made sleep quality very poor.  I don't know if the other rooms had this problem, but we will probably go elsewhere next time we're in Sydney. It's a shame though as the location & price are perfect.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383543790~“Great value”~Value accommodation close to Darling Harbour. Price was sensational, expected a dump, pleasantly surprised. Not the Ritz, but comfortable, clean, friendly, helpful staff, fantastic location 5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour - loved it!~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_383152939~“It was fine”~We ended up staying there for 2 nights. Originally we had booked for 4 nights, but had to change the plans. We changed it about a week or 2 before we were meant to check-in and received a full refund. Customer Service was good, we checked in with no issues. Keep in mind, they do not help with luggage. We were on the top floor and carrying around our 6 weeks stay worth of luggage. Bed wasn't very comfortable and we had no air condition. However, the washrooms were very clean and I never had to wait in line, even though it appeared that the hotel was quite full. The location of the hotel is fantastic. We walked almost everywhere, even to the Rocks. So all in all, a good stay, but if I go back to Sydney, I think I would try and find another hotel. Especially if I'm staying for longer than 2 nights. Also, for anyone that needs a lift to the airport, try and avoid booking with their contracted shuttle. They were terrible. Over 2 hours late to pick us up, rude driver and waaay too bumpy of a drive. Take a cab instead, if you're 2 people or more, it will cost you about the same anyways.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_380095928~“I liked it”~From the street it's a very drab and sad looking building. Reception girl was pleasant and helpful. Room was very old with very high ceilings but comfortable enough and the bed was super comfy. Bathroom was really old and in need of an update but clean. Location was great just 1 minute to the light rail and very close to Darling Harbour. All up a good stay!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_373534669~“Thumbs up”~It was my second holiday trip to Sydney during transit back to Malaysia. The hotel is located on Allen Street just at the back of (landmark) Ibis and Novotel Hotels. Initially it was difficult for me to locate it since I don't have a map but once I got the bearing correctly, it is quite easy to reach either via St James or Grand Central stations. Located near the Darling Harbour, my 2 days trip were packed with activities. The nearest tram station located just 3 minutes walk from the Hotel while 10 to 15 minutes walk required to the nearest MRT stations. However with all the attractions along the way to the station, you would not even realized the distance. Reception was warm, friendly and smooth. I found the lovely staffs were helpful and full of smile, keep it up. I've booked a single bed bedroom but been upgraded to shared bedroom with four beds dedicated just for me, what else could I asked? The room was neat, clean and well maintained. It equipped with flat screen TV, sink and fridge which was nice if you travel in group. Not so roomy but I found it comfortable enough for me to pray and do light stretching every morning. FREE WiFi available in-room and the speed was awesome. Shared shower room and toilet located just at the corner of the room. Both the shower room and toilet were very clean and comfortable. Unlike the shower room, you may not find signage for the toilet but the trick is, if the door has no label on it, then it is a toilet. A la carte continental breakfast available upon order at a reasonable price of AUS7. In a nut shell, thumbs up Woolworkers Hotel and I'll definitely come back on my future trip.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_370538249~“Average price average stay”~Stayed here recently for 1 night in an ensuite room at the front of the hotel. Reception staff were welcoming and friendly A little noisy during the night from passers by and traffic Single beds that were too hard for me but I have slept on worse. Wife was not happy about the sleeping arrangements. Shower had no where to put the soap and hot water took a while to kick in The room itself was clean and relatively modernised while retaining its old age charm with high ceilings. Sparsely furnished with not much hanging space for clothes. Noisy air conditioner,TV worked fine. Location is pretty good for Darling Harbour or the Star Casino. Also has a few pubs within walking distance if that is your thing.  Reasonable price but I Doubt that I will stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_366802915~“excellent location, friendly staff, clean n cheap.”~Stayed here for 1 night to see the Batman v Superman movie at midnight! This hotel suited me perfectly, as its very reasonably priced, and located walking distance to IMAX theatre. I felt safe walking back even at 2:45AM!  1. check in - staff was polite, efficient, whole check in process was seamless. lobby was clean n welcoming. 2. room - room was pretty good for a budget hotel. its facing an elevated road with busy traffic. didnt really hear the traffic noise. and not that hot. even with window / curtain close. there is a fan but didnt use it. ask for higher floor if you really think the road is a problem. but higher floor means dragging your bag up flights of stairs.  facilities like sink, kettle, flat screen tv with remote FREE WIFI in room! are included.  3. bathroom - bathroom is outside / shared. there are plenty though, no waiting. one every 2-3 rooms. one was newly renovated and look modern. but the rest are very OLD and dated they really should do renovation on ALL bathroom to offer guest consistent level of comfort. its spacious & clean.  4. dining room - very large dining room with coffee/tea / TV lots of seats. pretty good. 5. the back garden was a hidden treasure! most hotels dont have a secret garden! very pleasant!  6. location - excellent. walking distance to light rail stop. to darling harbour shops. to the Star & huge Coles supermarket. to imax theater. LOTS of eateries on Harris St. nearby. 7. check out - again, great friendly staff. efficient. offered free luggage storage.  Overall, very happy stay.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_354457719~“Good”~Decent and good positioning for money. Not very comfortable for warm weather stays though (no aircon or ceiling fans) but you are provided with a portable fan, still got quite hot though and bad road noise when window was open. Would stay again but in the cooler months.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352727847~“Ideal overnight stay”~As a mature couple we found this hotel to be an ideal overnight stay. For the price the room and bathroom were fine but somewhat dated. The bed was very comfortable. The location suited us fine although not a lot of shops close by.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_352255775~“good location and nice private rooms”~POSITIVES: good location in darling harbour, close to ferry to circular quay. Coles nearby. Was cheaper than hostels! Clean room with sink and fridge (very useful!) and friendly staff.  NEGATIVES: no aircon and only tiny fan in our room, so uncomfortably hot at night (we visited in February). Road outside noisy so not ideal for having open windows. Bathroom cleaned daily but sadly dirty if you didn't get in there first.  Would stay again :). Great for backpackers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_347261234~“Average quality, decent price”~It's certainly no five-star resort, but if you're just dropping by in Sydney for something, it's decent accommodation for an affordable price. Breakfast cooked at the hotel, the single beds are very comfortable, modern bathrooms in backpacker-style accommodation. Only very small rooms, but certainly not uncomfortable.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_347018056~“Beds shonky, no lift, no aircon, shabby rooms”~Bunks cheap, nasty and noisy. King bed concaved. No aircon. Had to carry our 30kgs suitcases up 3 flights of narrow stairs. Room feels more like a backpackers accommodation, dirty. Bathroom, modern but average. Called Novotel across rd after we checked in here got quoted same price.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_337659538~“Acceptable”~Marginally clean. Very helpful staff. Excellent location (find access to Darling Hrbr through Novotel parkade). No elevator or luggage trolly. Realize extra charges apply for each child. Coffee shop, convenience store and bus stop a very short walk. Our room had a small fridge and there is one set of coin operated laundry. Room had lots of space for us and our three kids.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_327909740~“Squeaky bunks makes light sleep”~The bunk beds for the kids squeaked all night keeping us awake, the staff did nothing for us. The breakfast was ok, and the location good. The value for money is questionable, as they rely on the location to be their value proposition.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_323488195~“Well-managed, understated and all embracing”~I was skeptical of the "shared bathrooms" but could not find an alternative within my budget. I was very pleasantly surprised at the clean bathrooms and quiet of this hotel which seems to have dorms and family rooms as well. owever one drawback of my room #11 was that there was no chair and no pegs to hang clothes (no closet either) so that everything is either in the suitcase or dumpedon the bed - where you have to sit and sleep….not really a problem but how difficult can it be to hang a row of pegs. There's a washing machine and dryer ($3 each) wifi, but breakfast is not included. The dining room is nicely appointed and promotes friendly exchanges with other travellers. I was comfortable enough here and glad that the Light Rail stop "Convention" was just around the corner.~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_322784923~“Check-in interrogation”~Although not forewarned on either the Otel or hotel websites, at check-in staff demanded to scan private identification (ID) details. This conflicts with the Australian Privacy Principles which require that a business should not scan or copy personal ID, if sighting it would be sufficient for the purpose it is required. It is up to the business to explain why sighting ID is insufficient. As they were unable to do so, staff finally relented to just sighting this time. The booking was prepaid and held by credit card.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~3~nan
review_314942723~“Awesome Location”~This place is just spot on for somewhere if you just want a bed and a shower in a fantastic location. The rooms are old but comfortable and clean and the showers and amenities are plentiful. We have stayed there twice now and if you are after a no frills place to stay for a great price, this place is spot on...and free wifi to boot~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_308847069~“Very disappointed by the evening staff.”~A distinct lack of courtesy by the evening staff (male). Did not come to the door for quite awhile.  Did not inform me that the rooms did not have bathroom facilities and the sink in the room had only cold water. I had to go up 3 flights of stairs which is fine but be aware.

review_307651200~“Economical and comfortable”~This is your typical b&b. Low key but comfy. The bathrooms are shared but there are plenty of them.

review_303505250~“Woolbrokers 'Hostel'”~There are shared bathrooms on each level which can be maintained to be decent, aren't really so especially at the end of the day.  The room we had was moderate with a queen sized bed and 2 bunk beds, even though they weren't needed. The heater was slow when it came to heating the room.  The pro about this Hotel is the location, being a walking distance from Darling Harbour.~2~nan~3~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_299391479~“An economical place to stay in Darling Harbour”~This hotel is a perfectly adequate place to stay if you want to be near Darling Harbour and the Sta,r and don't want to pay Sydney hotel prices. It's just a few blocks from everything at Darling Harbour and the double en suite room was spacious, with thick walls and high ceilings. The king bed was very comfortable,and the room was quiet except for the occasional loud car outside. We slept very well.  I would have given it a rating of 4 if the shower and toilet hadn't knocked a point off. The shower was little better than a trickle, and veered from hot to cold and back in a fashion guaranteed to have you yelping and hopping. And the toilet mostly flushed, given time and effort.  If you are not expecting better than a standard (older) motel room you won't be disappointed, and will save yourself the cost of a very nice dinner.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_294255820~“Thank you!!”~I will certainly reccomend to others and stay here again. Staff were terrific, I had many questions as never had traveled to Sydney, they answered everyone, even giving me more and more information. As a family of seven, having five children, rules us out of most accomadition. This place was clean, tidy, spacious. It was affordable, great location to sight see, easy travel to and from airport, but most importantly, let us have our nights away under the same roof and enjoy it as a family.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_275695514~“Never Ever again”~I get that it was cheap accommodation, but it did not present value for money, the room was very stuffy, The beds were awful, the mattress on the single bed was either 1/2 foam mattress & 1/2 innerspring or in need of replacement and the mattresses on the bunk beds were worse, and beds constantly creaked when sat on. The toilets were revolting (1 bathmat/hand towel for all users), the showers are in need of repairs (multiple tiles loose presenting a safety risk for all users) and only 1 bathmat for all users. Very dirty showers, lots of hair on the floors despite being "cleaned" that day. Will be seeking a refund, I chose to cancel the rest of my long awaited Sydney trip to go home to clean comfortable bed. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone and have told all those I have spoken to about my poor experience at this place~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_274317647~“Not for me”~In fairness, my friend booked this place for a night with 6 girlfriends (in our forties). I would not have chosen it. None of us could cope with the shared bathroom and chose to forego a shower (.deodorant and perfume does wonders!). The room had six single beds including two bunks. One sink. One TV. A heater that had a peculiar electrical smell. A fan. One hanger for clothes. One chair. Small table. The only positive things I can say are these: 1. Beds were not uncomfortable (although bunks were squeaky) 2. The room was clean (bathroom was only ok) 3. We felt safe 4. The other guests were quiet. 5. Location was good. 6. Free Wifi was offered (with a limit) I would not stay here again, but it is probably okay only if you are on a budget and not a princess like me.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
