review_479251318~“Acceptable”~I requested a quiet room on a high floor, so why was I given a room at the front of the building? The windows did not open and the A/C was noisy. I was aware of roadworks in front of the hotel which were quiet when I arrived. But at 22.30 they started and the noise went on all night. I went to reception and complained and got the usual " all rooms are full". I made a fuss next morning and was moved to a quieter room overlooking the inner courtyards. Why are single people always dumped in the worst rooms in big hotels!!! This is an old building and the rooms are smaller, but it was clean and acceptable. There was a small fridge, room safe, but no microwave. Tea/coffee were provided, but no biscuits. Wifi in your room was very expensive and I complained. Then I discovered by chance that free Wifi was available in the bar and restaurant. So I ate in the restaurant so I could use Wifi. The food was good and reasonably priced - probably the best thing about this hotel. The location is good as it is only a few minutes walk, even with a big suitcase, to Central Station. There are various eating places close by and also some shops.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_478709880~“Basic place to sleep”~First off, the hotel is undergoing ongoing renovation (don't expect to sleep later than 8) so the assessment of it may become dated more quickly than usual. The hotel is old and a bit tired. The aircon didn't work and the wi-fi was for purchase. On the good side, the location (very close to Central Train Station, Sydney) is really convenient, although that places you in a slightly stressed neighborhood. The breakfast buffet was a reasonable addition to the room reservation. There was a good selection, although the hot items were barely warm. There is value for money here, if all you're looking for is a place to lay your head (and if the room temperature is controllable).~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_477070368~“Good location for a stay in the heart of Sydney .”~Clean , if not a bit small rooms . Great location to Chinatown , literally walk out the back door and your there.

review_475487405~“Location, location, location!”~The best thing about this hotel is the location - that's it. It's a stone's throw from Central Station from where you can get to anywhere. There are other hotels which are near the station, of course but the Great Southern is at the intersection of several major roads and so it's quite easy to go around the city. The rooms are very simple, in fact the door almost brushes the bed, and from the bed to the toilet is just three steps away. So, yes, they're super small. I've stayed at another hotel in the city center which are bigger. But the Great Southern is a bit cheaper, for its location.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_475146339~“'Luxury' price tag for 'budget' quality.”~We did stay here for New Year, so prices were greatly inflated anyway, but I still think the price was horrendous for what we got. We chose this hotel for the location - about a 30 to 40 minute walk away from the New Year firework spots. The hotel is also within easy reach of a shopping centre and Asian restaurants, like noodle bars and Korean bakeries. The staff at reception were friendly and helpful. However, we paid £875 - that's British POUNDS, so about Aus $1500 - to stay here for two nights, in a dingy, mediocre room that did not have opening windows or WiFi included. The room looked like it belonged in a cheap outdated motel, not an expensive hotel in the middle of Sydney. I felt well and truly ripped off!~2~1~nan~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_474379638~“Best Location”~Best location,just 2 minute walking distance to Central Train Station and 10 minute to Hyde Park and Oxford street.Easy access to restaurants,bars and night life of Sydney.Staff were very handy and polite.Thanks to Benjamin(works in reception),I got my room when I arrived from a long flight at 10 Am so I got rest.The breakfast is good,Finally I recommend this hotel for any visitor who don`t like to get stock in traffic jam of Sydney CBD.~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

review_472826294~“OMG ”~We arrived to workmen in the reception area updating the air conditioning system. Despite having paid in full at the time of booking they asked us for a security deposit of $50 per room which I can only assume was in case of damage.  The room was extremely dated with little room for luggage or space for clothes. You almost have to enter the equally dated bathroom to pass along the bottom of the bed. This hotel is stuck in the 1920s when there was clearly no Internet as they want to charge their guests a daily rate for Internet access which is free in every bar and cafe in Sydney.  They also charge to store your luggage ( per case) between check out and departure. They charge extra for maid services. A complete joke in my opinion.  We have spent 3 weeks travelling around Australia and most hotels have provided much more for less and far more accommodating and cost-effective not to mention customer friendly. I would highly recommend avoiding this hotel when in Sydney.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472826077~“Awful hotel not a place to recommend”~Hotel not decorated since the 1920's some work in progress but would be better flattening and starting again. Desperately needs a complete overhaul from top to bottom. In this modern age where WiFi is free in most places this ancient relic wants to charge you AU$ 20 for Internet access. Which you get for free in paddys market round the corner. Would never stay here again. Total rip off for the price a room that is congested with a single person in it for a rate you can get a serviced apartment for.~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
review_472580844~“Terrible service”~My husband and I spent one night here in February 2017. We only decided to stay here as it was close to Central Station. The day we stayed was a particularly hot day (around 45 degrees celcius). We had no trouble booking in and couldn't wait to get to our room to get in to the air conditioning. As we were going to a concert that night we waited in our room while trying to cool it down with the AC before the show. Despite the fact we waited a couple of hours the room was still boiling hot, so we decided to leave. We left the air conditioner going the whole time that we were gone in the hope that the room would be cool on our return. We were devastated to find, 6 hours later that this was not the case. My husband went down to inform the front desk and it was only at this point that he was told that they were replacing all the air conditioning systems and in fact none of them worked. He was given a voucher for a free breakfast in the morning. The next morning, after a very uncomfortable night I went to the front desk and asked for a voucher for myself as well, which they were happy to give me, but warned that the buffet breakfast would be closing in 20 minutes. I said that that was fine and I only wanted a quick bite as we needed to head home. When I got to the hotel's restaurant I was turned away by a waitress who told it that it was too late to have breakfast and to 'come back tomorrow' !!!!! I informed her that we were in fact on our way home and would not be able to return the next day and that I would be quick. She went off in a huff as I refused to leave (they weren't closing for 20 MINUTES!). I grabbed as much food on my plate as I could fit and my husband did the same. No sooner as we sat down the arrogant lady started clearing out all of the food, despite the restaurant not closing for another quarter of an hour, and ensuring that we would not be getting seconds.  I am absolutely appalled by the service we had at the restaurant during breakfast, and even more so that we were not told on check in, on a 45 degree day, that the air conditioners weren't working. What a joke!!!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472521999~“Overnight visit to Sydney”~Hotel is well located - a short walk from Central Railway Station. Upgraded to a recently renovated suite on 8th floor with a view of Haymarket. Rooms were spotless and well-appointed. Shower over bath in a good sized bathroom but needs shelves. Fans and air-conditioning but with separate controls they need to be turned on individually. A little noise from outside airconditioning motors but this may be fixed after they complete their renovations. Loved the historic photos of the hotel in the public areas. Didn't eat in the hotel as we had dinner planned in Glebe. Breakfast in an excellent Korean cafe next to Thomas Street entrance. Has Wifi as hotel's is expensive~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_471890429~“3 night stay”~arrived after long flight from Dubai not expecting our rooms to be ready - but also not expecting to be charged 2 dollars per suitcase ( we had 8) for storage! The hotel is dingy and dark and also very stuffy and hot. Our rooms were very small with no space for our luggage. There was some work being carried out which meant the lift was more like a padded cell! Absolutely awful. Very disappointing for the price paid.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_471559221~“Worst hotel room I have ever stayed in..............”~How the hotel passes as a four star amazes me as I would grade it as a two. The room was absolutely awful and we had to rearrange the furniture in order to have enough space to open our suitcases, the bathroom was also pretty grim. The breakfast was okay but the room more like a cafe than a hotel dining room. I wouldn't stay there again if it was free! They even charged to look after our suitcases for a few hours after we had checked out of the room, we have NEVER had to that before.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~2~2~nan
review_470810678~“Two night stopover”~Booked for two nights at $129 (friday and saturday) per night only to find when we arrived the second night hadnt been booked.. they tried to charge us $399 for the Saturday which we bluntly refused to pay.. ended up with the original deal after 20 mins of "negotiations". Hotel under renovations and was quite comedic. Exposed cabling, air conditioning machines in reception ... even though location was great, this felt like a second rate hotel upon entering .. was surprised to see our room was clean with good clean linen. Only slept in the room as out all day sightseeing .. Next time in Sydney, may look into staying here again .. good location~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_470162806~“Good value”~The great southern hotel is a Beautiful old building situated in a very convenient spot to most of the city's attractions. We stayed here while at a work conference which was only a quick 10 minutes walk . The rooms are dated but beautifully clean and the bathroom the same . Very uncomfortable twin beds found my self rolling towards the floor as bed very sloped but that would be my only complaint . Staff very friendly and help full .

Room was ample and tucked in where no noise helped me relax for an early rise to catch the train which was situated within 10mins walking distance. If I had my time again I would stay another night.

review_467944067~“Uncomfortable!”~We stayed here one night (too many). The hotel is undergoing air conditioning upgrades, with portable aircon units in the lobby area. The reception had also been moved temporarily. There was no aircon in the room and windows sealed so they couldn't be opened. Although we put the aircon on it only blew warm air out, so very uncomfortable in the room. The room was dated and very basic with the smallest ensuite I have seen in a hotel. No shelf to put your wash things on either. The room and bed definitely need an upgrade.  It would have been good to have been forewarned about the aircon and the major roadworks on George Street, right outside the hotel. Instead they just took our non-refundable booking.  To cap it all, they wanted to charge AU$2 for each piece of luggage to be stored, so we didn't bother. Most hotels will do this for free. I have to say this is the worst hotel experience I have had.~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan

review_463934933~“Great location and value”~We chose here for a 1 night stopover because of its price and proximity to Chinatown and Darling harbour. Its also only a few minutes walk from Central station which gives you great access to all of Sydney by train and bus. The hotel obviously was an old original Sydney pub but it has been renovated beautifully. The room although not large was comfortable and quite modern looking for an old building. The only problem we had was that we were on the second floor facing a brick wall which wasn't the best view. Maybe higher floors would be better. Also the spare pillows in the cupboard were like rectangular bricks. There also needs to be more information in the rooms about the hotel including the restaurant and bar. We didn't realise there was happy hour in the hotel until we walked out in the street just as it was finishing. But we would be happy to stay here again for the location and price.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_463924085~“Undergoing refurbishment”~This place is undergoing refurbishment. Reception has been temporarily moved and there are portable air conditioning units all over the place. Our room was comfortable enough but dated. Not sure if the refurbishing will reach it though! Room air conditioning only seemed to blow air, uncooked, so sleeping was not that comfortable. En suite was a bit cramped. Perhaps remove the bath and replace with a shower. Wasn't cheap, but then nothing is in the run up to Mardi Gras!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_463385458~“Too Hot for Comfort”~Check in procedure went okay but after that, things went a bit downhill. The hotel was going through some major airconditioning and other type of renovations. The environment inside the hotel was very humid and hot. Our room while very spacious was hotter than downstairs. The air con did nothing to cool the temperatures and you couldn't open the windows for any fresh air. The room was clean although friends staying in a nearby room didn't feel comfortable using the shower with bare feet! An additional shelf or similar would of been handy in the bathroom and although a minor thing, a hand towel after washing hands would of been helpful. Our supposed queen bed was actually 2 singles pushed together which really needed new mattresses as one of the springs on the side of the bed stabbed me in the back of the leg. The staff although willing to help weren't correct in information when advising us it would take 15 minutes to walk to Darling Harbour. More like 30 minutes at a brisk pace or about 10-15 in a taxi which actually worked out quite cost effective at about $10 per trip to that area. A short 2 minute walk to nearby Market City and a great shopping centre where there were good options such as The Coffee Club for breakfast which provided a much better choice and more nutritious than the $13 breakfast option at the hotel which was almost inedible, especially in the heat. Internet was quite expensive at $22 a day if you had your own laptop and the guest laundry proved tricky as the dryer tried to chew a corner of a pair of my shorts and left a greasy mark in one area. Happy to say we got a discount on the cost of our breakfast as a result. Parking in the area is hideously expensive with a Wilson carpark nearby costing us over $40 overnight and with road works in the area and lots of one way streets it was a bit tricky to negotiate the roads. Value for money - not really, will not be planning a return visit to this hotel.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~3~nan
review_463091932~“Good base for Chinatown and the sourthern end of the city”~rooms are refurbished and better than your average motel room. Have a bar fridge and tea/coffee making. Small but not cramped our room overlooked the rooftops towards the markets. didn't eat or drink in house so no views on that but check-in was easy as was checkout.

review_463053356~“Better than you might expect”~Stayed for a couple of nights, in part because it was a reasonable price and in part because of its great location. Coming from Central Station the easy two block walk was an excellent start to a great weekend. The rooms are plain but clean. Beds are comfy and there are four good pillows. The bathroom is small but adequate. Air conditioning is a bit noisy but everything else is better than one might think for the price. Also the lifts are excellent.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462795115~“2/5 hotel ”~Central to train station and other places by taxi. Staff weren't overly friendly or welcoming. The reception had construction things everywhere with no visible signs or direction on where to go. The room shower had pink mould in it. The toilet wouldn't flush. Very closed in , couldn't open windows. Room was clean otherwise. Very spacious. Would have liked a table or bench in the bathroom. Parking was reasonable , though we parked on the Wilson parking next door. Overall 2/5, this is not a 4 star hotel. For the price and what we got , I won't be coming back.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461009294~“Great Location, Great Staff, Great Hotel”~My wife and I spent a marvelous six days in Sydney this February. We picked the Great Southern Hotel due to its location, but were a bit worried about some of reviews stating that it was under renovation. We took the plunge and were not disappointed.  When we arrived in Sydney early Monday morning after a red eye flight from Perth. We had decided to use the train from the domestic airport and purchased Opal cards to make the payment more stream lined. The train trip from the airport to Central train Station took no more than 15mins. Once outside of the station it was no more than a five minute walk to our hotel at an easy pace.  We were early and knew our room would not be ready but we had also done our research. The hotel would hold our bags for $2 each per day. Awesome value considering that shops next to the hotel were advertising prices at $4 to $6 dollars. Once the bags were stowed away, we walked to Circular Quay jumped on a ferry to Watson's Bay for Brunch ie. Fish and Chips and a beer  After we got back we checked into our room on the second floor. We had asked for a room at the back of the hotel or on a higher floor as we had read that being at the front you were suseptable to noise from the street and/or the hotel bar on the ground floor. The hotel accommodated our request for a quiet room.  From looking at pictures hanging on the walls of the reception area, the hotel in its current building has been around since the 1940's. When you enter the hotel you can see that a lot of investment is currently going on. There are renovation works going on everywhere, the most obvious are the temporary air-conditioning unit's operating until new air conditioning is being put in place. The second floor carpets were for the most part covered in plastic due to ongoing renovations.  Our room was small, but fitted our needs. If you are a person that wants to go on holiday and spend a lot of time in your room then this hotel may not be for you, if on the other hand you use your hotel as a base camp to go out and experience all that Sydney has to offer then this hotel is excellent. The room was clean, bed comfortable, TV has local and Foxtel channels and most importantly the air conditioning worked a treat. The bathroom while small had loads of hot water and was clean.  The location of the hotel makes it an excellent choice for the adventurous traveller. Want to experience China Town, your in it. Want to go to Darling Harbour, walk 15 minutes and your there, looking for a bargain at Paddys Market walk out the back of the hotel and your there. Going to the Opera, jump on a train at central and you will arrive at Circular Quay in under 10 minutes for under $2. Feel like a bite to eat at 4 in the morning go outside and there numerous 24 mini-marts open.  We also requested the morning breakfasts. They serve a buffet breakfast which has everything from cereal to an automatic pancake maker. Breakfast starts at 6.30am and in my opinion value for money.  The staff are very open and friendly. I would like mention Li and his off sider (whose name I wish I could remember) who always seemed to working on the front desk, both always had a smile on there face and a ready joke to make every one laugh.  When back in Sydney we will be using this hotel again. Not because it is particularly lavish (although I can't wait to set it after the renovations are done) but because it suited our needs, had a great location and superb staff. This is why a rated it excellent.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459865837~“Good value accommodation”~I stayed two mid-week nights in February. The hotel is classic Art Deco style, which is being maintained, thankfully. The room I had was small but adequate - furniture is dated but the bathroom was fully renovated, good air con and a ceiling fan. The hotel is undergoing renovation at present, but that doesn't seem to affect the clientele too much - I found the work crews very friendly and helpful. Great full cooked breakfast included in room price; by night the same Bistro serves great classic pub food at good prices. And after Sydney's recent heat, the cold beer was very welcome. A good base in the Haymarket area, 2-3 minute walk from Central Station.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459169346~“Comfortable historic hotel in excellent down-town location”~We came to this hotel for the New Years Eve celebrations in Sydney - there were not many hotel rooms left when we booked, but when we arrived the hotel was not particularly packed. It was within easy walking distance of most of Sydney's attractions, with plenty of chinese, malaysian and vietnamese restaurants around. Staff were very welcoming and friendly, and very helpful with local information. We were worried that the noise from the bar downstairs might be disturbing, but in fact the room was very quiet, and comfortable; unlike some other reviewers who complained the bed was too soft, we found the bed extremely comfortable. The decor and ambience of the hotel reflected its origin in the Art Deco period, and there were fascinating exhibits of some old photographic and gramophonic equipment. Some people like old, some like modern. We were very happy with the old.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_457428306~“Practical Hotel for a short stay”~We just had one nights stay in Melbourne and selected what seemed on paper to be a reasonably priced hotel. The Great Southern did not disappoint and although of an old style it had been smartened up to be good. The bathroom was quite modern and overall the room was comfortable and clean. The front desk staff were helpful. The breakfast was very good. Overall would stay there again as it was conveniently located.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456037751~“Practical, Not Fancy and Conveniently Located”~Our 4 nights at the Great Southern were enjoyable enough for us...certainly not a fancy place but the old hotel has been sufficiently modernized to provide basic necessities, room 331 was clean, comfortable but not large. We arrived before noon and were allowed early check-in at no charge! Other than sleeping, we did not spend much time in the room; we did like the location for getting to tourist sites and it was great being next to Chinatown. Hotel breakfast buffet was okay and plentiful, but there were so many Asian restaurants very close by for good eating at very reasonable prices. Yes, WIFI is pricey in the hotel so we bought a Vodafone pocket WIFI router including 4 GB data sim for about $40...Vodafone shop was just down the street. There also are some interesting pictures and exhibits in the lobby. Staff was also helpful when our airport shuttle was late and they quickly got us a taxi. While we were there in November 2016, a big transportation project was ongoing which really reduced access to the hotel on George Street (true for all businesses along that street).~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_455306550~“Cheap rip off management.”~We were there for New Year’s Eve, every hotel in the city took advantage of the business opportunity, so had very high mark ups. We expected that it that was not the issue.  This hotel has no internet for free, can you believe they want about 20 dollars a day for it, in this day and age, cheap hotels in developing countries provide free internet. I could see the embarrassment on the staffs face when I made it a point, too ashamed that their boss from India is a rip off.  The hotel provides you with amenities in the bathroom they say on their website, its one little bottle of shampoo, hand soap and the cheapest rough toilet paper, no body wash or conditioner. When we asked the staff that for charging us 800 a day for New Year’s should we not get more, we were told that we could buy it next door at the 7/11.  The thigh boss does not allow the staff to turn on the air-conditioner in the lobby and walk ways of the hotel, it’s so hot, having said that the tiny rooms are cool and have individual units. We came an hour early and our room was no ready, so we decided to grab some lunch, we asked the staff if we could leave our bags for one an half hours, again the rip off policy came into play, we were told that it will 2 dollars per piece, this is at check in, what a rip off, we paid as we did not want to drag our bags around. We would not have mind paying if we were checking out and going out for the day, but even in developing countries that is a service hotels provide to guest. The staff don’t tell you this we found out on our second day that there is free internet in the bar, its looks like it’s part of the hotel, but it’s not, you can get free internet at the front entrance if you don’t want to buy a drink. The hotel as no security in the lobby and you have street people walking (don’t get me wrong I do feel sorry for them) in to use the pay by the hour internet in the lobby, you are told look out for bags. Overall the only thing good is the staff, nice people working for a tight boss.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_455072585~“Good location and great breakfast”~This is an older hotel - 1930s style. Our room (505) had everything we needed: comfortable bed, bar fridge, good sized bathroom, safe, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, air conditioner that worked well plus ceiling fan. Our view was just rooftops etc but plenty of natural light and heavy curtains to block out light if needed.  It is close to Darling Harbour and Central Station. It's very close to Chinatown and Paddy's Market. We walked down to Circular Quay and stopped off at Queen Victoria Arcade on the way.  We had breakfast included and it was worth it! There's a wide variety of choices, including a juicer where you can make your own fresh juice.  You can arrange late checkout for $10 an hour extra up to 1pm. They will store your luggage for $2 a bag. The bar downstairs has amazing meals for a reasonable price.  All in all it's a great place to stay in Sydney. We've stayed there twice and will return next time we visit Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454449743~“Convenient and quiet in the heart of the city”~The Great Southern is situated close to Sydney's Central Station. It is an older hotel although has all necessities. We booked a standard queen room which was small but quiet.The bathroom was small but adequate. On checking in we asked for late check out which they agreed to. Usually a charge of $10 an hour is added but they did not charge us. Our friends were up graded to a larger room with a strange balcony - closed in with no view. However it would have been good to have the extra room. This hotel is ideal if you are going anywhere in the city.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

I would stay again simply because of the location & price~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_453240265~“Cozy, Close to a lot of areas in Sydney”~It was a small queen size bedroom, but perfect for couples with no children to travel with.  Shower was small as well as the bathroom. TV is on a wall, shows some foxtel channels as well, mostly has captions, but if you can ignore captions then TV viewing is good, There is no way that I found to get rid of the captions. The window viewing isn't much for what I got. There is also a small desk and chair, which is quite squished between the bed and not much walking space around the bed area. Also 2 beside tables on each side. And a Wardrobe with a ironing board and iron and a safe. I found it very good to sleep in for 3 nights. A very retro hotel, has some history to it. But it was perfect for a couple going away for a couple of days.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_453130670~“Small and expensive rooms”~We got a very small double room with a very small queensizebed and a very very small bathroom. After one night we asked for a room with two singel beds and got an upgrade to a very nice familyroom. Central location but would not return.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450636308~“I wouldn't mind if it wasn't so dirty. And a rip-off.”~We stayed in room 410, looking out into three walls of windows, not that I care about the view, just that it was one more thing we didn't pay for with no compensating trade-off.  I also don't mind that it was too small for the two of us to open our suitcases anywhere than on the bed because the useless behemoth of a wardrobe was stuffed with a giant safe and a suitcase rack wedged in cross-wise. Not sure where we would have put that rack even if we could have opened it. There was a small desk with a chair we couldn't sit in because it's too close to the bed.  Whatever. What we really didn't like was how dirty it was. And since we paid Sydney prices for the room, paid $22 extra per night for wifi and $2 to hold our bags on checkout day, you'd think that there'd be enough money to pay the cleaning staff to vacuum under the bed, or clean the bathroom sufficiently so there weren't insects flying around. The location is fine, it's easy to get to, just be aware there's a fair number of "for adult eyes only" emporiums in the area, and a lot of Thai massage places that may or may not be legit.  If you want to dirt bag it, stay at the YHA across the street. If you want a hotel, even a cheap hotel, don't waste your money here.~2~nan~nan~nan~1~1~3~nan
review_450294671~“Great location and very good value”~I was hesitant about booking given some of the reviews but as a regular visitor from Canberra, via Murray's bus which leaves from Central Station, thought I would give it a go. I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed with the room, particularly as it was and had been a sweltering 36deg for a few days in Sydney. The air-conditioning was excellent, the room was huge, clean and very very comfortable, with a modern bathroom. Staff were helpful and friendly and I liked the character of the old hotel. Thanks to the Trip Advisors that warned about being close to the lift and rooms that were dark and dingy. I did ask for a room away from the lift with external daylight! Based on my first experience I'll be staying there again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_450099153~“Good value and good location”~We found the Great Southern Hotel online and choose it for the price/value and location. On both marks, it met our expectations. This hotel is one block from the Central station, you can also hike to the harbor - its perhaps 1.6K but enjoyable. Room was small and Spartan with very small bathroom. Not a lot of furniture...but we mainly were looking for just a bed. Like many overseas hotels, every outlet has a switch, so they don't air condition an empty room. Everything was clean. Our room had a mini-refrig and flatscreen with a dozen cable channels. The room included a breakfast which I highly recommend - over a dozen hot items, lots of fruit, yogurts, and multiple newspapers. We also caught the dinner special offered by the pub type bar which was a good value and excellant. Staff was helpful on giving us local tips. While this is an old hotel, we actually like something with character over boring glass and concrete slabs. They could do better on their internet policies and prices!~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450061950~“Good location, high price”~Hotel is easy walking distance to darling harbour and shopping centres and central station. Proximity to central station makes it easy to travel around the city. Advertised as a 4 star but lacks the basic amenities I would expect from a 4 star, you have to pay extra for wifi, acess to the in room safe and breakfast -all of these are considerably costly. Staff at the hotel were very helpful and reception gave a lot of useful information. Sheets are dirty when we arrived, these were swapped when asked. Room had a strong pungent smell the whole time we were there and we couldn't change the temperature of the ac.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450024864~“Not great value”~Although clean, the place is quite dated and feels old and stale. The wifi is paid and quite expensive. It's large hotel with many floors and no real character. Functional at best and not great value. There are nicer places nearby for similar or cheaper price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449762204~“Find yourself better place to stay”~Old. Outdated. Stuck in 70's. It feels run down. No A/C in the foyer, just some portable units; the smell was stale not fresh.  Room had musty odour about it; couldn't open a window to let some fresh air in.  A/C in the room was set to 20 degrees, which was way too warm. Furniture was old, with scratches.  Moved my bedside table to plug in the phone and it was dust galore there.  $22 per day for internet (Nuts!)  I would think twice before walking around bare foot on the carpet or in the bathroom.  We have arrived at the Hotel on the 1st of Jan, and our room wasn't cleaned for the next 2 days ( on public holidays rooms don't get cleaned).  Our room never got vacuumed, at least the towels were clean. On the last day I used Internet in the lobby to print my boarding passes and the computer was slow and unresponsive.  I booked this Hotel because of it's 4 star rating. Not sure who gave this hotel 4 stars but I wouldn't give more than 2.  The only positive thing about this Hotel is the location.  However, there so many Hotels within minutes from each other, so please go and look for something a little bit more decent and not so expensive.~2~nan~5~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_448752426~“Needs a lot of updating ”~We booked in for NYE. The weekend was hot and the hotel lobby had a hired acon unit in the lobby. That should have been a dead giveaway. Everything is dated in this hotel...and not in a quaint 'old style' way. It's just old and run down.  Got up to our room and it must have been 35 degrees!! Turned the acon on and set it for 20. We got in late so it was time for bed. We were so hot and sticky from traveling and just wanted to go to bed but the room never cooled down. After several complaints to the front desk over our 3 night stay...it never did get fixed. Fortunately the weather wasn't so hot.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448646255~“Over priced”~Great location. In Haymarket , very outdated stale smell in rooms , overpriced for next to no ammenities , check around other hotels similar price for more updated ammenities close to central train station , 15 minute walk to harbour bridge~2~nan~nan~3~2~nan~2~nan
