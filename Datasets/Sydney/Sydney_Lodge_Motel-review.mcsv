review_470989217~“Good location, good price, good room”~We have stayed here on numerous occasions over the years. We have no problems at all with the rooms and their amenities for the price, if you want fancy drapes, carpets and a bigger room, then simply go elsewhere and pay more money. For our purposes when we visit, it's a very good price within easy walking distance to the city and surrounds. The rooms have always been clean, and there's a microwave if needed, plus the continental brekkie on offer fills your tummy fine. The parking can be a squeeze if you have a large car, but it is included, unlike many other more expensive places that do not offer parking or you pay extra for. The staff have always been very friendly and helpful. It's a lovely stroll through parks and streets to the city and close to Surry Hills and Kings Cross. What you get for your money you can't complain. If you want fancier trimmings, a bigger room, a big car space, better breakfast then stay elsewhere and pay a heap more money.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470803124~“Belies some reviews”~I needed a cheaper place to stay and chose the Lodge for a number of reasons, not the least it's very good room rate and continental breakfast. Having read a few reviews I was a little nervous, but need not have worried, The room I had on the first floor at the back was clean, well fitted, had a nice view over the garden and reasonable quality inclusions, toiletries etc., The only problem was the parking, perhaps what they have is suitable for some vehicles but it did not fit my Landcruiser, so I was forced to take my chances in the streets. Not that it was a problem as long as you were arriving late or leaving early. On two nights I arrived at the peak hours end and decided that it was not worth my life to park out front, although it was allowed by the signs, but the street was occupied by bumper to bumper, kerb to kerb commuter cars and to block a lane would have led to a riot or worse. I needed to get some washing done, but the Lodge Laundry was out of order, however a local Dry Cleaners did a bag wash, but the Lodge only provided an ironing room, not an in room iron. This room was miniscule and the Iron was on a button timer switch which only responded to percussive maintenance (you had to bash it). I understand that renovations are underway and would recommend to the management that an in room iron would be a great extra service. WIth a few shortcomings, I would still recommend the Lodge as a good, affordable accommodation close to the city and sailing.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_470713726~“Conveniently located to train and ferry transport”~This motel is on a busy road but relatively good value if you just want somewhere to sleep. Our room was quite small with a double bed but very quiet throughout the night as we were located towards the back of the facility. Unfortunately there were some renovations happening while we were there so were woken up each morning with hammering or drilling. It's walking distance to the train station which is only a couple of stations away from the heart of town. Also a short walk to lovely Double Bay eateries and a short drive to Bondi beach.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_466644132~“Not good but not too bad”~Location is great, central to a lot of great places to visit, cheap with a standard breakfast included of cornflakes, 2 slices of white bread and a slice of fruitloaf each. Jams, milk and juice. Rules everywhere (which I respect rules) but they are certainly rubbed in with threats of additional charges if breached. A lot of renovation happening, although needed I feel I should have been advised prior to booking the accommodation. Staff were friendly and rooms were fairly clean but certainly do need new carpets and the renovation that appears to be happening. When comparing price v quality it wasn't be any means a bad stay, you do get what you pay for! Good luck with the renovations, as I said great location so modernizing should enhance the experience.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Location is excellent for City or Eastern suburbs. Across road from Station and shopping centre. Room was clean, towels and sheets nice and of good quality. The bathroom was clean with a good shower and hairdryer. Breakfast was supplied in the fridge, fruit bread and plain bread to toast, with butter and jams. Cereals were supplied and milk and OJ. Only issue was that the second day the breakfast wasnt supplied for 2 people only for 1 person, we asked but there was obviously some confusion.

review_458300325~“Inexpensive, plain, unremarkable rooms, no night reception”~Our arrival was the worst possible. We didnt know the reception is closed at night and there was an Asian man who started shouting at us and was angry that we arrived too late. First he claimed that we have to go somewhere else to find a hotel. Then he claimed EXTRA 20 AUD from us for giving the keys to our two rooms at night and still he kept on shouting at us. We were quite astonished and annoyed but we paid and got the keys.  Later we found out in the e-mail that the reception woman had sent us instructions how to get the key at night.  First we got a room with pungent chemical smell, like fresh glue or smthg. Next day we got the room changed. Motel locates under long downhill, maybe 300 m from underground station.  Kitchenette is poorly equipped but you are able to cook tea there but not for cooking food. There is fitted carpet on the floor, not good for allergic people. In the shower there is no handheld shower, only shower up in the wall and no bidé shower.  Motel was peaceful at night and the traffic didn't bother.  For budget travellers this is good alternative.~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

We could walk into the city, or take the bus or train (Edgecliff station is across the road). There is also Coles, a liquor store and Aldi just across the road,. Wi-Fi is $1 per hour.

review_360874805~“Basic facilities..Stay there if you are travelling on a budget and have not much choice”~I stayed here for 4 nights in March 2016. the motel is 5 minutes walk from the Edgecliff station. If you are in Sydney for tourism, you ideally want to be closer to the city, preferably near Central or Museum station (or on that train line). This is a very basic motel - really small rooms, mediocre linen, no wifi connectivity in higher floors. You have to pay and access wifi only in the lobby. They provide some juices and cornflakes (or similar) with milk for breakfast. I had to stay here, out of no choice, as i was i Sydney at a very busy time and all hotels were sold out. Given a choice, I would not stay here. However, this is not a terrible place and is tolerable for 1-2 night stay, with reasonably good access to CBD. This place has a micro oven oven and some utensils to cook and clean washrooms.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_360839463~“Basic cleanliness expected - not received ”~This room was $140 per night. I realise that is the low end of the Sydney market but this place is hideous and I suspect does not have many return customers.  See photos re cleanliness. Beware there are no staff on site after 11pm. I must admit I felt unsafe on check in. The man at the front desk was polite but not discreet . As I was checking in another guest came down and asked for another key as he had locked his in his room ( he was a bit aggressive and strange) - anyway the reception guy had him wait while he checked me in - checking details with me loudly - "double room, 1 person, room 306" .  I realise it is budget accommodation but it is filthy. The rooms are large enough but very grotty.TV remote filthy and also mirror in main area had dirty splashes all over it. This is not about maintenance but BASIC daily room servicing hygiene.  Never again. Air b n b would have been much better.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_360584566~“Ok”~Chose this place because of price and proximity to the SCG.  Upon walking into the room, there was a strange smell. Not sure what. First impression was it was spacious, but showing its age.  Beds were comfortable Bathroom was clean Although on a major road, there was virtually no traffic noise.  (There was a repetitive dull thumping noise coming from somewhere though) The included breakfast was a packet of cereal.  It suited our requirements, but nothing outstanding.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356928687~“Never again”~It's true what people say: You pay cheap...you get cheap ($140pn). I will never go back to this hotel again. * We where given a room in the carpark! * Worst carpark ever to try and park a car. I ended parking in a side street. * Shower / toilet had walls and ceiling covered in mould. * No extraction fan. * Little window in shower had no fly screen...thus our room was a haven for mozzies which kept us up at night. * The little fridge was chucking a fit on regular basis. * Walls dirty. * WiFi costs $5 for 24 hours but it is very slow and kept booting me off.~2~3~nan~nan~1~nan~2~nan
review_347741413~“Cheap”~It's close to public transport. Family room is tiny. Breakfast is cold cereal and milk both in your room to eat when you want. The left bread in the fridge too for toast but not sure it was trustable. WiFi is weak and expensive. It's not close to tourist sites.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_329612388~“Good value”~We stayed for a Friday and Saturday night and paid $130 a night. That included breakfast and car parking. Breakfast was toast, cereal and juice provided in the room and you wouldn't fit anything bigger than a small SUV in the car park as it is quite low. Our room got serviced each day which included new towels, the fridge restocked and general clean. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The location of the motel is a 5 minute walk to kings cross, it is on a main road so there is a it of street noise. The rooms are dated but clean and functional. If you are looking for somewhere basic to stay in a good location and you aren't expecting anything too fancy you this place will be fine.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_319267135~“DISGUSTING”~Known also as the Edgecliff Motel ... DON'T be fooled, this place is nothing short of DISGUSTING ...... I checked in for a two day stay only to discover after a horrendous effort to park the car, a room that was so dated, worn and stunk of effluent! With a bed that I don't think the mattress has EVER been replaced (had huge dips etc) that was so foul there was NO way I would sleep in it for a fear of bed bugs, cockroaches etc so I didn't even unpack, I grabbed my bags and left, they have made money from me .. A lesson I have learnt from but we moved on. Run by very limited English speaking people so money over quality says it all!  Needs to be almost condemned! God help those guests I'f there was a fire!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_307345926~“Good value, close to city and public transport”~The location was great! Close to the river, public transport, basic food needs, and only a short distance from the city by train. The room was a bit small, and basic (but what do you expect in inner Sydney for $110 a night)), but the bed was comfortable, the room clean, and the price included a contential breakfast each morning. Some of the rooms could be a bit noisy I suspect. However I asked for a back room, which seemed fairly quiet, even on a Saturday night. I would stay here again~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_272444199~“ Cheap Accommodation”~Have stayed here twice now to attend family functions in the area. Cheap compared to other accommodation in the area. Small rooms and continental breakfast included with stay. Clean and comfortable with off street parking for smaller vehicles. Fortunately we got parking on the street in front of the motel as our 4 wheel drive would have hit the overhead beams at 1.8 metre clearance.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_223062398~“Proof that you get what you pay for”~Hubby and I stayed here for the weekend to attend a conference in the city. BIG mistake ! The room smelt of mildew. There was mold on the walls of the bathroom. Our towels were not changed daily. They did have washing machines, dryers and an ironing area upstairs which was a godsend. They stocked the fridge and cuboards with breakfast foods and drinks which was included in the rate although we ate out of the motel as the smell was so off putting. When we returned home the clothes in our suitcase smelt of the hotel. We will NEVER stay here again BUT if your looking for an affordable place close to the city, you're not too fussed with the condition of the room with breakfast included this is the place for you.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_194031383~“Value for money paid”~The room was adequate, had double bed, wardrobe, drawers, beside cabinet, small dining table and chairs, tv etc... en-suite shower, and kitchenette. Fridge was stocked with milk, juice and breads. Had toaster, kettle, cutlery and crockery. All was clean. The bed was comfortable. The air con was working. We managed to park in the basement parking area - very tight fit but luckily we had a small rental car. It was totally fine for our needs as only wanted a place to put our suitcases during the day and our heads on a pillow at night. Not too hard to get into centre either by bus, train or car as station and bus stops are very close by. The very shiny pink curtains made us laugh... Would recommend if travellers didn't want fancy frills.~4~4~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_191043182~“OK hotel but be warned...”~Relatively cheap hotel in heart of pack backer territory. Had tiniest room ever, only just fit bed and suitcases, but clean and comfortable. Reception area includes kitchen facilities to make you own cereal and drinks. Be warned Kings Cross, Sydney, is sleazy part of town with hookers, strip joints side by side with bars and back packer hostels. Felt safe but shocked as first experience after twenty four flight. Easy base.~3~3~3~4~2~4~2~nan
review_172496321~“Value for money in the city”~We booked a family room here for one night as my brother was running in the City to Surf fun run. It is on the route just before the 2km marker and close to Edgecliff train station so easy to get back to the city for the start and return from Bondi. Our room had a separate bedroom with a double bed where my parents slept, a double bunk at the entrance where my son and I slept and a sofa bed my brother slept on. A tv in the bedroom and another in the main room. There was also a round table and 4 chairs. A great bonus is the kitchenette with microwave, fridge, toaster etc and breakfast supplied. There was 3 pieces of bread per person including one raisin toast, 5 assorted mini boxes of cereal, 5 fruit juice bottles, 5 x 300ml fresh milk cartons plus a bowl full of jams/butter and UHT milk/tea/coffee. The road was closed for the race so can't comment on traffic noise as we were only there one night. Lovely park just down the hill on Rushcutters Bay with a marina, playground and cafe and the pub/restaurant next to the Vibe hotel had fabulous dinners (we had beautiful steak, fish and chips and a chicken parmiagani). There is a small carpark underneath but suspect it is first in first served and we didn't need to use it.~5~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_138622473~“Excellent value motel; great for budget-conscious traveller.”~The double rooms consist of a bed, lounge, table and chairs and a desk. On a busy main road but traffic noise is not a big problem. Noisy guests could be a problem but not encountered on my visits. About 100 metres downhill from the motel, on the other side of the road is a bus shelter. Frequent bus services from there go past Hyde Park and terminate at Circular Quay. It's 10-20 mins to Circular Quay, dependant on traffic conditions. The Edgecliff Railway Station is 200 metres up the hill. Frequent trains get to Martin Place in 5 minutes and Central Station in 10. Each side of the railway station is a food court and supermarket, where food can be purchased cheaply. The motel rooms have a toaster, kettle and microwave oven, making them a good option for the budget-conscious traveller. Have stayed there twice and will stay again.~4~5~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_91361728~“Comfy, clean, safe”~I stayed here over the New Year period. I was concerned about the noise from the traffic but I got to my room (first floor, closest to road) and could not hear the traffic. The only sound I could hear was from the other occupants in the hall. Yes, the rooms are small and basic but this is NOT the Hilton. You should know that before staying here, there are photos on their website of the rooms. The staff very very friendly and quick to fix things such as the broken hairdryer in my friends room. The motel has internet for $3 an hour, room key drop off box for after hours departure. The train station is only 5 minutes walk and bus stop into the city just across the road. A few doors up is a cute little Italian place called Jerry's Place, the food and gelato is amazing and they do free deliveries over $20. Aldi and Coles are just up the road too. The bed was comfy, the water pressure in the shower great as is the air con. The tv is an LCD screen. This place is cheap and cheerful and very convenient at just 3 kms outside the CBD. I would definitely stay here again.~3~5~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_82129043~“Worst Accom i have ever stayed at”~Walking in to a rude guy on front desk we went up to our room or shall i call it a box? the door was open as house cleaning must have just cleaned it i am guessing as they were on the floor doing other rooms.... Our room was far from clean As we entered we shut the door to find tissues on the floor followed by someones shoes none of ours dont know how long they have been sitting there either...went to sit at the table and their was blood on the table then sat on bottom bunk and copped a broken spring to the bum ... Very very noisy could hear every guest that was staying there atm.... Would never stay here again for what we paid i have stayed in alot nicer places in sydney (crowne plaza Darling harbour and swiss grand @ bondi) and paid less than i did here very very disappointed ..~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan

review_13416411~“Lodge Motel is my usual Sydney accommodation”~I live in Canberra and in 2008 will be attending many operas so The Edgecliff Lodge Motel will become my regular weekend retreat for my visits. I've stayed at this motel four times so far. Its accessibility within a few kms from the M5 exit allows me to be checked in after a 3 - 31/2 hour drive. There's free undercover parking on a 1st come basis or unlimited free street parking at weekends. The simple breakfast provided is cereal, 3 slices white bread, fresh milk, OJ, tea & coffee bags & the kitchenette is perfect for my needs with a fridge. There's an excellent Italian pizza place a few doors up the hill towards Edgecliffe underground rail station. The station complex has a large range of shops: coffee lounges, delis, a supermarket, ATMs, fresh fruit store, bakery, wine & beer outlet. You'll find the room air conditioning useful to slightly muffle the car sounds from the very busy New South Head Road, a small price to pay for easy access to public transport or simply hail a taxi. It's a budget place but its location is what I want.~4~4~3~nan~3~3~4~4
review_8115871~“Good Deal, Great Value”~The Edgecliff motel, also known as the Lodge Motel is a lovely budget accomodation located just off Rushcutter's Bay on the main New South Head Road. We were travelling with a 3 year old and it was our first trip to Sydney Australia and I must say it was just really wonderful. We stayed for a week. The hotel is a no frills, budget accomodation, very freindly and very safe, located in the posh Edgecliff suburb and just walking distance from the Edgecliff train station. We stayed in a double bedroom for AUD70 a night (for the entire room and not per person which is great). And you get some good cold breakfast as well. The room was well equipped with a fridge, microwave, hairdryer, television and ensuite bath. All for only AUD70.  Another conveinance is the bus right at the doorstep. Add to that a wonderful Indian restaurant up the road and you couldn't ask for more if you're on a shoestring budget. Infact, you can buy a city rail ticket for AUD 33.00 which gives you unlimited travel on the city's buses, trains and ferries for a week. You can get in the airport station itself and then take the train to Edgecliff and then just walk down the New South Head Road to the motel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
