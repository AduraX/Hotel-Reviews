review_477738140~“I hate to rain on the parade but....NOISY ”~A hotel is fundamentally a place to sleep. We all agree on this. I have never reviewed worse than 3 stars. Given its name I checked the trip advisor reviews and not one spoke to a noise issue. I am currently in room 101, the two bedroom "family suite", nice and not cheap but, it's 2am and the thumping music and running water coming down the pipes from above is a nightmare. (no reviewer mention of the pipes eithet). My wife has taken a sleeping pill and my daughter put her headphones on. It seems to have worked for them. I have spoken to mgt and despite the usual "I will see what I can do", there's been no noise reduction and get this, the hotel CLOSES AT 4AM. I took a look downstairs and it's not even busy. Frankly I'm disgusted by Expedia's and the hotels lack of guidance on noise for the "family" suite. So here you have my guidance - AVOID if you value sleep and plan to pay good money for a bed to sleep in. Note: I got Expedia involved and the hotels solution was to move us higher up to a one bedroom apt at 1am. Nice try, I'm not sleeping on a sofa, I just want my money back and 4am to come around asap. So, NO offer of money back and these guys have the cheek to charge more if you want a slightly later check out than 10am. We're on a flight at 1pm otherwise I would definitely need a 2pm check out to catch up on sleep...but, I would get charged for it!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472580570~“Solid”~I lived in Bondi for a number of years and prefer to stay in Bondi rather than the City when I visit Sydney. We picked Hotel Bondi because there wasn't much else available. Whilst I usually stay in more luxury accomodation I was genuinely surprised with the quality of the rooms. Whilst the bed was small (a queen would have been appreciated) the room was relatively spacious and the bathroom was of a very high standard (5 star equivalent). The staff were courteous and friendly. I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467437782~“best location in Bondi Beach, very friendly and helpful staff”~We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom with huge balcony overlooking the beach. The location was so close to the beach and smack bang in the middle of bindi beach so an easy walk to North Bondi or the start of the walk along the cliffs. It's right near the new supermarket and loads of cafes. The staff were incredibly helpful.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_465409952~“A+ location”~The location of this hotel is fantastic, right across from Bondi beach. The staff was nice, and quite helpful with directions and local information, as well. I had a room with two twin beds, which opened onto a shared balcony that overlooked the ocean. The bathroom was nice and modern.  For the price ($265 AUD), I would have loved to have a larger bed and a later check out time. Check out was at 10am, and there was a fee for any later check out.  All in all, it was a decent hotel -- but location is its major selling point. It's not fancy enough inside to warrant the room prices, especially if you're going to spend all your time out on the beach!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_460249538~“Best View Of Bondi Beach”~What a find. We booked last minute so not much choice for a 3 night stay at Bondi Beach. We chose Hotel Bondi because it was central and we like to be amongst the action. So glad we did. It's an older hotel, which in itself lends great charm. If you are after something shiny and modern, then this is not your place! We stayed on the top floor in a Junior Suite with balcony and whilst the accommodation could not be classified a 4 or 5 star, the view and the balcony itself made up for it. The Hotel was close to everything we needed and we wished that we had stayed longer. Will definitely be back.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_457456728~“Clean comfortable & great location ”~We very much enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Bondi & would return.  If you are after a clean & comfortable hotel without all the glamour then this is the hotel for you.  The location perfect and right in the centre of Bondi close to cafes and across the road from the beach. It has aircon which is a must in summer!  There is a pub downstairs however we didn't have any issues the noise.  Great costumer service, they were nice enough to upgrade up to an ocean view for our second night when they weren't as busy and allow us an extra hour for late checkout complimentary.  Thank you  Sarah & Zach  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455754260~“Super location nice but pricey ”~This classic hotel has had a few renovation it's priced up there a little too high in my view for what it is. It's 4 star-ish not totally a hotel. Dont get me wrong it's clean tidy functional and awesome location. Some rooms can be noisy with road noise.  I stay here often purely for convenience not for style. it works if you get it for around the 200 mark.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454491672~“In the heart of Bondi”~Unfortunately, the overall rating is low due to the concierge behavior on the last day of my stay. When I did check in, the lady at reception was very helpful and nice - she did even allow me to change my room for a more quite one. When leaving, I had a very late flight and I did leave my luggage at reception and went on the beach after to city center. When I did return, I asked the guy at the reception if there is a place/room where I can change, but he said no and he sent me to use the toilet. The toilet was not the hotel toilet, but of the bar downstairs and positioned in the basement and not exactly clean, especially on floor! I had to leave a small empty bag for a friend top be collected later. When if I can leave it at the reception for my friend to pick it up, the same guy gave me a very annoyed look like I was handing him over a bag of unwashed underwear, accepting it with a total unpleasant grim on his face.  I think that the hotel manager should review a bit their customer service. last but not least, would be nice if they would provide breakfast as well.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~1~nan
review_453160794~“Only one night but would have stayed longer”~We stayed one night here as a stopover between flights. We had a suite ( one double bedroom and small lounge area with pull out bed). As a family of four the room worked fine as we don't mind sharing. Only small issue was that the bathroom was en-suite in the bedroom so the kids had to walk through our room to get to the bathroom. Rooms were clean and tidy. Huge balcony looking over the beach. The hotel itself is a typical Aussie pub hotel. Food and drink of a decent standard. Very helpful and friendly staff in hotel and pub. Great location for touring the area, views of the beach from the balconies and central to Bondi for the facilities. We'd definitely go back and it was a shame we only had one night. Good value for money. It's right on the main seafront road but any noise there was did not disturb us.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_452866781~“Heritage hotel with all facilities and comfort”~This hotel has great character and all modern comforts within a few minutes of the most beautiful beach and surf. We were greeted by friendly and professional staff, one was a brand new member of staff. Nothing was too much trouble. The large room was cool and quiet with a huge sitting out shared balcony onto a side street. Very comfortable bed, cool cotton sheets and a large bathroom and big shower. I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival to ask if the twin I had booked could be changed to double. The staff offered a change without any problem, but we decide to stay put. I slept a solid 8 hours! We arranged a shuttle back to the airport and stored our luggage in a locked room. The bar and bistro downstairs was good too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452766691~“Central and functional”~This hotel is adjacent the main road along Bondi Beach, as a previous reviewer stated, it's not ostentatious with upmarket 5* furniture but it's functional and clean. We stayed 2 nights on a stopover, the beds ( twin) were comfortable, the bathroom clean and spacious. There was a/c in the room and it worked! The staff were helpful and friendly. It can be a bit noisy at the front with the traffic/ motor bikes and if you're a light sleeper a room higher up and at the back would be better. The bar on the street side is great for people watching and the $15 meals on weekdays were excellent value ( chicken parmi, steak and chips, fish and chips) . There no frills, no servers, you pay up front and collect it from the servery Overall a great place to stay in Bondi, right on the action!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_451669193~“Great location ”~A very good hotel located right on the Bondi Beach facing the Surfers Club makes it one of the most well located property on the Bondi.

review_449775893~“H Bondi is what U make it! Don't try to change what it is! It is what it is....”~NO concierge, NO Italian furniture, NO problem. Live without those pleasantries on this trip. I travel around the world and have to have deep pockets for those extras. This was a 10 day holiday trip. I researched everything for nine months before I chose H Bondi. I knew it wasn't the Hyatt at the Rocks. So I learned about everything else this location could give me. The Balcony and help I got from Ven was enough to compensate me for my long stay. I could nit pik but that would have made my trip unmemorable. I will not let that happen. From the Opera to North Bondi Fish to Speedo's cafe I had the time of my life. If I don't head back to Queensland guys, you better have a room for me the next time around! timothy/Boulder,Colorado~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_447368875~“Taylor is a life saver”~We have look forward to our trip to Sydney for over 6 months and had booked an Airbnb just around the corner. Due to the Airbnb accommodation being unfit for a human, we searched hotels on Bondi and came across Hotel Bondi. Taylor looked after us as soon as we came through the door and gave us the experience we expected from Australia. Thank you to Taylor for being a lifesaver! And saving our holiday.  The hotel is the perfect location and the room is just what we need.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446797847~“Sub standard and overpriced ”~We booked a stay for a Friday and Saturday night here in November . For what we paid we could have had a modern 5 star hotel in say darling harbour. The hotel is Old and decrepit and should be pulled down. No amount of renovation can help.  The rooms are like being in a Victorian terrace and the furniture is as old. But it has no charm it's just worn out and run down. The staff are friendly enough but this if this is one of the best hotels in Bondi I suggest looking at nearby Coogee. Bondi is over rated and over priced. Avoid!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443447275~“Good location, but...”~On the positive side, an excellent location overlooking the beach and close to all the activities. However, this was also a downside. The noise levels were considerable- from the bar and party noises late at night to the cleaning and garbage lorries in the early morning. Overall, a couple of hours sleep at best. The room itself was rather dated and small considering the price we paid. Furthermore, a couple of problems- the clock was an hour behind, the cold tap didn't work (the valve was turned off), the bed moved on its wheels whenever you sat on it. All were minor inconveniences but given the expense of the room plus the extra money paid for the parking, not a cheap and restful experience.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_443001829~“Second stay - superb location”~This is still my first choice in Bondi. Great hotel, clean and fresh rooms, super friendly staff, as close to the beach as you can get and with a great bar downstairs. We will stay here again for sure!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442249476~“Great location”~The hotel has a great location opposite the beach, with great restaurants, walks, transport and shopping close by.  The kitchens were closed for renovations when we were there, but the menu looked promising if you like pub food.  The rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms new.  The only negative was that in our room you could heard the thump of the music from the hotel itself.Not loud but it wouldn't suit a sensitive sleeper who went to bed reasonably early.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_441381945~“Right at the beach!”~The rooms are comfortable but the biggest plus is location - directly across the road from the beach. Bondi restaurants are in easy walking distance and Metro and bus are available. A shuttle to the airport is available.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_440201442~“Great location, dark room”~We had a family suite which turned out to be a long, narrow and dark room. The bathroom was tiny.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_438864209~“Great Hotel location”~We stayed here in this iconic beach hotel and found it to be fabulous for access to the beach and the lively storefront areas along this promenade. We had the front junior suite on the 3rd floor and found it a little noisey in the wee hours of the morning but then we knew the pub was below us so we knew what to expect. The room was a little small for 3 adults, but was perfect for sleeping by the beach and hearing the sound of the o ocean waves. The staff are excellent, being helpful, suggestive and good people. Certainly the ownership has kept up the traditions of the family's past. Well done. I would certainly recommend this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438586535~“Excellent location for Bondi beach”~It's right in front of the Bondi beach main entrance, surrounded by restaurants, surf shops, pharmacy, etc. Rooms are a bit small and noisy. The see view is breath taking. Very kind staff that facilitates an enjoyable stay. Parking in the street is complicated, so the hotel parking is recomended but it's expensive. Restaurant for lunch and dinner within hotel facilities~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436699820~“Great Beach Front Stay in Gorgeous Bondi Beach”~Our first hotel stay in Australia, and this hotel was lovely. The location was prime. It really couldn't have gotten better for location. Right on the beach front just a skip across the road. Lots of cute shops, restaurants, bars, pubs, tattoo shops, cafe's and convenience stores along the strip near our hotel. So there was lots to do in this charming area.  The rooms were a great size. Spacious with a bedroom, bathroom and a living room area. Our room had a great view of the ocean. The hotel itself was nice. A nice open lobby with very friendly and accommodating hotel staff. Definitely a great experience on our first point in Sydney. It is a bit expensive but this was definitely due to the prime location that the hotel is situated.  Definitely worth considering when looking for a hotel beach front of the famous Bondi Beach!~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_434968455~“Beautiful weekend in Bondi”~We had a brilliant night at the Bondi hotel. Once in the room you couldn't hear the hustle and bustle of Bondi beach.

review_434152324~“Great Pub location overlooking the main road opposite Bondi beach”~A pub that is in a great location, my wife and I were looking for a pub meal, beer and wine. The outdoor beer garden pretty standard for a hotel located across from a beach. The beer was cold, the wine was good the food was average (but probably on normal par for some hotels).~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan

review_430401103~“Wonderful”~We arrived early in the morning after traveling 14 hours from San Francisco. Our check in time was hours away but when we inquired about checking in early they offered an upgrade, for a nominal charge, that was ready immediately. Our room was a 1 bedroom with a living room area and the most amazing balcony that made the stay fabulous. The upgrade was so worth it. The staff was very friendly and helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425752313~“The true Bondi”~Five years running says something. If you go all the way to Oz and you've dreamed of visiting Bondi Beach - then this has to be the place to stay when you do it. Choose a sea view - whatever extra you pay it's worth it - and you can bring the beach to your room, it's that close. Sunrise on your pillow? No worries as they say, it really does. The hotel is not soulless modern age - it has a timeless fee about it and truly reflects the disparate qualities of Bondi itself. You won't pad around in suits and silk - chill out and enjoy!~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_423736614~“Great lunch”~We had a very enjoyable lunch here today. You find a table, place your order at the bar and await the little buzzer they give you to buzz. When it does, you go up and collect your food. We ordered starters and mains and everything worked out well. The calamari starters were fabulous, very juicy and a fantastic spicy aioli dip. My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the lamb ribs were succulent and nicely presented with sweet potato fries. A beer, sparkling wine and a bottle of red, and all for under $120. Can't complain at that. Very nice staff too, friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_423324140~“Great value yummy lunch”~Our family of 4 visited Bondi Beach for a day trip. We enter looking for somewhere to eat that wasn't maccas or hungry jacks and were drawn to the Bondi Hotel especially after reading the $15 lunch specials. We ordered the barramundi and cheeseburger and 2 kids cheeseburgers. All came with crunchy hand cut chips that were light and fluffy inside. All meals were fresh and tasty. The only thing that would have made the fish better was a salad to be included. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Open kitchen and great food. The only complaint would be that we would have liked to sit in the glass enclosure with a view of the beach but it is obviously a designated smoking area and although we could not see anyone smoking we could smell it so chose to sit inside.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_418237207~“Great location”~Stayed for 3 days (Fri-Sun). The location of the hotel is fantastic. Across the road from the beach, bus stops outside, easy walk to whatever you need in the area. Rained all day when we first arrived. As it was early the room wasn't ready, but the manager lent us his own umbrella and we went off exploring. Despite what we had read, the noise was minimal. Didn't affect our sleep at all. The room was fantastic. Not big, but had a balcony that look over the beach. (room 203) Had lunch at the Hotel bistro. Nice meal and not overpriced.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

We were there on a winter’s day and enjoyed the magnificent view from the front section of the hotel which is no doubt very popular in summer. We enjoyed a Barramundi fish with chips. Service was good, food was excellent, the meal didn’t take long to arrive and was a lot cheaper than some of the “fish and chip” shops along Campbell Parade.

review_381014791~“Rude inconsiderate staff.”~Not happy with our stay here. We had to park down in the basement with a specially made code for the boom gate which only works once. We drive down and theres people in a BMW in front of us who use their code and drive into the Hotel Bondi parking area, gate does down they go in, we use our code and the gate goes up... and then the people in the BMW reversed back out right in front of us, boom gate goes down and now BOTH of us can't get in! IDIOTS! The BMW people went and got a staff member to let us in so we drove in first and then parked in the only space left. Rude staff member tells us we cannot park there and that is only for the owner of the company. Ok? We just waited 15 minutes for a car space but thats fine, sure. And then we were forced to park in a loading zone? BMW drive comes through and the staff member tells him he can park in the owners car park! What makes them more of a priority than us! I asked the staff member why we had to park in the loading zone even though we were in there first and his response was, "I'm sorry that you don't understand that I make the decisions on who parks where.". SO rude I cannot believe the way he spoke to me, not happy at all! At least the man in the morning was very nice to us. I will never stay there again nor will I recommend it. Plus the room we stayed in looked like a house keeping closet.~2~nan~nan~nan~1~3~1~nan

The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a large walk in shower. Coming from cooler Christchurch we found the aircon that was turned on far too cold for us and eneded up turning it off altogether however we were staying in May so I'm sure the aircon would be much appreciated in the warmer months. Overall great location, lovely staff, large balcony, comfortable room would definately recommend for couple or solo travellers~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_373822521~“Hotel Bondi”~The hotel has been recently renovated as per previous posts. It is dated but location is fabulous. Noise can be an issue depending where you are located , let the manager know if you are a light sleeper. The day manager is very accommodating. Night staff is clueless and Internet was an issue. Although the rationale for poor internet was understandable, an intermittent internet is an issue regardless. No beach towels is a small nuisance but not needed. Get beach towed for guests. The day manager was more than accommodating to fix any issue. See him, avoid other staff or you will be frustrated.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
