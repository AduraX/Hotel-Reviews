review_154477872~“Good Location / Good Room”~Stayed here & walked everywhere -room was average with nice overall hotel appeal & decor -the location is nice for this property, its in the business district in Sydney & isnt far from any of the attractions. If anything its a good place to stay with alot of shopping & at a good price. Views from high floors are just of other skyscrapers -& there is a rail station nearby. If your looking for something in this area the hotel will suffice almost for anyone.~3~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
