review_474406341~“Nice reno, shame about the poor trade work”~Great spot to stay, close to city, rooms clean and tidy, BUT, very poor trade work. No grout behind wash basin so water runs down the back of the wall and on to the floor. Broken tiles in the new shower. Toilet seat only 1cm from wall so not possible to sit directly on toilet unless your tiny or a kid. Exhaust fan in bathroom not working at all. Room has all amenities, hairdryer, coffee and tea, safe, iron and board. Nice courtyard. Parking on site with very minimal cost. However, I would definitely stay here again.~3~5~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_474211857~“Comfortable place to stay, easy to get around.”~We stayed here for 3 nights while doing tours in and around Sydney. The bed was really comfy. They had international travel converters for tourist from North America who didn't think to bring one, thank goodness. Staff were very friendly and helpful with helping to show us where to go and how to get around. Also with getting taxis and such. Michael and Zoe were really great. Sorry, I can't remember the name of the person who helped explain about Paddy's market- which was really helpful too.  Room was clean and there is a free safe in case you need to store any valuables. It is located close to a transit station which is what I planned to use when booking, but once there33 we opted for cabs instead of wasting valuable time on public transport. I'd stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_470513568~“Cleaners stole personal things”~We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. I took my iPad Pro with me as needed to do some work while I was on holidays. We left in the room a fast charger for iPad Pro and the cable (all worth 120 dollars). The ipad fast charger was stolen after the room was cleaned. We talked to the hotel but they didn´t take responsibility. We also showed a photo I took to the room before leaving where you could see the charger but they didn't offer a refund or to use their business insurance. I would not stay there unless you just take non-valuable items.~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_465043804~“Tasteful decor”~The official description about the hotel being refurbished is probably outdated because it look to me as completed.  The rooms are small, but tastefully decorated, modern and clean. It appears that most rooms have a balcony - again a small one. You can't open any windows so you have to sleep with the aircon.  Reception staff were very friendly. And there is free wifi. In summary, this is a good place for an overnighter or a short stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462776515~“Smaller than I thought”~Stayed one night and probably won't stay again. Not a place for tall people to stay. Yes the bed was large but had a massive ridge in the middle from a joiner bigger than any I have seen. Plastic on the wood and a bathroom that makes it tricky to use conformably if you are larger than small.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461852182~“Convenient, comfortable, good value”~I chose this hotel as it is close to my family and I was visiting from interstate. It is a modest but clean and comfortable place to stay. Well positioned to some lovely restaurant/coffee bars across the road. it is also close to transport to the CBD. You will find the rooms fronting on to Glebe Point Rd have exposure to some traffic noise- but overnight it was quiet. Whilst the bathroom was small - the room itself was a good size. I will definitely stay here again on future trips to visit my family.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_458604878~“Nice and modern ”~We were spending some time in the city and paid half the price of a city hotel just 5 mins out. Has great service, decent size modern and clean rooms with balcony and air conditioning. Awesome cafes across the street which the hotel provided complementary coffee at one of them. Have also stayed for work in the part.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458158591~“Renovated, great location, friendly ”~Located in leafy Glebe in Sydney's Inner West, this recently renovated motel is a boon to the area. Agethe, in particular, is one of the helpful 24 hour reception staff. Glebe is close to the City and Darling Harbour and half way between the City and Sydney Airport. The University of Sydney and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) are minutes away. Opposite the hotel is the bus stop to the City, Broadway Shopping Centre and Central Railway; a cluster of shops comprising good cafes, mini-mart, newsagent (sells Opal card for Sydney's buses, trains, ferries), green grocer. Very good restaurants, more cafes and Bicentennial Park on the Sydney Harbour foreshore, are a few minutes' walk away. The air conditioning provided relief from a heat wave. L'Occitaine products are supplied in the bathrooms. Blackout curtains help with a good night's sleep. There's a good lift. There can be noise as tour groups arrive and settle in. Despite being on busy Glebe Point Road at Wigram Road, the rooms I occupied were not affected by traffic noise. Everything worked and I returned for an additional night after missing one night because the Haven was booked solid. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452549589~“Handy central location”~Very clean modern rooms great bed we have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and find the location very handy with a good choice of restaurants within a five minute walk.

review_452224435~“Well priced, clean and comfortable”~My husband and I stayed for one night during a trip to Sydney. We came by bus and it is literally steps from the bus stop,on Glebe Point Road. Staff at reception we lovely and we found the room to be larger than what we expected and very comfortable. The bed was two King singles joined together and I personally like this option as it allows me to sleep more soundly when sharing a bed with my hubby, each has their own space. There were LOccitane toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities, a mini fridge, a sofa, a desk and plenty of wardrobe space, so for a longer stay this room would have been perfect. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and the blackout curtains meant that we were able to have a good sleep in. We did hear quite a lot of ambient noise from other guests as the concrete corridors and configuration of the rooms around a central courtyard is such that noise seems to echo and travel, especially the sound of doors slamming shut, etc. It was a Friday night, so I assume possibly busier and more people coming and going? Despite this, I thought that this hotel was a good alternative to more expensive CBD hotels and there are plenty of eating options such as restaurants, cafes, etc all along the length of Glebe Point Road.,~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450362706~“Comfortable and clean”~The room was large, clean and nice with a clean bathroom and a little balcony. There was L'Occitane toiletries which my GF assures me is a good thing and the bed was large and very comfortable. Moreover there are proper blackout curtains which is always a plus if you need a lie-in (ie after NYE). We stayed for NYE and the staff actually surprised us with a bottle of bubbles which was very nice. The location is good with a bus stop right across the road to central station and a light rail way station just a few minutes away.  It was quiet and staff are very friendly. Our fare (which was quite expensive due to the time of the year) did not include breakfast but there are a number of nice restaurants and cafes on Glebe Point Road. The parking lot looked a little tight but it's better than nothing as there are few parking options nearby I think.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449047143~“New Years Eve”~We made a booking at the hotel to experience the New Years Eve Sydney Harbour Fireworks. The hotel was a 30 minute walk to Darling Harbour. The hotel was clean, well presented and close to all transport services, but above all else the staff were friendly, helpful and very caring. If we are to return to Sydney we would have no hesitation in staying at the Glebe Hotel.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449077773~“Well appointed & great value”~My room at Best Western Haven Glebe was stylish, well appointed and very clean. Small details like L'Occitane toiletries and well designed teaware were an added bonus! I found the staff to be warm and helpful, accommodating my request for on-site parking (at a surcharge) although I hadn't booked one prior—make sure you do, street parking in Glebe is not fun. Although my room was away from the elevator, it was at the front of the building facing Glebe Pt Road, so if you need quiet, request a room to the rear of the building. Overall very impressed with the quality and value for money, and will definitely return.~4~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_447905346~“Fats8”~Stayed for 3 nights just before Christmas .Very helpful and courteous staff Eno in particular.Room was a good size and the bed comfortable .Bathroom needs an exhaust fan in window.

We would recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445437787~“Cosy resting place on Sydney City Fringe”~We stayed 2 weeks ago During Xmas Party season after attending a few events within the heart of the City. It was difficult to secure a room in the City at this time of year and prices were exorbitant - we looked for other options and found the boutique hotel Haven @ Glebe. Our room was a small studio type motel room - with a small verandah - ours overlooked the back lane - reasonably modern, could have had a bit more attention on the cleaning - carpet could have done with a good vacuum (old building that has been refurbished). Bathroom is modern but has been a little overlooked in the attention to detail - grout, tiles, etc - the entire bathroom floor gets wet once you've had a shower. It was convenient for us to rest our heels between Day/Night events - the King Size bed was so comfortable & the air con was fabulous on a very hot weekend. It is close to restaurants and Cafes in Glebe Point Road and reception organised a taxi for us into the city. It was also within a short walking distance from the Light Rail which we also utilised. Parking underneath was limited to about 15 cars (hotel has approx 50 rooms ) and we were not advised when booking online that we needed to book and pay for a spot otherwise look for street parking. Upon arrival they take a Credit Card Pre Authorisation (hold) for the room rate ($229 plus a $100 security deposit - ours was $329 in total) Upon checkout we were debited a new transaction for the $229 which came out instantly whilst the Pre Auth remained on our account for a total of 8 days in essence barring us from using our own funds in the amount of $329 until the Pre Auth rolled off - Accounting wise there just has to be a better way.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_444736395~“Comfortable stay”~Stayed 2 nights and it was comfortable. Certainly some extra cleaning of the room would have been nicer (dust shows up badly on black) and a good vacuum of the carpet edges needed. Double glazing meant I wasn't disturbed by the main road and easy distance to all transport. Found the lack of signage interesting as I missed it completely the first time. I did think the $100 for pre-authorisation annoying and unnecessary. Most hotels put this through as $1 and given there wasn't an actual mini-bar in the room, I still don't understand why the amount is set so high. The staff were friendly and I would have no problem staying here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444608913~“Outstanding value in every way”~We visited Glebe in Sydney for a brief stay and chose the Best  Western in Glebe Point Rd. We chose this as we were looking for relatively affordable accommodation in Sydney. I have to admit that I have stayed in Best Western venues in other cities but this one by far exceeded my quite picky expectations. The customer service was excellent, all the reception staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The reception area and gym facilities were in pristine condition. Our room could not be faulted. It has all the basic requirements that are required for a brief hotel stay, except that this was presented at a higher level than I expected. The room was cosy, clean and inviting. We had a great night's sleep in a comfy bed, a nice clean spacious shower.  You do get room service (for breakfast and lunch) and there is 24 hr reception if you require basic necessities (eg more towels, toilet paper etc). It should be noted that the in-room bar fridge is purposefully not stocked, but you can request any item you like by dialing the in-room phone. I found what I wanted was delivered immediately (also I like not having the temptation of all the goodies of a stocked fridge a good thing - but that's just me maybe). The hotel is in a great location for eating out as Glebe Point Rd is full of a variety of restaurants and takeaway outlets. Or if you prefer there are convenience stores and small grocers.  Public transport is excellent, you can easily and quickly get to the CBD using the buses and light rail options, and even in peak time we found taxis were very easy to find. Overall, we were both really happy with our three days and nights at Best Western Haven Glebe. We will definitely be visiting this hotel again when we are in Sydney again next year. Love it.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_440059524~“A comfortable stay”~Couldn't get a place in the cbd so this was the next best option. And it was a pleasant stay. Friendly, helpful staff, comfortable room, and the surprise of L'Occitane products in the bathroom. No restaurant onsite, but they do room service. The bacon and egg roll and mango smoothie hit the spot each morning for me. Easy bus ride into city too, with bus stop 50 metres away from hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437613930~“A good alternative to central Sydney”~I needed to visit Sydney on business recently but was put off by the high prices of the hotels in the city centre. However I came across this hotel which is on the edge of the city but not so expensive. It is close to the light rail line and there is a bus to the city right outside. There are also lots of cafes in area. I booked by phone and the person was quite pleasant, although they forgot to send me an email confirmation of the booking which I had to remind them about. The hotel itself is very non-descript as it has no signs outside for some reason. I had a car and used their small carpark under the building, but note that it is very tight. I probably should have just parked in the street.  The check-in was easy and the receptionist was quite friendly. The hotel rooms are placed around a open inner courtyard which looked like it had been done up recently. One problem though is that noise echoes around the courtyard which was particularly bad when other guests gathered in the middle of the courtyard to chat. The room itself was very pleasant with all the usual amenities, and I had a good night's sleep. It was at the back overlooking the back lane and adjacent houses so very quiet from that direction. All in all I would be happy to stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_432067082~“Ordinary rooms but horrible service”~We own a local business and stay often. Despite being placed in a room next to the lift shaft and enduring the noise all night we still found it convenient to stay the weekends. Until, we booked for one night and decided to stay the extra night and the rude and aggressive receptionist did not honour the rate that was published online. After 10 minutes of questioning her as to why she could not honour the rate, we cancelled both nights. The hotel has lost a possible 26 room nights per year. There is a lot to be said for customer service. Will never stay again.~1~nan~3~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_431698726~“Business trip trying something different ”~Well probably would have to agree with most comments.  Staff super friendly. And live the bathroom layout and the way the accessories are laid out.  However the rooms are very small but bed is comfortable. There is definitely effort in the refurbish and for the most part it is lovely.  I was located right next to the lift which surprisingly isn't as loud as I thought but the road noise was louder.  The aircon was difficult to figure out and you have to be very careful on the security of the room door, it stuck in the close and didn't latch unless checked.  Good for the budget traveller. Close to the light rail and buses. Walking is even an option for the trip into the city.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431665518~“Best kept secret ”~On a recent business trip to Sydney I stayed at this hotel. Although I had the street number there is little indication from outside that I had arrived at the destination. The taxi driver was helpful in this instance. This is a clean, modern hotel. Whilst my room was small it was more than adequate for my needs. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but room service is offered. With lots of restaurants and cafes in the immediate vicinity there is food to suit all tastes. The city is well served by public transport making this an ideal destination for tourists~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429853463~“Check room first and watch payment methods”~We stayed in room 317 on 17th Oct 2016. Tip is to see the room first and watch how you pay. The hotel demands a room deposit of $100 on top of the room fee paid upfront. They photocopied my Drivers Licence saying it was their policy to record ID. I requested they destroy the copy in front of me which he did. The money was debited from our savings account immediately and the desk clerk kept telling us it was only on hold. We showed the Internet banking and he kept saying it would be returned the next day. Watch out for this as it took us 5 days to get the money released and then we paid $170 including $15 parking. The agreed amount. The room is located on the top floor but you have to enter the room via an outdoor glass walled balcony. Lucky for us it didn't rain. It was a long walk from the elevator. There was a nice view of the deck area on the floor below on the way. The room looked clean on entering but there was paint peeling on the wall and the shower has a small glass screen with no fan so you can't dress in there. We found a cleaner working on the floor to remove our chair cushion because it had white sticky liquid stains that I don't want to guess the origin. She was lovely and fixed it immediately. The king size bed had a mattress joiner that was like sleeping with a pool noodle in the centre of the bed. We went out for dinner and didn't discover it until we went to bed at 10pm. We phoned the desk and left a message. This call was not returned. This is our second visit and we gave it another chance because of location, cheap parking and they are rennovating. It was very disappointing again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_428586113~“Outstanding in every regard.”~I cannot rate my stay at The Haven highly enough. The staff went beyond all expectations to make this stay a highlight of our holiday.

review_428059711~“Too cool for school”~This motel was definitely about style over substance . It might be cool to have minimal signage i.e. an A4 placard at knee height in the window but it gets tiring when the taxi driver goes up and down the street 3 times to try to find it. It might be cool to have only a partial glass partition in the bathroom but not when all the water cascades out of the shower and onto the slippy large tiles. Reception staff contradicted what I had been told over the phone about room service and definitely had a take it or leave it attitude. When I asked about a cab I was pointed to the street.~2~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_422300530~“Great location”~Hotel has been refurbished recently. The double rooms are noisy as near the lift well. They are also pretty small, Ok for a few nights only. Ask for a queen at the back. Very convenient location with pubs, good restaurants, cafes, supermarket etc all on Glebe Point Rd. Also frequent buses, maps available at the hotel. Can take to Balmain for example or to the city.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_420103787~“Not Impressed”~I booked my accommodation over the phone on a Tuesday directly with a receptionist for a one night stay on a Saturday during an event weekend. The guy I spoke with was very helpful, reserved a parking spot and told me of some of the restaurants in the area. This was great. I then went to check in on the day only to be told that my booking did not exist and that they were booked out. Admittedly I didn't receive a confirmation email, which is probably a mistake on my part not to follow that up, but then should I have to double check the receptionist? I just phoned them up directly and last time I checked, that's their job! There was a half hearted apology, followed by a token effort of two minutes fluffing about on websites to find alternate accommodation for the night. I ended up sorting out an alternative myself after half an hour of searching on their business center computer, but not once did any of the staff come to see how I was going or to offer any further assistance. Pretty rubbish service if you ask me. They have certainly made sure that I won't stay there again, which is a shame as the property is in a great location and looked to be in reasonable order, but I couldn't possibly trust them to handle my accommodation again.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_416736127~“Never again......”~Our visit started off well as we arrived early at 10:00 am, were greeted with warmth and left our bags with reception until our room was ready. Came back from the markets at 4:30 pm and were allocated a room (112). Get up the stairs and end up outside our room to be greeted with a door held wide open by dirty laundry, and a little girl playing on an iPad on the floor. So I go back downstairs thinking a simple clerical mistake had been made. But no it was definitely our room that was still being cleaned at 4:30 pm with a wide open door and kid in tow. No worries-a bit unprofessional but just a mistake. So we were moved next door to 111 and immediately on entry our noses were immediately assaulted by a fairly strong mouldy/wet dog/damp/slight sewerage smell. By this stage we were over it and just wanted to relax so we opened the balcony door and chocked open the front door to hopefully air out the room. We tried to stick it out and even put some scented soap on the bed to try to disguise the smell. We eventually tapped out, admitted defeat and called reception. She took a bit to arrive but only because she had organised another room but also grabbed a can of air freshener! She was really good about it and asked us to check our third room (110) to ensure it was acceptable prior to moving. We did a smell test, moved our stuff and transferred rooms. While the room didn't smell of wet dog anymore, there was a lingering smell of cigarette smoke. After the previous shemozzle we just accepted it. That was until we looked at the bedspread-it had about 10 long black/brown hairs on it. Considering my wife is a blonde and I have a shaved head they definitely weren't ours...they looked suspiciously like the cleaner's. So that was nearly the end of the debacle.....other than the fact that I saw a jumping bug in the bathroom that looked very similar to a flea....hopefully I am wrong and I have a very restful sleep-I probably will as my wife won't we able to climb over the Great Wall-ish like mound down the middle of the bed. In all seriousness the reception staff has been great dealing with the issues, the rooms are furnished tastefully but the cleaning really needs to be looked at-it's pretty bad when you want to turn the lights off to pull back the covers of the bed.....~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415947282~“Good restaurants around”~Hotel is okay - well maintained rooms with a balcony. Good storage options too. Food is a problem with nothing in-house. Fortunately the Glebe Pt St has so many variety of restaurants that there is very good choice within 5 minute walk. In my specific case the AC was not working. I was given a workaround when I arrived which did not hold good. After 4 days another executive gave another workaround that helped and stayed.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_412958837~“Refurbishment a bib of a let down.”~Last time I was at this hotel was about 20 years ago. It has recently had a complete refurbishment and I was interested to see what they had done with it. Unfortunately just a few things let it down. The staff were as helpful as they could be but they can only work with what they have got. The rooms while having been completely done up have not been repaired. Our room had evidence of the roof leaking. This had taken off the paint from the wall and also damaged the print on the wall. The door to the room didn't close properly and you really had to give it a hefty push to get it to close. There was already evidence of mould in the bathroom which was a bit of a surprise. Our main issue was of the heating and cooling. We went to turn on the air con to go to sleep but it came though as heating. Apparently the air con in multiple rooms is connected and there is no way to get the temp you want you have to go with what it is set on. Either heating or cooling. It was on heating. We could not open the door as we would have heard buses going past all night and the bathroom window had super bright lights shining through so couldn't open that either. So we didn't sleep very well as we were too hot. This was a winter night. To not be able to control the temp is really not good enough. We may have ventured to leave the door to the balcony if there had been a lockable flyscreen.~3~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_412922440~“Good hotel, good value”~The upgrade of the old dilapidated Haven is very welcome. The new hotel is a good place to stay, especially in Glebe which is one of the most delightful suburbs in Sydney. Proximity to the city is also good and a simple bus ride or $12 taxi ride into the city. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Also considerably cheaper than the city hotels.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_411672130~“BW Glebe”~Hotel presents well with good 24 hour reception, there were no items in the mini bar, however you can order drinks etc. from Reception. I find this to be short of top class, also there is no pay tv so tv viewing is limited to free to air stations. Overall though the hotel is in a great location with plenty of food options near by. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as it is clean and neat.~4~3~4~4~3~5~4~nan
review_397129551~“Modern and Clean”~Stayed in a twin share room just as the renovations were completing. The rooms are modern and clean with air-conditioning and a big screen TV. Front desk staff were also friendly and helpful. On the downside, I thought the rooms were a little on the small side, the bathroom was very compact - one needed to manoeuvre on to the toilet and the shower construction poorly thought out - water went everywhere. The walls are also paper thin, we heard every word, knock and bang of guests arriving and departing other rooms - needless to say the morning checkout period was a noisy affair. Our stay was comfortable and wasn't unpleasant, but I found myself overlooking it on all trips since because there is better accomodation available for the same price or less.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_392168786~“Princess and the oea”~There is absolutely no evidence to indicate that the building at 196 Glebe Point Road is a Best Western motel. When I mentioned this to receptionist he said there was a problem because of all the heritage buildings in the area yet across the street all commercial premises had signs! I didn't sleep a wink due to the uncomfortable ridge in the middle of the king size bed. The shower controls were totally a mystery and finally with many random manipulations I achieved hot water. Aesthetically unusual decor with strange curtain completely oversized for narrow window but yet didn't successfully cover window. No shelf in bathroom to hold anything. Parking an extra fee.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Amazing view from the balcony on the top floor of the city lights. Balcony doors open, a breath of fresh air uncommon in many hotels these days. Friendly staff at check in and during the stay.

review_379797218~“Livid festival and livid at this place”~My haven experience started with out keys not working to get in. I had a cab waiting so i said can i pick it up when i get back and are you a 24hr reception. She said yes and no problem. I came back to a locked hotel with no reception. I had to sleep outside in the rain until someone opened up. When i got angry at the reception i was told cant you read the sign and he pointed at a be back in 10 sign. He was gone for at least an 90mins. Apart from that experience this place is over priced half attempt at a motel at best. There is no swimming pool.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369735731~“Affordable stopover in Sydney”~I have watched this hotel progress through the renovations over the last few years. There is now a lift, gym and open air space. The rooms have been upgraded. The bathrooms whilst small are functional, yet you do get the floor wet with the shower. Bed is comfortable and the room is adequately equipped, the day lounge is ideal to lie back in and read a book. Best of all is the restaurants surrounding ... so many choices. There is also a couple of second hand bookshops to pass time.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_366711266~“Just OK considering the price”~We had a twin room on first floor. Decor is modern, wifi is included and runs well, bathroom accs are good, in-room coffee facilities appreciated (only instant - pod would have been much better considering the room price!), very little street noise (our room faced the side road). Pretty cramped throughout but OK for a night or two. Only problem here is that the internal walls must be very thin- we got a lot of noise coming from the other rooms - coughing, talking etc can all be heard and I was woken during the night by the amorous couple next door (thankfully they were quick). Also - there is no BW sign at the front at the moment, so you need to know the name of the side road. I'd stay again because the location is close to my daughter's house, otherwise I'd probably find something a bit cheaper elsewhere.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_362937919~“I really want to like this hotel!”~I really want to like this hotel, and I do, there are just a few things they need to work on Pros: - Great location in Glebe with shops, restaurants and beautiful tree lined streets all around - Access into the CBD is very easy via bus (bus stop across the road), light rail (5 min walk) or walk  - Free wifi - Refurbished rooms - Nice toiletries - Very good staff (mostly) - Quiet rooms - We got a really good room rate Cons: - Refurbishment has been done a little cheaply (sink tap was wobbly, toilet seat keep moving off to the side - Bathroom design means water from the shower tends to go everywhere - Cleanliness was a bit of an issue (lots of hairs in the carpet and in the bathroom). I actually asked for the carpet to be properly vacuumed and this didn't even seem to help. - There was water damage down the wall in our room (the damage left white streak marks over several metres and the paint was starting to peel back. This needs to be fixed. - One male staff member that I dealt seemed to have the standard answer of no or I don't know. When we checked in, we asked about the Glebe markets and he didn't know anything about them. We asked the same gentleman about a late checkout and he said no (another guy later told us it was fine...). A little bit of work needs to be done on customer service there but for the most staff, the staff were great. Overall, I would stay here again. They just need to step up a little maintenance and cleaning wise.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_357518831~“Great Location ”~We have made this our base for visits to Sydney.  The renovations are now finished and the results are pretty good. We had room 306, fronting on to Glebe Point Road, which had views to the city including a little of the harbour bridge. Excellent sleep with no traffic noise to speak of. Staff were really good, especially the guy who service our room.  We intend to use this place again. Transport and restaurants in the area were first rate. If you are looking for a place to stay with easy access to the centre of Sydney plus great ambience, this may be the one.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_357450870~“New hotel - very good experience”~It is a new hotel - everything is bright, clean and fresh. It is located on Glebe Point Rd - an absolute haven for shopping and dining. There were so many classy dining establishments within a short walk, we were truly spoilt for choice. Will definitely stay again - Winnie on the front desk was lovely!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_356453414~“Rushed renovation”~Initually the room was fresh and new. Big flatscreen to zone out infront of. Bathroom was very small but for the money I didn't expect too much. Recently renovated but seemed rushed with no attention to detail. Room 107.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_354681675~“Great value option close to Darling Harbour”~Fronted by the indomitable Michael at the check-in desk, this is a great value location for anyone needing to get into Darling Harbour - just 3 stops down the light rail line - or the city, which is 20 minutes by bus. Both those destinations are also walkable in 30-45 minutes, though it was pretty warm in Sydney the week I was there so walking in a suit was not really happening. Having spent the work week at the Haven, it is much better value than the dog box budget offerings at Darling Harbour. The surrounding Glebe Point Road area is a delight, with great food options from 6 am until late at night. Spacious recently reno'd rooms with a reasonably sized bathroom (L'Occitane soap, shampoo and conditioner on tap), workable shower pressure, and all linen sparkling. I enjoyed the balcony one evening though it only really works for rooms further away from the busy Glebe Point Road - try get a room numbered X06 and higher. In particular avoid room numbers 101, 201, and 301 which face right onto Glebe Point Road and would be very loud with the buses and traffic. Another tip is that you can avoid the $15 per night hotel garage parking charge if you're getting to Glebe after 4 pm and leaving before 10 am, as there is a fair number of street parking places with a 2P restriction but that only applies from 8 am to 6 pm. Very friendly and helpful staff who left no stone unturned to make my stay comfortable - they could teach the prestige chains a thing or two.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_354413962~“Great value for money. Nicely situated”~I choose the place because it seemed a good deal. In fact it was more than that. The place is nicely situated in Glebe where there are lots of restaurants, coffee shops, markets. Not very far from central.  The room I had felt spacious, light, very clean. A clear effort was made to accommodate guests as best as possible. Staff were really friendly.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353451527~“New property”~This hotel has only recently opened. Great location in the centre of Glebe village. The rooms have been tastefully decorated with all modern conveniences including quality bathroom products. The fitness room is a great addition. Pubs and cafes across the road for food and beverage. I would highly recommend Esca cafe (licensed).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352492805~“Could have been better”~Situated in Glebe, about 15 mins away from the Sydney CBD, the location is excellent, easily accessible and provides a nice and quiet environment to relax after a busy day of work. The quality of hotel itself is above average also and overall pretty new given its recent renovation. The mattress is comfortable as well which I had some good sleep on. Though a couple negative things I must point out. Firstly there was a flea issue during my first night of stay and my hands and feet were covered with over 20 flea bites when I woke up the next day. Itchiness and discomfort ensured, I spoke to the front desk staff about this and they promptly upgraded me to a King room while assuring me pest control will be carried out. However, the flea issue persisted despite the room change only at a much smaller scale for the remainder of my stay and I began to think the carpet was to blame because the couple of rooms I stayed in both had pretty dirty carpet which didn't look to be very well vacuumed/cleaned. Secondly, the bathroom is pretty small and I wasn't exactly comfortable while washing myself as a 6"1 tall male in the shower. The towels were all very new as well and my hair would be covered in lint every time after I dried hair not mentioning the body. Pretty annoying I must say as it subsequently got lint on my other clothing items as well. Overall the stay was okay but the flea issue really left a bad taste in my mouth as I considered it a massive health and hygiene issue not knowing what those disgusting bugs had been biting and if I were to become ill from it, I would be absolutely furious.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352032747~“FAAAABULOUS!! 10/10”~Visiting family in Glebe sister said "What that dive?" but she didn't know about total re-fit. New entrance. New lift. New stairs. New gym. New bathroom. New bedroom and bed. New lift. New stairs! 24 hour reception. Friendly staff. Easy check-in/out. Simply lovely. And CHEAP!!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_350151077~“Great bed, but the noise”~Ideally situated and a most comfortable bed, but the traffic noise coming into the room the Haven makes this a poor choice. Stayed in a room facing Glebe Pt Rd. Sadly, the wooden door resonated traffic noise, and the wide gap between the bottom of the door and the floor allowed much noise to enter. Elsewhere in the world, aluminium noise cancelling doors coupled with rubber seals ensures noise doesn't enter.  WiFi was average to poor, and one had to reconnect after each departure! Stayed for 4 days. After one night I asked to move to a quiet room. Staff said they could do it for the next day. I agreed. The next day the (different) staff said it wasn't possible. I remonstrated to no avail.  I mentioned to the staff on exit that the shower waste didn't eradicate water and the floor became flooded. Staff response was "we only just renewed the pipes".  Also, there is no signage on the exterior. Would have thought a large sign stating 'The Haven', or large numbers 196 would have been erected. The way I see the world, I doubt that Best Western are concerned about occupant amenity; typical American hard ball approach 'like it or lump it'!~2~3~nan~nan~nan~5~2~nan
review_350073115~“Good last time, much better this time.”~We first visited Haven a year ago, during the renovations. There is now a lift, which is a great assistance to my wife, who has difficulty walking. Work on rooms is complete. Exterior finishing touches are close to complete. They have done a good job on the building, but what about the staff? If anything, the staff were better than a year back - somewhat more at ease in their jobs and thus better able to succeed. We like this place - it is close to a range of high quality small shops, well connected to the city by light rail, taxi and bus and has plenty of very good food options locally. The rooms? Refurbished top to bottom, medium size, good furniture, even better beds. Noisy? Not at all - we asked for and received quieter rooms. I imagine that some at the front of house receive a lot of street noise, but we have been very happy with ours. We heard absolutely nothing from adjoining rooms, though the place was full.  This review covers two separate bookings in the same month - we altered our plans in order to return to our new "city base".~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_349954157~“One week in Haven”~Size of room (307) was comfortable. Bed of good quality. Staff very friendly. Wifi connection very poor. Room not cleaned properly. Floor carpet remained dirty for days, even after complaints. Bathroom very cramped. Room for one at a time. Toilet squeezed between wall and washbasin. Location ideal at cozy Glebe Point Road.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
