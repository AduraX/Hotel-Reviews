review_471741080~“Volleyfest”~Room was great. Stayed at Bella Vista. Nice view. Air con worked a treat. Rooms were great. Ensuite to the main was nice. Only issue was no internet not even if we paid for it. They were trying to get it fixed but in the 10 days we were there is did not work. Overall nice place right on the beach.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466450694~“Spacious apartments and great location ”~Stayed in the Bella Vista location. Impressively large apartments with good facilities such as washing machine and tumble dryer and immaculate and well equipped kitchen - perfect for us a family with young children. We had partial and delightful beach view. Apartments are about 10mins very pleasant walk to the Corso but there are other shops and excellent cafes nearer. Beach is literally across the road and it's also within short walk of the ocean filled swimming pool at Queenscliff. Local buses stop right outside which go to Manly wharf or up to Dee Why and Frenchs forest. A very big shout out to the reception team and in particular to Nicky who was just fantastic. Highly recommend it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459544815~“Bit of a trek!!!”~Stayed in the one bedroom apartment in the Queenscliffe side of Manly Beach. First impression of the apartment was it was clean and great views over the beach. Downside being no air condition, no WIFI provided in 2017. Sydney was going through it's highest temperature heatwave in history. Saving grace was opening the windows to have some kind of breeze flowing through, otherwise this would have been unbearable to sleep in the apartment. Having paid quite a high rate we would have expected basic amenities i.e. apartment to be cleaned daily, and and fresh linen, towels to be provided. No basic tea, coffee etc provided due to GST not being charged, not sure what that was all about. Location of the apartment is quite a distance if you wished to have breakfast, lunch, dinner which is a 20 minute walk and near to 1 mile one way. The cafe next to the apartment had closed down, and left us with no other option. Would have preferred a more central location to the amenities, and really were not informed of the distance from the main Manly surfside apartment as advertised. On arrival we were informed that it would be a 20 minute walk to the apartment or order a taxi, considering we had our luggage. Thankfully a member of the staff was heading to the other apartment and kindly gave us a lift.  The apartment for all it;s fault was clean and spacious and overall just needs to be updated slightly for the prices being charged be it in high season. We arrived just as the school terms for children had started so expected more of a reasonable rate. This was comparable to the Seibel hotel right in the heart of Manly itself.~3~nan~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_455800731~“Good Sized apartment in Great area”~No of Nights – 3  No of people – 5(adults) Location – Manly (North on Beach) Room Information –  No of beds – Room 1 (Double) Room 2 (Double & Single) Room 3 (2 Singles)  Type of Accommodation – Fully Self Contained Apartment Size of Accommodation – Very large and spacious  Fixtures – Very Good. No air conditioning throughout although in main area Storage space – Very Good Bathroom – 2 bathrooms (1 with room 1) Cleanliness – Very Good – The only item that was not up to standard was outdoor furniture was a little rusty.  The unit was on the side of the complex and did have a good view of the ocean.  Accommodation Facilities/Services Lobby- Occupied 7 days a week although not 24 hours. Open business hours during week and a few hours each day on the weekend. Comfortable area to wait for transport. Access to room (lifts/stairs) – OK – lift a bit small and a few steps to reach lift area. Not a major issue though.  Staff – Excellent. Very friendly and happy to help in any way.  Restaurants/Bars- 3 Cafes just opposite complex. All seemed to be well frequented. Is approximately 1 km from mainstream Manly where there is an abundance of cafes and bars. Wi-Fi- Free  Parking – Free Sporting Facilities– Directly opposite beach where there is surf life saving club. There is no pool in complex however having the beach opposite this is not an issue. Beaches in the area are renown for good surfing. Also beach volleyball is very popular in this area.    Transport Local – Local buses are well provided for the local area. You are able to walk to Manly Jetty to catch a ferry to the city.  Domestic – Ferry arrives at Circular Quay (City) that has a train station that allows access to the Sydney metro train system. International – The airport is quite a way from Manly. You could get a train and ferry to reach Manly however if you have a few people in your travel party a taxi is probably the best option. Depending on the time of day the cost is approximately $AUD80 each way. Alternatively you could hire a car. Apart from getting you to Manly, this is a good option to explore the northern area beaches.  Suggestions/Summary Positives – This unit was very good in a great area. The unit was more than big enough to accommodate the number of people we had. It was very comfortable and the staff were excellent.  Negatives – Not quite right in mainstream Manly but this would suit a lot of people. No pool may also disappoint some people.  Other Information – Would definitely recommend.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_448781580~“Stayed for a long weekend”~Can't complain. Stayed in the upper queenscliff one bedroom apartment and was spoilt with gorgeous views overlooking the beach and manly.

review_443212742~“Close to everything but at the quiet end of town.”~Needed to go to Sydney to catch up with friends and family, but wanted a real beachside holiday. So glad we found Manly Surfside Apartments and the fabulous Nicki - best receptionist ever !!! As we couldn't get the apartment we wanted in Bella Vista for the week, we were upgraded to a 2 level 2 bedroom executive apartment on the 3rd floor. Spacious, with a huge very well equipped kitchen and views to die for with huge balconies on both levels and directly opposite North Steyne Surf Club, literally 2 minutes to the famous Manly Surf Beach and a 10 minute stroll along the promendae to The Corso and Manly Wharf. Although the apartment was fully self-catering, the coffe shops and restaurants directly opposite made this feature redundant as it was not far to venture for a breakfast, lunch or dinner.  We thouroughly enjoyed our stay so much, we decided to extend another 3 days and unfortunately had to be upgraded again to another luxury 3 bedder - someone has to do it so it may as well be us. As my wife had just finished a long bout of medical treatments, this was just the treat she needed to make her feel like a princess. Cannot recommend these guys enough for a complete range of luxurious holiday accomodation and the nicest, friendliest staff from reception through housekeeping and maintenance. I know where we are staying next year !!! Well done Manly Surfside Apartments.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_441765290~“Best place to stay in Manly”~We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The 2 bedroom apartment was perfect for four of us. Large bedrooms, one with a queen and one with 2 singles. Very large living area. Great view of the beach. Perfect location for restaurants, Jellyfish and Salt, were very good. Our whole group loved staying at the beach at Manly and even when we went into Sydney all they wanted to do was go back to Manly. Very helpful staff, clean. The only negative is that the beds are a bit hard and you do have to bring your own soap, shampoo and coffee since it is an apartment but well worth it. The internet was a bit spotty but I loved this place so much I'd definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_440275588~“Great apartments”~We were a family of four adults over from the UK and these apartments were perfection.Three bedrooms,two bathrooms,utility room with washer and tumble drier,a fully fitted kitchen,dining area in an open plan lounge.Two balconies with great views overlooking the beach.We would sit here early mornings,cup of coffee and watch the young surfers take the waves.The concierge Nicky is a vibrant,witty,super friendly lovely lady who is on hand to help and assist.High recommendation~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_437010592~“Weekend getaway at manly”~Lovely apartment with the most helpful friendly staff. Good for larger families as we had a 3 bedroom apartment which is harder to find. Would suggest that you ask for a front apartment not just for the view but the back ones can be noisy at night due to the laneway and old apartment building beside. Overall had a nice seaside feel and was very clean. Also bedrooms have fans only so if traveling in hot weather maybe warm~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~5~nan
review_435477686~“Ideal location when visiting Sydney”~We found these apartments to be in an ideal situation for our visit to Sydney. Although away from the CBD the apartments are a 10 minute walk to the ferry terminal that then is only a 30 minute ferry ride to the CBD. Airport to the apartments took an hour! The apartments themselves are very slightly in need of a refurb but we had a beach facing apartment on the 1st floor and the view is totally worth it! Yes the apartment got a bit noisy first thing in the morning but why do you want to lie in and miss all that Manly and Sydney have to offer. I would definitely recommend staying here for the location. Another slight negative - it would have been good to have a couple of dishwasher tablets and some salt and pepper (but I'm assuming that other occupants probably take them). There was dishwashing liquid and washing powder. All in all we had a lovely stay here and would definitely recommend them. The girls on reception were lovely - prior to the booking and while we were there. Thank you!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_415242138~“6 Pine st. Apt 2”~Stayed here for 3 nights. Nice apartment. Though could do with some work. Only downside was the blinds don't shut out the light and we were awake very early every morning and this apartment and number 1 are adjacent to the road and it gets noisy too in the morning. So no lying in. Good location though.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_413522438~“Bella vista lived up to its name”~Our 2 bedroom apartment had a large kitchen, lounge / living area. 2 bathrooms, washing machine & dryer. Dishwasher, and lovely decor. The down side was that although it advertised that no tea, coffee, milk was supplied. It would have been good to know that there was no soap etc in bathrooms & no spare toilet paper. We got a great price from wotif and loved our stay. Well worth checking out~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~3~nan
review_392744384~“A week in Manly”~My wife and I thought we would do something a little different, rather than stay in the CBD we opted to stay in Manly. The Manly Surfside apartments were the perfect choice. We originally were going to stay at the Bella Vista apartments but then chose to stay a little north at the Grey Cliff apartments. The apartments are clean, modern and well appointed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390346027~“Stayed in Bella Vista Penthouse”~Wonderful 2 story beachfront penthouse at Bella Vista run by Manly Surfside Apartments. When we entered unit 18 we just went "WOW"!!. the decor, furnishings, space & that view was incredible. It was large & had had everything needed for an extended family vacation.  One large bedroom on the main living level with a queen & single bed & ensuite then upstairs were 2 bedrooms & 2 bathrooms, one a king master suite the other 2 single beds. Each room had good quality linen with 2 pillows per person & blankets in the wardrobes. Air con in the bedrooms but was not needed. The kitchen space was great to feed our family & grandkids & saved on money not having to go out for every meal. The whole living area including dining, lounge, TV, sitting area had gorgeous views up & down the beach & out to sea. There is a balcony on the main living floor with a table & chairs for 6 but the grand, large balcony is on the top floor via either of the 2 bedrooms. This was the spot to sit in the winter sun & watch the world go by. There were chairs & a small table & 2 sun loungers.  We had 1 car parking space included but the other car had to be moved around the streets constantly to avoid parking fines or park near the aquatic centre a few klms away were it is free parking. Manly has so much restricted parking so watch were you park. This was the only downfall with Bella Vista as when you rent a 6 bed penthouse we expected parking for 2 cars. The front desk staff were lovely, the lifts worked fast & the apartments & common areas were clean. The location was beachfront in the middle of the beach. It was a 10 min walk to the corso & Manly ferry along the back street & a 25min drive to the zoo.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_383323391~“Excellent location and accomodation in Manly”~We went for a family holiday and wanted a beach view. The reception staff were extremely helpful and assisted us picking the best room with a view within our budget. When we checked in they surprised us with an upgrade to the Penthouse suite. Absolutely amazing apartment (2 levels, 3 bedrooms) and spectacular view of Manly beach. The apartment is directly across from the beach and an easy walk to the wharf and all the restaurants (~15 mins). Not all rooms have a beach view so if that is a requirement check first before booking. Added benefit was free secure parking for 1 car. We can not thank the staff enough for making our holiday so special. If we ever stay in Manly again we will definitely stay at Manly Surfside Apartments.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_383064753~“Near the beach but no view”~This location is just right for Manly Beach. It is a 15 minute walk from the wharf and ferry to Sydney. There are restaurants nearby as well. You are 1/2 a block from the beach. The parking is included for 1 car. This is a deal since everywhere else I have stayed in Sydney was charging extra for parking. You may get one of the apartments with a view. I had the one with the ground floor patio. The patio was exclusive for the apartment but not private. No views. I just closed the shades since I really did not want to look at the neighbors deck lights all night. That was really the only downside. I loved having more than one bathroom, in suite laundry, full kitchen and two separate bedrooms. This was perfect except for the lack of view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367045936~“Great location, excellent accommodation!”~We were a family group (between 6 and 70 years old) from interstate and overseas, gathered to celebrate a 70th birthday. We occupied three 2BR apartments on the second floor, two with partial views of the beach and one (cheaper) at the back of the building. We found the accommodation very spacious and well appointed. Our holiday lasted eight days/nights and for more than half of these we gathered for the evening meal in one of the apartments. There were 11 of us and we cooked and ate in comfort. We chose this accommodation so as to be away from the Corso (noise and crowds) and mostly did not regret this decision. It's a 20-minute walk to the Ferry so there were a few grumbles but mostly we enjoyed the walking, and really loved the Ferry rides! Staff were very friendly and helpful and the apartments were very clean.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_363868826~“Great location, well serviced”~Location, location, location! 96 North Steyne is as good as is gets, on the beachfront, next to restaurants and an excellent surfschool, easy walking distance to the Corso for bars and shops.  Manly is heavenly and these apartments are idealy placed. Service was great, although our ground floor apartment was little prone to ants.. so check your beds on arrival. 3 bed apartment easily accomodated (4 adults and 2 kids) with a great living / dining area. Considering the location it really was value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_363848286~“Great location / too noisy if long stay”~Reception arrival...  Not very friendly / Quite abrupt - never even lifted the heads when walking to or passed reception over two month stay prompting us to say " hi how are YOU.., they were very disinterested - and that's the face of the business!! no luggage assistance offered u take your own bags  Clean - nicely decorated apartments with good size balcony and apartments sizes - however it had dated and old green/grey carpets that were lifting  Cleaning service was once a week - average  Area... Being on 2nd floor it was Very noisy - garbage trucks collecting smashing glass /recycling etc daily - u could pull your hair out the noise was so intrusive! Great onsite beach location with lovely walks restaurants etc nearby - manly surf club direct across road - great for kids Overall great apartments short of the negative vibe in front desk. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_353810614~“Great service and wonderful location”~Ill just make this brief. The only bad thing was the wifi which was being upgraded as we were there. We had a wonderful 2 bedroom apartment at 96 facing the ocean on the angle. We stayed here on the way back to Perth from a 5 week trip through USA Banff and Mexico. This was a large spacious apartment and as a family could spread out. Only a minute from the back and about 10 minute walk to the corso. Coles is also 10 minutes away but just go there stock up and get an uber back. Easy to get into Sydney CBD but Manly has alot to offer. Laid back oceanside village feel but only 20 minutes from the CBD. Finally a big thanks to the reception and cleaning staff. The are so nice to deal with and made a huge effort to meet our departure needs on a Sunday when they were shut. Having a young family its this kind of going over and above that give this place the big tick.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342063135~“Gorgeous apartments steps from the beach and Corso”~We booked an apartment in Upper Greycliffe but due to late redecoration we were upgraded to 96 North Steyne. The apartments are all beautifully presented and are of modern contemporary design with white suites and flat screen TVs. The balcony in the room we had directly looked across to the beach. We could not have been more pleased. The ladies on reception were friendly and helpful, altogether a terrific experience, so much so that we have booked again in March. A well deserved 5 star rating.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_336458797~“Service 5 star. Apartment 3 star”~We booked a week in a one bedroom apartment in Upper Greycliff St. with this company. Our stay is not typical of what you can expect because, during our stay, the whole building was undergoing a major refurbishment. This prevented us using the two verandas or even opening the windows. But enough of that because the management team of Manly Surfside Apartments dealt with the issue appropriately. And that's the point. Service can best be assessed when things do not go to plan and people need to react. I can commend and recommend this company based on the way they dealt with our issue. Now for the apartment; it was not very expensive but did have a view of the sea/beach. It was described as a two or four berth apartment because there was a sofa bed in the lounge. There was one reasonably sized bedroom with a bathroom leading off. This would create a problem if used for four people because the bathroom could only be accessed through the bedroom. There was no air-conditioning in the apartment. The mediocre Wi-fi has to be purchased and proved to be a very hit and miss service. The furniture and fittings were simple but ample for the two of us.  Based on a balance between price, location and quality this apartment is value for money.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_331004868~“Stay Ruined by Renovations”~Booked a double appartment at the Queenscliff site and though superficially attractive, on closer inspection the entire building is shrouded in scaffolding and noisy building work is ongoing throughout the day. This is already known to the reception staff but not something they deem necessary to share with their customers (other than, "You do know about the building works ?" on being driven to the location). Some complain and get moved (see other reviews); others complain and nothing happens (ourselves included). The appartments come replete with advice on how to deal with noisy neighbours. If you envision arriving jet-lagged, this place is a particular, "no no." One other noteworthy inaccuracy, there is a serviceable convenience store nearby, despite the advice offered to the contrary at the reception. The wifi, offered through a third party, never worked throughout the visit. In summary, suggest its is better to avoid this place, than to contract and complain afterwards, as they demonstrably have no shared service values. "Caveat emptor"~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_328246979~“"Serviced apartments" that don't actually include many services”~Good things first: the 3br apartment I rented was absolutely beautiful - lovely modern furnishing, clean and with two great balconies. It didn't have the fabulous view of the balcony on the website, though (picture attached), but it was still quite a nice place to sit and write. The kitchen contains all the cutlery (8 sets of everything) that you'd need and the bedrooms would comfortably sleep 7 people (2 doubles, 3 singles).  Unfortunately, I found this property a bit lacking and here's why. First of all, I stay in a lot of serviced apartments, and the services you would expect were not included. There are signs everywhere saying that you are responsible for your own garbage. Yes, that's right, you are required to lug your garbage bags downstairs in the lift and throw them in the dumpster yourself, or you will be charged a 'departure fee'.  Secondly, there are no toiletries in the bathroom. This is even more of a problem when you realise that the closest Coles is 20 minutes walk away and after a long flight in, I really didn't feel like leaving the house AGAIN to go and get shampoo and conditioner.  Thirdly, there are no coffee/tea/sugar sets that you normally see in the kitchen of serviced apartments. Again, these are things you will need to lug home yourself from Coles, and if you're staying for 3 days like I was, you'll end up throwing out most of them (I did consider leaving them for the next person, but was worried I'd be charged that 'departure fee' if I left 'rubbish' anywhere.  The bedrooms have no aircon. This may not be an issue most of the time, but one of the days I stayed here it was 42C. Even with the overhead fan it was VERY stuffy in my room which was quite a long way away from the living room where the aircon is. It made for a sleepless night. My friend was sleeping in the bedroom off the living room and left the door open and didn't have the same problem.  Aircon aside, it would be no bother (and not very expensive) to include these little conveniences (like getting the cleaner to throw out the garbage for you, and having toiletries and tea/coffee available), and I don't understand why the choice wasn't made to include them, except for extra cost-cutting, maybe? That doesn't seem very 'luxury' to me.  So while the apartment is beautiful, I'm not really happy with how it's run. I probably won't be staying here again.~3~nan~5~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_317438859~“Bella Vista Perfect Spot”~My partner and I had a wonderful 6 night stay at the Bella Vista Apartments (1 of 4 apartments managed by Manly Surfside Apartments) visiting with family in Sydney. We were pleasantly surprised to be moved and upgraded after being told that we couldn't and really appreciated the reconsideration of our request. While our partment did not have a view we loved the spaciousness of the apartment. The staff were wonderful, warm, welcoming and accommadating. The apartment was spotlessly clean, had every thing that you could possibly need. Bella Vista is sited directly behind the Manly Surf Club, a short pleasant 10-15 minute walk to the main shopping centre. We will certainly return.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_243763447~“Bella Vista. Brilliant!”~We rented two apartments here for a family trip to Sydney. With 6 adults and one two and a half year old, we opted for a beach/city venue rather than city/beach. On arrival the check-in was easy, the staff very helpful and friendly. Our first apartment was ground floor/side view. Extremely well equipped - absolutely everything you could need. Downside: there was a wall around the large patio, great for security for our toddler, but did spoil the view somewhat, unless standing up. Also, above our apartment (4) there was a vent thing which 'ran' loudly for an hour every 'late afternoon', just when you'd like to be sitting on the patio enjoying a drink or cuppa at the end of the day. Went on for around an hour. But - that's just an observation, and a minor detail, considering the fabulous'ness of the rest of the accommodation! The other apartment (6) was first floor, 3 bed corner - which was way and above our expectations - beautiful. Clean, again well equipped, and the VIEWS!!!!! Can't praise it enough.  Since the trip was our Christmas treat to our kids, we were very happy, and they were most impressed with 'Mum and Dad'!!! Thanks  Thank you too, to the reception staff who dealt with 'problem' neighbours above us promptly, and reassuringly (to us).  We would stress to PARTY PEOPLE who might think this is a great PARTY VENUE - IT IS NOT!!! The management are very tough on anti-social behaviour, and 'NO PARTIES' or late night noise is the FIRST rule on their booking form. There is a night time security number you can ring if you have a problem. We didn't have to use it, but it was good to know it was available. All in all, a great family venue. Thank you Bella Vista for making us our - kid's 'best-ever-parents' ...!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS Oh yes - and 'Jellyfish', almost next door, does do the most amazing, great value breakfast - highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_239857934~“Needs Work”~I rented the 2 story penthouse for 3 days for my family. From the moment we checked in it was not a great experience. After giving them all my credit and address information to book the apartment, I had to refill ALL the info again on a checkin card.. Small detail I guess. Then after we got the keys I asked for the password for the wifi that was supposed to be included, as per the 2 conversations that my daughter and I had when booking the room. They advised us there was no password, we had to BUY the wifi as it was NOT included in the price. So I guess that my daughter and I were both mistaken on two separate calls, one from Australia and the other from Canada. At that time we were also given a parking space number and very vague directions as to how to get to the underground parking. After circling the block twice, I got out of the car and walked down the street with the remote and started trying it on the garages until I found the proper one. We then get into the garage area and the number for the parking spot is non-existent. So... we park in an area that is marked with a different number. We then proceed to the apartment, with absolutely stunning views, and read the laminated guest information card. It says on the card, if you need assistance just pickup the phone and dial 9. The problem now.... no phone!!! So my daughter calls the number that we used to book the apartment, with her cell phone, and they advise her that where we are parked is not allowed we have to move to a spot that is NOT marked at all. I do not know if I mentioned this underground parking area is tiny and very difficult to move any type of vehicle, never mind an SUV. But move it we do. Now, what are to do for a phone in the unit??? The management company sends one up. The problem this time, no charger and the phone is almost dead and locked. Another phone call and another phone is sent up. This one is fine. I try to get onto the internet and place my credit card info online. Hit the send button and get this message. Sorry your attempt has failed, please try again. So I try 2 more times and get the same message. Enough of this. We go get something to eat. Come back 3 hours later and try to login again. SUCCESS!!! WOW finally. For those of that remember dial-up speeds, think of that only slower. Then I start getting email notifications.... 4 of them. I have been billed 4 times. 3 for the attempts that failed and 1 for the one that went through. 1 hour on the phone and 7 emails later, I am finally connected to someone that can issue the credit. This is all in the first 4 hours. The place needs to be painted as the walls are all white and there are black marks all over them. Other than the absolutely fantastic views and the great location, there is not much else to say positive about this property. Manly Surfside Apartments specifically and Australia in general need to get into the 21st century on internet and wifi technology.~3~2~5~4~5~3~1~nan
review_226170248~“Unbelievably friendly service and great location”~We have been in an apartment at Belle Vista now for longer than most holiday makers so we have a really good experience of all aspects of Manly Surfside Apartments. So where to start....The reception staff cant do enough to help making you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. The apartments are well appointed and have everything you need to have an enjoyable holiday. We looked at several companies before we settled on Manly Surfside and I am pleased to say we made the right choice.  I would recommend them without question. Ian ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Only downside is... the en-suite room is just above the garage entrance. Truck coming to collect rubbish / delivery stuff could be really noisy in some mornings. We stayed for a week.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_222782151~“beautiful property and nice people”~have been staying long term in the Bella vista apartments and must say they are great. Close to the beach, nice balcony. Good and secure parking. We can say this place is the way to go if you are on holiday or for long stay accommodation.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_222254892~“Very comfortable apartments right on the Manly surf beach”~We stayed 4 nights in Manly and our adult son was staying with us so we found a 2 bedroom apartment rather than 2 hotel rooms. We made our last minute booking via Whotif and got a healthy discount off the published rate. They are part of The Manly Surfside Apartments group who own multiple apartments. The apartments are in a 4 level block right opposite the Manly surf beach and offer 2 or 3 bedrooms. We hired a car and free undercover car parking is provided which is a bonus because parking is very restricted in Manly. The have a reception desk staffed between 9am and 5pm only. Unlike a hotel, rooms are serviced only once per week with the option to pay extra for more frequent services. Our apartment was modern, spotlessly clean, and larger than we expected with large en-suite to the master bedroom, another bathroom and large lounge. The kitchen had double ovens, microwave, full size fridge etc and everything we needed. We had a side apartment rather than the very front, but we still had good sea views. If you want room service, mini bar etc then do not stay here. They are self catering apartments. They do not even supply tea or coffee. But that is exactly what we wanted and we can not fault anything. We ate out and there are 3 good restaurants next door, including one called Jellyfish which offers the best quality and value for money breakfast we have had for many years. Would we stay here again? Yes. Great value, very comfortable, great location~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_221214349~“Awful Experience”~I booked the standard apartment was is still advertised as a mid-range accommodation choice. The check-in procedure really upset me and ruined my 3 night visit to Manly. The apartment was not the one shown in the photo that I thought I was booking. It was freezing cold with one small electric heater for the whole area. The bathroom was like an ice-box - plenty of hot water but so cold to use being cold ceramic tiles on the floor and the window blind moving in the draught coming through the window. The bedroom drawers were disgusting - marked/stained (clean I'm sure) so I had no inclination to put my clothes in them so lived out of my suitcase. There were chips on the furniture, wires hanging off the skirting board, all a bit tired and shoddy and for the money I paid, I'm not happy at all. The lounge room was so cold it was impossible to get comfortable and relax in there. I would not recommend this place on any budget. It reminded me of a dated and tired seaside holiday let in a typical seaside resort in the UK. Good view of the beach however .... but that is what you are paying for, and there is no point in the winter months!~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_218012633~“Disgusting.”~We stayed here and booked to stay in the Standard apartments, we saw these to be fit after looking at the photographs and the cost on the website. But when we arrived we were disgusted. The apartments were dirty and hot, although the lounge area has air conditioning the upstairs had nothing but two floor fans. The theme of the apartment was a drab green with dirty green carpets and the windows didn't even have curtains or proper blinds which made sleeping a nightmare as there was an outside light directly opposite the window. The beds were un-comfy and the two single beds had bugs in them that even after being sprayed with lots of bug spray still managed to bite in the night. The shared bathroom was falling apart, half of the shower door was missing, the bottom of the door was coming up and there was tape on the bath to cover up marks - disgusting and unclean. Even the kitchen area had bits peeling off the covers of the cupboard doors and the insides of draws and cupboards were dirty. These apartments did have Wifi that was very expensive. The cost of this apartment - due to its location (just off Manly Beach Front) was around 300 and something GBP per night and this is an outrage considering what is actually in the apartment, the only good area within this apartment is the lounge area. I would never stay here again, and I would certainly not recommend the standard "3 Star" apartments to anyone. Disgusting.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_217205548~“Amazing View, great space. Only one disappointment...”~We've checked in today and were very excited by the amazing view looking over Manly Beach. It just doesn't get better than that view! Well equipped kitchen, great size bedrooms and living area. Our disappointment lies in the fact that when checking in we presented a discount coupon we had recieved for $50 off the price of the room, however as the staff member advised that she had already processed our payment she would not honour the discount, then when we enquired about the availability of an extra parking space we were told it was $15 for a space (but were not offered it for free even after the coupon not being honoured). As the coupon was a driving factor in choosing the apartment I find this dishonourable and really rather annoying!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~2~nan
review_216616256~“Lovely apartment”~We stayed here for 3 nights and we were very happy with accommodation . Three bedrooms, three bathrooms and really nice large living area. Good equipped kitchen and laundry room. Good quality pillows and bedding. And very comfortable beds.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~3~nan
review_214406666~“Value For Money”~Manly Surfside Apartments is a recommendation I am happy to provide, we stayed there last July in a 2 bdrm apartment and while there was a problem with the washing machine it was soon fixed. We booked in for the same this year and found on a arrival we have been upgraded to a bigger unit for the same cost. The unit was spacious, clean and well furnished. It was 1 min walk to the beach, 10 mins to Corso and 20 to the Ferry. Great place to base yourself and them branch out from there to visit Darling Harbour, Bondi Beach, city etc. Found that with two young boys they loved the ability to run along the beach yet we were only 50 mins from city and who does enough a ferry ride.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_214405434~“Bella Vista unit 22”~I say a lovely treat as we were upgraded on arrival from another unit to a fantastic 3 bedroomed/ 3 bathroomed duplex. As mentioned in previous reviews, most of the bathrooms were on a small side (guest toilet in particular requires a specific technique to get out of without damaging yourself -note I am tiny so for normal sized people I'd suggest you avoid this room). That's the only down side I can think off.  We weren't at the front but could get ocean glimpses, especially from upstairs but as you are a hop, skip and a jump from the beach it hardly matters.  Little touches that surprise like powder for the washing machine and a whole bottle of dishwasher liquid were great.  However do note that there is nothing by way of a starter packs for a cuppa on arrival. It's a long walk to the supermarket but there's an expensive but well stocked and friendly convenience store about 100m away. So either come prepare or get a delicious take away coffee from Stillano's.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_206006852~“No view but no problem”~Stayed Easter 2014 when Will and Kate were there but that wasn't planned. Too many others there visiting which meant W & K didn't get to see us! Booking went fine but arrival a little disappointing as we weren't advised on routine to get keys. We also helped another couple in a similar situation after we had called the 'emergency numbers'. Apartment clean and comfortable and no view was expected but wasn't an issue. Reasonable value for money considering time of year. Very convenient setting alongside beachfront, in a quiet location apart from bottles being emptied into garbage outside early in the morning. Very strict on checkout by 10!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_200193936~“Very good with one major flaw..”~If you want a busy Sydney beachside apartment this place is perfect.  Rooms were generous in size and tastefully decorated. Although the bathrooms were a bit cramped, the shower was an over achiever - no lack of water pressure on the third floor here.. Location could hardly be better if you're looking for an accessible Sydney beach suburb with all the amenities. Plenty of good dining right down the street, and, as a former resident of the area, the backpackers tend to be better behaved than down at Bondi. The one major grips was noise. Every morning between 6am and 7am a garbage truck parked across the street to deal with rubbish from several cafes. This involved leaving the truck running and unloading bins for about 15 minutes. Via some acoustic accident the noise levels inside our apartment were deafening and never failed to wake up the entire apartment including those in the bedroom farthest from the street. So no sleep-ins for us. I don't imagine all apartments have this problem but be wary of those with windows facing Pine St. To cushion this somewhat the mid-week prices were a bargain - but I probably would have been very disappointed with the noise if I'd paid full price.~4~4~5~2~4~4~nan~nan
review_198687593~“Bella Vista Penthouse”~Fantastic experience was had by all who stayed in this penthouse. Very easy to book, polite friendly reception and a clean and tidy penthouse all make for a memorable holiday! Am definitely keen to come back to this apartment block in the future!

review_197323826~“would have been nice to stay”~Some tips for booking here after a very disappointing experience. Booked a 3 bedroom Riviera apartment at the end of October 2013 for 3 nights starting 27/2/14. Paid my deposit by direct bank transfer and it went thru thought nothing about it until I rang to check key arrangements a week before. Conversation; "what booking, you have no booking, you didn't pay deposit and we are all booked out that weekend anyway" Tip 1 telephone and email when you transfer deposit Tip 2 if no confirmation email within 7 days ring them as your booking will be cancelled without notice After much emailing and phoning they found my deposit had been credited to someone with the same name but different spelling. Getting a refund was again trying and involved a few calls; they could only issue a refund by cheque which could only be written by the solicitor who could only be seen on Fridays by appointment.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_197122478~“If possible get the Atlantis penthouse (number 7)”~We had 3 couples in the Atlantis penthouse (room 7) for a long weekend. The location is fantastic - just across the road from a beach that is patrolled on weekends and on the main road along Manly beach. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Corso but there are a few restuarants very close by. Arriving and checking was easy and well organised. There was a bit of a mixup with the bedding configurations but someone came to fix this within 5 minutes. I suggest that you specify the bedding configuration that you want in the booking. Parking underneath was convenient and I was even about to get our large car into it. The apartment itself was wonderful. It was light and had balconies in various positions if you wanted to sit outside. It was great to sit on the front balcony and watch the world go by and look at the wave. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms very nice. With the front windows open you could hear the waves (and the traffic) but with them shut there almost no noise. While it was not cheap, it was probably cheaper than each couple getting a hotel room in Manly and it was a lot better. We hope to get back before too long. Highly recommended.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_195112790~“Bella vista unit 4”~We stayed in a two-bed ground floor Bella Vista apartment over the new year and loved it! It exceeded all our expectations - the apartment was enormous for three people, it was clean, modern, well laid-out and right opposite the beach. I was also delighted that it was air-conned as I was told by management staff beforehand that it wouldn't be! Considering the space we had, the amazing location and the fact that we were staying in peak holiday season, the price was also quite reasonable. Would highly recommend these apartments if you're visiting Manly. Jellyfish next door does brilliant breakfasts too.~5~4~5~5~5~5~3~nan
review_471741080~“Volleyfest”~Room was great. Stayed at Bella Vista. Nice view. Air con worked a treat. Rooms were great. Ensuite to the main was nice. Only issue was no internet not even if we paid for it. They were trying to get it fixed but in the 10 days we were there is did not work. Overall nice place right on the beach.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466450694~“Spacious apartments and great location ”~Stayed in the Bella Vista location. Impressively large apartments with good facilities such as washing machine and tumble dryer and immaculate and well equipped kitchen - perfect for us a family with young children. We had partial and delightful beach view. Apartments are about 10mins very pleasant walk to the Corso but there are other shops and excellent cafes nearer. Beach is literally across the road and it's also within short walk of the ocean filled swimming pool at Queenscliff. Local buses stop right outside which go to Manly wharf or up to Dee Why and Frenchs forest. A very big shout out to the reception team and in particular to Nicky who was just fantastic. Highly recommend it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459544815~“Bit of a trek!!!”~Stayed in the one bedroom apartment in the Queenscliffe side of Manly Beach. First impression of the apartment was it was clean and great views over the beach. Downside being no air condition, no WIFI provided in 2017. Sydney was going through it's highest temperature heatwave in history. Saving grace was opening the windows to have some kind of breeze flowing through, otherwise this would have been unbearable to sleep in the apartment. Having paid quite a high rate we would have expected basic amenities i.e. apartment to be cleaned daily, and and fresh linen, towels to be provided. No basic tea, coffee etc provided due to GST not being charged, not sure what that was all about. Location of the apartment is quite a distance if you wished to have breakfast, lunch, dinner which is a 20 minute walk and near to 1 mile one way. The cafe next to the apartment had closed down, and left us with no other option. Would have preferred a more central location to the amenities, and really were not informed of the distance from the main Manly surfside apartment as advertised. On arrival we were informed that it would be a 20 minute walk to the apartment or order a taxi, considering we had our luggage. Thankfully a member of the staff was heading to the other apartment and kindly gave us a lift.  The apartment for all it;s fault was clean and spacious and overall just needs to be updated slightly for the prices being charged be it in high season. We arrived just as the school terms for children had started so expected more of a reasonable rate. This was comparable to the Seibel hotel right in the heart of Manly itself.~3~nan~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_455800731~“Good Sized apartment in Great area”~No of Nights – 3  No of people – 5(adults) Location – Manly (North on Beach) Room Information –  No of beds – Room 1 (Double) Room 2 (Double & Single) Room 3 (2 Singles)  Type of Accommodation – Fully Self Contained Apartment Size of Accommodation – Very large and spacious  Fixtures – Very Good. No air conditioning throughout although in main area Storage space – Very Good Bathroom – 2 bathrooms (1 with room 1) Cleanliness – Very Good – The only item that was not up to standard was outdoor furniture was a little rusty.  The unit was on the side of the complex and did have a good view of the ocean.  Accommodation Facilities/Services Lobby- Occupied 7 days a week although not 24 hours. Open business hours during week and a few hours each day on the weekend. Comfortable area to wait for transport. Access to room (lifts/stairs) – OK – lift a bit small and a few steps to reach lift area. Not a major issue though.  Staff – Excellent. Very friendly and happy to help in any way.  Restaurants/Bars- 3 Cafes just opposite complex. All seemed to be well frequented. Is approximately 1 km from mainstream Manly where there is an abundance of cafes and bars. Wi-Fi- Free  Parking – Free Sporting Facilities– Directly opposite beach where there is surf life saving club. There is no pool in complex however having the beach opposite this is not an issue. Beaches in the area are renown for good surfing. Also beach volleyball is very popular in this area.    Transport Local – Local buses are well provided for the local area. You are able to walk to Manly Jetty to catch a ferry to the city.  Domestic – Ferry arrives at Circular Quay (City) that has a train station that allows access to the Sydney metro train system. International – The airport is quite a way from Manly. You could get a train and ferry to reach Manly however if you have a few people in your travel party a taxi is probably the best option. Depending on the time of day the cost is approximately $AUD80 each way. Alternatively you could hire a car. Apart from getting you to Manly, this is a good option to explore the northern area beaches.  Suggestions/Summary Positives – This unit was very good in a great area. The unit was more than big enough to accommodate the number of people we had. It was very comfortable and the staff were excellent.  Negatives – Not quite right in mainstream Manly but this would suit a lot of people. No pool may also disappoint some people.  Other Information – Would definitely recommend.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_443212742~“Close to everything but at the quiet end of town.”~Needed to go to Sydney to catch up with friends and family, but wanted a real beachside holiday. So glad we found Manly Surfside Apartments and the fabulous Nicki - best receptionist ever !!! As we couldn't get the apartment we wanted in Bella Vista for the week, we were upgraded to a 2 level 2 bedroom executive apartment on the 3rd floor. Spacious, with a huge very well equipped kitchen and views to die for with huge balconies on both levels and directly opposite North Steyne Surf Club, literally 2 minutes to the famous Manly Surf Beach and a 10 minute stroll along the promendae to The Corso and Manly Wharf. Although the apartment was fully self-catering, the coffe shops and restaurants directly opposite made this feature redundant as it was not far to venture for a breakfast, lunch or dinner.  We thouroughly enjoyed our stay so much, we decided to extend another 3 days and unfortunately had to be upgraded again to another luxury 3 bedder - someone has to do it so it may as well be us. As my wife had just finished a long bout of medical treatments, this was just the treat she needed to make her feel like a princess. Cannot recommend these guys enough for a complete range of luxurious holiday accomodation and the nicest, friendliest staff from reception through housekeeping and maintenance. I know where we are staying next year !!! Well done Manly Surfside Apartments.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_441765290~“Best place to stay in Manly”~We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The 2 bedroom apartment was perfect for four of us. Large bedrooms, one with a queen and one with 2 singles. Very large living area. Great view of the beach. Perfect location for restaurants, Jellyfish and Salt, were very good. Our whole group loved staying at the beach at Manly and even when we went into Sydney all they wanted to do was go back to Manly. Very helpful staff, clean. The only negative is that the beds are a bit hard and you do have to bring your own soap, shampoo and coffee since it is an apartment but well worth it. The internet was a bit spotty but I loved this place so much I'd definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_437010592~“Weekend getaway at manly”~Lovely apartment with the most helpful friendly staff. Good for larger families as we had a 3 bedroom apartment which is harder to find. Would suggest that you ask for a front apartment not just for the view but the back ones can be noisy at night due to the laneway and old apartment building beside. Overall had a nice seaside feel and was very clean. Also bedrooms have fans only so if traveling in hot weather maybe warm~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~5~nan
review_435477686~“Ideal location when visiting Sydney”~We found these apartments to be in an ideal situation for our visit to Sydney. Although away from the CBD the apartments are a 10 minute walk to the ferry terminal that then is only a 30 minute ferry ride to the CBD. Airport to the apartments took an hour! The apartments themselves are very slightly in need of a refurb but we had a beach facing apartment on the 1st floor and the view is totally worth it! Yes the apartment got a bit noisy first thing in the morning but why do you want to lie in and miss all that Manly and Sydney have to offer. I would definitely recommend staying here for the location. Another slight negative - it would have been good to have a couple of dishwasher tablets and some salt and pepper (but I'm assuming that other occupants probably take them). There was dishwashing liquid and washing powder. All in all we had a lovely stay here and would definitely recommend them. The girls on reception were lovely - prior to the booking and while we were there. Thank you!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_415242138~“6 Pine st. Apt 2”~Stayed here for 3 nights. Nice apartment. Though could do with some work. Only downside was the blinds don't shut out the light and we were awake very early every morning and this apartment and number 1 are adjacent to the road and it gets noisy too in the morning. So no lying in. Good location though.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_413522438~“Bella vista lived up to its name”~Our 2 bedroom apartment had a large kitchen, lounge / living area. 2 bathrooms, washing machine & dryer. Dishwasher, and lovely decor. The down side was that although it advertised that no tea, coffee, milk was supplied. It would have been good to know that there was no soap etc in bathrooms & no spare toilet paper. We got a great price from wotif and loved our stay. Well worth checking out~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~3~nan
review_392744384~“A week in Manly”~My wife and I thought we would do something a little different, rather than stay in the CBD we opted to stay in Manly. The Manly Surfside apartments were the perfect choice. We originally were going to stay at the Bella Vista apartments but then chose to stay a little north at the Grey Cliff apartments. The apartments are clean, modern and well appointed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390346027~“Stayed in Bella Vista Penthouse”~Wonderful 2 story beachfront penthouse at Bella Vista run by Manly Surfside Apartments. When we entered unit 18 we just went "WOW"!!. the decor, furnishings, space & that view was incredible. It was large & had had everything needed for an extended family vacation.  One large bedroom on the main living level with a queen & single bed & ensuite then upstairs were 2 bedrooms & 2 bathrooms, one a king master suite the other 2 single beds. Each room had good quality linen with 2 pillows per person & blankets in the wardrobes. Air con in the bedrooms but was not needed. The kitchen space was great to feed our family & grandkids & saved on money not having to go out for every meal. The whole living area including dining, lounge, TV, sitting area had gorgeous views up & down the beach & out to sea. There is a balcony on the main living floor with a table & chairs for 6 but the grand, large balcony is on the top floor via either of the 2 bedrooms. This was the spot to sit in the winter sun & watch the world go by. There were chairs & a small table & 2 sun loungers.  We had 1 car parking space included but the other car had to be moved around the streets constantly to avoid parking fines or park near the aquatic centre a few klms away were it is free parking. Manly has so much restricted parking so watch were you park. This was the only downfall with Bella Vista as when you rent a 6 bed penthouse we expected parking for 2 cars. The front desk staff were lovely, the lifts worked fast & the apartments & common areas were clean. The location was beachfront in the middle of the beach. It was a 10 min walk to the corso & Manly ferry along the back street & a 25min drive to the zoo.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_383323391~“Excellent location and accomodation in Manly”~We went for a family holiday and wanted a beach view. The reception staff were extremely helpful and assisted us picking the best room with a view within our budget. When we checked in they surprised us with an upgrade to the Penthouse suite. Absolutely amazing apartment (2 levels, 3 bedrooms) and spectacular view of Manly beach. The apartment is directly across from the beach and an easy walk to the wharf and all the restaurants (~15 mins). Not all rooms have a beach view so if that is a requirement check first before booking. Added benefit was free secure parking for 1 car. We can not thank the staff enough for making our holiday so special. If we ever stay in Manly again we will definitely stay at Manly Surfside Apartments.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_383064753~“Near the beach but no view”~This location is just right for Manly Beach. It is a 15 minute walk from the wharf and ferry to Sydney. There are restaurants nearby as well. You are 1/2 a block from the beach. The parking is included for 1 car. This is a deal since everywhere else I have stayed in Sydney was charging extra for parking. You may get one of the apartments with a view. I had the one with the ground floor patio. The patio was exclusive for the apartment but not private. No views. I just closed the shades since I really did not want to look at the neighbors deck lights all night. That was really the only downside. I loved having more than one bathroom, in suite laundry, full kitchen and two separate bedrooms. This was perfect except for the lack of view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367045936~“Great location, excellent accommodation!”~We were a family group (between 6 and 70 years old) from interstate and overseas, gathered to celebrate a 70th birthday. We occupied three 2BR apartments on the second floor, two with partial views of the beach and one (cheaper) at the back of the building. We found the accommodation very spacious and well appointed. Our holiday lasted eight days/nights and for more than half of these we gathered for the evening meal in one of the apartments. There were 11 of us and we cooked and ate in comfort. We chose this accommodation so as to be away from the Corso (noise and crowds) and mostly did not regret this decision. It's a 20-minute walk to the Ferry so there were a few grumbles but mostly we enjoyed the walking, and really loved the Ferry rides! Staff were very friendly and helpful and the apartments were very clean.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_363868826~“Great location, well serviced”~Location, location, location! 96 North Steyne is as good as is gets, on the beachfront, next to restaurants and an excellent surfschool, easy walking distance to the Corso for bars and shops.  Manly is heavenly and these apartments are idealy placed. Service was great, although our ground floor apartment was little prone to ants.. so check your beds on arrival. 3 bed apartment easily accomodated (4 adults and 2 kids) with a great living / dining area. Considering the location it really was value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_363848286~“Great location / too noisy if long stay”~Reception arrival...  Not very friendly / Quite abrupt - never even lifted the heads when walking to or passed reception over two month stay prompting us to say " hi how are YOU.., they were very disinterested - and that's the face of the business!! no luggage assistance offered u take your own bags  Clean - nicely decorated apartments with good size balcony and apartments sizes - however it had dated and old green/grey carpets that were lifting  Cleaning service was once a week - average  Area... Being on 2nd floor it was Very noisy - garbage trucks collecting smashing glass /recycling etc daily - u could pull your hair out the noise was so intrusive!

review_353810614~“Great service and wonderful location”~Ill just make this brief. The only bad thing was the wifi which was being upgraded as we were there. We had a wonderful 2 bedroom apartment at 96 facing the ocean on the angle. We stayed here on the way back to Perth from a 5 week trip through USA Banff and Mexico. This was a large spacious apartment and as a family could spread out. Only a minute from the back and about 10 minute walk to the corso. Coles is also 10 minutes away but just go there stock up and get an uber back. Easy to get into Sydney CBD but Manly has alot to offer. Laid back oceanside village feel but only 20 minutes from the CBD. Finally a big thanks to the reception and cleaning staff. The are so nice to deal with and made a huge effort to meet our departure needs on a Sunday when they were shut. Having a young family its this kind of going over and above that give this place the big tick.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342063135~“Gorgeous apartments steps from the beach and Corso”~We booked an apartment in Upper Greycliffe but due to late redecoration we were upgraded to 96 North Steyne. The apartments are all beautifully presented and are of modern contemporary design with white suites and flat screen TVs. The balcony in the room we had directly looked across to the beach. We could not have been more pleased. The ladies on reception were friendly and helpful, altogether a terrific experience, so much so that we have booked again in March. A well deserved 5 star rating.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_336458797~“Service 5 star. Apartment 3 star”~We booked a week in a one bedroom apartment in Upper Greycliff St. with this company. Our stay is not typical of what you can expect because, during our stay, the whole building was undergoing a major refurbishment. This prevented us using the two verandas or even opening the windows. But enough of that because the management team of Manly Surfside Apartments dealt with the issue appropriately. And that's the point. Service can best be assessed when things do not go to plan and people need to react. I can commend and recommend this company based on the way they dealt with our issue. Now for the apartment; it was not very expensive but did have a view of the sea/beach. It was described as a two or four berth apartment because there was a sofa bed in the lounge. There was one reasonably sized bedroom with a bathroom leading off. This would create a problem if used for four people because the bathroom could only be accessed through the bedroom. There was no air-conditioning in the apartment. The mediocre Wi-fi has to be purchased and proved to be a very hit and miss service. The furniture and fittings were simple but ample for the two of us.  Based on a balance between price, location and quality this apartment is value for money.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_331004868~“Stay Ruined by Renovations”~Booked a double appartment at the Queenscliff site and though superficially attractive, on closer inspection the entire building is shrouded in scaffolding and noisy building work is ongoing throughout the day. This is already known to the reception staff but not something they deem necessary to share with their customers (other than, "You do know about the building works ?" on being driven to the location). Some complain and get moved (see other reviews); others complain and nothing happens (ourselves included). The appartments come replete with advice on how to deal with noisy neighbours. If you envision arriving jet-lagged, this place is a particular, "no no." One other noteworthy inaccuracy, there is a serviceable convenience store nearby, despite the advice offered to the contrary at the reception. The wifi, offered through a third party, never worked throughout the visit. In summary, suggest its is better to avoid this place, than to contract and complain afterwards, as they demonstrably have no shared service values. "Caveat emptor"~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_328246979~“"Serviced apartments" that don't actually include many services”~Good things first: the 3br apartment I rented was absolutely beautiful - lovely modern furnishing, clean and with two great balconies. It didn't have the fabulous view of the balcony on the website, though (picture attached), but it was still quite a nice place to sit and write. The kitchen contains all the cutlery (8 sets of everything) that you'd need and the bedrooms would comfortably sleep 7 people (2 doubles, 3 singles).  Unfortunately, I found this property a bit lacking and here's why. First of all, I stay in a lot of serviced apartments, and the services you would expect were not included. There are signs everywhere saying that you are responsible for your own garbage. Yes, that's right, you are required to lug your garbage bags downstairs in the lift and throw them in the dumpster yourself, or you will be charged a 'departure fee'.  Secondly, there are no toiletries in the bathroom. This is even more of a problem when you realise that the closest Coles is 20 minutes walk away and after a long flight in, I really didn't feel like leaving the house AGAIN to go and get shampoo and conditioner.  Thirdly, there are no coffee/tea/sugar sets that you normally see in the kitchen of serviced apartments. Again, these are things you will need to lug home yourself from Coles, and if you're staying for 3 days like I was, you'll end up throwing out most of them (I did consider leaving them for the next person, but was worried I'd be charged that 'departure fee' if I left 'rubbish' anywhere.  The bedrooms have no aircon. This may not be an issue most of the time, but one of the days I stayed here it was 42C. Even with the overhead fan it was VERY stuffy in my room which was quite a long way away from the living room where the aircon is. It made for a sleepless night. My friend was sleeping in the bedroom off the living room and left the door open and didn't have the same problem.  Aircon aside, it would be no bother (and not very expensive) to include these little conveniences (like getting the cleaner to throw out the garbage for you, and having toiletries and tea/coffee available), and I don't understand why the choice wasn't made to include them, except for extra cost-cutting, maybe? That doesn't seem very 'luxury' to me.  So while the apartment is beautiful, I'm not really happy with how it's run. I probably won't be staying here again.~3~nan~5~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_317438859~“Bella Vista Perfect Spot”~My partner and I had a wonderful 6 night stay at the Bella Vista Apartments (1 of 4 apartments managed by Manly Surfside Apartments) visiting with family in Sydney. We were pleasantly surprised to be moved and upgraded after being told that we couldn't and really appreciated the reconsideration of our request. While our partment did not have a view we loved the spaciousness of the apartment. The staff were wonderful, warm, welcoming and accommadating. The apartment was spotlessly clean, had every thing that you could possibly need. Bella Vista is sited directly behind the Manly Surf Club, a short pleasant 10-15 minute walk to the main shopping centre. We will certainly return.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_293886979~“Fantastic Manly Location”~These apartments were perfect for our family of 4. They had all the facilities we required and the location was perfect. The apartments were clean and tidy and the staff were helpful when required. We arrived afterhours and the keys were left for us as arranged.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_273669574~“The ONE we love”~THE place to be for us. Quiet, even if your room is facing the streets. Just a stones throw and you can dig your toes in the sand of beautiful Manly Beach. The Corso with the wharf, shopping and restaurantsis a few mins walking down street. Always good to come back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_268790236~“Great Place to Stay”~Stay at Pine Court a two bedroom Townhouse, near Bella Vista. Easy check-in, very nice staff. place was big enough for the 4 of us. clean with a full Kitchen, Laundry with washer and dryer. downstairs living room and dining. we were there for 2 weeks, great location near the beach. only thing was very thin walls could hear all the street noise (cars and people) plus people coming in and out of the building. parking for one car is included in the underground car park of Bella Vista. only problem is it's gets full easily we couldn't find a parking space 3 times while there. we would stay there again but would try to stay in another apartment away from the street.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_253755087~“Excellent”~We stayed in Atlantis on the ground floor which had a BBQ area at the back and a  large patio at the front . Very spacious, well equipped, nicely furnished and clean apartment and beautiful views of the beach. Would definitely stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_247966621~“Pretty much faultless”~Stayed here for a very relaxing 4 nights... Paid more than we wanted to at over $500 a night but considering we went last minute and it was opposite the beach and really roomy and January I think we did really well. We had a North East facing two bed penthouse...could probably do with a bit of updating here and there but very comfortable none the less.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_243763447~“Bella Vista. Brilliant!”~We rented two apartments here for a family trip to Sydney. With 6 adults and one two and a half year old, we opted for a beach/city venue rather than city/beach. On arrival the check-in was easy, the staff very helpful and friendly. Our first apartment was ground floor/side view. Extremely well equipped - absolutely everything you could need. Downside: there was a wall around the large patio, great for security for our toddler, but did spoil the view somewhat, unless standing up. Also, above our apartment (4) there was a vent thing which 'ran' loudly for an hour every 'late afternoon', just when you'd like to be sitting on the patio enjoying a drink or cuppa at the end of the day. Went on for around an hour. But - that's just an observation, and a minor detail, considering the fabulous'ness of the rest of the accommodation! The other apartment (6) was first floor, 3 bed corner - which was way and above our expectations - beautiful. Clean, again well equipped, and the VIEWS!!!!! Can't praise it enough.  Since the trip was our Christmas treat to our kids, we were very happy, and they were most impressed with 'Mum and Dad'!!! Thanks  Thank you too, to the reception staff who dealt with 'problem' neighbours above us promptly, and reassuringly (to us).  We would stress to PARTY PEOPLE who might think this is a great PARTY VENUE - IT IS NOT!!! The management are very tough on anti-social behaviour, and 'NO PARTIES' or late night noise is the FIRST rule on their booking form. There is a night time security number you can ring if you have a problem. We didn't have to use it, but it was good to know it was available. All in all, a great family venue. Thank you Bella Vista for making us our - kid's 'best-ever-parents' ...!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS Oh yes - and 'Jellyfish', almost next door, does do the most amazing, great value breakfast - highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_239857934~“Needs Work”~I rented the 2 story penthouse for 3 days for my family. From the moment we checked in it was not a great experience. After giving them all my credit and address information to book the apartment, I had to refill ALL the info again on a checkin card.. Small detail I guess. Then after we got the keys I asked for the password for the wifi that was supposed to be included, as per the 2 conversations that my daughter and I had when booking the room. They advised us there was no password, we had to BUY the wifi as it was NOT included in the price. So I guess that my daughter and I were both mistaken on two separate calls, one from Australia and the other from Canada. At that time we were also given a parking space number and very vague directions as to how to get to the underground parking. After circling the block twice, I got out of the car and walked down the street with the remote and started trying it on the garages until I found the proper one. We then get into the garage area and the number for the parking spot is non-existent. So... we park in an area that is marked with a different number. We then proceed to the apartment, with absolutely stunning views, and read the laminated guest information card. It says on the card, if you need assistance just pickup the phone and dial 9. The problem now.... no phone!!! So my daughter calls the number that we used to book the apartment, with her cell phone, and they advise her that where we are parked is not allowed we have to move to a spot that is NOT marked at all. I do not know if I mentioned this underground parking area is tiny and very difficult to move any type of vehicle, never mind an SUV. But move it we do. Now, what are to do for a phone in the unit??? The management company sends one up. The problem this time, no charger and the phone is almost dead and locked. Another phone call and another phone is sent up. This one is fine. I try to get onto the internet and place my credit card info online. Hit the send button and get this message. Sorry your attempt has failed, please try again. So I try 2 more times and get the same message. Enough of this. We go get something to eat. Come back 3 hours later and try to login again. SUCCESS!!! WOW finally. For those of that remember dial-up speeds, think of that only slower. Then I start getting email notifications.... 4 of them. I have been billed 4 times. 3 for the attempts that failed and 1 for the one that went through. 1 hour on the phone and 7 emails later, I am finally connected to someone that can issue the credit. This is all in the first 4 hours. The place needs to be painted as the walls are all white and there are black marks all over them. Other than the absolutely fantastic views and the great location, there is not much else to say positive about this property. Manly Surfside Apartments specifically and Australia in general need to get into the 21st century on internet and wifi technology.~3~2~5~4~5~3~1~nan
review_226170248~“Unbelievably friendly service and great location”~We have been in an apartment at Belle Vista now for longer than most holiday makers so we have a really good experience of all aspects of Manly Surfside Apartments. So where to start....The reception staff cant do enough to help making you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. The apartments are well appointed and have everything you need to have an enjoyable holiday. We looked at several companies before we settled on Manly Surfside and I am pleased to say we made the right choice.  I would recommend them without question. Ian ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_225911131~“Great 3-rm apartment with gd view”~Nice, spacious living room. Good air-con/heating in the apartment. Good kitchen with plenty eatery.  Only downside is... the en-suite room is just above the garage entrance. Truck coming to collect rubbish / delivery stuff could be really noisy in some mornings. We stayed for a week.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_222782151~“beautiful property and nice people”~have been staying long term in the Bella vista apartments and must say they are great. Close to the beach, nice balcony. Good and secure parking.

review_222254892~“Very comfortable apartments right on the Manly surf beach”~We stayed 4 nights in Manly and our adult son was staying with us so we found a 2 bedroom apartment rather than 2 hotel rooms. We made our last minute booking via Whotif and got a healthy discount off the published rate. They are part of The Manly Surfside Apartments group who own multiple apartments. The apartments are in a 4 level block right opposite the Manly surf beach and offer 2 or 3 bedrooms. We hired a car and free undercover car parking is provided which is a bonus because parking is very restricted in Manly. The have a reception desk staffed between 9am and 5pm only. Unlike a hotel, rooms are serviced only once per week with the option to pay extra for more frequent services. Our apartment was modern, spotlessly clean, and larger than we expected with large en-suite to the master bedroom, another bathroom and large lounge. The kitchen had double ovens, microwave, full size fridge etc and everything we needed. We had a side apartment rather than the very front, but we still had good sea views. If you want room service, mini bar etc then do not stay here. They are self catering apartments. They do not even supply tea or coffee. But that is exactly what we wanted and we can not fault anything. We ate out and there are 3 good restaurants next door, including one called Jellyfish which offers the best quality and value for money breakfast we have had for many years. Would we stay here again? Yes. Great value, very comfortable, great location~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_221214349~“Awful Experience”~I booked the standard apartment was is still advertised as a mid-range accommodation choice. The check-in procedure really upset me and ruined my 3 night visit to Manly. The apartment was not the one shown in the photo that I thought I was booking. It was freezing cold with one small electric heater for the whole area. The bathroom was like an ice-box - plenty of hot water but so cold to use being cold ceramic tiles on the floor and the window blind moving in the draught coming through the window. The bedroom drawers were disgusting - marked/stained (clean I'm sure) so I had no inclination to put my clothes in them so lived out of my suitcase. There were chips on the furniture, wires hanging off the skirting board, all a bit tired and shoddy and for the money I paid, I'm not happy at all. The lounge room was so cold it was impossible to get comfortable and relax in there. I would not recommend this place on any budget. It reminded me of a dated and tired seaside holiday let in a typical seaside resort in the UK. Good view of the beach however .... but that is what you are paying for, and there is no point in the winter months!~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_218012633~“Disgusting.”~We stayed here and booked to stay in the Standard apartments, we saw these to be fit after looking at the photographs and the cost on the website. But when we arrived we were disgusted. The apartments were dirty and hot, although the lounge area has air conditioning the upstairs had nothing but two floor fans. The theme of the apartment was a drab green with dirty green carpets and the windows didn't even have curtains or proper blinds which made sleeping a nightmare as there was an outside light directly opposite the window. The beds were un-comfy and the two single beds had bugs in them that even after being sprayed with lots of bug spray still managed to bite in the night. The shared bathroom was falling apart, half of the shower door was missing, the bottom of the door was coming up and there was tape on the bath to cover up marks - disgusting and unclean. Even the kitchen area had bits peeling off the covers of the cupboard doors and the insides of draws and cupboards were dirty. These apartments did have Wifi that was very expensive. The cost of this apartment - due to its location (just off Manly Beach Front) was around 300 and something GBP per night and this is an outrage considering what is actually in the apartment, the only good area within this apartment is the lounge area. I would never stay here again, and I would certainly not recommend the standard "3 Star" apartments to anyone. Disgusting.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_217205548~“Amazing View, great space. Only one disappointment...”~We've checked in today and were very excited by the amazing view looking over Manly Beach. It just doesn't get better than that view! Well equipped kitchen, great size bedrooms and living area. Our disappointment lies in the fact that when checking in we presented a discount coupon we had recieved for $50 off the price of the room, however as the staff member advised that she had already processed our payment she would not honour the discount, then when we enquired about the availability of an extra parking space we were told it was $15 for a space (but were not offered it for free even after the coupon not being honoured). As the coupon was a driving factor in choosing the apartment I find this dishonourable and really rather annoying!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~2~nan
review_216616256~“Lovely apartment”~We stayed here for 3 nights and we were very happy with accommodation . Three bedrooms, three bathrooms and really nice large living area. Good equipped kitchen and laundry room. Good quality pillows and bedding. And very comfortable beds.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~3~nan
review_214406666~“Value For Money”~Manly Surfside Apartments is a recommendation I am happy to provide, we stayed there last July in a 2 bdrm apartment and while there was a problem with the washing machine it was soon fixed. We booked in for the same this year and found on a arrival we have been upgraded to a bigger unit for the same cost. The unit was spacious, clean and well furnished. It was 1 min walk to the beach, 10 mins to Corso and 20 to the Ferry. Great place to base yourself and them branch out from there to visit Darling Harbour, Bondi Beach, city etc. Found that with two young boys they loved the ability to run along the beach yet we were only 50 mins from city and who does enough a ferry ride.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_214405434~“Bella Vista unit 22”~I say a lovely treat as we were upgraded on arrival from another unit to a fantastic 3 bedroomed/ 3 bathroomed duplex. As mentioned in previous reviews, most of the bathrooms were on a small side (guest toilet in particular requires a specific technique to get out of without damaging yourself -note I am tiny so for normal sized people I'd suggest you avoid this room). That's the only down side I can think off.  We weren't at the front but could get ocean glimpses, especially from upstairs but as you are a hop, skip and a jump from the beach it hardly matters.  Little touches that surprise like powder for the washing machine and a whole bottle of dishwasher liquid were great.  However do note that there is nothing by way of a starter packs for a cuppa on arrival. It's a long walk to the supermarket but there's an expensive but well stocked and friendly convenience store about 100m away. So either come prepare or get a delicious take away coffee from Stillano's.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_206006852~“No view but no problem”~Stayed Easter 2014 when Will and Kate were there but that wasn't planned. Too many others there visiting which meant W & K didn't get to see us! Booking went fine but arrival a little disappointing as we weren't advised on routine to get keys. We also helped another couple in a similar situation after we had called the 'emergency numbers'. Apartment clean and comfortable and no view was expected but wasn't an issue. Reasonable value for money considering time of year. Very convenient setting alongside beachfront, in a quiet location apart from bottles being emptied into garbage outside early in the morning. Very strict on checkout by 10!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_200193936~“Very good with one major flaw..”~If you want a busy Sydney beachside apartment this place is perfect.  Rooms were generous in size and tastefully decorated. Although the bathrooms were a bit cramped, the shower was an over achiever - no lack of water pressure on the third floor here.. Location could hardly be better if you're looking for an accessible Sydney beach suburb with all the amenities. Plenty of good dining right down the street, and, as a former resident of the area, the backpackers tend to be better behaved than down at Bondi. The one major grips was noise. Every morning between 6am and 7am a garbage truck parked across the street to deal with rubbish from several cafes. This involved leaving the truck running and unloading bins for about 15 minutes. Via some acoustic accident the noise levels inside our apartment were deafening and never failed to wake up the entire apartment including those in the bedroom farthest from the street. So no sleep-ins for us. I don't imagine all apartments have this problem but be wary of those with windows facing Pine St. To cushion this somewhat the mid-week prices were a bargain - but I probably would have been very disappointed with the noise if I'd paid full price.~4~4~5~2~4~4~nan~nan

review_197323826~“would have been nice to stay”~Some tips for booking here after a very disappointing experience. Booked a 3 bedroom Riviera apartment at the end of October 2013 for 3 nights starting 27/2/14. Paid my deposit by direct bank transfer and it went thru thought nothing about it until I rang to check key arrangements a week before. Conversation; "what booking, you have no booking, you didn't pay deposit and we are all booked out that weekend anyway" Tip 1 telephone and email when you transfer deposit Tip 2 if no confirmation email within 7 days ring them as your booking will be cancelled without notice After much emailing and phoning they found my deposit had been credited to someone with the same name but different spelling. Getting a refund was again trying and involved a few calls; they could only issue a refund by cheque which could only be written by the solicitor who could only be seen on Fridays by appointment.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_197122478~“If possible get the Atlantis penthouse (number 7)”~We had 3 couples in the Atlantis penthouse (room 7) for a long weekend. The location is fantastic - just across the road from a beach that is patrolled on weekends and on the main road along Manly beach. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Corso but there are a few restuarants very close by. Arriving and checking was easy and well organised. There was a bit of a mixup with the bedding configurations but someone came to fix this within 5 minutes. I suggest that you specify the bedding configuration that you want in the booking. Parking underneath was convenient and I was even about to get our large car into it. The apartment itself was wonderful. It was light and had balconies in various positions if you wanted to sit outside. It was great to sit on the front balcony and watch the world go by and look at the wave. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms very nice. With the front windows open you could hear the waves (and the traffic) but with them shut there almost no noise. While it was not cheap, it was probably cheaper than each couple getting a hotel room in Manly and it was a lot better. We hope to get back before too long. Highly recommended.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_195112790~“Bella vista unit 4”~We stayed in a two-bed ground floor Bella Vista apartment over the new year and loved it! It exceeded all our expectations - the apartment was enormous for three people, it was clean, modern, well laid-out and right opposite the beach. I was also delighted that it was air-conned as I was told by management staff beforehand that it wouldn't be! Considering the space we had, the amazing location and the fact that we were staying in peak holiday season, the price was also quite reasonable. Would highly recommend these apartments if you're visiting Manly. Jellyfish next door does brilliant breakfasts too.~5~4~5~5~5~5~3~nan
