review_475580081~“Definitely recommend - would be happy to stay here again”~The room was really narrow but overall I had a great stay here! The staff were really nice and even though it has a great location - 5 minutes walk from Newtown station - it was really quiet at night. The hotel certainly isn't luxurious but it's a good price for a good hotel. I also really liked the vaguely hipster, industrial kind of feel of the decor. Free unlimited wifi as well.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_474808427~“Great hotel in the middle of Newtown”~This is a great place to stay in the middle of the busy Newtown area.  Friendly greeting and the staff at the front desk were more than happy to provide suggestions for where to eat. Room was small but adequate for an overnight stay with everything I needed. The hotel is ideally located, surrounded by a huge variety of restaurants and quirky little shops and cafes.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_474385635~“Great location for gigs, really friendly staff”~Stayed here for a gig at the Newtown Social Club, was on first floor with windows facing side road so not too noisy. found all the amentities to be great given location and proximity to everything (buses, trains, food and venues). would stay again.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_471357795~“Urban Newtown - Feb 2017”~The Urban Newtown is a hotel located in an up and coming suburb of Sydney. It has great access to Sydney's transportation system, and a large variety of local shops on Enmore road. A few blocks north and it merges into King street, a major shopping/ eatery road. Reminds me of a SOHO areas in NYC. The hotel is not a major high-rise like other mainstream hotels. But it is very modern / chic in its styling and design. The Queen room we had was modest. There was the Queen size bed, a small kitchenette (refrigerator, cook top, sink. microwave). The room was clean and functional. However, the room size was small. For two people, it required an occasional coordination of movements to maneuver around the room. While it was an inconvenience, it was tolerable as our focus was to enjoy Sydney. IF you're looking for a get-away hotel to just relax in, probably not the hotel for you. But if you need a reasonable room that is comfortable and safe while yo are enjoying the life in Newtown, then this could be your room. Check for sales and special pricings through the various on-line hotel searches to get the best deal.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470207491~“Really nice hotel”~I found this hotel to be good value, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Being on a busy road I thought that it might be noisy but I heard no traffic noice from the 4th floor on which I stayed. The reception staff were friendly and i appreciated being upgraded to a king room. I wasn't impressed by Newtown but there are many who are who would be well served by staying at the Urban. The small touches such as large, soft towels and quality toiletries just added to experience and distinguishes this hotel from others who tend to ignore the niceties! Highly recommend this establishment!~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468444377~“Verging on quaint but worth it”~When I walked into reception I left (until staff ran out and retrieved me) because it looked like anything but a hotel reception. When I first walked into my room I thought I had the wrong key because the upper walls and ceiling looked unfinished, as though panels had been removed and not replaced - raw rendered plaster with evidence of old adhesive, and exposed electrics. The ever friendly and helpful staff - reception and housekeeping - allayed my fears and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Good bed and kitchenette, near new bathroom. Happy hour Friday & Saturday 2-7pm including a variety of finger food and drink. Muffins and croissants with tea & coffee available daily no charge at reception. Location amidst cafes and hotels, Enmore Theatre a minute away. I have found a new home for my regular visits to Sydney!~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_467398921~“Great access to Enmore Theatre”~Booked this place for the closeness to the Enmore Theatre months in advance so got a good rate. Room was very clean, bed comfortable and shower great. The room itself was cozy to say the least but for 1 night was no real issue. We had a corner room that looked on to Enmore Rd, which was noisy, till I worked out that our window was open just a bit. As soon as I closed it, there was minimal street noise.I ensured I had parking by booking it well in advance (like 5 months!) and followed up the week before arriving, as there is very limited parking on site. The gentleman who checked us in was very polite and helpful. We left early the next morning and was advised there was a drop box for the key. It is also very conveniently placed for the restaurant and cafe scene around Newtown too. There was an issue of being billed for mini bar purchases that we didn't use, but was sorted with a few emails.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466812899~“Strange decor but good value for money.”~The rooms in this hotel were strangely decorated - as though someone had tried to hard to make it look cool and hip. However, the amenities were brilliant, and the hotel itself is lovely and it is good value for money. We were staying with friends in Sydney but decided to get a hotel to give them a night off, and so we could explore Newtown for ourselves - I would recommend going out in the evening just to see some of the nightlife and attractions - I'd recommend a trip to Young Henrys before dinner (they close fairly early for a pub). The hotel was quiet, well stocked with every thing we could need (even cooking facilities, and a Nespresso pod machine). Bed was super comfy too. :-)~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_466162810~“OK but...not for a longer stay”~The good things: - friendly and helpful staff - excellent location for the local restaurants, shops and bars - very easy access on public transport However : - the areas outside the rooms can be dark and dingy and not helped by the dull, dark paint and missing light bulbs. - the "free mini-bar if you book direct" was only refilled once in the 10 nights I stayed. When I asked about this at reception they promised to have it restocked...but that never happened. So the deal is actually "three cans of beer, 3 soft drinks and a chocolate bar if you book direct"...which really isn't what's advertised. - the room was kept reasonably clean but the carpet is thin and industrial  - the bathroom was a good size but the room was quite small. The online photos show bedside tables but there weren't any - just the wall brackets where they'd been removed. Along with two very uncomfortable metal chairs and nothing else to sit on apart from the bed. - the kitchenette was OK but there was no toaster. When I asked about a toaster at reception I was given a "why would anyone want a toaster?" look. I later overheard one staff member suggesting that you could toast bread on the convection cook-top. That's a good way to set off the smoke alarm ! - this hotel has the slowest lift ever - and only 1 for the whole building. Overall, OK for a short stay if you must be in Newtown but for a longer stay at the same price there are many competitors who offer much better facilities.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_465634426~“Great Location !!”~My wife and I stayed at the Urban Newtown for 3 nights recently and thoroughly enjoyed it.Surrounded by great cafes and restaurants we were spoilt for choices on where to eat.The Urban offer free sweet and savoury snacks at reception all day,including delicious muffins,hot and cold drinks and fresh fruit. The staff were very friendly and helpful and with a train station close by it was easy to get around. We will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465451804~“Funky and clean option for a short stay”~The rooms aren't very big but the kitchenette is well set out and would suit a longer stay. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and the windows were openable. If you book via the hotel the mini-bar is included and they aren't stingy with that - there was a bottle of very good red wine, a couple of beers, soft drink, chips and chocolate. No water, but they'd give you it if you asked, I'm sure. The hotel even has pastry and muffins at Reception for breakfast, something you don't see very often in Sydney hotels. There are loads of places to eat nearby too, and it's close to Newtown station.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_464184876~“I loved this place!”~Booked here as it was the closest we could find to the Canterbury Race track. So pleased we did! I loved this place. Very friendly, helpful staff, offered drinks and pastries etc on arrival and departure. Our room was at the front of the motel, street side, however we did not have any problems with noise, it may have been a quite night?? Room was clean, bed was very comfy. My only complaint is the floor covering, it was a bit sticky underfoot, I think it is because of the type of flooring and certainly not the cleaning! We will definitely stay here again.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463832241~“Expensive mistake”~Was supposed to stay here on monday night for a last minute business trip. Booked the room late sunday night. Apon arrival I was informed Id accidentally booked to stay the sunday night and not the monday. My credit card had been billed, booking was treated as a "no show". Phone call would have been nice as I could have sorted something else out during the day. My mistake, the best they could do was offer me another room at full price. I couldnt afford $300+ per night so I slept in my car. Parking was $40 per night.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462576343~“Hipster-ish”~The hotel was very hipster with up to date facilities. I love where they need your room key to access the lobby after 10PM as it is a happening area. Front desk is not available for 24/7 so please do check in b4 10PM. Upon @ lobby, you will be able to have some treats for free like some bread and butter and coffee. The nearby shops aint that bad and the walking distance to the train station is not bad as well. WiFi is tremendously good here. Overall, I would rate this 8/10. Would recommend anyone to stay here. Just be mindful that there are alot of pubs nearby so be careful at night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462404077~“Good economy accommodation”~The rooms are modern in a way that has a lot of exposed concrete and timber boarding.  The facilities are good with all the basics, tv, air on, good shower room, mini kitchen etc.  If you like Newton and surrounding areas it's a great spot to be based.  We have stayed here several times over the last few years and it does what it says on the tin. I would compare it with Travel Lodge or Travel Inn in U.K. terms.  Newton, Erskinville and the surrounding area is so vibrant with lots of bars, restaurants and shops. There aren't many hotels in this area so if it's where you want to be it's ideal.  There's no bar or pool but there's no shortage of bars on the doorstep and easy bus ride to the beach.  Good value for money.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_461356805~“Close to Sydney University ”~Decent rooms, clean, crisp white linen, well equipped with kitchenette and serviced daily. The double room was very small for 2 people so we upgraded to a king suite. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The rooms facing the street are unbearably noisy!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460798221~“Not worth staying here”~Firstly the room. It was nice enough, very cramped but still nice enough.  That's where the praise ends. My wife and I had to wipe the bottom of our feet before we got into bed because the floor was filthy. The window in our room was leaking water, which from the warped frame clearly showed that it was not a new issue and just hadn't been fixed. The towel rack was coming off, which I was able to push back into the wall and the hot tap in the shower was coming loose which we tightened. But while all of that was disappointing, the most terrible, annoying part of our stay was the parking. My wife called them after we booked the room on booking.com 4 weeks before our stay to confirm a parking spot which they said we had booked. Done and sorted. On our way to the hotel we called to confirm that we did have parking and where it was....yeap all confirmed but we had to park on the street when we first got there to get a pass into the parking. No problems. Get there.... no sorry, there is no parking booked and you'll need to park on the street. We explained to the staff there that we had confirmed by phone 2 hours before that we had a parking spot and asked what had changed in that time. There only answer was it wasn't on the computer. I believe that they just took parking requests on the day until it was filled and then ignored anyone that had actually pre-booked. And from reading other reviews, this is not a one-off instance.  Truly, avoid staying here. You will be greatly disappointed.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460766499~“Urban Newtown in February”~Have just spent 3 days at this hotel. Couldn't be more satisfied. Staff were pleasant and helpful, rooms comfortable and well appointed.

review_459568223~“Dodgy area, grotty little reception, horrible staff, my confirmed booking CANCELLED when I tried to check i!!!”~What a horrible place. A grotty building facade, a dingy, depressing little reception and rude staff. My booking was confirmed but when I tried to call check-in, I was told my booking had been rejected and the hotel was full!!! It was 7.15 in the evening and I was without anywhere to stay. Reception staff hardly apologised and then said there was somewhere available in King's Cross! No thanks - had enough of rat holes just walking into this horrible place. YUCK. Not recommended.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458417558~“OSB = OMG”~Architect self immolation The minimalist proposed design and décor has fialed. Nay, it tanked. Well, OK, some may mouth platitudes but it leaves moi cold, metaphysically and real. There is little , in our opinion, that says style when construction boarding is used, no matter the cachet of sanding and urethanening basic oriented strand board. With faux steel and no way to get the telephone ot work, we left our brief $ 35 drive from airport hotel and returned to Malton to go to N.Z., where nature has no need of re-imagining.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457280106~“Quirky”~Well located near the train station and within walking distance to both the Enmore Theatre and major strip of King Street. Very friendly and helpful staff who let me check in early. Rooms are small but well designed/layed out with a funky modern feel. Free amenities including wifi/tv/toiletry products were all good. Just a small amount of mould in the shower was the only negative. Would stay here again~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_457031955~“Funky and friendly”~This hotel is ideally placed in the heart of Newtown within easy reach of trains, buses, shops, cafes and restaurants. The design is industrial and urban as the name suggests. Rooms are comfortable and have everything you need.  The drinks and snacks offered in the lobby is a highlight. I had trouble when the air con leaked all over the desk in my room, onto electrical equipment and books. The staff could not have been more helpful in dealing with this. Thanks once again for your help.  Great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452736857~“Modern Funky Hotel”~Stayed here in December for 4 nights & loved it. The Hotel itself is a short walk from the centre of Newtown & is very modern & unique. Our room was lovely, small but big enough for the 2 of us. Well stocked free mini bar. Huge comfy bed & all mod cons, very clean. Excellent air con which was much needed. Reception staff were always very friendly & helpful & offered beer, wine, fruit and snacks which is always available in the reception. Free WiFi too which was great, many places only give limited WiFi, but not the Urban Newtown. I highly recommend this hotel & would not hesitate in staying here again when i'm next in Sydney.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452005286~“Location.”~Checked into the The Urban for a 1 night stay prior to a concert at The Enmore Theatre. Very friendly welcome, offered a beer, wine, fruit and snacks. Our upgraded room was spacious and extremely clean.  The hotel has a very industrial feel to it whilst also quirky . It was in a great location, walking distance to shops and restaurants and conveniently located to the theatre. All the staff that we spoke to where very helpful with restaurant recommendations etc.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_450652799~“Great location. Rooms are terrific.”~Close to the Enmore and many nice restaurants. Great location.Limited parking available though. If you need parking, make sure you request it at booking. The room was newly referred, nice furniture, bed was great. Terrific bathroom, all very modern.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450495502~“First stay in Australia!”~Remarkable  Truly an amazing beginning to our trip around Australia! Booked with Urban Newtown on a whim and were just looking to rest our heads after traveling for 4 long days from the states. Nadal, at the front desk, was a total delight, smiling from ear to ear as he talked to each guest. He helped us from finding good eats around town to figuring out reputable websites to buy a van from so we could begin our surf roadtrip along the coast. Then, to our surprise, as we were booking a second night, Nadal then tells us we were being upgraded to the penthouse suite! As if this trendy boutique hotel wasn’t great enough, we then walked into our new room, nothing short of extraordinary and fully equipped with everything you would need to cook relax and enjoy the view. The place reminded us of a hip hotel in bushwick New York but better. Def recommend this spot to anyone traveling to Sydney. Great location, staff and hotel ☺~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443198114~“It's a good venue - could be better, but like it just the same!”~You may find some reviews a little confusing, particularly when some reviewers positively hate the place. Urban is a good joint, but let's go a little further. - Some complain about the size of the rooms. Make no mistake, for Sydney standards the rooms are very spacey - The cleanliness standard is excellent - All other fittings are well appointed, right down the Nespresso coffee machine (even if the pods supplied are as weak as dishwater, just use 2 or 3 What you need to prepare for: - If you are traveling in a car, be prepared that there is no set-down area, and the front street becomes a clear way after 3PM - If you phone to make enquiries, your call will most likely be answered in the Philipines. This is a silly cost-cutting measure, considering the guy behind reception doesn't have much to do, and is very helpful - This is not a quiet venue. Newtown is quite busy late into the night, so if you are staying on a weekend expect some yahooing in the back alley. The tiles in front of the room are also very loud, especially at night. Also, there is no underlay under the carpet, to speak of, so even people walking above you will come through loudly. - If you are taller than, say, 5'6 then watch out for the ridiculous light fitting close to the window. It is low enough, and close enough to the bed that you will hit it with your head several times. Other than that, if you're unfamiliar with Newtown, this is a great location. Plenty of restaurants close by - one of my favourite parts of Sydney.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_439836154~“An excellent stop in Newtown”~There are not many hotels in this area, but if you need to stay here or want to be a bit out of the CBD and near the railway (5min walk), this is a really good choice. Industrial in design and minimalist in furnishing, it is a clean modern hotel with plenty of space and a comfortable bed. Free croissants and muffins in the foyer is a nice if somewhat unusual touch. Staff are really friendly and helpful. The rooms have a very basic kitchen, one pot one fry pan from memory, two hot plates and a microwave - so you couldn't really feed yourself there for a week :-) Pod coffee is a nice upmarket addition. The shower has good hot water and nice strong water flow. The hotel offers parking - but the website does not mention that it cost $40 per night and you have to book as there are only six spaces. The windows do open ( a small amount) so you can get some fresh air, though that come with increased noise from the street. Book online, direct with the hotel, and you get the contents of the minibar free ! A bottle of wine, two beers, cider, soft drink and chips - easy $40 worth. Strangely the card slot to activate the lights and power was not located just inside the door - it was across the room on the fuse box above the kitchen sink. . The only issue we had was that the design of our room meant that the air conditioner blew cold air directly onto the bed, even on lowest fan setting, no matter how we set the angle.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
