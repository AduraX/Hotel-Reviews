review_478476562~“Incredible and Quirky Hotel!”~Stayed at the QT Sydney with my partner for her birthday. The staff and location are fantastic. The hotel and rooms are quirky and amazing. The bar joined to the Hotel is also incredible. I would definitely come back again!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478454803~“A welcoming funky Sydney hotel”~We were welcomed by a consistently friendly team at QT . The decor and style of the hotel interior is detailed and quite unique with lots of special features including different songs playing in the lift . We had a spotlessly clean deluxe king room on the eighth floor which has an engaging and warm fit out and windows on two sides .  The room was well stocked and comfortable however it would benefit from more bathroom supplies such as soap in the powder room. Also three coffee pods only was strange for a room booked for two people . The concierges recommendation for Sunday lunch and Monday breakfast were superb.  This was a good fun hotel for one night in Sydney on our way to the Blue Mountains .~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_478109517~“Singing Lift”~As always, this hotel feels like another world after a hard day at work. Love the warm friendly welcome from all and of course the singing lift (which always seems to sense just what music is needed! Felt like a princess in my beautiful room with its fluffy blanket~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477244676~“Amazing hotel!”~The staff, the hotel, the location all amazing our room was upgraded for us which was a nice touch. We had an awesome view of the qvb building from our window. I would recommend staying here if you are in Sydney and like a nice hotel with a bit of quirkiness.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476788668~“Great place for a weekend getaway”~Stayed with my partner for a weekend getaway for my birthday. We had a great fineness and did not really even leave the hotel for most of the time. The rooms are very uniquely decorated as is the unique vibe of the hotel so it may not be to everyone's taste, I feel like the younger demographics would appreciate more. The service from staff was also great.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476751948~“Simply amazing”~We were welcomed here by super friendly and most helpful staff. Stunning accommodation. The restaurant was lovely with great food. Got stung by the drinks paid $26 for a glass of champagne without knowing. When I questioned this, the staff didn't seem to care. Great location and very stylish rooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476750543~“Mid week trip”~Ow. Why n unusual place.  The old Gowings building converted into an awesome eclectic lodging.  The rooms are fresh and fun.  Ensuite modern and functional.  All in all a great stay.  Be ready to be confused and amazed all in one.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476616105~“Gowing's Bar and Grill / Gilt Lounge”~QT Sydney is an amazing, quirky and fun hotel! I recently dined at Gowing's Bar and Grill on a Saturday night and the place had a real buzz about it. The food was some of the best I have had in Sydney and it won't break the bank either! Staff were very attentive and made sure we were well looked after from start to finish. We ended the evening with a great cocktail upstairs in Gilt lounge where we were also very well looked after. I already have and would recommend Gowing's Bar and Grill and Gilt Lounge to anyone!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476415700~“Always a pleasure.”~Staying at the QT is always a pleasure. The staff is always happy to help and the decor is sexy, quirky and interesting. We have stayed at the QT Sydney numerous times over the years and it still holds up to its charm, nothing has dated, nor is it looking tired. Can't wait to check in again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475725717~“Big on style, not enough focus on comfort”~At the outset I have to say this hotel is near the corner of Market and George Streets in the Sydney CBD and while the major construction work is underway in George Street, there is always going to be significant noise. But, when putting in requested amenities as part of the 'online check-in', I asked for two things - a quiet room and low-profile pillows. The hotel has been created between the State Theatre and the old Gowings clothing store, indeed the restaurant and bar is still called Gowings. The decor is exceptionally quirky.  Reception is on the first floor and getting into the lifts is the first shock to the system - very loud music and a light show. That's tolerable for the most part, except being hit with that the following morning after a less than optimal night's sleep was a little hard to take. The receptionist told me my room had been upgraded. OK. That's nice. I was a little unnerved when I found the room overlooked Market Street but the windows are double-glazed.  The rooms are exceptionally out there. Mood lighting, sheepskin on the bed, walk-in showers, large bed. The air-con was also very effective - excellent for a hot Sydney day. But the sleep quality and functionality of the very modern bathroom the next day just didn't cut it. The noise from the roadworks was very annoying - especially as it became most apparent in the early hours of the morning, rather too late to ring up reception and ask to be moved. There were sliding mirrored panels separating the bedroom from the bathroom. These fogged up immediately the shower started running so trying to use the mirrors to get ready was virtually useless. It seems very odd that a huge amount of money has obviously been spent on refurbishing this building but there's no steam extraction in the bathrooms. There was also no express check-out offered. Having to stand in line with only one person manning the desk seems to be pretty poor. If you're in town for business, you want to head off in the morning to do, well, business.  I was also told my tax invoice would be emailed to me. Three weeks later I'm still waiting. There's a lot to enjoy about this hotel if you're a lover of creative kitsch and value style but there's very little in terms of luxe fit outs or groovy music that can beat a good night's sleep and a functional space.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475692552~“Fun, Quirky, Awesome Staff”~Hotel was super fun with their decoration, they let us check in a few hours before actual check-in time, very accomodating, located extremely well- right near a train station and central to get around in the city, only a short walk to about everywhere. overall a great stay. There's a restaurant as well, we did not eat in it but the cafe below is awesome~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_475114172~“Bit of a Fail”~This hotel has the makings of something great but just really falls short. Firstly, check in staff were wonderful, got us into our room in no time. The room - quirky and dark. As a male with lots of females in my family the room was so dark there would of been nowhere for them to apply makeup. Lights were out in the bathroom which added to the darkness. The quirky ornaments were full of dust. The worst part was the rude door staff commenting on passers by like heckling crows from a cartoon, I even heard one of them comment about their guests "they're staying here?"  The upside was the dining room and bar staff were stellar. Maybe they could teach their door staff hospitality.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474833262~“Sophisticated City Bolthole”~Aimed at the hipster in all of us , this slick contemporary hotel is located within the heart of the Sydney CBD's retail heart and the State Theatre. Perfect for staying in town if you are enjoying a show next door and much more appealing than the Swiss Hotel across the road. Rooms are moody and comfortable with great toiletries. Excellent cocktails and delicious breakfast.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474545414~“Love! ”~This place is awesome! Our kids loved the bath and robes. It's central location and amazing decor made it quite the experience for us. The staff are super friendly and we will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474506976~“Wouldn't return ”~We stayed here for two nights. Most of the staff was exceedingly nice and accommodating (amazingly nice) but the restaurant was quite rude and full of themselves. The hotel is dark and moody (by design) which is a mismatch for the vibe that you get anywhere else in Sydney. Plus our room looked out onto a brick wall (totally normal in a city for some rooms but for the price and room level, a real let down). I couldn't wait to get out into the light and on to our next hotel. If you are catching a show at the theatre and want to stumble a few feet to your hotel or perhaps if you need to be in the area for business, this is the place for you. Otherwise, might not be your best option.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474404773~“Amazing place, highlight of our trip”~Stayed 3 nights at QT as part of a work trip. Our whole group were really impressed with the funky fit-out and cool vibe around the place. Room was quite spacious and well appointed. Staff were extremely friendly and efficient. Bar was great and we ate dinner one night in their Gowings restaurant which was also spot-on for our group.  Would definitely return on a private trip.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474394036~“Our new Go-to in Sydney”~Great spot; professional, relaxed and confident staff.  Rooms are well designed and spacious. The bar is cool with very knowledgable bar tenders and the restuarant has nailed it. We'll only stay here from now on~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473094900~“Ready to give a 5 star rating but one person made me change my mind...”~QT Sydney is a great hotel with a superb location (for shopping and Darling Harbour). I have spend 6 nights so gave me plenty of time to evaluate this place. What struck me at first glance was the authenticity of this place, indeed the 2 old buildings have been transformed but still the original atmosphere remains. You will feel welcomed by the somewhat dark mysterious look and the original funiture which may seem ecclectic but fits perfectly. I received an Executive room on the 8th floor: spacious, bed in the middle of the room (you must like that), a big well created bathroom with rainshower and huge bath. All that you need for business or leasure is at hand (a Sydney map in the room would be handy). Only downside of this room (825) was the elevator noice so if you are a light sleeper ask for a different room. The Check- In team, the Breakfast team, the Bar team are going all the way to make you stay comfortable: friendly and helpfull. What made me change my mind giving the topscore was the check out: at Check- In I have requested a very late check out (till 7.30 pm) and was prepared to pay for it as I needed to do some work before my late night flight. This was confirmed by the Check -In team and guaranteed by my credit card. However on that last day I was phoned by the Reception Manager that I had to move out of my room (4 pm) as my room was reserved for another guest. Apparently their reservation system had not captured my request, however the thing that made me reduce the rating was the rude, unfriendly way the Reception Manager brought the message. A mistake by the hotel became a mistake by the customer with absolutely now intention to offer a solution. In the end after long unnecessary discussions the problem was solved but the damage was done. If you are working in the hospitality business customer comes always first and you never try to cover up your problem. A fine hotel but wrong reception management.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_473038333~“Funky, cool but not for business travellers. Save for holidays”~The QT network is brilliant, and their Canberra hotel is one of the best business hotels in the country. The Sydney QT is beautifully crafted and integrated into two classical buildings in a beautiful way. The rooms are well laid out and the bathroom is a joy, but the rooms themselves are cluttered meaning floorspace is at a premium. A chair fewer, removing the massive wooden block end of bed coffee table and taking away the mountains of cushions on the bed would ease the tension. The desk is a reasonable size and plenty of powerpoints for the road warrior toolkit. The lamps are well located but the squeezed furniture means getting to reach the powercord mounted on-off switch is a challenge. So far so good, but then try and use the hotel bar and restaurant. Two nights in a row i tried to dine there and could not get in as the place was packed out with locals for whom the Gowings bar and grill is social central. While that is great for the hotel, guests need to look offsite. Fortunately simply crossing the strret brings you to the Swisshotel Sydney, whose lobby bar and restuarant is beautiful, quiet and spacious - the perfect place for a business meal or solo dinner whilst reviewing the day. When you are ready to party, the QT's Gowings bar is still there and surely if you wait long enough you will gain entry once the local social set has moved on. If you are holidaying in Sydney, the QT is well worth considering, but avoid for business trips when timely service and access matters.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472772971~“Looks great, but left a little disappointed..”~Stayed on Level 9 but was located near the elevators so it was a little noisy, especially when things would rattle in the room. The lighting is obviously for 'mood' but it would be great if it could be on a dimmer or something so it could be brighter at night. Also, the beds are VERY soft. Nice to sit on for a bit but not everyone will like sleeping on it. Went to Gowings Bar and Grill for drinks which were great, even though it took a while for my partner to be served with nobody else waiting. Breakfast was fantastic as it's very fast and delicious! The QT Spa is amazing, I would highly recommend paying them a visit during your stay as the massage I had was great. Also, don't see a difference between a King and King Deluxe. We booked the Deluxe thinking it would be slightly bigger as it says you can have a rollaway bed, but when got to our room it looked exactly the same as the King room images on the websites. There was no way you would be able to fit a rollaway unless they were right next to you, in the hallway or in front of the bathroom. Not sure if I'll stay at Sydney again, but may give its Port Douglas resort a go eventually.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_471654478~“Qt - Quite Terrific”~Qt is on Market Street, in the heart of the CBD. Built from the old State Theatre, which is still there, this is a historic building with an ultra trendy hotel now jostling alongside the tradition. Our room, on the 7th floor was a treat. The bed is huge and the gel mattress is simply great! You will not want to get up in the morning!! The complimentary movies, featuring up to date oscar nominated choices is first class and something other hotels would do well to follow. Staff are friendly, trendy and informative. Although the hotel does not have it's own gym/pool, access to the nearby Virgin Active Club is free for guests and the facilities here are superb. We had breakfast in the ground floor cafe and drinks in Dowlings restaurant and bar, which again, attracts a lively crowd. Clearly given location and style, rooms are not the cheapest but this is a great hotel in a great location and we really enjoyed our stay.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_471391835~“Hip, fun, and quirky - new favorite place to stay in Sydney CBD”~We just spent three fabulous nights at the QT Sydney - a centrally located, hip and quirky CBD hotel. We loved the service - from the bell staff to concierge, everyone we met was energetic and eager to help! PROS: 1) Large, airy rooms with modern, sleek bathrooms - we were in two adjoining King Executive rooms. Hardwood floors, long entryways, high ceilings, and cool decor. The "gel" beds were incredibly comfortable. The bathroom had a separate walk-in shower and stand alone tub, and I liked the contrast between the dark tile and the lighter fixtures. The bath amenities were also top notch.  2) Location - The hotel is located on a big intersection right in the heart of the shopping district and next door to the QVB center with more shops and dining. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby, and both Darling Harbour and the Circular Quay are a brisk walk away. 2) Staff and service - check in was a breeze and the staff (especially in front of the hotel) were fantastic! The Australian premiere of Beauty and the Beast happened at the State Theatre right next door and the staff was eager to take photos of us with all the decorations set up outside. CONS: 1) As other commentators have mentioned, the rooms could do with a bit more lighting.  2) Late check-out - not a huge deal, but when the hotel is exceptionally busy, they are pretty strict on check out times, even for those with membership status as we had. Would have been nice for them to accommodate an extra 30 minutes.  Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay at the QT Sydney - it made for a memorable end of our short time in Sydney experience!~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_471296380~“Outstanding!”~On arrival at the curb we were met by a happy friendly member of staff to direct us with the parking and check in process. The room was amazing, lovely art deco design and well thought out appointments. Every comfort was thought of. The lighting was beautiful. The rooms were a good size and really quiet. It was easy to feel like we were in a secret sanctuary. The service was 5 star, nothing was too much trouble and everyone we encountered was friendly. We had breakfast in the restaurant and the service, menu and quality were impressive. The location is amazing, you are close to everything here. This hotel is so well thought out and so different from your generic and very beige 5 star hotel. It is an experience, not just a hotel. well done QT, we can't wait to come back (or maybe move in) :)~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_470307582~“Old fashioned glamour”~We arrived at midnight after a long flight and were greeted by friendly door staff at the front of the hotel which was excellently positioned in the centre of the city. The receptionist quickly checked us into a large, corner room. The style throughout the hotel was fantastic from the old fashioned suitcases and wall of drawers in the lobby to the music and lights in the lift to the Art Deco / glam bedrooms.given the location of the hotel and the fact it was fully booked the rooms were so quiet we had a great sleep all 3 nights of our stay. The hotel's gowing bar offered a great breakfast each morning and great selection of drinks in the evenings. We even had the pleasure of brekkie with an old English footballer :) The hotel is excellently positioned in the hub of all the shops and 10-15mins walk to the harbour/opera house in one direction& china town in the other.  We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and the complementary drink & card were a lovely surprise. Thank you to the QT team.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470166615~“Quite Trendy!!!!”~When you arrive to the hotel over 2 hours late you're not off to a great start!! We were warmly welcome by the great staff and received a generous upgrade for our brief stay Nothing was a problem for any of the staff - they were great and made our stay most enjoyable It's a little out there in style but the upgraded corner room was amazing!!! Speaking with the friendly director of chaos she told me that the company have many other properties around Australia If this is the quality of service you receive at the QT group i'll be coming back for sure!! Don't know much about the other properties but QT Sydney is trendy funky and fun!!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_469985853~“QT Sydney”~QT Sydney is the perfect hotel for those liking a bit of drama in their lives. From the dressed up doorpeople to the cocktail ingredients in your room, every detail is designed to maximize fun. The location is excellent, and the food and beverage outlets good too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469724722~“Very unique hotel”~QT Sydney is not like any other big name 5 stars hotel. They're uniquely decorated to special liking. The room is very special is probably for lovers or honeymooner. The lightning in the room definitely need some improvement. Is way too dark and you cannot see clearly during the night even with all the lights switch on.  The restaurant food is amazing. Love it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469460127~“Modern chic”~This hotel is very cool. A boutique hotel but very modern and trendy in its decor. The gel bed was extremely comfortable!  The size of the room, especially the bathroomn was very generous even in the basic king room that I stayed in! The bar at Gowings Bar & Grill had a great vibe, with attentive & friendly bartenders and an impressive wine & cocktail list!  My one & only issue was that the rainwater shower head in my room wouldn't work and the alternate shower head was awkward to use as it was very small and you couldn't adjust the angle of it at all and as a result water went all over half the bathroom floor.  A great boutique hotel though in a good central location. Will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468613087~“Funky Hotel”~My wife and I have just stayed 3 nights in a corner room at the QT Sydney. This is a funky upbeat hotel that we have loved. Great staff, great location, great rooms. This will be our Sydney hotel for future visits. Highly recommended.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468511547~“Hotel With Difference at good location”~Stayed for couple of nights on business trip. The Hotel is surely different that typical hotels and frankly I was worried when I saw the entrance.  Check in was fine. they surprisingly charged 50 AUD for early checkin, It happened to me for first time specially in such an expensive hotel, but I didn't have patience to think about it after hectic 20 hours travel.  The room was spacious, quiet, clean and well decorated. It was a different experience. The bed was too soft for me but I was sooo tired I didn't bother. It could be a challenge for someone who is particular about it.  The location is excellent and in the middle of town where malls and restaurants are all around.  In all it was good experience.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468464387~“Thank you”~Visited Sydney for one night for our 25th anniversary. Absolutely thrilled to receive a lovely room upgrade on arrival with a warm welcome from the check in staff. Then to enter our beautiful room and find a bottle of champagne chilling in an ice bucket made us feel extra special. I've never experienced anything like this from a hotel before. Every single staff member we encountered was friendly and professional. On returning home, I realised I may have left my favourite top in the bathroom. I emailed the hotel on the slim chance that it may have been found and surprise surprise it had been found and is being posted to me. We have been regular visitors to QT Gold Coast since it opened and couldn't imagine how any other hotel could be as good but QT Sydney is up there. It's not just the decor and comfort of the hotel that make it so interesting and unique. All of the staff must be chosen for their very caring and warm qualities. Fabulous!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468453004~“What a change from a traditional "corporate" hotel!”~Super conveniently located, with friendly staff more than happy to lend a hand, my arrival experience was great... and then I walked into my room and was blown away! What a vibe! Super funky fit out with the most eclectic range of mini items available - I guess you never know when you'll need a bow tie! The gym was a little cramped tucked away upstairs with no windows, but if it weren't for the rain, I would have been outdoors running. Having eaten at Gowings previously, I can vouch for both the wine list and quality of the food. Would recommend the QT in a heartbeat!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_468433924~“Excellent with a lit of quirky features”~Fabulous city location. Close to Queen Victoria Building, Westfield, David Jones, Myers and the Pitt St Mall. More shops, restaurants and tourist attractions than you can possible take advantage of. Fabulous modern design around historical background - seriously worth seeing. Staff are very helpful, breakfast in Gowings Grill is so good and is the best value breakfast we have experienced in any 4 or 5 star hotel. The rooms are also like a little art gallery. Excellent bathroom with bath. One down side is the low lighting. Very atmospheric but hard to read by and hard to do make up by!!! If you are driving it is a little tricky but is works. Take the valet parking. Seriously just pull in front and put your hazard lights on. The valet will come. But a warning- drive slow, do not get to George St. Stop just past the entrance to a Wilsons car park in Market St. The car park is not the one so don't go in - just stop. There is no grand entrance with reception is on the 1st floor so just stop and wait for 1 minute. Overall we were totally impressed. The theme and the preservation of some great features is to be commended. Next time we will dine in the Grill as the food is great. Also good is a coffee shop/bar on the ground floor level which I don't think is part of the hotel but worth a visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467967039~“Quite quirky”~Street access to come in to reception not very clear on entry.

review_467935945~“How can I ever stay anywhere else?”~QT Hotel is the hotel that makes anything else seem inferior. From the moment you arrive the service is so efficient and pleasant it's a revelation! And the rooms! Is there anything comparable in Australia? A bit like a modern take on Kismet, the rooms almost seem too good for my well worn suitcase. From the DIY cocktail to the glass cabinet of gorgeous vases, not to mention the snuggly hooded bathrobes, the QT leaves other Sydney hotels I've stayed at for dead. My only regret was not having more time to enjoy this divine gem in the centre of Sydney's vast CBD. A quick walk from Town Hall station and the QVB and just a few blocks from Hyde Park. Did I mention the deep bathtub and large shower? Superb amenities and quirky minibar selections, if the budget stretches that far? Definitely a place you must try on a Sydney visit. Just try to make it longer than one night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467763113~“Location, Location!”~Located right in the city in the midst of Pitt Street and the QVB and not far from darling harbour, this hotel doesn't disappoint! Quirky is one word I would use for it! The beds are like CLOUDS!!!! And the mini bar stocked with an array of delicious drinks and food. The room was quiet, and dark (block out curtains) I had the best sleep ever. I was travelling with my parents, Mum had a day spa treatment and raved about it. The bar service was friendly and quick. I also really liked the email pre-check in asking for preferences such as lower level or higher level room, what type of pillows I wanted in the room etc. Very nice. You won't get massive harbour views or anything here - but you will definitely have a great stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467672899~“Beard trim”~I was lucky to have Leslie for a quick beard trim as time was short. She was accommodating, welcoming and knew exactly what to do even when I wasn't too sure in my explanation to her. I would definitely recommend going. The facilities have that vintage feel of an old school barber. The price isn't too bad for the attention to detail shown by the staff. Will be going in for a haircut as well next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_466667860~“Great Bar and atmosphere”~We spent an afternoon at the QT bar and had a great time. I can't comment on the hotel as we didn't stay there but the bar is great. Good service, great atmosphere, relaxed, cool and with music but no so that you can't hear conversation, which is all important for me. OK, there is no harbour or ocean view but for a city centre bar its ideal and we will go here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466646261~“Step back but look forward”~Had two nights here and it was different, art-deco with a look to the future. The relaxed entry from Market St. Assisted by the attentive door people, very cool. The whole place reminds of the best film noir settings without the bad guys. Room was great, I really took to the whole idea of this place. Staff were good, restaurant could have had a little more light at the table but food was spot on. Sydney not the greatest city in Australia but the QT is certainly a hotel that makes it worth the visit. One more thing the city centre is a construction nightmare at the moment but from our room all we had was peace.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

There is a really cool, funky vibe through the building, including reception, rooms, bar and even the lifts. Our room was awesome, well appointed and even had an espresso martini kit in the room!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464946786~“Hip Hip Horray!!”~You will love the QT! It screams cool from the moment you pull up to the kerb. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city and across from the main shopping precinct. Given this area is quite busy, arriving was quite simple. Just pull up out the front and have your car valet parked. It's the easiest option.  We arrived before check in and our car was taken care of and our bags were taken upstairs. Once we arrived back at the hotel everything was ready for us. There is also an area where guests can wait.  Our room was fab. Very dark and sensual. The bathroom was large and well equipped. You have to lounge around in the robes, so comfy. The toiletries were Malin + Goertz. Just be a bit careful around the shower area - there is no closed in shower screen so the water tends to get everywhere. There was a free standing bath as well.  The bedroom area was large with an awesome mini bar with all sorts of cool things.  We ate at the breakfast each day and i didn't think it was amazing but the others were happy with theirs. I just thought it would be better than it was.  Definitely head to the bar for a few drinks. The wait staff are great and gave us some suggestions for unique cocktails. There is also another bar on an upper level.  I would definitely stay here again - loved it.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_464884250~“Fantastic hotel, but don't bother with the presidential suite”~We have stayed here many times, its a really great hotel in a really good central location. We decided to treat ourselves with the Presidential Suite this time, unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations at all. The fit out is nice, but not practical, we had to rearrange the furniture to watch a movie. The bath is pretty average for a suite. The roof leaked in 2 places and dripped all night. When we told the hotel, they were kind enough to cover some room service but the response, 'that it has never leaked before' seemed odd. Why would it matter to us if it had happened before? The lounge has stains on it and needs to be cleaned or replaced. We wished we didn't go all out. The other rooms are cosier and much better value.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_464677766~“Hip Hotel in the Heart of Sydney”~Think pre-war Berlin meets New York chic, this hotel is super cool. Sydney has some great spaces which are unused or under used and hotel is located in one, above the state theatre and in the old Gowings store. It is funky and hip but the service is great. Normally one finds the staff at hip new venues too cool for their own good but someone who knows about service has obviously been working with this group, they were friendly, helpful and chatty without seeming plastic or working to a "Have a nice day,now" script. It is a quirky hotel with loads of character but that does not detract from the amenity. They have, in my view, the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, and I have tried the Savonia beds at the Savoy. It was like sleeping on a cloud. The bathrooms are well laid out and spacious. We had breakfast at the Gowings restaurant and that was impressive, not only for the pervasive helpful nature of the staff but the food was well prepared, arrived efficiently and was the coffee was expertly done. I used the gymnasium, as is often the case in hotels it appears an afterthought but there are adequate numbers of well maintained cardio machines (treadmill, cycles and elliptical trainers). Great location in the centre of town but parking is a bit problematic. There is valet Parking but it is nearly $70 which is a bit steep. Loved the place and will be back.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464657094~“Modern and Comfortable Trendy Hotel in Central CBD”~My wife and I stayed one night mid-week in February. This was our first time staying at the QT. We were seeing a show at the Opera House, and while the location is not really an easy walk (25minutes) buses regularly run along Elizabeth St so that was fine. The QT is in the old Gowings building on Market St and I understand the hotel to be only around 4 years old. It is certainly very well appointed and is targeting a younger more trendy clientele than us, as we are in our mid-sixties. None-the-less we were made feel very welcome by the young staff, and the Concierge was particularly obliging. Regrettably our Opera House show was on Valentines Day so the room was quite expensive (I didn't realise at the time of booking the show). We received an upgrade and the room we were allocated was spacious, beautifully appointed and very quiet and the bed very comfortable. The lighting was subdued (i.e. very very low lit) which would not suit some. The decor was also quite dark so the dim light made locating things a little tricky, especially probably given our aged eyes. But, the room was peaceful and very pleasant, but one didn't really find inclined to stay and read etc - not that we were there for that. I think in-house movies were free. Valet Parking was available and cost $70.00. You need to let the staff know about an hour before you want your car, but they are not keen to get rid of your car on check-out, which was a pleasant surprise. We enjoyed our stay, and I would recommend the hotel given its appointments, furnishings and the location. We are seeing another show at the Opera House in April and we have chosen to stay here again, at a much reduced price too now being a member of the Priority Guest Rewards loyalty program (and it not being Valentine's Day too I guess).~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_464364898~“Great hotel and good location”~The QT is different, which was my main requirement after years of traveling to Sydney and staying in beige same same hotels. The location is good, nice and central, an easy walk to most palaces. Service was great~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464205309~“Hip and Chic and friendly staff”~Have always wanted to stay at QT Sydney and had the opportunity last Friday night. My husband and I arrived before lunch and were advised that our room was ready and we could check in. We had included valet parking in our stay and this was attended to promptly and efficiently. We were welcomed by a friendly staff member and our luggage and car were swiftly taken care of. The staff were all friendly and efficient. The porter went to great length to explain how everything worked in our room, which we appreciated. We loved the room and the decor in the hotel. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and although the menu was quite modern and adventurous we found something that we liked. (We are plain eaters). Breakfast was a la carte and by the way not included in the Priviledge Card discounts although the room rate and dinner and lunch were. (Well worth joining and it is free to join). The hotel is in a great spot, over the road from the City shops and close to Darling Harbour. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and congratulate the management and staff for a well run hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464145752~“Too cool for it's own good”~Read Aleck D's review and add a +1 from me. This is a hotel for people who wear their sunglasses to breakfast. (no kidding I saw one) Get to the hotel - is this the entrance? Yes, according to the hipster in the beret at street level.  Assaulted in the lift with loud music, ok but what floor am I on?  Check into room and the creepy hand holding your room number is a little off-putting - but I guess it's meant to be hip?  Bar fridge not working, luckily I wasn't interested in a bottle of Mumm. Fairly certain there was overcharging at the bar, attempted in the restaurant and again on check out. No towel rail but hey, the bathroom design is 'on pointe' and the bed A+ for comfort and pillows. Conversation over dinner? Hell no because the music is blaring. Chat with colleagues over drinks? Afraid not because in the bar the volume is higher than an AC/DC concert. Glad this was on the company card and not my own money. Just a little bit too try-hard for me. I accept certain types will love it.~2~nan~5~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_463319938~“Maybe more for business stays?”~Firstly, bar staff were exceptional and friendly and very attentive. Couldn't have met happier, nicer people in my life. Rooms are clean, fun and eclectic. Just what you'd expect from the QT.  Bathtub plug wouldn't close though so I couldn't take a bath, oh well. When booking we mentioned it was our wedding night, we had a really small, low key, middle-of-the-week wedding in the city, but not a single congrats was given at reception.  I've stayed at more budget places that were more congratulatory on a special occasion with a free bottle on arrival or *something*. Reception here must have thought I was in a white dress for jokes. For the bonkers price we paid we didn't feel that special.~3~nan~5~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_463300571~“Glitzy Glam Hotel”~Funky hotel with glamorous staff. Extremely efficient. Wonderful restaurant with a great upper level bar only open Wednesdays - Sunday's with a great pre club atmosphere. Rooms are spacious. But the most wonderful thing was the bed. Be warned , its soon incredibly comforting that with the very good blackout curtains, you'll sleep for many many hours an miss out on seeing the fab city!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462604336~“Funky”~Stayed a few nights here recently. The hotel is definitely different. Boutique with a twist of eccentricity. Staff all very friendly. Rooms comfortable. Only problem I had with the place was that the lighting is TOO moody especially if you want to do some business work. After awhile, you were quite glad to get out into the sunshine! Other than that, it is well worth the money. Great little bar down stairs too.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_461878840~“I can't say enough good things about this place”~I was absolutely blown away by my whole experience at QT Sydney. The front desk team was lovely and helpful, the room... STUNNING. Quirky and beautiful, with a tub in the bathroom that was to DIE for! Every time I left or returned to the building the team at the front door had a cheerful greeting for me.  I unhesitatingly recommend QT to anyone that's thinking of staying there. The location is brilliant, close to everything, and I just loved everything about my stay.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461384940~“Beautiful rooms”~I enjoyed my 2 stays at the QT Sydney in February a lot. The building is fantastic the location really good. The rooms were great and well appointed with beautiful bathrooms and nice and fluffy black bathrobes with a hoodie, loved them! Breakfast was acceptable, the bread was fried and very tough to digest in the morning, no fresh orange juice and a bit overpriced. If you go downstairs for breakfast it's better, faster and cheaper. Overall highly recomendable.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan

review_461051032~“FABULOUS CENTRAL LOCATION”~Great location right in the centre of the city. Decor a mix of quirky art deco, mod contemporary with a little morocco thrown in. Definitely a talking point. Bathroom was too dark for applying makeup and had to resort to small mirror in front of window(suggest Hotel install lit makeup mirror on swing arm). Staff wonderfully friendly. Room was quiet. Hotel great for an intimate get-away.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_461011441~“THE BED IS AMAZING!!!!!!”~Ok, the whole hotel is amazing but oh my god, we wanted to steal the bed!  Staff were fantastic, they were always smiling and helpful-but quirky, not your normal hotel staff apartment was clean and funky! The amenities were amazing, perfect for couples!  The only thing I can say that is negative is the rooms are lit in a funky moody way - so my wife said makeup is hard to do!  If your looking for not your average, but still very up market hotel... STAY HERE!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461007163~“My Sydney retreat”~QT is a quirky hotel right in the middle of the city (suits me for work). It's become a regular little haunt of mine. You leave the bustle of the city behind hind you as soon as you arrive at the first floor reception. The beds are awesome, the staff friendly, styling might not be to everybody's taste but the rooms are super quiet, free movies and always immaculately clean. It is a real city escape.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460602626~“Quirky and great value”~Our second stay here in a few months. We loved it first time and it didn't disappoint second time around. Staff are very friendly, efficient and helpful. Our deluxe king room was spacious and the decor is Art Deco/New York nightclub - lots of fun, but if you are after light and bright you should be aware it is quite dark. The bed is comfortable and there is a choice of pillow types. The bathroom had a rain shower and separate freestanding bath, and double basins. The toiletries are deluxe quality, but as happened on the previous stay, were not replaced for the second day which is a slight irritant when you realise there is no shower gel. For a mid city location the room was super quiet. Breakfast is excellent with some really interesting twists on the more usual offerings, and plenty of healthy options. The loyalty program has useful and immediate benefits, so do sign up.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460315248~“ABSOLUTLY AMAZING”~What an fantastic gem in the heart of Sydney (just a short walk to Darling Harbour). The hotel itself is so quirky and interesting, like nothing I have every experienced before. The staff were lovely and the rooms were spacious, stunning and clean. We were treated to complimentary wifi and movies as well as a room upgrade on arrival... And the bed in our room was SO comfortable. Valet parking was a little expensive but well worth it as options in the area a limited. Will certainly be staying with the QT chain again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460308434~“Nice restaurant and bar, Cleaning not great”~Big room was nice, fancy bathroom (more fancy than useful), cleaning in the room was not good I stayed for 16 nights and they never really did I properly once, very helpful and friendly staff in the reception. The restaurant and the bar was very nice, high quality and very good service in the restaurant!~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_460236869~“Great location, sexy rooms and an excellent restaurant inside the hotel”~My travel agent booked this hotel for me and I have been singing his praises for days now. First off, the location is superb. It's a 20 minute walk to the Sydney Opera House, 15 minutes from Darling Harbour and Chinatown, and 5 minutes from Pitt street where there's tons of shopping. It's also close to the train station. I easily walked everywhere.  The adorable woman with a red wig from the website greeted me as soon as I arrived, helped me with my suitcases and told me to go right up to level 1 to check in. I was in love with the hotel the second the doors opened to level 1. The beautiful colorful 60s couches with fun pillow, old spinning mannequins, and funky decorations made me so blissfully happy. As you turn the corner around the elevators, the lobby wraps around with more funky colorful couches, books, and tables. I could have stayed there all day.  I went to check in around 12pm and was told my room wasn't ready, but to go have a walk around and when I got back it definitely would be. Overall the staff was super friendly and attentive.  I arrived back mid-day and was told yes, my room was ready and my bags were already there ahead of my imminent arrival. I opened the door to my room and was ecstatic. My room was similar to a W hotel room but sexier. The bathroom was by far my favorite, large open rainforest shower, separate tub, and a mirror that pushed back so the whole bathroom was open and you could see the tv at the same time. The bed was large and comfortable. The large red drawn curtains helped to make the room super dark at night and the overall the room just had these hip, funky touches that had me posting pics on social media like a mad woman. From the sign on the door that said "Yes or No" to the writing pad by the telephone that said, "lost for word", and the creepy hand outside my room holding a sign with the room #, everything was super chic. One evening I had a cocktail upstairs in the restaurant and it was fabulous. The bartender was also super nice. The place was packed come 7pm on most evenings! I went in to have breakfast one morning and she said the restaurant closed at 11am, but if I could order straight away at 10:55, she could sit me. I agreed and ended up having a delightful Huevo's Rancheros dish.  Another night I decided to order room service. The menu was pretty decent, I loved that you could order 24/7 and low and behold, I ordered and my food showed up less than 10 minutes later. I was shocked. Great experience.  My only minor complaint was the gym, which is so strange. It's on the 10th floor, but then you need to walk up a flight of stairs to a dodgy 11th floor. The equipment is decent, but it was old and terribly creepy. Nonetheless, I absolutely loved the hotel and will 100% book the hotel again when I'm in Sydney with my hubby.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_459965981~“Funky flavour ”~Stayed here just for one night for a work trip and it's lovely, very hip and funky with all the perks. Awesome shower, comfy bed and good pillows. The only downside is that rooms are a little dark, I'm sure that's the style, but not enough light to put on makeup. It also took forever to turn all the lights and lamps off at night, funny actually.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459183614~“Original, one of a kind”~I guess this is one of the most special hotels where I've stayed. The staff is good looking and has quirky outfits, and besides they are all very friendly. The room was spacious, as was the bathroom, and had interesting stuff in it (cocktail maker, two showers, very good complimentary cosmetics), very clean. The disadvantages for me as a business traveler were the bad lighting, even in the bathroom, so that makeup is kind of impossible, and the lack of a normal breakfast buffet. But for holidays this hotel is perfect, due to its central position, proximity to the theater and experience overall.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459101342~“Top notch city escape for couples”~We escaped the family grind for a night here and loved it.  The design is great - quirky and fun, attracting patrons of similar predilections. The restaurant is excellent with a really comprehensive but high-quality menu and wine list.  The location is ideal for theatre and CBD / inner urban nightlife ... in theory! In the end we just relaxed with a couple of movies in-house following an after-dinner cocktail at their bar above the restaurant.  The room was a modest size but very comfortable and well-appointed. We walked into Paddington the next morning for a yum breakfast before a relaxed checkout and back to real life.  Imagine staying here for two weeks over Sydney Film Festival in the State Theatre below... that would be hard to beat.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459029819~“Loved this hotel!”~We spent 3 nights at the QT Sydney and LOVED the hotel. Awesome decor and vibe, not to mention very comfortable beds. We particularly loved the double rain shower in our room and the luxurious black robes. We ordered room service one night and it was fantastic. We definitely didn't want to leave and wished we could stay a few more days. The location in downtown Sydney was perfect. Can't wait to try another QT hotel soon!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458587904~“Fantastic place to stay, centrally located with great service, rooms & ambiance.”~This hotel is like other reviews have said is 'quirky' in a great way and has to be experienced to be believed. We were greeted by two staff dressed in very distinguishing 'uniforms' with a cabaret style, who were very welcoming & obligingly offered to take our bags to the room and we no hesitation in letting the Director of Chaos manage the initial meet & greet. They provided us with clear directions to take the lift up to the reception area for checking in. As soon as you step into the lift the brightly coloured string lights ignite around the door giving you a feeling that you are travelling to somewhere special, the lift then sensors someone in the lift and the music changes to something upbeat & familiar which we found ourselves dancing to. Upon the doors opening, we immediately noticed the walls which are made up of old fashioned suitcases & books which upon closer inspection are real, the huge arm chairs welcome visitors and & helped myself to the complimentary apples & a newspaper. Check in was very efficient & informative and upon advising them we had booked into Gowings for an evening meal, they provided advice about charging the meal to the room & a discount is provided. The hallways to the rooms have very high ceilings and are dimly lit, with large mirrors depicting clever shadows that almost give the impression that someone is looking out for you, ready to give directions if you are lost. The room numbers are held by a hand which is very clever, unique idea and in fact these adjectives can be used to describe many features of this hotel. The room was welcoming with generous space and a very comfortable bed. The window blinds allow for complete light block out and was very quiet. The room is decorated in darker colours similar to the Japanese red/black, including the bathroom which has a double rain shower, and bath with a seat at one end. All in all, this hotel so suited us with all the quirks reminiscent of The Adams Family & Rocky Horror Picture Show blended into one, it was brilliant.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_458434656~“Simply superb!!”~What a great hotel!!! Definitely one of the best hotels in Sydney!! There's a reason why it rates so high: because it is excellent!! Location: couldn't be better. In he city center, just moments from the shopping area and plenty of restaurants. It takes about 15 minutes to the ferry and the Opera House Service: excellent!! All staff is very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast: they don't have a buffet breakfast. It is à la carte from the menu. Some options are a bit weird and not be for everyone, but the quality of the ingredients is excellent. If you take the safest options you will be delighted. If you feel adventurous try some other options and you will be pleased too Room: the room is very comfortable, very good size and quirky. The views are not that great considering you are in the centre.  WiFi: complementary and very fast Price: not cheap. It is a bit higher that the average but totally worth it In summary, this is a great hotel and I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458244518~“Funky little place”~My then fiancee and I spent a night here enroute to New Zealand. It is quirky and the staff is hip and friendly. They recommended a spot on place for late night dining (Hubert on Bligh) and we had a great - albeit short - stay at Sydney. The bars in the building looked hip and happening but sadly we did't have much time on this trip. All in all, we find the staff warm and helpful and would come back again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457982769~“Quirky Hotel in the Centre of Sydney”~We decided to stay a night in Sydney recently and chose the QT as we are fans of the one in Canberra and also a similar one in Amsterdam called Ink. The QT in Sydney is located above the State Theatre and within the old Gowings building so to check in you need to find the access and go to the 1st floor, not difficult by any means. The staff are fabulous and we were even upgraded to a QT EXECUTIVE KING which I would describe as spacious but different. The only issue that we had with the room was the fact that it was dark and you felt slightly closed in. Apart from that the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was great and the room itself spacious however do not expect a view as such. All in all we were very happy but one night would be enough.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_457766718~“Quirky place but very cool!”~Very cool, edgy hotel. Really different but unique in a good way. Super service and great staff. They Had an excellent restaurant, Gowings, which we used for breakfast & dinner. Great menu, food, & service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457722442~“Way Cool Hotel”~Have stayed in a few as do like the group of hotels. This is one of the best by far. From the old restored Theater and Department store refurbished into something amazing. Staff in all depts excellent, service, check in a breeze. Bar downstairs is worthy a drink as great cocktails.  Location is very central to everywhere.  Would highly recommend and will return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457027521~“Cool, different atmosphere”~This hotel "nailed" doing something different as far as decor and presentation goes. The eclectic decor was very appealing and presentation of staff was left of centre.  The rooms were very spacious and commodities were very good.  The only problem I had was the lighting in the rooms. Very difficult to get makeup done as the rooms were very dark. This goes for getting ready. They did however try to assist with bar lighting in bathrooms but just found it was not enough. Staff very friendly and helpful. Enjoyable 3 day stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457023356~“Comfy and Quirky”~I stayed for two nights and had a great stay in the CBD. I had a room on the 7th floor - the room was comfortable and a bit luxe in a quirky way. This is the hotel in the old Gowings building with nice touches of the old lifts and the ground floor entrance and cafe parlour. I loved it, from the Malin and Goetz toiletries to the egg bath and monsoon shower, and stunning glass decorations in the bar. Nice touches for those wanting an espresso martini among many other creature comforts in room. No noise from the outside and room choice re hypo-allergenic bedding which can be ordered at pre checkin. It was great being so close to transport and QVB/Pitt street mall. Not cheap but great for a weekend away.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_456794586~“Cool, Quirky and Comfy”~My husband and I visited the QT Sydney for one night on New Years Day, which is my husband's birthday. I decided to surprise my husband and chose the QT as it looked so unique, especially compared to the sort of places we would usually stay. Even though it's a very expensive time to find accommodation, the QT was reasonably reasonable, so we splashed out. It's a wonderful location, right next door to the State Theatre, and the décor is just so wonderful. As soon as you walk through the door, guided by the friendly attendants, you feel like you are in New York or somewhere other than Sydney! I kept lagging behind looking at the fantastic retro items that are worked into the surroundings - it's quite hard to describe, which is what makes it so entertaining. We had drinks at the bar while we waited for our room, and the barman couldn't have been friendlier. The room is also unique - incredibly soft and comfortable bed, beautiful items of crystal and bric-a-brac to amuse, a lovely screensaver/music loop running as you enter the room. My only small gripe is that the lighting in the bathroom is almost non-existent, it's so dark. So good luck if you want to put on make up after sundown! There is a big window in there, but it's not much use in the evening.  Dinner in the restaurant was delicious, with attentive and friendly waiters and hosts. The location is just so fantastic - you can step outside and be in the busiest part of town for shopping, a bonus for me! All staff are friendly and cheerful, and most importantly, the hotel has it's own individual personality that just sweeps you away into another world. Try it out, it's an adventure!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_456336889~“Great hotel and great bar and resturant”~I stay here most weeks with work and love it. I got so bored of the the drab old Hilton and the like. The hotel is different, cool. A mini bar and in room cocktails that you can mix, and room of goodies to run up your bill. Get an upgrade and get the massive bath for 4! It's like being on a movie set! You can go to Virgin mega gym around the corner. Better than any hotel gym in Australia I would say, it's free. The bar is full of people with awesome cocktails. The Resturant is fantastic. Truffle eggs for breaki! Awesome steak, great service. And amazing staff, dressed to impress if I may say! Not really any negatives! But the price varies quite a lot. You can get a room for 280, a lot of time it's 450! I love it. Will never stay in the big chains again when there is a QT! Go and try, if it's not for work on your own, boring, like me. This is a place to bring your partner. Right in the middle of the CBD, walk to everything.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456004972~“Wonderfully quirky with great attention to detail!”~Central location, excellent staff that goes the extra mile and its fun, extravagant and unique design make the QT a fabulous choice for a few nights in Sydney. Extremely comfortable beds, an excellent and spacious bathroom with quality products and most importantly a well-stocked mini bar! The hotel went truly above and beyond to meet any requests as we I was there for work and had a few (somewhat unusual) requirements. Highly recommend!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455094811~“Quirky but cool hotel”~As soon as you hop out of the taxi in front of the QT hotel, you know that you are about to experience something quirky and unique. This hotel (and no doubt all hotels in the chain) is one of a kind. All staff are dressed differently, and all furniture is unlike nothing I've seen before. But having said that, all staff that I encountered couldn't do enough to ensure that I had an enjoyable stay, and I felt at home the entire time. Best of all was the central location in the CBD, right outside the Pitt St mall and only a short walk to Darling Harbour. If you are wanting a different experience from your "normal" hotel, then definitely give the QT Hotel in Sydney a go - you will be pleasantly surprised!~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_455052269~“Most Fabulous Hotel Ever!”~I loved, loved, loved this hotel! Not only is it in a perfect location (five minutes' walk from St James Station), but it had Spectacular rooms that make you wish your apartment was even half as glamorous. There were amazing little touches everywhere, from the "martini table" in the room to the gorgeous lobby, the bar, and the café on the ground floor. Staff COULD NOT have been nicer, friendlier, and more helpful. Special thanks to Callum for the early check in and the best room in the hotel. Also to Eric who offered to come across the street to another hotel where I was checking out, in order to carry my bags across to the QT - unbelievable service! And to Chris who cheerfully resolved a problem with the room lock, and Jackie who was so helpful with the outlet adapters. If I am ever in a city with a QT hotel, I will not stay anywhere else. N.B. when are you opening one in NYC??~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454391893~“Birthday Treat”~The Hotel entrance is nit clearly marked as it is one if the doors into the theatre. Once you've got inside take the disco lift up to the 1st floor and reception area. Funkily decorated with lots to catch your eye. Next floor up is the well stocked bar and restaurant. Got a free room upgrade as my partner had asked being it was my birthday. Room was a good size and again the quirkiness continued. Bath and shower in the upgraded room or otherwise just a shower. Comfy beds lots if pillows and dressing gowns. No slippers though. Well stocked mini bar with other essentials you might need. We were in room 216 and looked out into the main street but couldn't hear any noise from the traffic. Air con was a welcome relief from the heat. Overall a good stay and a great location. Even got checked in an hour early as room was ready.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_453677229~“Love the QT”~Having been away for a couple of months it was great to come back the the QT. Rooms are great and the staff are outstanding. The music in the lift still makes me laugh every time. Coffee downstairs is generally very good and with access to the Virgin gym round the corner it's perfect for those that want to be active. For runners, it's 5.2km to go over the bridge and back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453162050~“Incredible ”~This was our second stay at the QT, Sydney. I've searched on Trip Advisor for another hotel to rival this one but cannot find one. The attention to detail and comfort are outstanding, as is the effort QT put in to preserving the history of the buildings it inhabits. It is spread across two of Sydney’s most prominent historical buildings, the State Theatre and the Gowings building, both of which opened their doors in 1929, the year the stock market crashed and the Great Depression started. QT Sydney reportedly undertook a painstaking 17 month restoration project in an effort to return the building facade back to its former glory. Original items discovered, such as suitcases, televisions and drawers, have been incorporated into the foyer walls.  Very, very cool.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452905339~“Soo Swanky”~Stayed for 2 days, loved every minute of it, from the hotel greeter, to the front desk. Nothing is accidental here in this hotel, you feel like everything was planned and planned well. The restaurant has a great breakfast, dinner was good too, but I loved the breakfast. The decor is just fun, from the lobby to the hallways, to the rooms, very well done, bed was super comfy. Everything about my stay here was on target!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_452831580~“Querky hotel - very enjoyable stay - highly recommend”~Great hotel to stay at with a difference. Stayed in a QT Deluxe King: Experience with a QT Life Package. Great value & a very enjoyable stay. From the eclectic furnishing to the various music that played in the lift, the stay was something to experience. Will definitely stay again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452048643~“Almost perfect”~On arrival we loved the reception area with lots of surprises to find and look at. Check in was slow but staff were polite. Our room was spacious and the bed wonderful. Black out curtains were great for a sleep in. We were surprised the fridge did not work. The Nespresso coffee machine was great but please QT use Nespresso capsules this is disappointing. The bathroom was lovely with a huge bath. The limited amount of toiletries was disappointing and why put candles around the bath with no way for guests to light them ? I know these are small problems but when paying premium price at an advertised boutique hotel we did not expect these problems.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~3~nan
