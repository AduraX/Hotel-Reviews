review_479084689~“Do not stay here!”~After booking online at the Oaks Goldsbrough , I tried ringing them with a query several times over 4 days before arrival, well don't bother ringing them because they don't answer the phone, even when their booking line transfers you to reception. We were having a couple of days in the city at the end of school holidays & unfortunately were extremely disappointed with our accommodation. When we checked in, we had to leave straight away for an event we had tickets for because even when you request an earlier check-in, there is no such thing. When we returned we discovered that the hot water system must have burst just prior to us checking in & a hap hazard job was done to replace & clean up. A 1/2 a metre of the carpet entrance to both bedrooms were saturated & the rooms stunk. We discovered this was because there was wet, mouldy carpet left in the room the hot water system was in. When we spoke to reception all they could do was say 'sorry about that, we'll see if we can find another room for you'. Another person at reception stepped in and said they would refund us $100 & send maintenance to our room to fix. Well their idea of fixing the problem was to leave an industrial heat fan in our room for the entire time we were out. 6 hrs later when we returned to our room which was now a sauna, & had blown dirt & dust into our bathrooms & bedrooms, we had to turn it of & tell reception to get someone to remove it. When maintenance arrived, we asked him to remove the wet mouldy carpet, his reply was he couldn't until he checked with his manager & that was the last we heard from him. Once again reception said 'sorry about that' & they will find us another room, which they never did. On checkout I expressed to reception once again what had happened & once again was told 'sorry about that'. We are still waiting for the refund & have been charged the $75 holding deposit. I have been on the phone tonight again for an hour to find out why we have been charged this, but once again no answer. Oh & don't waste your time paying for wi-fi, we had a 2 bedroom appartment, upstairs was lounge & kitchen, the wi-fi only worked in one bedroom, no other room in apartment. Can not warn you enough, DO NOT STAY HERE!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478354475~“Wouldn't recommend ”~First of all the female staff we dealt with were rude. We were put on level 2 where there was no natural lighting. It was like a dark cave. Worst thing was the way the rooms were positioned our bed was obviously against the room next doors bed. Not nice being woken up by people getting busy at 12pm at night. Also the noise from the walkway was awful. If you are looking for a nice place to stay please spend the extra money and go somewhere nicer. This was my worst hotel experience ever.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477900951~“Grandparents and 2 Children”~We had a week in a studio room and then our 15 and 13 year old grandchildren arrived from Qld for 6 nights . We had been booked into a apartment in the city but decided to stay and move to a 2 bedroom at Oaks Goldsbrough for not much more cost , but so much more comfortable facilities for the 4 of us Kitchen very good ,, we did not cook as mainly ate out but were able to bring meals up from Harbourside or café on 2nd floor.for reheating etc if wanted. .. All staff we spoke with at times were so obliging and the room service was very good. I felt spoilt. We have stayed with Oaks many time in the last 10 years at Oaks on Collins St . Alexander Headlands and Brisbane. and have been very happy each time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477688321~“Disappointment in Darling Harbour”~We had expected something unique and interesting considering the history of this building, what we found was just depressing. At first we were given a room on Level 2 that unfortunately had a back door onto a laneway, looking at the brick wall opposite the external wall of the room. No natural light ever entered this space and the bedroom had a window looking onto the internal atrium at the level that everyone walks past and again no natural light. The colour scheme only enhanced this depressing outlook. After complaining we were given a room on Level 9. Hope reigned supreme when we entered and saw a view out to Darling Harbour. However as the stay developed the inherent faults of the hotel became more and more evident. All the walls were damaged and marked. All the cupboards in the bathroom and kitchenette were falling apart. The internet access is outrageously expensive and phenomenally slow. And there is no acoustics - you can hear conversations and worse in the adjoining rooms. To top it off some upper level rooms were being refurnished and the jackhammering noise started at 9am every working day that we were there - echoing across the atrium space. OMG I will never stay there again.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~2~2~nan
review_477624407~“Impressive ”~Lovely appartments with history dating back to an old wool store. Decor is impressive with some of the previous timber left in place.

review_476719140~“Cheap and well located but thats where it stops”~Well locate on the edge of Darling Harbour and reasonably priced but unfortunately thats where it starts and stops.

review_476634690~“Disappointed”~Stayed Here on the 7/4/2017 for a overnight stay as we had a concert to go to in the City and we have stayed before and had a lovely time so we thought lets return. Check in was fine our stay comfortable . We checked out on the Saturday a bit of a line I think they need more than 2 people on reception in holiday time. When we returned home 2 hours later I realised i had left my Tiffany chain on the bed side table I thought stupid me I rang the hotel straight away to advise them and knowing checkin time was 2pm it would have been cleaned it was now 1.00pm >I was told to ring back on Monday I asked could someone go and see the room for me and was told no Housekeeping will advise on Monday i was disappointed as it was worth a lot of money . I rang the Res Number still no avail nothing told to ring Monday ...I rang Monday spoke to the Manager and guess what NO CHain so moral of the story don't be careless like me and hope they have honest staff that work in house keeping or a staff member could have gone and looked for me I will NEVER return and word of mouth is a good form of advertising. The Manager has phoned me to say they couldn't find it it has to be somewhere either the next guest OR ?????~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_476621325~“Disappointing”~Easter weekend away with my daughter which we don't do often enough. Looking forward to a nice hotel, food, fun etc. So disappointed with the Oaks. First time we have stayed and won't again. Location is excellent however room was dark and grubby. Bedroom hardly big enough to swing a cat. Floor tiles in the bathroom cracked and bath itself old and stained. The courtyard area more like a prison than a hotel, bare and uninviting. Overall very very tired and just not great at all!! For a few dollars more a Meriton would have been so much better at least the quality is assert there.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~2~4~nan
review_476265973~“Short stay”~Recently stayed for 2 nights and would recommend this place. stayed in a 1 bed apartment on level 2 so was easy access to the carpark and darling harbour. nice and quiet and had everything we needed. The only negative thing I would have to say is the slow check in and check out process. upon checkout all we had to pay for was 2 days parking but took forever. $30 a day car parking seemed a bit excessive but compared to the standard rate in the carpark it was pretty reasonable. Would stay here again if ever in Sydney.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_475910549~“Wouldn't go anywhere else”~We have stayed at the Oaks Goldsbrough on 4 occasions. Our longest stay was 6 weeks. This year we stayed for 3 weeks after a cruise before flying home. It is a great base in Darling Harbour for exploring Sydney and its environs. Most attractions are within walking distance or if preferred the light railway which is being extended it literally outside the hotel or there are buses and ferries to all sorts of places from Bondi Beach to Paramater and in between. The hotel may not be 5 star luxury but it is clean and comfortable and the apartments are self-contained which gives us independence to come and go as we please. There are a wide range of local restaurants or supermarkets within walking distance. The staff are very helpful both in reception and in housekeeping and maintenance. Well done Oaks Goldsbrough. We look forward to visiting you next year.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_475740232~“Easter weekend ”~The hotel has great character and a lot of history! Relatively comfortable.  Not very warm or inviting through the levels of the hotel, but then again.. it was a wool shed.  My partner and I were on level 8, studio apartment, comfort of the actual bed was ok. Noise from other customers and traffic was quite low which is good. My family had their own room on level 3 with a 1 bedroom and a fold out bed, the fold out bed was terrible, basically folded in on the couple that stayed on it.  If your looking for a modern inviting hotel, this isn't it. If you like history character and something different then this is for you. All depends on preference.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475166734~“Would not stay again”~Room was rundown and floors stained & filthy. Even tiled and vinyl areas were not clean.Was worried about my two young children sitting or playing on the floor given how grubby they were. Disappointing as I've stayed in other Oaks hotels previously and was happy.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475164303~“Update required”~The room seriously need a major update although it was very comfortable and clean. We had one of the back rooms that had a small balcony but the floor needs a clean. The establishment is close to the light rail station (Fourth from Central) and you can make your way to HarbourSide Shopping centre in Darling Harbour without regard to the weather. During our stay my wife fractured her leg at Taronga Park zoo, I would like to thank Big Mac(Concierge) for his assistance in obtaining a set of crutches and arranging a maxi taxi to the railway station.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_474911098~“poor substitute”~Originally booked into another Oaks in Sydney i was bumped to here as they had "maintenance issues". Having looked at the website i thought okay as it look similar rooms. Same distance to the purpose of the visit and only 3 nights. Looked better in the website! On trip from airport overhead Sydney rooms were scarce so remembered i only be sleeping there and the bed was adequate.  Staff were average!~3~2~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_474541827~“Sydnay Getaway and Musical”~Very serviceable apartment. While decor was not luxurious it was vety comfortabe and clean. Great location. Was concerned about building opposite being noisy but there were no problems. Light rail station nearby~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474529927~“Different”~Not quite what I expected, a bit shabby and needs doing up but for the price I don't think you can complain. I would say half the price of a hotel and situated in an ideal spot for Darling Harbour. In fact whilst we were there had a terrific thunderstorm just as we were due to go out for a meal and because you can get to the food area via the Car Park we didn't even get wet. It would have been nice to have a view of the harbour but I think you would have to have paid a fair price in other accommodation. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to our friends and if we visited again would certainly book there as it was so central for everything.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~3~nan
review_474467461~“Rooms In need of an update”~Four of us girls stayed here in a two bedroom apartment for a conference at the new ICC at Darling Harbor, so very convenient.

review_474382730~“Well Past Its Prime - Now Without The View!”~We booked for three weeks at the Oaks Goldsbrough Apartments thinking it would be a good base to explore Sydney but without the cost of a central city hotel. We arrived in the evening and were checked in quickly, but we weren't shown to our room - instead we had to find it ourselves. We were extremely disappointed when we opened the door to the apartment to find it in a very poor condition. The paint on the walls was peeling in-fact there were chips in the paintwork all around the apartment. The bathroom was a disgrace - dirty and with broken fittings, we had to send for someone immediately to fix the tap in the wash basin. The bedroom's window overlooked the inside of the building, but with very poor drapes and no black-out blinds it was so light at night we may as well have had all the lights on. The view from the apartment which once may have been of Darling Harbour is now completely obscured by the enormous convention centre and hotel, so the only view you have is of the multi-lane express motorway, which by the way is so loud you can hardly hear the TV. We decided this hotel was not what we had thought we were booking and checked out as fast as we could check into another hotel.~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_473968240~“Disgusting Hotel. Do not book here - you will be disappointed.”~As a regular traveller for work and personal holidays all over the world, this is by far the worst I have experienced. From dirty carpets, to mothball smell in the bedrooms, to the unsafe power outlet. My colleague and I shared a 2bedroom apartment on the 5th floor. The door to the second bedroom could not even open as the single bed was behind it.  On my first night stay, I got an electric zap from my electric appliance plugged into the power outlet in the bathroom. After I rung reception, they sent a staff member up to take a look at it. He went to the electric meter box in the kitchen and flicked the electric safety switch on and commented “this always happens” !!! On the 2nd night stay the appliance was burnt out after in was plugged into the second power outlet in the bathroom.   Every day since the incident I tried to speak with the manager to resolve the matter and request my item be replaced or I be compensated the full amount so I can replace it. On each occasion, the manager was not in or on the phone. On the last day I was advised that for 'my inconvenience' I will be compensated $100 (for a $300 appliance). Disgusting way to treat patrons at an unsafe hotel. Needless to say I am taking the matter further. I strongly suggest you do not stay at this hotel if you would like a pleasant stay whilst in Sydney!~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_471973522~“Better for holiday stays rather than business”~I stayed here for a business trip and quickly decided that this venue is better for holidaymakers than those looking for the facilities you usually expect on a business stay. Firstly the position is tucked away off the main drag meaning it can be difficult to get a taxi, there are no restaurants, decent views or access to shops without a walk. The rooms are small, basic, and there is no room service - not much good if you are travelling and with limited time. There is a supermarket a short walk away but again I think this works much better if you are a holiday maker - you can stock up the fridge and cater for yourself making your stay no doubt cheaper than dining in fancy restaurants etc. But for the business traveller again there is no decent cafe or bar for either morning or evening snacks/drinks etc - the little cafe next door was closed when I arrived at 3pm and in the morning when I had a look what was on offer was pretty basic. The venue is a converted warehouse - actually a beautiful old building that would have had a real purpose in the old days being close to the harbour. But the conversion lacks character - in fact you still feel like you are in a warehouse - can't say I found it very appealing. The service was fine but certainly not exceptional or anything to write home about and I can't say it would be a venue I would chose to return to. For holidaymakers however the price per night may be appealing and it is not far to walk down to the harbour to enjoy all that Sydney has to offer. The appartments have all that you need to function self sufficiently eg washing machine, dryer, kitchen etc. So if it is price that is important to you then definitely this place could be a good option. The coolest thing about this hotel is the swimming pool, although it is on the ground floor near reception making is a bit awkward in terms of access in your robe, or swimmers and towel but it has been beautifully designed and is huge. So this venue may suit some but not everyone. If you manage to get a good deal on price then it would certainly be worth thinking about as an option.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471897806~“Location good for eating out and harbor views”~We had room 418. basic basic basic. our view was a big ugly car park tower and ally way to rubbish bins etc, our bed was meant to be king having a 6 foot 7 partner we got a queen which wasn't horrible but to short. 24 hour front desk service is a joke dont bother calling at all. first time i called 14 times for the extras we asked for before checking in. second night we called again 9 times as house keeping didn't turn down our room and we had no clean towels or toilet paper. i walked to front desk to ask for the items they didn't leave us i had to carry 4 towels toilet paper tissues shampoo etc myself some how use the lift with a room key or it wont take u to your level no help at all... you get 30 mins free internet each day we signed in to find it already 10mins out of time. and only could use it near the bathroom. bathroom was horrible mold in shower vanity was broken and had massive hole on the end, i had to fix my own shower head twice as it was leaking water from the wall and causing water hammering. the toilet wasn't clean sticky and had hair on it. kitchen oven was broken and the stove cooker was pealing and looked very dirty. we had no drinking glasses only wine glasses... this room is OK for a few night sure we had a full week here and we managed i like my home clean neat tidy we paid a fair amount to stay here and i shouldn't have to clean while on a holiday this room needs work. Great location friendly staff pool area gym spa all fine its got old charm i would stay again just in a different room and hopefully we wouldn't have many problems like we did in this one. it didn't make our holiday worse we managed fine. just expected more for the amount we paid for~3~nan~4~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_471759111~“Great location and value - give it a go!”~I wasn't expecting much as I had to book at late notice over Mardi Gras weekend. Was mainly interested in value and location. The Hotel is walking distance by covered walkway to Darling Harbour shops and ICC, Tramline, Pyrmont, Chinatown and a comfortable walk over to the CBD. Interesting building - warehouse conversion to apartments with a mix of Hotel/residential. My room on the 11th floor had an excellent view from the balcony over the neighbouring buildings rooftop garden (stunning!) and west. Small but handy gym/sauna and pool as well. Overall great value for Sydney. I would happily stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_471732071~“Average”~We stayed for 4 nights last week.  On arrival the check in procedure was swift got our swipe cards and off we went. No mention of having to use them to work the elevators though! Found the room on level 5. The lounge room was nice and spacious with a good view of the Sydney tower. The stairs leading downstairs to the bedrooms are narrow, hard to lug luggage up and down but are no doubt necessary for the layout. The bedroom was a good size and the bed comfortable, though I could only find power points on the wall next to the cupboards, nothing beside the bed? The kitchen was functional, and the couches where comfortable. Now for the negatives: The bathroom had a cracked tile in it and hair on the floor. Also, where the taps are attached to the sink there was a lot of dirt that could be cleaned with a toothbrush.  The stove cooktop had a chunk taken out which was covered with duct-tape.  Overall was a comfortable place to stay, not sure it deserves its price tag, but it was close to Darling Harbour.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471435147~“Report on apartments”~Location was great. The apartment was very tired and dirty.

review_470950476~“Not the best - by far”~We booked for a party of four in a two bedroom apartment with two bathrooms. The apartment was advertised as "split level". When we got there, and eventually got through the rather long booking in procedure, we were put into room 1310. Don't go there!! Accepting that it may be split level we were disappointed to say the least to find it was actually 2 storey with 16 steps between the 2 floors. The second issue was the condition of the place. Two smelly old armchairs, threadbare stair carpet, damaged furniture, broken floor tiles in both bathrooms and dirt behind every bed. After gluing my hand to the stair rail I cleaned it with one of the cloths provided. I have provided some photographs as evidence. After complaining and requesting another room we were advised that nothing was available for 2 days. Eventually after 3 days we were moved into another 2 bed apartment which, to be fair, was in a better condition. Unfortunately it only had one bathroom - a fact that appeared to come as a surprise to the staff. Other issues - the advertised wifi is woeful (at best) and the carpet leading out of the apartment at level 2 has to be seen to be believed; after 8 days in the place I still couldn't find a piece to show me the original colour. We have requested a refund.~1~nan~5~nan~nan~1~2~nan
review_470539409~“2 stars for service & facility”~Disappointed from the moment we walked in to rude 'customer service'. Then when we saw the room......the disappointment grew.

Don't bother.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470200728~“Absolutely woeful accom, service and staff”~We paid a small fortune for a 2 bedroom apartment for 4 nights while we were at a conference. Upon checking in we immediately went out for supplies to come back a few hours later to find the room stinking hot. We put the air con on, then had to go out for dinner. We came back to find the room still stinking hot, we figured the aircon had turned itself off, so we put it back on and went to try and sleep. The next night was the same, so we called reception, they came up to find that yes the aircon was broken and instead of not working, it was actually heating the room to a balmy 26.5 degrees in a sydney autumn. We were told we couldn't be moved as the place was booked out.  I explained this was unacceptable and that a refund must be issues. On return from the conference the next night, we were told by the night clerk that a refund of $900 had been authorised and that they couldn't get hold of us to confirm. I told them to confirm and authorise it and that we'd be unavailable due to the conference the next two days. The night clerk said he'd put as much in the notes. When we came to check out, we were told the $900 was not going to be refunded as they'd tried to contact us to move us but couldn't get hold of us (read the notes!). After some discussion a refund of $600 was offered and accepted because honestly, we were jack of this place. We'd slept in heat and humidity for 4 nights, been promised recompense and then lied to about it, oh and lost ALL the food we put in the fridge, because like the aircon, the fridge had packed it in as well. This place tries to charge $300-$400 a night, yet it competes with a $10 a night Thailand back packers for what it provides. Avoid it at all costs! Oh....and the refund still hasn't appeared in our accounts...I don't hold out much hope for it to be honest, my experience leaves me with the opinion that they will say whatever they can to get you to move along, with absolutely no intent of follow through.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_470007767~“poor service”~We loved our room on the 12th floor, large balcony looking out over Pyrmont. However, they had given us a queen bed instead of twin beds as requested, and said they were unable to change it. After sharing a bed for 3 nights we are still good friends. The staff never answer the phone, and never return a call after leaving a message. Had to go to reception to collect fresh towels each evening. The man who appeared to be the manager was very reluctant to acknowledge us, as his colleague was attending to others. Not a bit friendly or welcoming. Clearly customer service is not his niche.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~1~nan
review_469985767~“Everything and the kitchen sink. ”~To be honest we weren't expecting much. Arriving early and expecting to wait for a room we were presently surprised.  We were offered a newly renovated apartment on level 9 and moved right in. So newly renovated the curtains were yet to be installed. Maintenance informed us of the work yet to be done and set about making a cozy home for us.  When we had returned from our evening out everything was in place, the new kitchen appliances curtains and the kitchen sink. Our stay was comfortable relaxing and staff were very helpful.  Everything looked newly renovated except for a few items. The room is very standard and lacking in interior style and theme.  We had odd numbers of cutlery and crockery. If you can look past style then it will certainly be comfortable.  Thanks Oaks Goldsbrough for the newly renovated room. Much appreciated.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469968594~“Trying to find something nice to say”~Can't recommend this place, although on the plus side, my friends & I were on 11th floor & had a more modern apartment than others in our conference group who were on 6th floor. However, it wasn't cleaned very well & the kitchen bin was full on arrival. When we arrived just before midnight we had to wait in the foyer for the reception desk clerk to check the room for something or other & weren't admitted until 12.15am. The twin room had wooden slat blinds overlooking the conglomeration of corridors & stairs, although the queen-bed room had a harbour view - which would have been okay excepting we asked for 2 lots of twins as it was for 4 women. The walls were dirty, there's no air-con so the windows were left ajar, which is okay for days when it doesn't rain, but it was hot & humid & the apartment very stuffy. It was nice to have 2 bathrooms, although one had the old type shower over the bath with plastic curtain. The other had a modern shower, but we found it was only attached by one hinge & the glass/plastic (?) surrounds were ready to come off & fall on some unfortunate bather. A plus is that maintenance people arrived very quickly. Weird that the spare powerpoints in our bedroom were inside the wardrobe. Altogether - umm, pretty poor, & embarrassing for a hotel used by international conference delegates.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~2~nan
review_469941281~“So many problems!”~I'll start with what's good: Comfortable bed, roomy apartment.  However, the toilet wouldn't stop flushing, the shower pipes crunched and groaned so loudly, I couldn't have a shower the morning I was due at the airport for fear of waking the entire complex!  After a very long day in a conference room, I arrived at the building to find I was locked out. When I got to reception there was one man struggling to help a queue of tired agitated people whilst we could hear 2 women laughing and chatting in the office behind. No-one offered to help the man, even though one lady came out to get something from the counter. After 20 minutes, my swipe card was reactivated. I went to the lift - it didn't work. I then went to the back of the queue and waited again. After a further 5 minutes, I walked around reception and asked for someone to help from the office (they both looked shocked and horrified). Everyone in the queue smiled and said 'well done" but why should we need to?! I finally entered my room 40 minutes after my lockout at 11:30pm exhausted. I can't recommend this place. I will not be returning.~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_469513590~“Very Depressing”~Stayed here 3 nights March 2017. Without a doubt one of the most depressing rooms Ive ever stayed in. Dark, no outlook, cramped bathroom. Just awful. I don't recall the price being reflective of the room. i.e wasn't cheap but also wasn't super expensive. Pool area and Gym were good facilities and it was conveniently located close to Sydney Convention Centre. Room was clean and tidy. Just dark and Dingy and in no way a place you wanted to be or relax. Lastly, what is it with Hotels that still want to gouge you for Wifi? They do provide 30 minutes free, but that has to be used in the 30 minutes from when you first log on. And only one device can be used. Certainly would not recommend this place again.~1~nan~4~nan~1~nan~2~nan
review_469260336~“Seriously don't go here”~From the staff who were too busy talking to each other at reception when I arrived that I had to interrupt to ask if they would serve me to the unbearable noise and cobwebs and mould, avoid room 1002 and anything near it at this apartment hotel. The dripping tap was also annoying and the smelly flat pillows were just the icing on the cake for over $400. A night - are you serious? Never again!  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_468739839~“Good and Bad.”~No questions, you are paying for the location. Sheets were clean, toilet and basin clean, crockery clean, although only one teaspoon! Sadly Oaks Goldsborough you are letting the side down. The place is definitely in need of a refurbishment. Curtains, carpets, furniture and walls all marked and dirty looking. Mould on the tiles in the bath/shower. Attention to detail by cleaners has not happened in a very long time with dirty skirting boards and a lot of old dirt around the cook top on the stove. I feel a little duped with regard to the price for the experience. Could be a lot better with a little effort.~2~2~nan~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_468718614~“Great location ”~Stayed At this hotel in March for a work conference. Great location to the convention center and darling harbour. Even though it doesn't have its own cafe there is a cafe underneath. One tip though... don't swim in the pool as the only two people out of our work group swam i the pool and this week now have colds. The pool was very cloudy and couldn't see in front of you. Wish I didn't swim in the pool now but was so excited as it is a 25m lap pool. Oh well I guess you have to take the good with the bad~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468298072~“Lovely!!”~Had a 2 night stay here and had a great time, good location wise away from the hustle and bustle which was nice but only a 5 minute walk to Darling Harbour. Clean, tidy with a comfy bed and perfect for us especially when you have small children. Highly recommended!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468220690~“Short stay ”~The Oaks Goldsborough is located conveniently to Darling Harbour. Stayed in a studio appartment with friend. 2 single beds for us but you can get a double. Clean and tidy laminate floors could do with update. Beds very comfy and small balcony outside. If your a smoker you cant use it or smoke anywhere so dont bother booking if uou want to. Didnt affect us as non smokers. Kutchen adequate but our tap was broken and fixed immediately when repirted. Access to darling harbour through some walk ways no crossing roads.  Use light rail straight from Central Station about 2 buck. Get an opal card. We didnt know and spent $20 on cab. You learn.  All in all would recommend this place for a stay in sydney near darling harbor. Plenty to see do and eat nearby.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
