review_467093567~“Lovely, central hotel”~The Swissotel is right in the CBD of Sydney. You are a less than a hundred metres from Myer's, David Jones and The Strand, so if it's city shopping you want to do, this is the place to stay. But there are many more aspects to this hotel that I liked. The room we stayed in (12th floor) was a twin and it was much larger than the usual twin and quiet (the rooms start on about the 9th or 10th floor so there is no street noise, or at least there wasn't on the 12th). The bathroom was also a great size, and clean and modern but still full of character. The breakfasts (included in our deal) were by far the best hotel breakfasts I've had with all the usual cooked and fresh buffet stuff plus a gluten-free section, a make-you-own-pancake section and a juicer (with carrots, kale etc ready to go). And to top it off the staff were fantastic - really friendly, helpful and professional. It's not often I rave about a place but there is nothing I could complain about!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478131977~“Nice cbd hotel”~I've just finished an over night stay at the siwssotel and only have good things to say about the place. The staff were so friendly, the rooms were very modern and clean, conveniently located right in the cbd next to Myer and Zara my town favourites. Would stay again in a heart beat.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477473057~“Worst Hotel Experience Ever”~We booked two rooms in this hotel for our family of five, and we were placed next to a couple who were smoking cigarettes in their hotel room after we specifically asked for a non-smoking room to accommodate my daughter's severe asthma. We were told by Arthur at the front desk at arrival that the entire hotel is smoke free, which is one of the reasons why we chose this hotel when booking online. When we reported the problem to the night manager, who is an Asian woman, she told us that we made it up and that the neighboring room was not smoking cigarettes. She told us that our neighbors we not smoking when she checked on their room, and that she found no evidence of cigarettes. This was not the case, as it was very obvious that is smelt of cigarettes and my daughter was affected by the smoke and the smell of the cigarettes. The next day when we told Arthur and other front desk staff, they said they were aware of it and promised us directly that they would move the couple to another room. After some time we noticed that the couple was still next to us, and still smoking. When I called the front desk, the manager told me that if I don't like it then we can leave the hotel with our three children. The issue continued when I witnessed the man in the neighboring room make rude and inappropriate comments to my wife. When we brought this new issue to the same manager, she insisted that we should move rooms instead of the couple. We had six pieces of luggage, two rooms and three children. We directly heard the couple say that they paid off the night manager to let them keep their room for $100. The night manager showed no empathy for my daughter, who was clearly uncomfortable being in close proximity to cigarette smoke due to her severe asthma. The other staff at the hotel were very accommodating, with the exception of the rude and aggressive night shift manager, who is clearly not fit for any management position and should be fired.~1~2~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan
review_475699997~“Excellent stay and customer service”~I stayed at the hotel from 8th to 14th April 2017. Room service: attentive staff and excellent food. Good choices on the menu including gluten free and lactose free. Room: comfortable bed, requested firm/foam pillows and these were very comfortable and equivalent to what I have at home. Nice furnishings, comfortable sofa and a great TV in terms of choice of channels and the fact that the TV could be swivelled from all angles of the room. Prior to my stay I did request cold and effective air conditioning, however after the first night I found that it could only reach 18.5 to 19 degrees. As I heat up easily I found this very ineffective.  However, one of the duty managers who I must commend for his excellent customer service, Anupam did everything possible to ensure my room was cooler. This included moving me to another room though it was still not any cooler. He ensured that the doona was moved from my bed and replaced with a thin blanket and he also provided me with a fan if needed. After all this I did find that I could sleep at night.  On another occasion someone had removed the card that powered the lights and air conditioning. As a result Anupam apologised for this and provided me with a complimentary bottle of wine. Once again Anupam did everything possible to ensure my stay was comfortable and that my room was always cold as requested.  Laundry: used this on one day and clothes returned by 6 pm as promised. Executive lounge: a good lounge though unfortunately no tea leaves for the tea and only tea bags. Staff were also attentive and after the first day they were aware that I required gluten free bread. Each morning from there on I was provided with GF bread.  Restaurant: did not use during my stay, however aware that the room service items came from the restaurant and as mentioned above excellent food.  Checkin and checkout: excellent service by the staff. A specific mention of Maggie on checkin on the Saturday night as she was very friendly.  Overall I had a great stay at the hotel and again would like to make a specific mention of Anupam and the customer service he provided during my stay. I would have to say he is an outstanding asset and representative of the hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_475412349~“Treat yourself- New York style ”~Wake up in the morning amongst the buildings- just don't open the curtains in your birthday suit as the you may scare the office workers in the buildings surrounding you. You are in amongst and gives you that feeling of living life of other major world cities whilst being able to escape once inside the hotel. Well appointed rooms and hotel that are more than provides that goes beyond being comfortable that leaves you with an experience that treating yourself to something that you usually don't do. The faculties and bar have a touch of luxury and staff are extremely professional and well trained. We'll be back.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475052034~“Nice hotel and Pool nice surprise ”~The hotel has a nice central location in downtown Sydney. Walkable to opera house, the rocks and harbor bridge. The rooms are modern and have nice amenities. We were pleasantly surprised with the pool and pool area. It is a small pool and area but has very comfortable chairs and is quiet. We also stayed at other similarly rated hotels in Sydney but this was our favorite. Only complaint was staff seemed a little stuffy and we felt like we got funny looks walking through the lobby on the way back in after a run. Clientele seems to be business heavy so maybe they aren't used to seeing people in scrubby clothing in the lobby.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Walking distance from darling harbour and not to far away from the opera house and circular quay. The staf is super friendly especially the doornen downstair the hotel . We were however affected noise at night comming from street works outsider the hotel. The lobby and bar are spacious but could perhaps uwe Some home fragrance .

review_474404948~“Swiss Precision with annoying incision - credit card charge”~This hotel represents good value for Sydney and a very central location for shopping and shows. We had a one night stay for a show. Every amenity is thoughtfully covered down to the nicely covered coat-hangers (so your dresses don't slip off). The carpet is soft and lush (something that is becoming rare these days). Décor is all very "Scandy-Noir" with some colourful contrasts. Nice bathroom, I won't mention cracked basin because everything else made up for it. Oops did I say cracked basin? Hotel photos are true to reality. Bed was big, soft topped and a good night's sleep was had. My only niggle is the $4.50 charge for credit card. Like, seriously guys? Just include it in the price and don't upset me! Please! $4.50 for paying? Everyone pays with a card. Stop annoying your customers!~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_473325374~“Great staff, great location but extremely expensive”~We liked it here for the central location and the impeccable staff. But the hotel is an expensive place to stay and the food and drinks are extortionate. $40 for a breakfast for one person is really too much, no mattr how tasty. Drinks at the bar are eye wateringly expensive too. We were upgraded and our room was very small - barely room for the suitcases - so God knows what the basic rooms are like. We chose this hotel as it has a gym and pool but both are tiny and disappointing.~2~nan~4~nan~1~nan~5~nan
review_473293289~“Very Nice!”~Stay at the Swissotel as a part of a 2 day work conference being held at the hotel.

review_473133086~“Simply stunning”~Went to the Swissotel on a work conference recently, the conference was held at the same location. It surprised me when arriving on ground floor and then going to the 8th floor for the lobby, but was like wow seeing the place. The lobby looked really nice, the rooms looked great. Exactly what was needed for an individual on a work trip. Beautiful venue, great meals in the kitchen also, great facilities. Thanks for having us.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473044149~“Disapointed”~Arrived at 4pm to be told our room was not ready. We waited in the bar, purchased drinks, not offered as much as a cup of coffee on the house - our room was available at 5.45pm Prior to arriving we were not advised that the valet parking was not available due to road works & we had to find our own parking 2 blocks away & carry our own luggage to & from the car park.~3~2~5~5~3~4~3~nan
review_472977142~“No my cup if tea!”~Booked direct on hotel website 2 rooms for 3 nights-could have got it cheaper on another website but the hotel website said that we would be upgraded to next room category(subject to availability).When we checked in I mentioned this and the receptionist said she had never heard of such a thing and it wasn't available anyway-how naive and disappointed was I!!!The food in the bar is a problem we had an awful lunch and breakfast mistakes both times but to be fair the poor items were removed from the bill.thought the street level foyer was a bit scruffy but I suppose it is open to the elements.Wish I had gone a bit more upmarket.Staff in the bar were however very polite.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_472766257~“Supurb”~Amazing hotel. Amazing breakfast, amazing staff. There was a slight problem but that was our own fault. Our flight with British Airways landed 5.20 in the morning but we was unable to check in until 11. The receptionist took our cases and said we can use the spar/pool or pay to have a breakfast. We went out into the city instead to look around. It was early but it was quiet and we took the sites in and enjoyed our stay. We stayed in Room 1920 with balcony. It's nice and high and great view. Amazing shower, also desperate bath. Comfy bed. With coffee and kettle. The buffet breakfast was the best breakfast I've ever had in a hotel. Everything you could imagine was there. Even a honeycomb for fresh honey. Pancake maker, the lot. I will be back here to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472508165~“A very disappointing experience”~This was a very disappointing experience. The hotel has no idea concerning guest relations. We stayed for 8 nights in what is called an executive suite. There is only one on each floor but they are right behind the lift shaft so that at times it seems you are at a railway station, especially if in the bathroom or trying to sleep before midnight.The outlook/ view was better from some other rooms. The executive lounge breakfast was very poor. When these matters were raised with the guest relations person the answer was ...didn't they tell you the room was behind the lift? The hotel has no regard to Platinum membership or business plus membership of Accor at all. The breakfast , at a cost, on the 8th floor looked much better but despite a suggestion by me that in the circunstances we could be offered this as a goodwill gesture, it was flatly rejected. There is a real problem arriviving by car as it is rately one can pull upnear the hotel and then quickly unload. I could elaborate much more .~2~1~2~1~1~4~3~nan
review_472226027~“Terrific”~Spent the weekend in Sydney off that back of a business and trip and booked the Swissotel on a recommendation. We had a Corner Premier King Room and it was stunning. Clean, contemporary, well designed and comfortable. The staff were delightful and beyond helpful, and the hotel was brilliantly located in the heart of the city right under Centrepoint, on top of Westfield and next to the QVB, a 15 minute walk to Circular Quay. We honestly couldn't fault the property in any way. Highly recommended. We'll be back!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472079833~“High Tea ”~We recently purchased the High Tea lunch experience from Scoopon. We weren't sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised when we got there and our food came out. All the food was beautiful.  The only suggestion we could make is to have a few more savoury bites and less sweet ones. This may not suit everyone but all six of us who attended prefer savoury to sweet dishes. Maybe you could give people the option to select either equal serves or specify their preference.  The eating space was pristine, the staff were very friendly and provided a great atmosphere. We would recommend this high tea.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471852978~“For a 5 stars, only between good to very good hotel”~For a 5 stars hotel, I was expexting a bit more: when I arrived in the late evening, nobdoy was there to take care of my lugagges and i hand to carry all of them from the taxy ground floor to the 2nd level. then again after the check in nobody to help me to go to my room. Same when I left. The main restaurant is closed on Sunday evening and you can only get some light dinner from a "sort of" bar. The rest of the stay was very good, the room and service was great, the restaurant (when open) was good and the service efficient. the breakfast was excellent, but sometime it was a bit Noisy ¨ With some effort at arrival and departure and having a restaurant all the time open, i would have almost rate it excellent.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471372415~“CLEAN, renovated and CBD Central.”~Perfectly located for CBD central excitement of shopping or a stroll to Darling Harbour only 10mins (even for the younger children ).  We were in an upgraded premium room with two large double beds( queen size). Looking straight out onto Sydney Eye Tower. The children were amazed. Renovated rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and extra pillows, slippers and bathrobes. The bathrooms have a full bathtub and shower with good amenities (no toothbrush/toothpaste) however the service is so great I expect you could ask!  Buffet breakfast was sufficient and fresh. Staff welcome you on arrival and make your first hot beverage request.  All your options of an egg station cooked to your liking, as well as the usual bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes etc are included. Having an outdoor pool is a bonus. And you can order drinks from a phone!  Valet parking is a must. A little daunting for people not used to it, however concierge quickly clam your nerves in the crazy traffic and take control. They are professionals.  And it's just as easy when you have them collect your car. Make sure you let them know 20mins ahead of time~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470833018~“Hits & Misses”~I've stayed in the Swissôtels in Singapore and Bangkok and have to say that I am a little disappointed with the property in Sydney.  To be fair, there are some good points too: newly furnished rooms, good location as it's right smack in the middle of CBD with shopping and restaurants around. We had complimentary champagne as its our anniversary and that was a sweet gesture. One of the staff Tin Latt from concierge went out of his way to get us an extension wire as our plug won't fit into the wall socket, that was commendable.  The misses. The 1st room we checked in for a night had an extremely filthy kettle, I washed it out with hot boiling water twice and still couldn't get the grit out, so I gave up on having tea by then. The bathroom toilet seats were extremely dirty with dark stains and I wondered if housekeeping actually did something to it.  2nd room we checked in surprisingly had no bottled water. The bathroom door couldn't close and despite speaking to reception to get engineering to get it fixed, nothing was done. On our last night, housekeeping even forgot to top up the amenities.  Perhaps I went with high expectations of the brand but left disappointed. Sorry, but I would check out other hotels in the city next time.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470429609~“Very Handy”~We stayed here in late November 2016 for a quick trip to Sydney to view the xmas decorations, collections & blooms etc. Sydney is always great to visit around Nov., getting ready for Xmas. The Swissotel in Market street is in super location & could not find any better for proximity to Westfield, David Jones & Myer. The twin bedded room was quiet & all we needed to enjoy our stay of 4 nights. The bathroom worked well with a separate shower, along with really good hanging space in the wardrobes. We ate in the café located just across from reception. This had absolutely no character of ambience & would not return - more fun sitting in Westfield'ses food court. Yes we would return.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_470250365~“Fantastic location , wonderful team”~Just back from a girls weekend in Sydney loved this hotel . Fantastic location but the highlight for me was the genuine warmth of the team working there. For a large hotel in a major city it had the warmth of a country hotel, they made our stay very pleasant.Loved it and will be back. I would recommend this hotel for weekends away / business but maybe not romantic get aways~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470212691~“Awesome hotel!!”~Perfect location. Very helpful room attendants. The property is clean and tidy.  Only downside would be that the quality of slippers provided is quite questionable for a hotel of this standard. Rest all perfect!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469713390~“Mixed feelings ”~I have to say I have very mixed emotions on my stay at this hotel. There was a mix up in my booking which I have to say the staff dealt with very professionally.  Rooms are nice and clean,modern in design and comfortable.  I did have some experiences with the staff which were less favourable however. Seemed to be a great variation in staff qual5and professionalism in my brief experience. Biggest minus for me however is the parking which is located about 5 blocks away. On a rainy Sydney day this wasn't a pleasant stroll to the car.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469685242~“Great location with great rooms and an outside pool. ”~I've visited this hotel several times. It is walking distance to the Westfield Pitt street shopping area and opposite the State Theatre.  It is close enough to walk or take a quick taxi or bus to circular quay/rocks area.  You walk into a door where there are valet staff which is not inviting and not a good first impression, however when you take the lift up to the reception lobby you now realise you're in a luxury hotel! The rooms are great and beds very comfy. The outside pool with jacuzzi is amazing for a hotel in the middle of the city! The breakfast is a good option too. There are not great views from the hotel but this didn't make a difference to us.  Valet parking is the only way to go if you're driving to the hotel as the road leading to the front of the hotel is so busy, make sure you stay in the right lane and park and go and get a valet staff member and they will go and park your car for $60 for 24 hrs (unless this price has changed) ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469580029~“Excellent”~We usually stay in another well known 5 star hotel but they unfortunately did not have a room for our dates so we decided to stay at the Swissotel Sydney and we are very glad that we made that decision. The room on the 13th floor was spotlessly clean, nice views and very contemporary decor. It was pretty quiet at night and we were only woken in the morning by the usual inconsiderate guests who like to slam their doors closed.  We did however find check in slow. There was only one person on reception when we arrived who was busy serving somebody with a lot of questions. When we got fed up with waiting we attracted the attention of somebody who came out of the office who directed another person to the reception desk. Unfortunately the PC then had to be rebooted and so another wait. There were also only two towels in the bathroom which we didn't think were sufficient. Apart from those two issues we had a very good stay and would return.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

Tv signal very clear unlike some other inner city hotels ( it's the little things sometimes ). Comfortable bed and room facilities and it always looks clean and modern. Room service dinner very tasty ( salmon and green veg) , hot and cooked well. I used both the pool ( a little chilly for a heated pool) and the gym.

review_469045298~“Dreadful ”~I had standard expectations for this "5 star" hotel, and whilst the location is great, there's nothing else worth rating. My room service of a "vegetable" salad speaks for itself (see pictures), if I had only wanted a bowl of spinach leaves then maybe I would have been happy, but for the veggies to be only a minuscule handful?! And $20? Get real.  The service in general is average, room size is good, bathroom is large, but aside from that, this hotel is just in a great location and nothing more.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The location of this hotel is really good. You can walk to a lot of places from the location. You are also close to the Victoria Building which you must go inside and walk around.

review_468725068~“A Dream Hotel in a Wonderful City”~This is one of the best hotels i have stayed in. The service & staff absolutely made this hotel. I spent 16 days in the Swissotel & it was an absolute dream. From the first moment i walked into the hotel the staff treat you so personally. Most of the staff i came into contact with in the lobby & at reception remembered your name from the first meeting &always greeted you with 'hello Ms Williams, or Hello Ms Sara' which i thought was lovely. Anytime i left the hotel for a run & came back, the lobby staff would offer me a bottle of water. The Hotel reception area is very grand & spotlessly clean. There was often a pianist playing music or live singers in the evening.  There was a lovely relaxing bar to have a drink at & the breakfast was delicious with great choices & well cooked food. The only issue here would be that the tea/coffee that is offered when you walk in takes an absolute age to get... sometimes i had even left before it arrived.  The bedrooms were very spacious with the most comfy beds, great linen & a pillow menu should you so desire.The maid service was excellent & the rooms were again spotlessly clean. The spa & the staff within the hotel were again excellent. They remember your name which i think is such an important part of customer service, & they are extremely helpful.The pool area was lovely, but did not have enough sunbeds. The gym was great & had excellent selection of equipment.  I will definitely return to this hotel when next in Sydney~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468683676~“Very spacious room”~Very central. Great place to explore the city and the staff very helpful and friendly. We went to check in early and would have been able to get a room straight away, however the gentleman on reception suggested that if we were not in a hurry he could store our bags and a much better room would be available in 2 hours. We had not come off a long flight , so we went to explore and have a leisurely glass of wine before checking in. Our room was fantastic, a corner room with two windows. Very spacious, clean and comfortable with a large bathroom. We didn't eat here but would definitely recommend the accommodation here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467512929~“Biz trip for a week”~Well located in the shopping hub. Very busy hotel with a diverse clientele. Rooms are compact but modern (After renovations). Very good service but the waiting time was a little longer than other similar establishments for everything. That's checkin to baggage arrival to room service. Biggest upside is the location. Biggest issue - they don't have their own driveway so dropping off a car is challenging.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467438986~“Top Hotel in Top Location”~I would highly recommend this Hotel. Especially if you want a luxury break! Everything was pristine, everyone working there was courteous and keen to ensure you felt welcome. Located right in shopping district of the city centre, so easy to get to most city locations. Although now part of Accor group, loyalty programmes were not yet merged - probably the only fault.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467401730~“Beautiful hotel”~First off this hotel is in a great location! Right in the heart of things, near loads of shops, QVB and plenty of bars and dining. The foyers are all a bit 90s but the rooms are gorgeous. We dined in the bar and the restaurant. Each time the service was absolutely first rate. It is expensive food, as hotels always are, but the quality was good. The rooftop pool is great to hang out on. Our only quibble was that we had to chase up our poolside drinks orders a few times.  They offer a pillow menu, with a variety of options you can have sent up. The bathrooms and showers are lush and top notch and one of the best beds I've ever slept in. This hotel really exceeded my expectations at every encounter.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467127015~“60th Birthday”~Stayed at the Swissotel as a surprise for my husbands birthday. Check in was slow and disappointing as I had requested a higher level room which was not given. So I paid $100 a night extra for a skyline suite on the 25th floor As I am an Accor & Swissotel member I thought they would be more accommodating. Thank you to Suzanne for the chocolate cake left in our room a nice surprise. There wasn't a view to speak of just roof tops. Suite was spacious and very modern and clean. Water pressure in the shower was pathetic and tiles very slippery. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and did a great job. Executive suites intitles you to use the Executive Lounge. This was disappointing constantly running out of food. The standard of food was poor and very little variety over the six nights. The F@B Manager needs to visit Sofitel Melbourne to get some fresh ideas as this Executive Lounge is amazing. Also it doesn't open till 5.30pm which I think is too late. We didn't dine in the restaurant so can't comment. Had to pay for a later check out. Accor bought out the Swissotel chain many months ago and still no member benefits. Hotel is very handy to shops and the train station. I don't think I would stay again as I don't think it was worth $3700.00 NZ ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467078491~“Adequate”~Adequate hotel nothing special about hotel rooms, smallish, a little worn and the tv very poorly placed in our room, more of a businessman hotel, than a couples hotel, good bathroom with both a shower and a bath~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466646252~“Wonderful stay”~My daughter and I stayed 2 nights and the entire stay was wonderful from the moment we walked in the door. Every staff member from porters, concierge, reception, wait staff and room service were friendly, helpful and professional. One of the best hotels I've experienced recently. Will definitely recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465947098~“Appreciate Genuine Service, but Internet Speed must be Improved”~Appreciate genuine guest service. I have encountered a reception trainee who obviously has had a great service mentality. This fact alone will bring me back to stay here again. Thank you.  Only one thing disappointed was internet speed that was troublesome. I hope the wifi get improved to the today's standard without delay. Free wifi is provided to Accor Hotel Members, otherwise chargeable. I don't think such Accor Group policy is being reasonable, although I have enjoyed free wifi being a member. It shall be free for all the guests.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_465244692~“Opposite Great Restaurant and State Theatre. Shopping District”~Wonderful location. Walking distance to loads of shopping centres, opposite a great restaurant - Gowings and State Theatre. Wifi in the room can be a tad weak.  We had an extra bed added in for our child. Room was a good size and it didnt feel cramped with the extra bed.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463576851~“Ideal location”~The hotel is in a fabulous shopping location. The room was well presented and clean. The staff at concierge fantastic, however this does not follow through to the other areas of staffing. The bar staff was busy packing up instead of serving hotel guests and our guests. We were told the area needed to be cleaned and we were not able to order coffee or drinks . This was at 1030pm on a Saturday night.The Hotel amenities were adequate. The room service fairly priced and quality was good, the servings were enormous.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463330853~“Perfect Location”~Recently spent 3 nights here and simply could not fault the place Perfectly located within easy walking distance to both Circular Quay and Darling Harbour, great access from the airport via the train  The Hotel is surrounded by wonderful shopping, historic pubs, cafes and more shopping if required The hotel rooms themselves were very modern clean and professionally managed, nice overall size as well The restaurant food was simply faultless and the overall service from all staff was exceptional, simply wouldn't stay anywhere else whilst in Sydney, well worth the price if you are simply after a flawless experience  Can't wait to get back ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462809674~“Pleasant stay recommended”~Directly over the road from the amazing State Theatre, this hotel was a very pleasant stay. I was only booked for one night and almost wished I didn't have to move on. The room was well appointed and reasonably spacious and the bathroom was huge with a wonderful shower and a large separate bath. Room service wasn't cheap but neither was it outrageous. I'd happily return for a longer stay to get a better feel for the hotel and its surrounds. Interesting with the lobby on the 8th floor but a very efficient extension of the concierge at the street entrance to help you out.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462590010~“fantastic”~Booked this hotel as a last minute due to the very disappointing accommodation booked through Airbnb. We weren't disappointed this time. Could not fault anything about this accommodation. Staff professionalism exceeded our expectation as well as the rest of the amenities offered,~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_462119579~“very friendly”~e have stayed there a few times and each one the staff are super friendly. The consierage are very helpful and so are the staff upon check in.

review_461867996~“Fantastic ”~Very central, fantastic staff with rooms that have only recently been renovated. The reason to stay is simple. It's located in the middle of a major shopping centre with a multitude of high quality retail outlets in every direction with the botanical gardens and the NSW art museum all with in walking distance.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461755013~“Great hotel”~We were in Sydney for a family function and stayed at the Swissotel. Booked under a package that included breakfast and parking. The hotel is lovely despite the convoluted entry - you have to take a lift from the ground floor to the lobby. Then another lift to your room.  The rooms are attractive, spacious, well laid-out and comfortable. Our bathroom was huge and even had a full-size bath. The room, and the hotel in general, was immaculately clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well. The package included breakfast which was in a lovely restaurant on the lobby floor. The food and drink offerings were excellent and there were plenty of options. A special mention has to be made about the very helpful, friendly and courteous staff. Particularly the guys on the concierge desk and the valet parking crew. They were all helpful, engaging and a delight to deal with.  All un all this is an excellent hotel and we would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461348613~“Spa Day”~Thank you to the team at the Swissotel Spa. What a fabulous day. My partner and I enjoyed some time by the pool, glass of sparkles, chocolate strawberries and fabulous spa treatments. The staff were fantastic and we will definitely be back!  Thank you!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Breakfast deal was inexpensive and fabulous brekky, even got honey and swiss muslii, honey came from 5th floor beehives. great that they had happy hour in afternoon after conference when we could all go for a drink afterwards. My son was able to come and go , use the pool and gym etc. we stayed 2 nights.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_461102317~“Family trip”~Stayed on the 23rd floor in a Swiss Advantage room. The room was quite large even with 2 cots! You need to keep a eye out for the bell boys or you could drive straight past. Great service with valet parking. Great views over the city, lots of windows. Great to have Nespresso machine in the room. My daughter loved getting a chocolate from the staff when they where doing turndowns. Although a older hotel now, you can not go wrong with the location, it is great to be able to just walk out of hotel and you are in Pitt street mall. Will stay here again.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460540424~“A wonderful hotel”~I hesitated when first booking this hotel. It just seemed too expensive but it was worth every penny(cent!). It is located in the heart of Sydney with the fabulous harbour with it's bridge and the Sydney Opera House easily accessible. An evening meal in Darling harbour was extra special. The botanical gardens and St. Mary's Cathedral are also nearby. I have nevr stayed in an hotel where the staff have been so helpful, they were extraordinary. I would stay there again if I am ever in Sydney again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459546817~“If you have allergies, triple check your booking!”~Unfortunately on check in, it was advised that my request for hypoallergenic bedding was not passed through from my booking. As i had booked on line, i thought maybe i missed it. So I asked the girl at the front desk to request housekeeping change our bedding, as the hotel was full and we could not shift to a hypoallergenic room. This appeared to be no trouble, except two hours later as we left the hotel to go out we had still not seen housekeeping, so I asked again at the front desk for this to happen. When we returned that night at around 10.30pm it was clear that there was still feather bedding, so i went back to the front desk. Once again I saw the trainee who contacted housekeeping immediately, and they arrived at our room very quickly this time. Turns out they had changed bedding on one bed but not the second in the room... not sure why when it was clear it was a room for two adults and two kids on our booking. Whilst the trainee did her best, i was pretty annoyed with housekeeping. There were also only three towels in the room for four of us. The room itself was clean, the service at the desk was good, and the food we ordered for dessert was lovely. But I did expect more from a hotel of this class and for the price I paid for the night. The manager on duty did try to appease the situation by offering free breakfast but we were already needing to be checked out. I have stayed a few times at this Swissotel given the great location but i might try somewhere new next time....if you need to get feather free bedding, triple check your booking and make sure housekeeping are clear!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459040833~“it' always a treat to stay here”~We've stayed here a few times and love that it's close to shops and good restaurants. Since the last time we stayed, new carpet has been put in. We got upgraded to a room on a higher floor and am not sure if it was a higher value room but we the pillows, bedding, and bed were extremely comfortable. We also enjoyed the luxury of nespresso in the morning. Wish we could have stayed longer. If you're into Pokemon, I was able to collect balls from 2 Pokestops from our hotel room, which our son was ecstatic about.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_458845322~“Fantastic hotel, great location.”~I stayed a weekend here and i couldn't fault it. Concierge were so friendly and couldn't do enough for you! Renovations look great. Room was lovely and spotless! The beds were very comfortable. The outdoor pool is great and a generous size. The location is great if you are a keen shopper, practically right next to the Westfield and a very short walking distance to the restaurants on darling harbour which was great! Nicest stay I've had at a hotel yet.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458782025~“Centrally located, good facilities, ok staff ”~I rang this hotel to book 2 rooms - interconnecting rooms. I was told there were none available so I asked for a room that is really close together whether the doors are just literally next to each other. I got given 2 rooms but the doors are about 2 metres apart. Clearly they don't know their hotel layout. On check in, the staff tried to help me but she couldn't find a close enough room on the same floor. She eventually found 2 rooms close enough but we were told that it would have to be an upgrade. Since it was their mistake I would have thought that the upgrade would be complimentary, clearly it wasn't. Rooms were not vacuumed while we were there. Ordered room service and the rice came in lukewarm and so it had hard bits. Breakfast is average. The only thing I'd rave about is the nice facial - which of course didn't come cheap. If you want central location stay here but they don't have views. If you want service and quality stay somewhere else.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458760078~“A real treat ”~This hotel never fails to impress. I would say it's in the best location easy walk to all the downtown restaurants and attractions. On arrival we were upgraded to a different room on a higher floor. The beds and pillows and super comfortable. If you get the chance stay here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458463048~“Perfect Location”~The best thing about this hotel is its location! Very convenient. The lovely QVB and Strand Arcade are just around the corner, and the Westfield is just next to the hotel. Within a few min walk is a supermarket, the Town Hall Station and Hyde park. The Darling Harbour is around 20 min walk away, and you can even walk up to Circular Quay within 30 min.  Its not cheap to stay in this hotel, but the room is spacious and clean. Great staff, great service. Checked in at 9am, although the room was not ready yet, they called me around 11am and let me know that room was ready. I haven't tried the breakfast as I have plenty of choices for breakfast nearby.  I will definitely stay in this hotel the next time I visit Sydney.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458204770~“Not as good as previous stays”~We have stayed at the Swissotel many times as it has such a good location to the shopping mall in Sydney. The rooms have been improved on the executive level but still the same layout. The executive Club was dissappointing we have always included this in our booking but this time it seemed tired with the same food as always nothing new. They use the words gourmet I would not agree. The usual staff have left the hotel and the level of service and friendliness was not very good. The afternoon tea was a bit stale and not much taste. My mother was very dissappointed. I am reluctant to do bad reviews but it was so obvious to our last 6 stays at the hotel. Just book a cheaper room on lower levels is my suggestion. The location is still very good.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_458148439~“Great Hotel”~Wonderfully renovated hotel with tasteful room decor. The hotel is in a great location right by Pitt Street Mall.

review_457793765~“Great hotel and great location ”~Unfortunately our stay was a short one. It was our first time to stay at this hotel but it will not be our last! We have stayed in many hotels in Sydney and I must say this hotel is now my favourite! The room was bright and spotless. The location was superb especially if you are a keen shopper! The staff were delightful especially Sean at the concierge desk who was very obliging and helpful when it came time to collect our car. The breakfast was very good and even the coffee gets a thumbs up!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457493233~“Great renovated hotel”~Swissotel Sydney is a great hotel in a Sydney CBD with bright rooms and all the amenities.  PROS - Great looking cheek lobby  - Absolutely striking rooms with nice views and all amenities with nice toiletries  - Most of staff members are friendly - Nice newly added swimming pool with a jacuzzi - Excellent location in a heart of CBD - Absolutely fantastic bed CONS - Attentive but more formal staff attitude - Check out at noon with 3 pm check in - unbelievably unfair. We had an anniversary and any kind request to extend out check out to 1 pm were declined  - Sauna in SPA is too cold (58C), no steam room Verdict: Great renovated hotel in Sydney, worth staying at, but not on the top of customer service....~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
