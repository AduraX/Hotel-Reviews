review_474825831~“I just love this place ”~This hotel is quirky, unique and such good value for money. I love staying here and have done so about six times already. The location is great - close to Paddy's Markets and an easy walk to Central Station and the light rail (which takes you into Darling Harbour in minutes). Some parts of the room/stay will make you laugh or shake your head but it's all part of the joy of not staying in your bog-standard hotel. Our room on the sixth floor was huge with views over George St to the Central Station clock tower. Some may find the road a bit noisy in which case I recommend a lower room facing Valentine St. Also the blinds in the sixth floor room don't quite meet (see what I mean) so if you need block out curtains in order to sleep then choose one of the rooms facing Valentine St too. Thanks Valentine for another fun, affordable and comfortable stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474764174~“Great Location ”~Close to China Town, Paddy's Market and Darling Harbour....all walkable Good value for the cost.  Room and bed were comfortable Staff were very accommodating.  Stayed one nite after a cruise.  Lots of good restaurants close by.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473492943~“Designer chic - I think - but getting dated and a bit shabby”~I think this place would've been a head turner when it was first decorated - but it's getting shabby and reminds me of someone who's clung to a hairstyle that suited them when 20 but looks a bit odd at 40! I had a really nice stay - great location. Nice and quiet. But I'd have preferred less funk and more function. Needs some more power points. Didn't' bother with the most minuscule TV I've ever seen (even though it's supposed to be modelled on one in the Museum of Modern Art in New York (I think I got that right). Send these tellies off to NY and get some large flat screens would be my philistine advice! Lighting was of the mood variety - but its hard to shave when the bathroom is lit up like a chill out room in a nightclub at 6am in the morning. The hot water in the hand basin took such a long time to heat up that I'm afraid I may've drained a few reservoirs around Sydney. But - nice toiletries supplied and room was beautifully serviced. Free Wifi that was also effective - a real bonus!!! Glad I stayed and if you're looking for something different and retro chic - give Valentines on George a try!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_473025711~“Nina”~Clean room, helpful friendly staff. Good location very close to the train station and walking distance to shops. Very secure hotel felt safe at night time. only thing would not let us check out late but did hold our bags.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469523517~“OK room but not great.”~I wasn't happy that we couldn't check in to our room early. After a 17 hour flight I didn't like having to kill time at the airport before heading to the hotel. It must mean something when many taxi drivers didn't know where it was. A couple of the staff were helpful and polite.    Our room was different then most hotels that I've stayed in. The room was a long narrow room with concrete floors. Lots of windows that went almost to the floor but blinds let in some light. Bathroom looked like it must have recently been redone. Large 2 person shower and nice sink. Hole in wall where the towel rack had previously been attached. The bed was nice and comfortable and the room was clean. Large concrete post divided the bed area from the rest of the room. Decoration looked like it was bought at a yard sale. Metal desk, low wicker chairs in sitting area, one white plastic lamp and also a metal lamp. An area rug in the sitting area. Coffee maker, and fridge. There was a small black plastic box by the wicker chairs that turned out to be a small TV. TV channels were three news, a weather channel and a couple of sports channels. A/C didn't push out much in the way of cool air. When we asked for ice, we were told no ice and no ice bucket. One staff got us ice from the connected restaurant but another wouldn't get us any. No restaurant for breakfast and no continental breakfast. When we asked the staff for a nearby restaurant for breakfast, they couldn't help us. We spent most of our three day stay touring Sydney but when we returned to our room we wanted a comfortable room but this was only fair.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_464866319~“Excellent location if you love walking.”~We were fascinated by the door key/card also controlling the lights. The floor was cement and the lighting was hidden under long desk/table attached to the wall. Good planning since the room is a compact size. Loved the bathroom lol. We enjoyed the location very much.  We give 2 thumbs up to Nooraini Ghani and a big thank you for her assistance. It was extra work on her part to send an item back to Canada for us and were are thankful. She made us very happy :)~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_461569112~“Affordable, close to Central Station and Chinatown”~We stayed here for two nights and loved the price and location. Easy 5 minute walk from Central station even with two big suitcases. Close to Ultimo, Powerhouse Museum, Chinatown and Paddy's Market. Good sized room with a lovely bathroom and fabulous shower. The staff were friendly and helpful. I did read a review where they had trouble getting into the building, you either press the buzzer or use your room card. The hotel is small which made it lovely and quiet and we couldn't hear any outside noise. The front door is located in Valentine Street just down from the Thai restaurant on the corner. Would definitely stay here again next time we are in Sydney.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_457012986~“Trouble getting in”~DON't use this hotel if travelling from U.K. Or Europe. After a 22 hour flight had to wander around the streets from 10am to 2pm. The owner/ receptionist was determined not to let us in before booking in time regardless of how tired we were. Even then we had trouble getting anyone to answer the bell. Not a good start to a holiday,and never in the world have I found no one on reception.~1~nan~nan~nan~4~4~1~nan
review_454659764~“Affordable place in expensive Sydney”~Hidden on small side street of China town, it is hotel with very nicely decorated spacious hotel rooms. Reasonable price and friendly service. Printed maps and all about Sydney info was available at the reception. 5 min from metro station. Perfect if You want secure and unexpensive stay in Sydney. All Chinese eateries are walking distance and food markets as well .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450000789~“Affordable accommodation close to Central Railway Station.”~We chose Valentine On George online. It was close to the Central Railway Station and affordable. It didn't look much from the outside and when you enter the foyer it was ordinary looking and had a smell of Asian cooking we are assuming from the restaurant next door. However, the hotel was secure. It was clean. Our room was comfortable especially the bathroom and the king size bed.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_446630495~“Strategic location and near Central Station”~I stayed there from 4-9 December 2016. The room was clean and the service was good. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The owners are Malaysians. The hotel is in very strategic location and it's near Central Station. Will stay there again next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_437248452~“If you like China town, this is the place to stay ”~We liked the location. Super close to the subway making it easy to get to and from the airport. I felt really secure here. Your room key is required to get into the building and access the elevators to your room. The reason for the 4 stars versus 5 is the "flat screen tv"~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432809795~“Worth it”~It's a fair distance walk from Central Station to the hotel with my pregnant wife. The hotel has a good size, clean bathroom and the room itself is very spacious considering the hotel price is cheap. There are 2 asian restaurant beside the hotel, a must try. In the morning you can grab a coffee opposite the hotel, i think it's a Colombian owned cafe, try their sandwich.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_425741273~“Friendly Staff, clean room, conveniently location”~2nd time staying at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful, the hotel is conveniently located near Central station, 5 mins walk from China Town. Room is spacious and clean, but tv was a bit old and small. Will definitely come back again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421205091~“Surprised”~For some reason hotels in Sydney were way overpriced for when I was visiting so ended up having to book this hotel. Being honest I was not looking forward to staying here. Upon arrival at about 10pm I checked in fine and went to my room which was actually quite nice. Very modern and clean bathroom and the room itself was very spacious. Very handily placed close to the station and just off the Main Street to walk down to the harbour.  Negative Reception area and landing area could do with a bit of modernisation.  Overall this was a very pleasant stay and goes to show you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418590207~“Convenient comfortable and Quirky”~Wanted a cheap clean and comfortable hotel to stay overnight when I attended a conference in Sydney. Valentine on George more than delivered. Reception staff all friendly and helpful (no problem to leave bag before check in and after check out.) Room was clean and comfortable and with a funky urban decor nodding to 1970. Bose sound system was a surprise.  Location is brilliant. So close to Central Station, CBD, Surrey Hills, China Town, Darling Harbour etc.Able to access conference during day and head off to dinner at night, all near by.  For the price this hotel is excellent value. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414702269~“Pleasant stay”~Centrally located, a stone's throw from the train station making it a good base to travel around Sydney. The room is very spacious, very clean, and serviced very well. It has a boutique feel to it. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397040258~“Locked for 40min. upon arrival”~I arrived from overseas on Sunday afternoon (13:00) to find the hotel locked; nobody appeared or answered the phone for nearly forty minutes. When someone did show up, there was no apology. (Note that I did follow their intricate pre-check in procedure, so the hotel management had my arrival time information.) The room was fine, but the maid washed the dishes in the bathroom sink and left food remains in the sink. The room also had flies (in the winter, no less!). I can't say that I would recommend the Valentine on George. Surely there are cleaner and more reliable hotels or AirBnB options.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390278149~“Great Location”~Great place to stay. Close to Central Station and local Market Mall. Staff were very good explaining with a map for us to use to get around. Travel by bus, train and ferry was only $15 per day with an Opal Card which made travel very affordable. The only thing that could be improved was the lighting in the room. Very hard to read in bed with the dim lights. The cleaner could have done a better job with the cleaning of the toilet and dusting the furniture. Otherwise a place we would go back to. Staff were great at confirming our taxi pick up and a wake up call at 5.00am~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_389901060~“The Sydney experience”~I am an editor of a community newspaper in the states who spent time in Sydney first and then headed to Melbourne. My girlfriend and I fell in love with this hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly and assisted us with directions whenever we needed them. This hotel is only a 5-minute walk from Central Station's trains, light rail and underground. Within a short walking distance are scores of good restaurants and shopping centers. The room was comfortable, the Wi-Fi worked well and the security was good. Our room was near the cathedral, and on Sunday morning, the tolling bells added a memory from our youth.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_387645316~“A real disappointment.”~My family and I stayed at Valentine on George for 3 nights. We booked the two bedroom apartment and found the facilities to be pleasant enough, however the room was very hot and there were cockroaches in the cupboards and drawers.  After spending over an hour trying to get the aircon to work, a staff member came and "fixed" it. By 8pm the room was still stifling hot and everyone was struggling to sleep as opening the windows meant too much city noise. We saw the duty manager to register a complaint and request to be moved. Apparently they knew prior to our arrival that the air conditioning didn't work and failed to disclose it. The staff member said it had been broken "for weeks".  Unfortunately the hotel (and most of the rest of Sydney CBD so we couldn't love hotels) was fully booked until the following day.  The next day we were moved to a smaller 2 bedroom apartment down the hall and the state of the room was appalling. Wet stains on the carpet that remained damp for the duration of our stay, mould on the bath, handprints all over the mirrors and ripped carpet throughout. Our baby was learning to crawl at the time and we couldn't put her on the floor it was so disgusting. The cleaners just shrugged. It was an absolutely miserable stay. I forwarded the attached photos and my complaint to the hotel manager who refunded the full amount of our stay - however, they did not respond at all (even to inform us of the refund!)  All in all I would not recommend this hotel. Poor communication and filthy rooms.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_385182159~“Comfortable and convenient”~Husband and I spent 4 days at this hotel and although it is tucked away down a side street and is 'no frills', it was spacious, comfortable and central. We were a 5 minute walk to Central station, 5 minutes to Chinatown and Paddy's Market, 10 minutes to Town Hall and Darling Harbour. Quiet and convenient at a reasonable price. Only negative was the tiny 'box' TV!~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_381961589~“Hard too Find but worth it”~Nice big rooms, beds are a little low for me but slept very good. Very convenient to the train station, all transportation runs from the station.

review_376337542~“The man at the front desk is a disgrace”~This would have been a 5 star review. The location is great, the rooms were funky and nice, it has a boutique feel with a chain price in the center of the city, key card swipes are required to go upstairs making it feel safe, it was a great stay.  But the jerk at the front desk ruined it.  I checked out this morning, turned in my key card, and stored my bags. I had a lovely conversation with the female owner, I assumed, about teenagers and the Internet, travel and more. I told her I'd be back between 6:30 and 7 to pick up my bags. She said, the door is locked then, just ring the bell.  Upon arrival at 6:40, I did as she requested. A man, claiming to be the owner, poked his head around the desk, looked at me, and then picked up a phone to talk on the intercom instead of letting me in. But between his accent and the system's delay and poor transmission, I couldn't understand what he was saying. So he started yelling. "WHERE IS YOUR ROOM KEY? This is a private hotel!" So I shouted back, "I don't have one, please open the door!" He continued to tell me I was not allowed in the hotel, I assume hoping I'd go away. I finally shouted that I would call the police to get my bags and he finally pressed the button which opens the door. By the time I got to the desk, he had rolled my suitcase and dropped my bag (containing a laptop) on the ground. Of course by this point I'm pretty pissed off. Not only have I been banging on the hotel but I'm having to shout to make him open a door, he man-handled my property and he's still going on about how he assumed I was "not a customer".  So based on all the language they have about "no guests past 10pm" and "no one not listed on the room list being allowed in" I can only assume he thought I was a prostitute. And he didn't deny it when I asked. He just sat in silence until I started recording. He claims in the video I shot that since I didn't identify myself, he thought I was there to "disrupt the customers".  Last I checked paying $100+ USD made me a customer too. Not to mention, there's nothing but a desk in the lobby. There's no way to "disrupt the customers" without the key card which I OBVIOUSLY didn't have.  Don't book here. Especially minority solo travelers.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368463199~“CONVENIENTLY LOCATED IN SYDNEY”~Though the hotel was hard to find due to a lack of signage (maybe it's a speakeasy hotel), the front desk staff were friendly throughout. We were in walking distance to Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Ultimo and public transport. The modern (lights powered by room key inserted into a slot) and eclectic room was very clean, good amenities were provided, though the AC was not cold.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_368126250~“Lousy hotel and sickening attitude from the manager”~Dear friends please do not book this hotel. We saw it online with the competitive rates and booked it for a whole week. Upon arrival- the hotel is very dirty ,smelly and unkempt. The manager keeps the main door locked and started accusing us of arriving earlier than the check in time, though her morning shift staff was the one who asked us to come by 11 am. She passed a few racist comments as well- much to our shock and disappointment.  If you decide to book this place ,be prepared to wait for hours for the door to be opened. The front desk has nobody monitoring it. This is also a big problem. Luckily we got into Novotel later,which provides much better service. My tip to fellow tourists- dont book this place just to save a few bucks. They give very bad service and can really spoil your trip.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_356044741~“Strange hotel without clear sign”~We booked queen bed - we got 2 beds together - not very comfortable. At the reception we were told, that this hotel has only such a beds... We stayed for 1 night only. In the room was no carpet at all - the floor and room design was like in cellar. It was very clean, but not nice at all. Another problem - we booked room for two people and we got soap and shampoo only for one person. To be honest - lots of hotels are doing this.  The hotel was not easy to find - no sign by the entrance, that this is a hotel.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~3~nan

review_344178886~“Best Location to City”~Stayed here a few nights with my boyfriend. We arrived too early, but were able to leave our bags with the reception. Upon arrival they were in the room already. A big decent room and bathroom. The only thing is that the tv was too small ( not enough channels) and the bed covers too thin.. but it was a decent few nights for the price.  George St is just the next street, and a short walk to Central stn and the malls.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_340113012~“Good service, nice fit out but an old building and it shows.”~I thought the service was great, and the location excellent for our purposes. The room was properly clean but not in entirely good repair. It is clear that the current hotel managers are trying to do a good job, but the building is fundamentally in need of a renovation. The room struck me as being a bit cold and hard, and the furnishings didn't really help to soften the effect. I too thought the tv's were quite strange, like little ones from the 1990s. The bathroom was quite glamourous though, and the bed comfortable. If you are not planning on spending much time in the room, this is not a bad option. It was also nice and quiet (well soundproofed) given the busy location.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_332207948~“Overall decent”~I had my hunches about this hotel because of some of the previous reviews complaining about housekeeping and cleanliness/tidiness. But my experience was quite satisfactory. In fact the staff was quite cooperative in making suggestions about doing tourist activities in Sydney. One important point to note: This hotel is quite minimally-staffed. So for the security reasons their main entrance door is always locked. So if you come way before the usual check-in time, you may have to call on the hotel number to reach the staff inside so that they can come out and open the door for you. We were bit freaked out at present, because we rang the door-bell several times and no one showed up. Once you get your room access card, the same card works to open the main door too, so you don't have to always wait for the hotel staff to open it for you. But it's only before checkin that this might be bit of a problem.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_331082707~“It's comfortable ”~I thought this hotel was good. Not great but not awful either. It is close to central station. The room is fitted out nicely. The bathroom is also very good. The most puzzling thing was the size of the tv.  I was not planning on watching lots of tv but found that the tiny square tv sitting on an equally small square box incredibly difficult to watch. It was perplexing given the size of the blank empty wall it was sitting in front of. The third night the tv didn't work at all, I'm guessing the aerial moved as I could get a fuzzy picture back if I moved it. The mini bar prices for the soft drinks were very well priced. The bed was very comfortable. I found sitting on the cushions on the bench by the window not that comfortable as the cushions moved all the time. All up I did have a pleasant stay here. If you are looking for budget accommodation with a slight upmarket tinge then this might be the place for you. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_330436108~“Excellent Hotel”~The location of the hotel is spot-on. It's very near to most of the shopping areas. The bus terminals and Central train station is located about 5 mins away.  There is a Muslim Halal Thai restaurant beside the the hotel lobby. So food was not a problem for us. The staffs are a friendly bunch. The room that we got was on level 5 facing the church. The room was spacious for 2 people. Love the bathroom as well! The small retro TV was cute and coz we were not around most of the time, it didn't bother us much. All in all, for the price that we got for the hotel and how it's centrally located, I would definitely come back here again. :)~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_330435849~“One of the nicest rooms in Sydney”~I booked Valentine on George for 4 nights with some trepidation. However I found that my room overlooking George Street was one of the nicest rooms that I have ever stayed in in Sydney. Plenty of windows made it bright and pleasant & there was virtually no street noise. King-sized bed very comfortable. All the usual facilities such as tea/coffee making, ironing board and iron, hair dryer etc. Bathroom quite large and good shower.Staff extremely pleasant, greeting me by name as I passed the reception desk.

I have stayed here a number of times because of the location, but the place is in need of a good makeover. It is looking tired but that's why it is reasonably priced.

review_318908969~“Ideal conference hotel for UTS”~I stayed here while attending a conference at the university (UTS). It was very close, about a 7 minute walk and opposite the Sydney Central train station. The room was clean, small but had all I needed. Fast internet, the staff were friendly, they can store your luggage and the hotel was very secure with swipe card access. It was a small hotel and had no restaurant or room service. It was good value for money and close to the uni.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_316253393~“Fantastic value and good location”~The hotel is situated near UTS in Ultimo, near Chinatown on city fringe. We paid for the parking which was $20 a day and the spot was situated at the end of the street, not connected with the hotel. There's street parking in front which is not free until midnight and becomes metered again @8am. Try your luck there first before you set back $20. However $20 is pretty reasonable for Sydney given you have 24 hours access. The hotel seems to have been recently renovated so it's very modern, clean and comfortable. We stayed at room 303 from memory. WIFI and service: Service was efficient and very friendly. I definitely rate their service. Free internet at the lobby or you can pay for the room one.  Bathroom: The bathroom has been recently renovated. It is just fantastic - 10/10!! The water pressure was good with consistent hot water throughout. Excellent amenities minus toothbrush which is standard for Australia. Amenities: Has everything you need including slippers. You also get two free packs of Arnotts cookies. View:  None Overall feedback: ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I will definitely return when I next visit Sydney! Good location and service and it's sure value for money!

review_309189086~“Hidden away, well kept secret”~I've walked past so many times and never noticed. Value for money hotel. It's starting to date, but still great. The decor is good concrete glass and mirrors, but someone wanted this to be great. For the money, don't complain, there's a lot worse, but better will cost you. Even nose sound system. My only criticism, the TV. It's tiny, and the picture doesn't fit, it's in a funky cube, but funky isn't functional. I'll stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_303073815~“Good value and good location”~My wife and I stayed at this quirky hotel for close to 2 weeks on a recent visit to Sydney. It exceeded my expectations in terms of the size and comfort of the room, which was well appointed and had a really nice bathroom, a small seating area and a decent sized fridge.  We were also able to use their reasonable priced car park facility which is close to the hotel. At $20 per day that is pretty good value for Sydney.  The location is excellent for George St, The Capitol Theatre, Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Paddy's Markets and Central Station..it is in the environs of the UTS university, so it is surrounded by cheap and cheerful cafes of all sorts. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would certainly go back again.. The hotel does not have a huge staff, and you let yourself I. And out of the premises with a keycard. The interactions we did have with the staff were friendly, and our room was well cleaned every day.  I would recommend this hotel to anybody who needs good vale with no frills.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_301132241~“Value for money.”~On arrival we were greeted by Mohammed (who works nightshift and has a beard and mo), who was very attentive and helpful. We didn't book parking (not realising that we had to) but Mohammed ensured that we got one first thing the next morning.  We were on the 4th level, on exiting the lift we smelt an foul odour lingering in the small area outside the lift. So we burnt incense once we entered our room which soon got rid of the smell as we could also smell it in the room. Our room had two single beds which were comfortable. The bathroom is chic and spacious. Only negative is that there is no exhaust or fan for the steam to escape or the smell of someone going to do their business.   All in all our experience was good. Value for money is excellent, considering the time we were there. It is a 5 minute walk to Central Station and a 10 minute light rail trip to Darling Harbour. It is close to restaurants, cafes and there are convenience stores nearby.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~5~nan
review_285638146~“Ave hotel reasonable price.”~Average hotel. Rooms were a bit quirky but the item most worrying was a shower cap over the smoke alarm. Sheets weren't changed and were a bit dirty. Outside a exhaust ent didn't stop until 10am. Given the price though it was good value. 120 a night sydney central is worthwhile.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_278884826~“Good value for money, friendly staff”~I stayed here for a long weekend with my partner. I had stayed here a number of times more than 5 years ago, but this was my first return trip. The location is very convenient, near to Central train station and the Railway Square buses. It is a 30-40 minute walk to Circular Quay but the hotel is near a bus stop serving bus 555, which is the free bus that runs between Circular Quay and Railway Square. The downside to the location is a small church opposite with loud bells that rang from 7am on Sunday. A bit annoying. The staff were very friendly. We dropped off a bag and checked in when we arrived in Sydney at lunch time (before the room was available). When we returned later that afternoon the bag had been delivered to the room. On checking out I was greeted by name (a nice touch) and we again left a bag behind which we picked up later in the afternoon. The rooms are a little bit tired (a little maintenance and painting wouldn't go amiss) but were otherwise nice. Good bathroom with good lighting and shower. Comfy large bed and pillows. Bose sound system. Quite stylish. If TVs are important to you, then the little cathode ray TV in the room would be a disappointment but this wasn't a problem for us. Overall a pleasant stay and, considering it's quite a bit cheaper than larger hotels, very good value for money.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
