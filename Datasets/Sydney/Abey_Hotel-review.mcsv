review_466660889~“Really good”~This place was clean and the staff are friendly. The lady that checked me in on Friday was awesome she is asset to the place, I am sorry I did not get her name but she was on in the morning on the 3rd of march. My only complaint is the full breakfast is not worth it but there is heaps of option around the block so I would just go out.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463069432~“Simple but comfortable, with very friendly staff”~The Abey Hotel is pretty simple but I was surprised at how comfortable it was. Although the decor is old, the room was clean and large (containing 2 single beds, a couch, wardrobe, desk, coffee table, chest and there still being plenty of unoccupied floor space) and had all the basics amenities. The staff member doing check-in was incredibly friendly and helpful, and I was given a free block of chocolate as a little check-out gift, which was a nice touch. The hotel has parking on-site ($35pn), which is convenient, but the car park is SCARY - one lane for cars going both up and down and narrow spaces to drive through as you go.~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_449304603~“Super ”~Very good hotel with exceptional staff. Especially the front desk. The girls where very helpful and was smiling all the time. Sorry girls, I have forgotten your names. Think that one was Natacha?? -GM. You can be proud of your front desk staff . OK location, only about 20 min walk to the harbour. Nice and clean room. Breakfast was also good. Only 1 minus was that I could only get 1 Cafe Latte even though I had paid for the full breakfast.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441994318~“ROOM NIGHTMARES”~I stayed at this hotel, booked through tour operators while traveling the Australia, for four nights. The hotel is well located with restaurants and convenience of transport. Within walking distance there are the bus leading both the Opera House ( 30/35 minutes walking) that Bondi beach. The hotel looks good with a small but well-kept lobby. The surprise, however, comes once I entered into the assigned room (N° 100 on the first floor). The room has two beds (booked a double, we are a couple) with window with frosted glass, and overlooking a narrow terrace where were located some air conditioners. The light in the room was very poor. The bathroom, rather old, had failed fan that worked continuously making noise that you could hear very well even with the bathroom door closed. Explained immediately the situation to the reception, they told that it was Friday and the hotel was full and have no vacancy rooms and that about the bathroom fan, on my insistence, would pass to take a look, that never did. The biggest surprise, however, was the evening when returned to the room . In addition to the fan noise there were a loud noise of an engine (perhaps the one of the pool, but it is my guess) that seemed to come from a nearby room service closed. The engine worked all night , except for a few interruptions but worsened the situation, because when after a while restarted , it issued a whistle too. I can say that for sure because we spent the first night almost fully awake. The next day we bought the earplugs but the situation improved slightly because the engine noise was loud and we heard it with earplugs too. On the third day, Monday, exasperated by the noise and by the fact that they had not cleaned the room, I mentioned this to the Hotel manager that this was not a room that they can be sold and above for a period of four days. Obviously I do not know the situation of other hotel rooms I hope they are better. Anyway I strongly advise not to choose this hotel, unless you check the condition of the room.~2~2~nan~1~nan~nan~2~nan
review_441437934~“Noisy environment”~If you want a peaceful and quiet environment then this is not the hotel for you! If you manage to get level two, you'll be able to hear everyone in the pool/spa area. My smoke detector was going off at 5am because it needed a new battery and cleaning staff started at 7am banging around their noisy carts on the tiles. Shower head is very small for those that are tall. Only positive was the reception staff!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440518163~“Awesome for a weekender”~This hotel is great value for money! Loved the location, the rooms were clean and spacious with everything you need (including a full length mirror and air con, necessities for getting ready for a night out). All the staff were very friendly and helpful and there was also an indoor pool. Would be awesome for a friends trip to Sydney and the double twin room would easily sleep 4 people comfortably.  See you again very soon! ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438679375~“Basic but awesome”~My best friend and I stayed here for our annual catch up. It was a great location, where we weren't stuck in a too noisy or busy part of Surrey Hills. Upon my arrival to check in, the staff were extremely helpful and perhaps a little too apologetic even on the what I saw was a short wait on checking in. Our room was great! I loved the fact that my bed was firm. Despite a little wear and tear, there isn't anything we could have faulted. Even the slide of management notes about contacting them if we needed anything to make our stay more comfortable was a lovely touch. As a note to other travellers: the iPod dock provided in our room was really designed for older apple products, so don't forget to pack your charger. Overall:this place is clean, has wonderful friendly staff and close to a pub that serves pretty good food!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_421138166~“great hotel for the price”~we booked this hotel to see a show in the city and was quite surprised with the room which for the price of $99 there were two double beds and one single. the bathroom was good and best of all it had a bath. had a tv and coffee/tea making facilities and we had the room that overlooked the pool which was actually quite nice as there was a large sunroof over it and it brought in a lot of light making it a more open space. it was a bit of a walk for my mum into the city as she is 80 but for me it was fine about four blocks to central and the city.  would recommend this if you were looking for a cheap hotel but parking was $33 which didn't help so catch public transport if you can or park some where else. there is three hotels in one building and this one is the 3 star then there is a four star and a five star. nice facilities and would stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_420418401~“Room without a window”~We spent 4 nights in this hotel. All was booked via agency.  The location was good, walked from the train (directly from the airport) with luggage for about 7 minutes. The reception staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are situated around a swimming pool so wherever you go, you smell the chlorine which was a first observation. In the actual room there were 2 double and one single beds - yes it was only two of us. But we got a use of the beds as a wardrobe due to a small space to store things and in a position where you want to go to bathroom. The room was spacious and modern. bathroom big and with a bath. Unfortunately, there is no window around! only window is facing the front and pool which you cant open for fresh air neither put up the blind as you dont want people "to see you" although I think it was tinted glass. Wifi is for free but you have to log in all the time.  There are number of restaurants around, Aldi for general shopping and bus stops to take you wherever you want. But they dont call the bus stops inside so you can get lost easily.~3~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan

review_387261815~“Good value for the price you pay”~I needed a place to stay for 4 days, as I had extended my trip to Sydney. Most of the hotels were booked, and the ones that weren't were really expensive which I wasn't keen on paying. So I found Abey Hotel while scouring through booking.com. The price was affordable, so I went ahead to book it. I had a really pleasant experience there.  I arrived at around 11.00am and check in was only at 2.00pm. But the staff attending to me was very helpful, and despite the near-full occupancy, she managed to get me into my room by 12.30pm.  It turned out to be more of like an inn or motel, with only 3 levels of rooms and all revolving around a small indoor pool. My room was on the first floor, same as the pool.  The room was nice and clean. I booked a triple share because it was the only one left. But it turned out well. I combined 2 of the beds to form a queen bed, and it also meant the room was very big and spacious. The beds were comfy and there was the basic amenities such as fridge and kettle. The bathroom was clean and sufficient too. The downsides of the room was that 1. It was dimly lit. There was close to no windows and there was insufficient lighting. 2. The pool tended to be noisy at times as it was indoor and near our rooms. But they closed the pool at 8pm and opened only at 8am, so not a big issue.  Wifi wasn't free, but I paid $25 for 3 days of unlimited wifi with access to 3 devices. So it wasn't too bad.  Location-wise, the hotel was conveniently located. It's within walking distance to a couple of train stations, and also walking distance to the city and even to darling harbour. It was also close to the main roads where you had access to the supermarkets and alot of shops. I loved walking out every morning to explore the neighbourhood and found nice cafes to have breakfast and coffee at. In particular, it is walking distance to Single Origin Coffee which had really good coffee and very nice breakfasts. Should check it out! Didn't get to try the breakfasts out, but mainly because there were so many good cafes around, that probably served better and cheaper meals.  Overall, I was really pleased with the hotel and had a good stay there!~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_386801072~“A Hidden Gem”~As a female business person, I travel to Sydney on regular basis and always looking to find affordable, good quality, comfortable accommodation in a central location which doesn't cost a forture, where the staff are friently and good from a noise perspective, and feel safe. The Abey Hotel fits this criteria perfectly. The hotel is located centrally in Surrey Hills just around the corner from Crown Street and all the wonderful restaurants and bars. The rooms are really spacious, clean, comfortable beds and quiet which helps in getting a good nights sleep and waking up fresh! I would definately recommend this hotel to both holiday and business travellers.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_386318186~“Great little place to stay. ”~Chose this hotel due to its closeness to St Vincent's hospital. It was a great place to stay. Clean spacious room, nice clean bathroom, lovely heated pool and spa. Tea and coffee facilities and fridge. Helpful staff. Lovely Buffett breakfast ($20). Walking distance to hospital. Easy bus ride to Circular Quay. Nice central place to stay without the big city price tag. Interconnecting rooms available for families/groups. Will recommend and stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383153146~“Great location”~The hotel isnt brand new but is currently being upgtaded. My room was pleasant enough. Clean modern spacious and quiet I got an excellent nights sleep. My only critiism of the room was - no mini bar. But thats right. This hotel is situated in one of Sydney's coolest inner city suburbs. So its location is awesome. And Its still only a 20 minute stroll through beautiful Hyde Park to the city. Who needs a mini bar, it was time to explore. The staff were friendly and warm. Id stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381804493~“modern but in a busy noisely city center - also named Cambridge”~-positive, - walk from public bus off Campbell or Oxford st, - opposite main City Police station, - closeness to public buses allow city trips including Bondi, - clean rather modern, - has internal swimming pool, small spa shared by guests, - has luggage storage, - negative, - possibly used by 'party people' drunk & noise, - NOTE - pool side does not mean pool view - pool is in centre of building with rooms off to the boundary- building sides - so you walk from pool view INTO your room though room door -- bit different, - hotel promote 'pool side' but level 1 rooms are not ( booking.com June 16) room 101 over looks another wall! We were moved away from noisey neighbors and to 'pool'side' room on level 3 - much better, - price is good...just check other Hotel s- but stay away from Hotels as neighbors - some people come to Surry Hills to get drunk~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_379839296~“Average”~Stay for one night at this hotel. It was easy to find with a 65 carspaces in the underground parking lot. Staff friendly and helpful but overall, would not stay here again. Pros: - Great location; close to Museum station, Surry Hills and Kings Cross - Overall clean - 65 carspaces in the parking lot ($33/day) Cons: - Carpark was a nightmare to enter and leave. The spaces were tiny and it took about a 10 point turn to get into the space I parked in. The turns were also extremely narrow. - WiFi password not provided in the room/no instructions. It also appeared that after a small data allowance you would be charged. - Amenities did no account for the number of people staying in the room. Had three people in a room and only two towels. - Shower curtain had mould all along the bottom.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_378477800~“What year is this?”~Surprisingly it's 2016 now and the hotel only provides 512kbps wifi for 300mb quota, trying to convince the guests to pay $10 extra for better wifi. Really? It's $150 per night and with limited 512kbps wifi?~3~2~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_371348666~“Convenient location and value stay”~I stayed five nights from May 3 with my wife and 80-year old mum on a twin double at the poolside, booked through Agoda, after failing to get an early and clear response from the hotel direct over discrepancies in the total room rates. Besides the clarification over tax, I was later told all room rates were based on two adults, notwithstanding the type of rooms, and additional rates of $30 apply for every adult per night. Can't see why the hotel be transparent and disclose that on the website? Anyway, we were pleased that 300MB of WiFi was provided daily, however, for one device only. You need to logout from the device to access from another device. Rather cumbersome and irritating though. You also have to pay to use the desktop computer at the foyer, whether data is used or not. Not to be distracted from the hotel facilities, we found the hotel conveniently located in Surry Hills, an affluent, lively inner city, eastern suburb of Sydney. The hotel is also about 30-minutes walk from the Central Station or Chinatown, and easily accessed by bus from the busy Oxford St, less than 5-minute walk away from the hotel, to Circular Quay. Do get the Opus card for a cheaper travel around, instead of taxi, to avoid paying more due to the traffic. There is also the Aldi supermarket and many eateries and shops closed by, within the precincts of Oxford St and Crown St. The staff were helpful in giving travel directions and guidance for dining. Special mention goes to Sabrina, Monica, and duty managers Meagan and Mark. On our second night, we were surprisingly disturbed from our sleep by mosquitoes in the room, which were duly taken care of the next morning. The room, which has been refurbished, is clean, and housekeeping was excellent. The shower is sufficiently strong and adequate. For breakfast, you can experience Mr MO (around the middle block) or Baccomatto Osteria (Italian), which is linked to the hotel. We did breakfast at Mr MO, and at Four ate Five along Crown St, and dinner at Baccomatto Osteria, and the Porterhouse Pub, across the road at Crown St. Do also try the almond croissant at the Bourke Street Bakery, which is rather good. Abey Hotel is indeed a value stay in Sydney, and will be better and great if the hotel can sort out its WiFi use. You can consider its sister Cambridge Hotel, which uses the same lobby reception, for higher floors, as Abey Hotel has only up to level 3.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_356630636~“Not value for money”~Very basic. I have had much better facilities in other expensive cities as well and in similar prices. Bathroom door has hand marks, shower curtain smells, hard pillows, no cushions, really bad ironing board and no decent selection of tea and coffee in the room, forget about a decent private bar. Only thing that works is the location. I mean all these things are what I am paying for at a minimum, these should not have to be asked for and are not extras.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352807868~“Friendly, quiet, comfy and handy to city.”~Friendly welcome by staff. Quiet hotel with roomy accommodation. I stayed on 3rd floor and room was overlooking pool and spa. The only fault was the spa is not very hot - in fact its just warm. The steps into and out of the pool are rounded and should be flat so you can get out easier. I did ask the staff to provide a clock in the pool area so you can see how long you have been in the spa. Showers very good and generally very clean. I never ate in the restaurant, but it was full most nights. I stayed four nights. The local shops have great restaurants and I felt quite safe wandering around by myself. Aldi store near by. Free wi fi was a bonus.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_349300681~“Good option in Surry Hills”~Stayed two nights with my mom and all was well. It was odd how much the price jumped from when we booked ahead of time online to when we asked about it in person for the night after when our res was up (we liked it enough to want to stay one more night, so that's a plus, but it was twice as much as what we had already paid, so we went somewhere else).  Great location, close to pubs, cafes, restos, and shops in the cool Surry Hills area. Walkable to the harbour, but some might think it's a bit of a hike (maybe takes 45 minutes on foot?).  Clean facilities and rooms, good amenities, wasn't lacking anything, a bit noisy if you stay by the pool, but that's to be expected, I guess. Not a biggie, though.  Some staff members were super friendly (the guys and some of the women), but one or two women were just okay, borderline not that great. Guess that could be a lot of places, though, not every single staff member is going to be fantastic.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_344874817~“Great value, location and facilities.”~I was here overnight, a quick trip to Sydney. No problem checking in; my room wasn't ready (1.30pm) so I went next door to the excellent Italian restaurant and had the lunch special. When I returned, my luggage was already in my room. The room (a twin) was clean, quiet and had loads of space. The bathroom is a little dated (shower in the bath) but the lighting was good (makeup!) and there was lots of hot water and plenty of water pressure. Much better than trying to move around in a tiny space. The bed was super comfortable though if you like a lot of pillows you might want to check with reception for more as there was only one per bed.  I was super impressed with this hotel - very centrally located, a quick walk to Sydney CBD; Oxford street shops and nightlife just around the corner and a quick cab or bus ride to the train stations. Next time I'm in Sydney I'll book straight away with this hotel. Nothing in this price range compares. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_339047328~“short overnight stay for family of 4”~Room with 2 double beds was taken for one night for family of 4 (children aged 11 and 14 shared a double bed). Room was as described on the website and was excellent value for the price. Parking underneath for $30 and was able to check in and leave car there early which suited us well. was an easy 15-20 minute walk to Darling Harbour and around the same to the SCG. Room was quiet and heard no noise from either inside the hotel or outside although we weren't there all day and didn't get back until 11pm on a Sunday night. Beds comfortable and air conditioning TV etc all worked well. Staff very helpful and friendly. Pool was nice after a day trekking around Sydney and the toilet and shower facilities next to the pool were clean and tidy. It's not a flash hotel but neither is the price but the facilities were great and rooms excellent value for the money.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

The reception area was nice, very new and refurbished. Check in was smooth Room size good, bathroom ok, reasonably clean, but old; shower pressure was good.  We were on the floor where the rooms act as an atrium to the pool (room 316) it was very very echoey and you could hear people in the pool area not an issue for us as we spent little time in the room but a possible issue for others.

review_296508851~“Wins hands down on the location”~We enjoyed our weeklong stay at the Abey. The hotel rooms are large. The beds are good if not a little bouncy. The bathroom is functional. The TV is large and channel selection is good. Nothing is really outstanding but everything is very good. Yes, it’s a bit noisy but so is any inner city hotel. The location is outstanding. Restaurants and pubs of all descriptions and levels abound. It’s an easy walk into Sydney CBD, Chinatown and railway stations. Parking is OK but very tight. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The small warm indoor pool is a bit of a treat.  A couple of things: They don’t want to check you in until 2pm. A problem in an international city. The Wi-Fi was down for the whole stay. Come on fellas, this is 2015. But we still highly recommend and will give The Abey another chance next time we are in town.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_293313471~“The Abey nightmare”~Let me start by saying i had a very very horrible time from booking to leaving this hotel. I booked from hotels.com valid for 4 people and the day before we were meant to fly to Sydney the hotel advised me that we only paid for 2 people and that rhey are charging me additional $80 per person!!!! which i checked back with the website customer service. The Cs guy who anwsered attempted to convince the hotel to consider to honor what we booked but came back with nothing then he referred me to the manager. I waited for a long time before the manager who sounded like Filipina lady answered and gave me a very blunt answer that she is not capable of helping me without even apologiZing and when i got upset and i told her that she did not even attempted to help me she said she is the manager as if she is my boss. I said i dont care im the customer and she said something quicklyand hanged up. I couldnt believe that person was a customer service manager! Shame on hotels.com for hiring a very incompetent manager! After this i spoke to the hotel manager and was in tears because i was so upset from being so tired of talking to the hotel and the website . The manager finally gave in and said that i can stay there for the original price i paid for. The next day we flew to Sydney and got to the hotel. The check in took a long time as we were observing the check in and that people are getting impatient standing in line. Then we noticed a desk was free then we were just waiting there but the person behind the computer tried to avoid our gaze for full 5 minutes until the supervisor ushered us to him. OmG! then he was checking us in then i checked our rates again. Guess what? the manager did not note that he is giving us a discount!!! I was really upset as i had a really hard time the night before. I was in tears again! before this manager said that she will check with the other manager to honour that discount. I told her the whole story she couldve done it by then so she checked us in early and the other room she advised will be ready by 2 pm. The room was clean but nothing special I paid 165 for this small room on a saturday. On last minute .com or something the room was only $100 for the same day . They couldve easily given me that discount but they decided to just piss me off twice. 5 minutes later they called me in the room to say they are honourîng the rate. Ok so my friends decided to come in later so we wanted to wander around the city. We asked the supervisor to give her the keys. so she wrote it down on the other set of keys and put her in the computer as the other occupant. When my friend came in walking all the way up in surry hills in her hills dragging her bag and equipment up to that hotel . Reception did not let my paying friend in her roomand just told her to leave her bags!!! The nerve of these people!!! I was so angry at thém its one very bad experience from another. So instead of resting in her room my friend walked all the way from surry hills to the city to meet us. I was so annoyed!!!  Then when we went back the manager told me she didnt know what happened and that her bags is already in the room or will follow. After awhile they called us back in the room and told us they are looking for the bags!!! They lost my friends bag!!! OH MY "(&(&)@@$ !!! I went down to the reception and told the manager im not leaving until they produce the bag! He knows i was going to flip at him if he didnt help me that time. so he quickly got someone to find my friends bag. My friend popped downstairs and identified her bag. It got no tags so anyone couldve just picked it up that was so slack. Then we went to the room and started to get ready the cheap blow dryer in my friends room is not working. After the party we went back to my friends room and we couldnt get back in both keys were not working. They told us their system is down so we needed to get someone to open the room which they did but did not give us the keys this is 3 am in the morning and we were all very tired. i went back to my own room with my husband. In the morning i woke up to the neighbours TV it was loud because the walls were so thin. Before we left to add finality to nightmare the customer lift was broken so we needed to use the service lift!!! On check out the supervisor given my friend a $60 discount for our nightmare stay in the hotel and said that hopefully it will be better on our next stay. Can you please tell me, if you were me, would you consider going back???  o help me she~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_278968296~“Great Location”~The Abey Hotel is in a great location. The room was comfortable, the facilities were basic but adequate and were very good value for Sydney. The twin room I was originally shown was very small and not very private due to the fact that once the black-out blinds and curtains were opened you looked onto about 10 apartments and they could see you as there were no sheer curtains. I requested to change the room as it felt quite claustrophobic to sit in a room with all the blinds closed. The staff were friendly and very helpful, showing me a couple of rooms to which I found a more suitable option for my stay.~3~4~5~3~3~4~4~nan
review_276215596~“Expect nothing”~I was lucky to be there just for the nights and made it to get some sleep. Rooms are tiny, dark and lound (noise from inside and outside). They charge extra for Wifi and even more for fast internet. Breakfast is boring and overpriced. At least it's clean.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_275005538~“Location very good!”~Booked online. Nice staff. I travel with my husband and daughter. The room was close to the pool, quite noise at the night. Maybe was prefer another room. Was chilly at night , impossible to put up the pump heat. Cleaning was ok. BUt for couple days is ok.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_273967225~“Great value business or holiday accom”~This was a surprisingly great value stay. The Accom was really spacious and well presented if slightly dated. A better desk would be an improvement for business travellers but not an inconvenience for me on this visit. Rooms were dark, bed comfortable. The rooms focus around an indoor pool which adds a bit of atmosphere. At just $110, great value!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_269887514~“Some people are just hard to please...”~booked online and was pleasantly surprised on arrival...the staff went above and beyond to accommodate my family of 4 and we were right near the pool...hardly any noise and the pool hours are not late anyway...heaven forbid you might hear some people enjoying the use of an indoor pool !! the location was ideal for us as we were leaving via train and plenty of buses available a short walk from the Abey...excellent variety of restaurants just up on Crown st...we had Thai but you are spoiled for choice all close by...if you dont need to stay beside the Opera House than this is hard to beat for the $$$~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_268720039~“Location good and that is it”~No windows in rooms. Microscopic complementary toiletries. Why bother. Cochroach under bed. I know it's a Sydney thing as the ròom seemed clean but wasn't pleasant  Location is the best feature. It seems this site is called the Cambridge and the abey and the adage which is confusing~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_268004985~“Cheap, friendly staff, close, big rooms & clean!”~Firstly the young blonde short haired receptionist was absolutely lovely and helpful, secondly for the price the room definitely exceeded my expectations. Unlike other cheap hotels in Sydney the rooms were very clean, large, new enough and comfortable. Also the hotel was literally just around the corner from Oxford street, close walk to the city and China town. The only downside is the car park. I would not recommend driving if you plan to stay here, the carpark is very dangerous and narrow... Aside from that I will definitely stay again!~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_266514126~“clean and tidy, friendly service but bed not comfortable”~Staff were very friendly and accomodating. Indoor pool was kept clean and kids enjoyed using it. The room was a good size and had all the basic amenities, with some modern decor. Bed and pillows not comfortable., but otherwise the room was good value for the price we paid on lastminute.com  Sometimes we waited up to 5 minutes for the elevator, which is kept busy servicing the whole hotel.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_262364048~“Best for money, not so for location”~Browse and booked through internet. Nice, clean and well equipped room, it was small though. To get to your room you will pass the pool area which is smell of chlorine but don't worry not in the room. Expect noises from people playing in the pool.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan

review_243543405~“Misleading”~Having not enjoyed my experienced at the Cambridge I felt very misled to discover this was in fact the same building just under a different name. Due to the set up of the rooms surrounding the pool it was also very noisy and I was woken twice around 4am with people returning to their rooms.  My room was also not cleaned during the 3 day stay I had and to top it off found the car park particularly dangerous. Would not return to this hotel.~2~3~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
