review_479080585~“Excellent overall experience”~Overall my experience at Larmont Sydney was excellent and always is great. I stay at the hotel every 3 weeks and the service is fantastic the moment I walk in the door. The renovation of the rooms is just delightful with all needs being catered for.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_479007311~“Very nice hotel”~This hotel is located conveniently in Darlinghurst near Kings Cross and is ideally located near restaurants and other Sydney attractions. It is an easy walk into the CBD and the rail station is close. Rooms are large and well appointed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478944513~“Excellent Hotel at the right price”~I can throughly recommend the Lamont Hotel to anyone seeking a comfortable well appointed hotel room at Kings Cross, Sydney. Excellent value for the money! Great restaurant and gym access! Location is excellent, a must for businesses travelers!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478937347~“Amazing location.”~Invest in top floor corner suites. Amazing view and gym next door is brilliant and 24 hr Restaurant is a bit drab but delicious food. Enjoy a superb location in the newly renovated property. Close to the cross and Maclay street scene~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478421829~“Excellent Stay”~Great view and great beds! Worth the money for a secret Sydney hideaway. Would recommend to family and friends. Will definitely seek out staying in Room 1201 again.  Stayed just recently in April 2017.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477877396~“Great for business”~Had a great time at Larmont. Great part of Sydney and great hotel for business trip. AppleTv and huge smart tv pleasant surprise, and the food at Hyde restaurant is superb. Will be back for sure, this hotel has everything I needed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477568471~“Another enjoyable stay”~The Larmont again impressed with their welcoming and professional staff at the front and delightful rooms. Sure you don't always get a view but the quality and functionality of the rooms is excellent. And the extras, with the associated Hyde restaurant/ cafe, and free access to the nearby gym, all you could could want! Makes every business trip a pleasure!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476995639~“Good nightlife location.”~The location was good, only about a 5 min. walk from Kings Cross station. The area is good for nightlife. There is a lot of bars and clubs in the area. The hotel is very quietly tucked between tall buildings, so I can be a little difficult to find. The staff was very helpful and even gave us a sight seeing map of the city.~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_475980650~“Excellent Hotel”~Arrived here on Good Friday from Uk at 7am. Warm welcome at reception and our room was ready which was great after our long flight. Walked into room and wow we had 180 degree view of the harbour. Our room had been upgraded and some waster eggs too. Thankyou so much for this. The bed is so comfortable. iPad in the room too. Lovely shower room with rain shower. Lots of amenities you would get at a 5 star hotel. Hotel very near station but we have walked everywhere. Amazing value for what we have received. Thankyou.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475084594~“Great”~The staff was just absolutely friendly and really helpful. They helped us with every single thing we asked for help with. They were just really great. They never acted as if we were bothering them they were just always ready to help. Everything was so close by, walking distance. My mom and I had a great time. Definately will be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472837679~“Rubbish ”~Check in was warm. Room had a overwhelming stench, (maybe a plumbing issue?) we were moved to another room which was fine although extremely small, the tv had no movie channels only free to air channels. Power points in bathroom do not work.  My booking included breakfast daily, however the staff refused this, I then emailed them my booking confirmation, she then insisted the email was not received. I had to show her my confirmation on my phone.  The breakfast was not worth the effort. Bland, absolutely tasteless... we had scrambled eggs and mushrooms. I did not request the included breakfast again and nor did they offer it. During our 4 night stay the reception staff were unfriendly, cold and did not smile or offer assistance ever. Will not stay here again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472315212~“On the surface lovely, but ..........”~We arrived to the hotel about 8pm after a long 14h flight, the reception staff were helpful and the lobby was clean and inviting. As we got the lift up to our rooms all looked ok but as the loft doors opened the wooden floor (we were on 4) was scruffy and a bit dirty, however the carpet in the hallways looked brand new. Once in the room all the fixtures and fittings looked relatively new but as if they had been subjected to a hard short life. The bathroom was well equipped but a bit dirty, not filthy as it had been cleaned, but it was a poor job. The bed was soft and comfy and overall we were looking forward to our 3 night stay. After an awful night 2 sleep both my wife and I woke up with itching skin head to toe and came to the conclusion we must of both be having a reaction to the washing powder used for the sheets. We decided to cut out stay short and check out early. When checking out the staff on reception didn't seem to care, only commenting that "you can't have a refund as have already paid for three nights".~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471519980~“Great as always”~My second time staying at this hotel and they were consistent enough to provide the same seamless and effective experience. Rooms are spacious and beds are very comfortable. Large TV sets and an Ipad to boost! Brilliant place and a very handy location.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471268411~“Loved the room and staff”~The location of this hotel is excellent for exploring Sydney. Just a block from the kings cross train station. It's more of a business travelers style room. I loved the USB ports by the bed and the iPad in the room. The room was updated and modern. And really spacious! We had a HUGE balcony but unfortunately no way to enjoy it other than a small chair. Our room was on the second floor directly across from the housekeeping office. So there was some noise of talking and equipment coming and going early in the day. The staff was always so accommodating and friendly. They took the time to get to know us and ensure we were having a lovely visit. The gym in the basement is Anytime Fitness and we had unlimited use which was great! We have already booked our return visit!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471240903~“Hyde Restaurant”~I stayed at Larmont Sydney with my mother for 8 nights while my dad was in a hospital close by the hotel. The hotel staff were friendly and the rooms were nice and clean & modernt. The main reason for my review is for the restaurant Hyde connected to the hotel. Firstly Keira who I'd get my morning tea from was a superstar. So friendly, kind and helpful. We had dinner there 3 times. The food was excellent the service outstanding. We had pasta dishes on each night and being Italian it was like eating my mum's homemade pasta it was delicious!! The manager Efe was an absolute gentleman. He made us feel so welcome he was very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. His service & that of his staff was outstanding. I'd make the 1 hour trip from my home to go there and eat again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471000730~“Great service”~After having a few small issues with my first room, I contacted the manager Daniel and he sorted everything out for me. I think the sign of a great hotel is not that they don't have problems from time to time but that they deal with them effectively when they come up. Thank you to the staff at Larmont and Daniel for your great service.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470964643~“After the renovations...”~Our stay was more than expected - I had made contact for early check-in and our room was available after a long flight from Canada. Front desk check-in and staff were consistently friendly and helpful - the umbrellas readily on loan due to the rain was an added bonus! We did get a room that was recently renovated and everything we needed was supplied - Nespresso machine, mini-fridge, comfortable beds, modern decor, iron/ironing board and lush towels and toiletries. Bathroom was modern and the only two minor complaints (a) the minimal shelving and absence of hooks for towels and (b) sound proofing - we could hear the next room's music - fortunately it stopped at a decent time. No regrets choosing the Larmont - location was close to supermarkets, cheap eats and King's Cross Station (a 5 min. walk away) with easy access to the CBD and beyond.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469042190~“Great staff, location and comforte”~This motel is everything you expect from a much more expensive stay. Being met by the staff with a great welcome, provision of heaps of information and encouragement to use the free gym and yoga classes (if that was my thing).  The room was well appointed, with everything we needed and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The location of the motel was perfect for us. Very close to buses and trains. Nice places to eat, good entertainment and places to just sit and watch the world go by. This place is highly recommended and we will be staying there again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467969816~“Much too expensive for what it is ...but that is the Sydney way ... Nice staff”~Reall friendly staff. Everyone pleasant and helpful. The rooms kind of old, but well-kept. No privacy at all from the "Larmont" Rooms.(605) Directly in front of an ugly condo building. Everyone can watch you. So you need to shut the curtains and need light ..dyring daytime.The elevators not very clean. Wifi was perfect. For the right price okay. Would I come back ? Probably not. 155 us for a solid 3 star Hotel ?  Actually you pay a luxury hotel rate and get a 2 1/2 stars ....Absurdous  Well,take it or leave it. I checked the prices on their site, it went up to 300 us a day !!! Totally nuts. This feels like an old Sheraton or soso Novotel at best. It would cost around 50-70 us in any other city. I liked the King Bed, the extremely nice bathroom gels etc and the friendly staff. The metro kingscross is just 200 m away.  There is a coles market around the corner and lots of cheap (for sydney) eateries. You can walk to Hydepark and the CBD in about 20 min. I even walked to Darling Harbour and the Fishmarket (around an hour) max A pity those prices ruin your whole stay :) Friendly maids and nice nespresso machine with four free capsules. Very dark hallways and dark rooms. Really a big ceiling light in the rooms would be helpful.  The doors are not soundproof. Frequent doorbangers disturb your night's rest. Better than an Ibis which by the way cost the same on those days. Enjoy Sydney !~3~1~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467910967~“Great location ”~Located 3 Min away from King's Cross train station, this boutique hotel is a great place to travel to attractions like Darling Harbour and Chinatown. Didn't know this area was a red light district when I booked this place but we got home at around 9-10 pm and it was ok, even with kids. Amenities wise, the room was equipped with a large Smart TV, fridge, Bose audio player, iron and ironing board. The bed and fluffy pillows were the highlight of the room. It was really comfortable with its thick pillow TOP.  We were given the third level which I was a little disappointed with. It would be great if they provided toothbrush and complimentary water. However, in all, it was a nice comfortable place to stay in. Front desk was helpful in giving us directions to Darling Harbour. :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465548221~“Nice rooms and good location”~In Sydney we stayed at Larmount Sydney by Lancecom. The reception was nice and we got the room directly fixed at only half twelve noon. Our room, room 204, had a large patio. It was nice to sit there and relax in the afternoons. The room is nice and feels fresh. Unfortunately, it's bad with drawers and cupboards. One wants to be happy to pack up a little when to stay six nights. It is close to the subway and the area has many shops and restaurants.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_464665209~“Great Hotel”~The location of the hotel on the border of Kings Cross and Darlinghurst is much better than being the heart of the Cross. Easy walking distance to Kings Cross Train Station and the cool cafes of both Darlinghurst and Potts Point. Easy to get taxis and Ubers. Staff at the hotel very helpful; quick check in, offered good advice of the hotel services, etc. Great hotel room; large, modern, clean, functional. One down side. The hotel accidentally debited my Visa Card twice. When contacted hotel on a Sunday there was no Manager to reverse the charges; a bit annoying but other than that would highly recommend staying here~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464627582~“Flooded shower room ”~Hotel is very nice. And front desk staff super friendly.  The reason I am giving an average rating is due to flooding in the shower room area.  The room we stayed at was clean and fresh.  But the shower room is a disaster. The water goes everywhere all the way out of the shower room. Even though we put the bath mat, the face towels and wash towels on the floor to soak the water it still wasn't enough. So when you finish your shower you have an area flooded in the room. Very bad designed.  It was one night only so only needed two showers while in the hotel.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463743970~“Comfortable hotel in OK area”~We had a nice stayed at this friendly hotel. Kings Cross is not my first choice area be honest, however Larmont's location is convenient as near metro and bus stops. We like the friendness and helpful staffs. As the room is comfortable, bathroom is working well. But the lobby area is not the most inviting!~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_463391964~“Great hotel!”~Great hotel in a very convenient location. This hotel has become my hotel of choice when travelling to the area for work. Heaps of good food within walking distance.

review_462595814~“Good hotel with a few quirks”~I booked the Larmont in a secret hotel deal, and ended up paying half of what is normally asked for a room. I was promised a hotel 'In the Darlinghurst area' which turned out to be in Kings Cross - an area of the city I normally wouldn't frequent. For those of you not in the know, the Cross, as it's known, is affectionately known by the locals as the hetero heartbeat of Sydney's nightlife, and the place to go for fights on Saturday nights. The fact that the city's lockout laws are more or less killing the nightlife has made the place more palatable, but location probably isn't doing this place any favours. The hotel room itself was great - the bed was very comfy, the Smart TV was equipped for streaming from my phone and there's free wifi for those who need to work. The deskspace is convenient and large, and there's coffee and tea available. Keys use NFC technology and you don't have to insert it into a plastic thingy to turn the power on in your room - useful to have air conditioning when you come back from a hot day out in the Sydney summer. There are a few oddities in a 4 star hotel - the safe in my room didn't lock, and the desk light wasn't usable because they'd installed a light with a wall plug too large for the limited space their internal fitout had allowed--the small distance between the power socket and the surface of the desk was too short for the length of the light fixture. There's also no room service, other than a wine list (how very Sydney) and I don't think there's a restaurant on site at all. On the plus side, you get access to the nearby 24/7 Anytime Fitness gym and a complimentary yoga session from the yoga studio in the building if you want to partake. Normally I'd probably stay somewhere else, but if you don't mind being in the Cross (it's your closest train station and literally around the corner from it), then it's not a bad choice.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_462381468~“Good hotel in Kings Cross area”~Was here close to new years and booked late so this hotel was one of the few that still had availability but we were pleasantly surprised. Location is very near Kings Cross station so it was very convenient for us to hop on a subway to Central and then take the train to the Blue Mountains. Was also very convenient for travels to and from Circular Quay!  Contrary to popular belief, Kings Cross area is definitely not as seedy or unsafe at night, we've walked around at night on multiple days and felt extremely safe. There is also a 24hr Coles just 2mins away from the hotel so we were able to grab quick snacks to buy back home from there~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460550881~“Excellent Hotel and location”~My husband and I stayed for a Sydney Getaway weekend. I booked a signature room it was wonderful. You get everything you could ask for in the room, Nespresso Machine with pods, apple TV ! the beds, are very comfortable. It is close to the train, or a walk to the harbour, lots of little places to eat close by, the staff were very attentive and they couldn’t do enough for us. Daniel, is the manager, we complimented him on his staff and nothing was too much trouble. We had a lovely couple of days exploring our city. Thank you all for making it that little bit more special.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460270774~“Stunning!”~My partner and I stayed at this new hotel. The location is great, walking distance to everything you could want. From our suit we had 180degree views of the harbour and opera house. Huge balcony and a wonderfully comfortable king size bed. Drinking wine in the bath tub looking out over the harbour was a delight. A must stay hotel in Sydney!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459834339~“Staff was Outstanding! Hotel is adequate.”~I want to praise the staff at the hotel. When checking in the gentleman at the desk ran a block to see if the laundry service was open as it would be less expensive. All staff were very nice and helpful the entire week. I give the hotel 3 stars for a few reasons. It was not a good sign that not a single taxi driver (we used 2 per day) knew where the hotel was. They did know the landmark Coca Cola sign was so we used that. 1) I would add more lighting to the elevator area and the halls as it give off a dark rather depressing feel and our ceiling light bulb was out for 4 days. 2) I read reviews in November about the restaurant being remodeled and a reply to a review stared it would be done in Jan 2017. Its now Feb and there was no activity for a remodel goin on. It would have been nice to eat in when the rain storm came in. 3) no hook in the bathroom to hang your towels on if you want them to dry to use them again. 4) no closet, rod is just inside the door in the main room. 5) No ability to print. Staff again was nice enough to print after emailing documents, but in today's market I cannot remember a hotel with out a computer to print you boarding pass etc. 6) The bed was average in comfort. 7) King's Cross is known for the Red Light District down the street. Not the greatest place to window shop, but we did feel safe walking in the area.  Plusses: 1) there is a bus station a block away and Taxis are readily available. 2)There are a few nice sidewalk cafés. We recommend Froth Expresso for a nice breakfast. Tropicana ONLY accepts cash FYI.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458882508~“Excellent location”~As my headline says the best thing in this hotel was it's location. Kings Cross train station, numerous restaurants, shops, parks etc. are nearby but the area is still relaxed and peaceful. That I really liked. Larmont's staff were super friendly and always so happy - it was nice to enter every single time when you were greeted with genuine smile.  Room was not very big but just enough for two. It was clean, the bed was good and even the view was ok. First I thought the lack of bathroom (toilet and shover are behind the door but sink is in the room) was a nice decorative thing but when you spend over a week there with your friend and without any privacy looking all your belongings on the counter in the middle of your room you quite soon notice it is not. Public areas in this hotel are not very well cleaned and there is no restaurant or other services in the hotel. My friend used the gym located in the same building and free of charge for hotel guests and he was very satisfied.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458821054~“Very recommended”~My first visit to Sydney so didn't really know area but we booked here and we're in for a pleasant surprise in Kings Cross area. The hotel is modern but the backside has an electric mix in the neighborhood. Some not so great but I felt safe at night and you are two blocks from Kings Cross station which is convenient to Town ahHall and Central station. It's very modern room and our room on 11th floor faced a close by apartment building but it was fine. Daniel at Front desk was exceptional in letting us extend our stat, gave us a great room and made sure everything was great. Michael as concierge was also extremely helpful and we are grateful to call out both of them for exceptional service~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458816870~“Not worth staying here!”~At first booking this hotel and seeing the online reviews, my boyfriend and I were very excited. Upon researching this hotel's location, we started to have our doubts, nevertheless we kept our reservation and thought positive. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, and as we were arriving we were dissatisfied about the location. We did notice how its very central even for tourists with only 20 minutes walking to darling harbour, but it didn't seem nice to us. While checking in, the lobby was very modern and the staff was very nice, we received our room key and that was it. No breakdown of amenities within the hotel and no one told us where the gym was located. We made our way into the elevator and got off on floor 5 and noticed a very weird smell in the hallway -- I brushed it off and told myself they just renovated and paid it no attention. First impressions of our standard room was good but upon further investigating it was very dirty! There was dust everywhere in the room and it looked like it was not even vacuumed prior to our arrival. I then checked the bathrooms and I was shocked that the toilet was not clean!! My boyfriend had to clean it before I could even use it. We were only staying in Sydney for 5 days so we decided we might as well stay because the room was pre paid. During our stay 3 times housekeeping did not show up. We also felt a few days we came back from sightseeing a little late that it was not a safe neighborhood, we almost felt harassed one night by a group of guys on their way to party on kings cross. I would say it was very easy to get around from our location but I would rather next time to stay near the opera house because it is a much nicer area. When we checked out I prepared myself to tell management how terrible our stay was, but no one asked us if we enjoyed it! I have stayed at many hotels across the world and I thought it was very standard to ask that when checking out. This hotel says its a 4 star hotel but I can assure you its not...~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~2~nan

review_455522133~“Re-vamaped and great location”~I've stayed at the Larmont Sydney by Lancemore on quite a few occasions for both work and pleasure. I find it to be in a very central location and walking distance or short taxi ride to many of Sydney's great attractions, eateries and harbour. In very recent times the rooms have had a much needed face-lift which has been done in my opinion in a very tasteful way in a slightly retro style. The rooms aren't large but they are a good size and comparable to most hotel rooms of this rating. We always ask for a city view and high floor and the view are spectacular! The front desk is 24 hour and always very friendly and efficient service. You can walk to any of the great restaurants/bars and clubs in the surrounding Darlinghurst/Rushcutters Bay/Kings Cross area which are abundant. There's a lovely short walk to Rushcutters Bay Park for breakfast or to sit under one of the massive Morten Bay Figs. Or you can walk through the iconic Kings Cross and down Macleay Street to the trendy end for a coffee and then make your way along the Finger Wharf Woolloomooloo, stop for a coffee of drink and then walk around the stunning Sydney Botanic Gardens past Lady's Macquarie's Chair and into the Opera House and Circular Quay. I much prefer this location to the centre of Sydney as there's much more culture and community. The negatives are the noisy air-conditioning in some rooms and also if you are on a lower floor you may be annoyed at the sound of Kings Cross below.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_451945527~“Contemporary generous sized rooms with great views.”~Overnight stay in Sydney in a wonderful hotel, with great views over the city in a perfect location, a short walk to the city or via the nearby Kings Cross Train Station. I had booked a standard room, but upon my arrival, I was upgraded to a penthouse room, which was very generous, contemporary, clean and beautiful. High up over the road, with no real noise was great, but leaving the curtains open was difficult, as there were other nearby apartments that could look right into my room, but that was the only downside. The bathroom was beautiful, with a generous shower and separate bathtub, as well as a separate toilet. The duel sinks as well as the great lighting are worth noting. I woudl certainly stay there again and would recommended this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_447653265~“Nice hotel but some details need to be improved ”~What shocked me the most was to hear how noisy and old was the air conditioning system in the room: the last time I heard that kind of noise was in a backpackers in Myanmar. The room wasn't really clean, especially the bathroom and under the chair. You can see the picture attached. Not even a complementary bottle of water was provided. Definitely overpriced.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_444631644~“Sydney is great, and so is Larmont”~I visited Larmont with my wife and two year old son. After traveling for 20 hours we arrived to the hotel around 10am, and the receptionist told us that our room wouldn't be ready until 1.30pm. I think the staff could see how exhausted (and dirty?) we were, so they offered us to take a shower and gave us some refreshments, and that we could relax a bit in the lobby. But, when we came back from the shower 30 minutes later, the room was ready, which was such a relief! Great service by a great staff.  The rooms are nice (even though the walls are a bit naked), the wifi is good and the pillows are AMAZING. I might consider going back just for the pillows. The hotel has an agreement with a fully equipped gym 15 meters from the main entrance, which is way more attractive than the usual gyms you see in hotels.  It's located 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station, which allows you to get anywhere easily. 10/10 I will come back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444567483~“Wonderful Hotel”~Great Hotel! The Larmont boasts an great location, friendly staff and great value. It has just undergone a refurb and the hotel is looking great!

review_443647269~“Interesting concept”~Hotel has an interesting concept since all the services are pretty much outsourced, i.e. hotel itself has basically only reception + rooms. For the breakfast, you need to walk maybe a hundred meters to a cafe nearby and if you want to go for a gym, you need to walk 50 meters to a nearby fitness center (which is by the way of high quality).  Staff was very friendly and room quality including wifi was very good - maybe the biggest downside was the breakfast which wasn't particularly good and even less convenient.  Hotel is located in Kings Cross area which appear to be Sydney's red light district although it wasn't too visible even during evening times. One can walk from the hotel to harbour and opera house (maybe 3 km away).~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_443391072~“Christmas catch up”~The room was a reasonable size with a king size bed. The bathroom door has hard to open and bathroom had a unpleasant odour (both reported to morning staff).

review_442976528~“Home away from home”~The boutique Larmont Hotel, in its various re-envisionments, has long been a favorite go-to business accommodation for me. The Lamont was most recently the Diamant, which was formed by the lobby and building that was split off from the original Hyatt behind the iconic giant Coca-Cola sign. The tower became the Millenium Hotel prior to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and subsequently a condo (owned-apartment) complex, and the rooms above the reception desk became the Diamant. Patrons of the old Hyatt will undoubtedly remember the sky-high escalator that transported guests from the reception area to the lifts accessing the tower rooms, which overlooked the city. I stayed regularly in the Hyatt for a number of years, since 1989, until it became the Millenium. When the Diamant opened I immediately recognized the familiar trimmings behind the luxury boutique rennovations as depicted on their website and booked a stay, as part of an exploratory multi-hotel itinerary to identify the leading hotels of Sydney. I was immensely please by this hotel's ambience, functionality, business-traveler friendliness, luxury details, and over-the-top helpful staff.  The Larmont's reception area and rooms still retain the ambience of the original Hyatt. The hotel benefits from its attachment to the original building, where a full-service grocery, liquor store ("bottle shop" in Australianese), and several cafes, fast-food outlets, and restaurants are within steps of the hotel. However, the entry to the hotel is upslope from the major shopping street, so be prepared for a sometimes windy, relatively steep climb. The best way to arrive is by train. The station is a 5-minute stroll from the hotel. From the airport, a train ticket costs $17.50 Australian ($13 US), compared to 50$ or more for a cab. (A Chinese cabbie once took me on a circuitous route that cost me $85.) Australian trains are fast, always on time (in fact, often early), comfortable, safe, and fun to ride. Strike up a conversation with a local. Aussies are friendly, loquacious, and genuinely fond of helping visitors. On my recent visit to the Larmont, free wifi was provided. Upgrade to super-fast access was available, but I personally had no special need to upgrade. Waiting 60 seconds instead of 15 to read the news or download emal wasn't a big deal for me. The big-screen HD TV on the wall is fantastic. The double-size shower with glass wall is reminiscent of the Westin (which, if you don't know, features all-glass enclosed bathrooms). The luxury fixtures are a great touch. There are just enough touches resonant of the finest luxury hotels in Sydney to make you feel pampered and special.  You should know I haven't received any compensation, encouragement, discount, or any other consideration from the hotel to write this review. I just happen to like this hotel a lot. The pro's: high marks for cleanliness, friendliness and competence, luxury details, and proximity to trains. The cons: The street area below the hotel, known as Kings Cross, has a somewhat risque reputation, but is also home to one of the finest Italian restaurants in Sydney. One block over (Victoria Street) has some amazing restaurants and cafes. Of course, some people like risque, so I'll leave that pro/con argument to you. Bottom line: The Larmont is one of Sydney's best kept secrets. I highly recommend it for ambience, business-traveler friendliness, luxury details, and its amazing staff. Eclectic? Yes. Comfortable? Oh yeah.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442500563~“Beautiful rooms, very friendly and nice people”~Hi stayed in Larmont for 3 nights on business trip. The rooms are very nice and modern as they have been refurbished. The gym is located outside a couple of meters near the hotel, but they provide you a card, and it's a 24/7 facilities. However, I would like to make a special note to Marcela. She was really nice and helpful, recommended me places to eat and even advised on transport options. Also Fahad was very supportive as well.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_441703471~“Visit friends from Macau”~This was the first time i spent at Larmont in Sydney. Firstly the location is brilliant. You can get to anywhere is Sydney. The price was very affordable. The rooms were clean and the had huge Tv screen with all the modern equipmemt like Pod coffee, ipad, Smart TV and etc. The staff very very helpful. I would recommend this again and again. This is a bargin.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439975115~“Overpriced and just bad.”~Booked this hotel last minute through hotelstonight app. I expected much better for the price, was very disappointed. The room (3rd FL) was shabby, furniture was scratched up, carpet was dirty, the TV was broken (had lines running through the display) and was poorly mounted on the wall. The bathroom had a mildew smell and didnt feel clean. All this was bad, but to top it they started doing construction near the elevators at 7AM banging and tearing out tile, this was a rude awakening. We had to call and ask them to stop, which was only temporary as they resumed 1 hour later. I would not recommend this place.~1~nan~nan~3~nan~1~2~nan
review_438689284~“Great mid level hotel in Sydney”~I have stayed here a number of times and reviewed this hotel before, not for a while though and there have been a few changes. Ownership of this hotel changed last year and the new owners are carrying out some refurbishments, a bit surprising as I did not think it really needed it.  I have always liked the hotel and it is usually my first choice when staying in Sydney for work, the price is reasonable most of the time, although can vary depending how busy they are. The hotel is modern, always clean and very well kept. the location is great, very close to cafes etc. and a longish but do-able walk into central Sydney. The rooms are mostly similar, smallish but very well fitted, some have a large balcony, the main benefit of this is the ability to have the door open and some fresh air in the room. Bathrooms are also small but really well fitted and pleasant. Large seperate walk in rainfall shower is very welcome. My room this time around had been recently refurbished so nice and fresh, as above though there is nothing wrong with the un-refurbished rooms. All rooms have a large screen TV and iPad in the room. The only thing that annoys me slightly is the wifi, under the old ownership they had good fast wifi and it was free, as it should be in all hotels, now they have free standard wifi that is just too slow, and premium wifi you need to pay for. This time round they told me they have fixed it! premium is now free and super fast is at added cost. My experience was the only upgrade is the name change, the premium is now just slow and you need to buy the super fast upgrade to be any use. I still don't understand why they don't just charge a few dollars extra for the rooms and make fast usable wifi free! There is a limited number of car parts on site and the park is very tight, make sure you book parking in advance. ($45.00 night) If you like to use a gym, there is a commercial 24 hr gym in the building and hotel guests have free access, this works well and is a very good gym.  The best thing is the staff who I always find very friendly and welcoming. Apart from my gripe about the wifi I really like this hotel and have stayed here four or five times a year for the last few years. I highly recommend it.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_438598983~“Great alternative to city center”~Our room looked nothing like the rooms in the pictures, but it was still pretty nice. The bathroom was a little small, but I loved the shower (rain shower head), and the shelf for toiletries behind the sink area. The bed and linens were very nice and comfy/cozy. We had a direct view of the bridge and opera house (although partially blocked by construction). The iPad was very useful. We did not get sim cards for our phone when we arrived, so we relied on the hotel wifi and wherever else we could connect in the city. I didn't find it to be a hinderance. There was construction so by around 9am we could hear drilling, etc. but it wasn't really an issue as we were getting up and around to start our day by then. There are no real amenities, that I was aware of other than passes to the gym next door (if that's your thing). Unless your lan is to spend a lot of time at the hotel, then that's not really an issue. I end up not using most of them when I am playing tourist because I want to see and do things around the city. The star was so-so. They weren't overly friendly or helpful, but they weren't rude either. We wanted late checkout but had to wait until the day before we left to ask for it's availability. I think ti was an extra $40. King Cross is a diverse area. Lots of food, clubs, entertainment options. Not sure if it is unsafe, but we returned late at night a few times and didn't feel unsafe.  Positives: 5 min walk to King Cross station (about 15-20 minutes to circular Quay) Nespresso coffee maker (milk in mini bar fridge) Water heating pot iPad with free wifi Big flatscreen, but limited channels (no CNN International) Negatives: Construction No other amenities Tip: If you arrive late and just want to relax before starting out early the next day they have a food delivery service called Foodora (as well as others) that was reasonably priced and fairly quick with delivery.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_437350720~“Good location - good service and rooms”~I booked this from the UK before I arrived in Sydney. We were only in Sydney for 3 nights. This hotel seemed a fair price compared to many others that are "more central". I loved the location. It may have been "on the edge" of the Red Light District, but that is part and parcel of the history of the area and its charm. It is very safe around the area as a tourist and has some great pubs and eateries. Kings Cross Station is a very short walk which gains access to all of Sydney and her surrounding areas. The reception staff are very knowledgeable and will point you in the right direction to suit any needs - a nice restaurant, lively pub etc. The room we had was recently refurbished - not the greatest view but clean and comfortable. For the price I paid I was extremely satisfied - give it a go!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_479080585~“Excellent overall experience”~Overall my experience at Larmont Sydney was excellent and always is great.

review_477568471~“Another enjoyable stay”~The Larmont again impressed with their welcoming and professional staff at the front and delightful rooms. Sure you don't always get a view but the quality and functionality of the rooms is excellent. And the extras, with the associated Hyde restaurant/ cafe, and free access to the nearby gym, all you could could want! Makes every business trip a pleasure!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476995639~“Good nightlife location.”~The location was good, only about a 5 min. walk from Kings Cross station. The area is good for nightlife. There is a lot of bars and clubs in the area. The hotel is very quietly tucked between tall buildings, so I can be a little difficult to find. The staff was very helpful and even gave us a sight seeing map of the city.~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_475980650~“Excellent Hotel”~Arrived here on Good Friday from Uk at 7am. Warm welcome at reception and our room was ready which was great after our long flight. Walked into room and wow we had 180 degree view of the harbour. Our room had been upgraded and some waster eggs too. Thankyou so much for this. The bed is so comfortable. iPad in the room too. Lovely shower room with rain shower. Lots of amenities you would get at a 5 star hotel. Hotel very near station but we have walked everywhere. Amazing value for what we have received.

review_475084594~“Great”~The staff was just absolutely friendly and really helpful. They helped us with every single thing we asked for help with. They were just really great.

Definately will be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471240903~“Hyde Restaurant”~I stayed at Larmont Sydney with my mother for 8 nights while my dad was in a hospital close by the hotel. The hotel staff were friendly and the rooms were nice and clean & modernt. The main reason for my review is for the restaurant Hyde connected to the hotel. Firstly Keira who I'd get my morning tea from was a superstar. So friendly, kind and helpful. We had dinner there 3 times. The food was excellent the service outstanding. We had pasta dishes on each night and being Italian it was like eating my mum's homemade pasta it was delicious!! The manager Efe was an absolute gentleman. He made us feel so welcome he was very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. His service & that of his staff was outstanding. I'd make the 1 hour trip from my home to go there and eat again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_465548221~“Nice rooms and good location”~In Sydney we stayed at Larmount Sydney by Lancecom. The reception was nice and we got the room directly fixed at only half twelve noon. Our room, room 204, had a large patio. It was nice to sit there and relax in the afternoons. The room is nice and feels fresh. Unfortunately, it's bad with drawers and cupboards. One wants to be happy to pack up a little when to stay six nights. It is close to the subway and the area has many shops and restaurants.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_464665209~“Great Hotel”~The location of the hotel on the border of Kings Cross and Darlinghurst is much better than being the heart of the Cross. Easy walking distance to Kings Cross Train Station and the cool cafes of both Darlinghurst and Potts Point. Easy to get taxis and Ubers. Staff at the hotel very helpful; quick check in, offered good advice of the hotel services, etc. Great hotel room; large, modern, clean, functional. One down side. The hotel accidentally debited my Visa Card twice. When contacted hotel on a Sunday there was no Manager to reverse the charges; a bit annoying but other than that would highly recommend staying here~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464627582~“Flooded shower room ”~Hotel is very nice. And front desk staff super friendly.  The reason I am giving an average rating is due to flooding in the shower room area.  The room we stayed at was clean and fresh.  But the shower room is a disaster. The water goes everywhere all the way out of the shower room. Even though we put the bath mat, the face towels and wash towels on the floor to soak the water it still wasn't enough. So when you finish your shower you have an area flooded in the room. Very bad designed.  It was one night only so only needed two showers while in the hotel.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463743970~“Comfortable hotel in OK area”~We had a nice stayed at this friendly hotel. Kings Cross is not my first choice area be honest, however Larmont's location is convenient as near metro and bus stops. We like the friendness and helpful staffs. As the room is comfortable, bathroom is working well. But the lobby area is not the most inviting!~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_463391964~“Great hotel!”~Great hotel in a very convenient location. This hotel has become my hotel of choice when travelling to the area for work. Heaps of good food within walking distance.

review_462595814~“Good hotel with a few quirks”~I booked the Larmont in a secret hotel deal, and ended up paying half of what is normally asked for a room. I was promised a hotel 'In the Darlinghurst area' which turned out to be in Kings Cross - an area of the city I normally wouldn't frequent. For those of you not in the know, the Cross, as it's known, is affectionately known by the locals as the hetero heartbeat of Sydney's nightlife, and the place to go for fights on Saturday nights. The fact that the city's lockout laws are more or less killing the nightlife has made the place more palatable, but location probably isn't doing this place any favours. The hotel room itself was great - the bed was very comfy, the Smart TV was equipped for streaming from my phone and there's free wifi for those who need to work. The deskspace is convenient and large, and there's coffee and tea available. Keys use NFC technology and you don't have to insert it into a plastic thingy to turn the power on in your room - useful to have air conditioning when you come back from a hot day out in the Sydney summer. There are a few oddities in a 4 star hotel - the safe in my room didn't lock, and the desk light wasn't usable because they'd installed a light with a wall plug too large for the limited space their internal fitout had allowed--the small distance between the power socket and the surface of the desk was too short for the length of the light fixture. There's also no room service, other than a wine list (how very Sydney) and I don't think there's a restaurant on site at all. On the plus side, you get access to the nearby 24/7 Anytime Fitness gym and a complimentary yoga session from the yoga studio in the building if you want to partake. Normally I'd probably stay somewhere else, but if you don't mind being in the Cross (it's your closest train station and literally around the corner from it), then it's not a bad choice.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_462381468~“Good hotel in Kings Cross area”~Was here close to new years and booked late so this hotel was one of the few that still had availability but we were pleasantly surprised. Location is very near Kings Cross station so it was very convenient for us to hop on a subway to Central and then take the train to the Blue Mountains. Was also very convenient for travels to and from Circular Quay!  Contrary to popular belief, Kings Cross area is definitely not as seedy or unsafe at night, we've walked around at night on multiple days and felt extremely safe. There is also a 24hr Coles just 2mins away from the hotel so we were able to grab quick snacks to buy back home from there~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460550881~“Excellent Hotel and location”~My husband and I stayed for a Sydney Getaway weekend. I booked a signature room it was wonderful. You get everything you could ask for in the room, Nespresso Machine with pods, apple TV ! the beds, are very comfortable. It is close to the train, or a walk to the harbour, lots of little places to eat close by, the staff were very attentive and they couldn’t do enough for us. Daniel, is the manager, we complimented him on his staff and nothing was too much trouble. We had a lovely couple of days exploring our city. Thank you all for making it that little bit more special.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460270774~“Stunning!”~My partner and I stayed at this new hotel. The location is great, walking distance to everything you could want. From our suit we had 180degree views of the harbour and opera house. Huge balcony and a wonderfully comfortable king size bed. Drinking wine in the bath tub looking out over the harbour was a delight. A must stay hotel in Sydney!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459834339~“Staff was Outstanding! Hotel is adequate.”~I want to praise the staff at the hotel. When checking in the gentleman at the desk ran a block to see if the laundry service was open as it would be less expensive. All staff were very nice and helpful the entire week. I give the hotel 3 stars for a few reasons. It was not a good sign that not a single taxi driver (we used 2 per day) knew where the hotel was. They did know the landmark Coca Cola sign was so we used that. 1) I would add more lighting to the elevator area and the halls as it give off a dark rather depressing feel and our ceiling light bulb was out for 4 days. 2) I read reviews in November about the restaurant being remodeled and a reply to a review stared it would be done in Jan 2017. Its now Feb and there was no activity for a remodel goin on. It would have been nice to eat in when the rain storm came in. 3) no hook in the bathroom to hang your towels on if you want them to dry to use them again. 4) no closet, rod is just inside the door in the main room. 5) No ability to print. Staff again was nice enough to print after emailing documents, but in today's market I cannot remember a hotel with out a computer to print you boarding pass etc. 6) The bed was average in comfort. 7) King's Cross is known for the Red Light District down the street. Not the greatest place to window shop, but we did feel safe walking in the area.  Plusses: 1) there is a bus station a block away and Taxis are readily available. 2)There are a few nice sidewalk cafés. We recommend Froth Expresso for a nice breakfast. Tropicana ONLY accepts cash FYI.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458882508~“Excellent location”~As my headline says the best thing in this hotel was it's location. Kings Cross train station, numerous restaurants, shops, parks etc. are nearby but the area is still relaxed and peaceful. That I really liked. Larmont's staff were super friendly and always so happy - it was nice to enter every single time when you were greeted with genuine smile.  Room was not very big but just enough for two. It was clean, the bed was good and even the view was ok. First I thought the lack of bathroom (toilet and shover are behind the door but sink is in the room) was a nice decorative thing but when you spend over a week there with your friend and without any privacy looking all your belongings on the counter in the middle of your room you quite soon notice it is not. Public areas in this hotel are not very well cleaned and there is no restaurant or other services in the hotel. My friend used the gym located in the same building and free of charge for hotel guests and he was very satisfied.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458821054~“Very recommended”~My first visit to Sydney so didn't really know area but we booked here and we're in for a pleasant surprise in Kings Cross area. The hotel is modern but the backside has an electric mix in the neighborhood. Some not so great but I felt safe at night and you are two blocks from Kings Cross station which is convenient to Town ahHall and Central station. It's very modern room and our room on 11th floor faced a close by apartment building but it was fine. Daniel at Front desk was exceptional in letting us extend our stat, gave us a great room and made sure everything was great. Michael as concierge was also extremely helpful and we are grateful to call out both of them for exceptional service~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458816870~“Not worth staying here!”~At first booking this hotel and seeing the online reviews, my boyfriend and I were very excited. Upon researching this hotel's location, we started to have our doubts, nevertheless we kept our reservation and thought positive. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, and as we were arriving we were dissatisfied about the location. We did notice how its very central even for tourists with only 20 minutes walking to darling harbour, but it didn't seem nice to us. While checking in, the lobby was very modern and the staff was very nice, we received our room key and that was it. No breakdown of amenities within the hotel and no one told us where the gym was located. We made our way into the elevator and got off on floor 5 and noticed a very weird smell in the hallway -- I brushed it off and told myself they just renovated and paid it no attention. First impressions of our standard room was good but upon further investigating it was very dirty! There was dust everywhere in the room and it looked like it was not even vacuumed prior to our arrival. I then checked the bathrooms and I was shocked that the toilet was not clean!! My boyfriend had to clean it before I could even use it. We were only staying in Sydney for 5 days so we decided we might as well stay because the room was pre paid. During our stay 3 times housekeeping did not show up. We also felt a few days we came back from sightseeing a little late that it was not a safe neighborhood, we almost felt harassed one night by a group of guys on their way to party on kings cross. I would say it was very easy to get around from our location but I would rather next time to stay near the opera house because it is a much nicer area. When we checked out I prepared myself to tell management how terrible our stay was, but no one asked us if we enjoyed it! I have stayed at many hotels across the world and I thought it was very standard to ask that when checking out. This hotel says its a 4 star hotel but I can assure you its not...~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~2~nan

review_455522133~“Re-vamaped and great location”~I've stayed at the Larmont Sydney by Lancemore on quite a few occasions for both work and pleasure. I find it to be in a very central location and walking distance or short taxi ride to many of Sydney's great attractions, eateries and harbour. In very recent times the rooms have had a much needed face-lift which has been done in my opinion in a very tasteful way in a slightly retro style. The rooms aren't large but they are a good size and comparable to most hotel rooms of this rating. We always ask for a city view and high floor and the view are spectacular! The front desk is 24 hour and always very friendly and efficient service. You can walk to any of the great restaurants/bars and clubs in the surrounding Darlinghurst/Rushcutters Bay/Kings Cross area which are abundant. There's a lovely short walk to Rushcutters Bay Park for breakfast or to sit under one of the massive Morten Bay Figs. Or you can walk through the iconic Kings Cross and down Macleay Street to the trendy end for a coffee and then make your way along the Finger Wharf Woolloomooloo, stop for a coffee of drink and then walk around the stunning Sydney Botanic Gardens past Lady's Macquarie's Chair and into the Opera House and Circular Quay. I much prefer this location to the centre of Sydney as there's much more culture and community. The negatives are the noisy air-conditioning in some rooms and also if you are on a lower floor you may be annoyed at the sound of Kings Cross below.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_451945527~“Contemporary generous sized rooms with great views.”~Overnight stay in Sydney in a wonderful hotel, with great views over the city in a perfect location, a short walk to the city or via the nearby Kings Cross Train Station. I had booked a standard room, but upon my arrival, I was upgraded to a penthouse room, which was very generous, contemporary, clean and beautiful. High up over the road, with no real noise was great, but leaving the curtains open was difficult, as there were other nearby apartments that could look right into my room, but that was the only downside. The bathroom was beautiful, with a generous shower and separate bathtub, as well as a separate toilet. The duel sinks as well as the great lighting are worth noting. I woudl certainly stay there again and would recommended this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_447653265~“Nice hotel but some details need to be improved ”~What shocked me the most was to hear how noisy and old was the air conditioning system in the room: the last time I heard that kind of noise was in a backpackers in Myanmar. The room wasn't really clean, especially the bathroom and under the chair. You can see the picture attached. Not even a complementary bottle of water was provided.

review_444631644~“Sydney is great, and so is Larmont”~I visited Larmont with my wife and two year old son. After traveling for 20 hours we arrived to the hotel around 10am, and the receptionist told us that our room wouldn't be ready until 1.30pm. I think the staff could see how exhausted (and dirty?) we were, so they offered us to take a shower and gave us some refreshments, and that we could relax a bit in the lobby. But, when we came back from the shower 30 minutes later, the room was ready, which was such a relief! Great service by a great staff.  The rooms are nice (even though the walls are a bit naked), the wifi is good and the pillows are AMAZING. I might consider going back just for the pillows. The hotel has an agreement with a fully equipped gym 15 meters from the main entrance, which is way more attractive than the usual gyms you see in hotels.  It's located 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station, which allows you to get anywhere easily. 10/10 I will come back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_443647269~“Interesting concept”~Hotel has an interesting concept since all the services are pretty much outsourced, i.e. hotel itself has basically only reception + rooms. For the breakfast, you need to walk maybe a hundred meters to a cafe nearby and if you want to go for a gym, you need to walk 50 meters to a nearby fitness center (which is by the way of high quality).  Staff was very friendly and room quality including wifi was very good - maybe the biggest downside was the breakfast which wasn't particularly good and even less convenient.  Hotel is located in Kings Cross area which appear to be Sydney's red light district although it wasn't too visible even during evening times. One can walk from the hotel to harbour and opera house (maybe 3 km away).~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_442976528~“Home away from home”~The boutique Larmont Hotel, in its various re-envisionments, has long been a favorite go-to business accommodation for me. The Lamont was most recently the Diamant, which was formed by the lobby and building that was split off from the original Hyatt behind the iconic giant Coca-Cola sign. The tower became the Millenium Hotel prior to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and subsequently a condo (owned-apartment) complex, and the rooms above the reception desk became the Diamant. Patrons of the old Hyatt will undoubtedly remember the sky-high escalator that transported guests from the reception area to the lifts accessing the tower rooms, which overlooked the city. I stayed regularly in the Hyatt for a number of years, since 1989, until it became the Millenium. When the Diamant opened I immediately recognized the familiar trimmings behind the luxury boutique rennovations as depicted on their website and booked a stay, as part of an exploratory multi-hotel itinerary to identify the leading hotels of Sydney. I was immensely please by this hotel's ambience, functionality, business-traveler friendliness, luxury details, and over-the-top helpful staff.  The Larmont's reception area and rooms still retain the ambience of the original Hyatt. The hotel benefits from its attachment to the original building, where a full-service grocery, liquor store ("bottle shop" in Australianese), and several cafes, fast-food outlets, and restaurants are within steps of the hotel. However, the entry to the hotel is upslope from the major shopping street, so be prepared for a sometimes windy, relatively steep climb. The best way to arrive is by train. The station is a 5-minute stroll from the hotel. From the airport, a train ticket costs $17.50 Australian ($13 US), compared to 50$ or more for a cab. (A Chinese cabbie once took me on a circuitous route that cost me $85.) Australian trains are fast, always on time (in fact, often early), comfortable, safe, and fun to ride. Strike up a conversation with a local. Aussies are friendly, loquacious, and genuinely fond of helping visitors. On my recent visit to the Larmont, free wifi was provided. Upgrade to super-fast access was available, but I personally had no special need to upgrade. Waiting 60 seconds instead of 15 to read the news or download emal wasn't a big deal for me. The big-screen HD TV on the wall is fantastic. The double-size shower with glass wall is reminiscent of the Westin (which, if you don't know, features all-glass enclosed bathrooms). The luxury fixtures are a great touch. There are just enough touches resonant of the finest luxury hotels in Sydney to make you feel pampered and special.  You should know I haven't received any compensation, encouragement, discount, or any other consideration from the hotel to write this review. I just happen to like this hotel a lot. The pro's: high marks for cleanliness, friendliness and competence, luxury details, and proximity to trains. The cons: The street area below the hotel, known as Kings Cross, has a somewhat risque reputation, but is also home to one of the finest Italian restaurants in Sydney. One block over (Victoria Street) has some amazing restaurants and cafes. Of course, some people like risque, so I'll leave that pro/con argument to you. Bottom line: The Larmont is one of Sydney's best kept secrets. I highly recommend it for ambience, business-traveler friendliness, luxury details, and its amazing staff. Eclectic? Yes. Comfortable? Oh yeah.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442500563~“Beautiful rooms, very friendly and nice people”~Hi stayed in Larmont for 3 nights on business trip. The rooms are very nice and modern as they have been refurbished. The gym is located outside a couple of meters near the hotel, but they provide you a card, and it's a 24/7 facilities. However, I would like to make a special note to Marcela. She was really nice and helpful, recommended me places to eat and even advised on transport options. Also Fahad was very supportive as well.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

This is a bargin.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439975115~“Overpriced and just bad.”~Booked this hotel last minute through hotelstonight app. I expected much better for the price, was very disappointed. The room (3rd FL) was shabby, furniture was scratched up, carpet was dirty, the TV was broken (had lines running through the display) and was poorly mounted on the wall. The bathroom had a mildew smell and didnt feel clean. All this was bad, but to top it they started doing construction near the elevators at 7AM banging and tearing out tile, this was a rude awakening. We had to call and ask them to stop, which was only temporary as they resumed 1 hour later. I would not recommend this place.~1~nan~nan~3~nan~1~2~nan
review_438689284~“Great mid level hotel in Sydney”~I have stayed here a number of times and reviewed this hotel before, not for a while though and there have been a few changes. Ownership of this hotel changed last year and the new owners are carrying out some refurbishments, a bit surprising as I did not think it really needed it.  I have always liked the hotel and it is usually my first choice when staying in Sydney for work, the price is reasonable most of the time, although can vary depending how busy they are. The hotel is modern, always clean and very well kept. the location is great, very close to cafes etc. and a longish but do-able walk into central Sydney. The rooms are mostly similar, smallish but very well fitted, some have a large balcony, the main benefit of this is the ability to have the door open and some fresh air in the room. Bathrooms are also small but really well fitted and pleasant. Large seperate walk in rainfall shower is very welcome. My room this time around had been recently refurbished so nice and fresh, as above though there is nothing wrong with the un-refurbished rooms. All rooms have a large screen TV and iPad in the room. The only thing that annoys me slightly is the wifi, under the old ownership they had good fast wifi and it was free, as it should be in all hotels, now they have free standard wifi that is just too slow, and premium wifi you need to pay for. This time round they told me they have fixed it! premium is now free and super fast is at added cost. My experience was the only upgrade is the name change, the premium is now just slow and you need to buy the super fast upgrade to be any use. I still don't understand why they don't just charge a few dollars extra for the rooms and make fast usable wifi free! There is a limited number of car parts on site and the park is very tight, make sure you book parking in advance. ($45.00 night) If you like to use a gym, there is a commercial 24 hr gym in the building and hotel guests have free access, this works well and is a very good gym.  The best thing is the staff who I always find very friendly and welcoming. Apart from my gripe about the wifi I really like this hotel and have stayed here four or five times a year for the last few years. I highly recommend it.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_438598983~“Great alternative to city center”~Our room looked nothing like the rooms in the pictures, but it was still pretty nice. The bathroom was a little small, but I loved the shower (rain shower head), and the shelf for toiletries behind the sink area. The bed and linens were very nice and comfy/cozy. We had a direct view of the bridge and opera house (although partially blocked by construction). The iPad was very useful. We did not get sim cards for our phone when we arrived, so we relied on the hotel wifi and wherever else we could connect in the city. I didn't find it to be a hinderance. There was construction so by around 9am we could hear drilling, etc. but it wasn't really an issue as we were getting up and around to start our day by then. There are no real amenities, that I was aware of other than passes to the gym next door (if that's your thing). Unless your lan is to spend a lot of time at the hotel, then that's not really an issue. I end up not using most of them when I am playing tourist because I want to see and do things around the city. The star was so-so. They weren't overly friendly or helpful, but they weren't rude either. We wanted late checkout but had to wait until the day before we left to ask for it's availability. I think ti was an extra $40. King Cross is a diverse area. Lots of food, clubs, entertainment options. Not sure if it is unsafe, but we returned late at night a few times and didn't feel unsafe.  Positives: 5 min walk to King Cross station (about 15-20 minutes to circular Quay) Nespresso coffee maker (milk in mini bar fridge) Water heating pot iPad with free wifi Big flatscreen, but limited channels (no CNN International) Negatives: Construction No other amenities Tip: If you arrive late and just want to relax before starting out early the next day they have a food delivery service called Foodora (as well as others) that was reasonably priced and fairly quick with delivery.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_437350720~“Good location - good service and rooms”~I booked this from the UK before I arrived in Sydney. We were only in Sydney for 3 nights. This hotel seemed a fair price compared to many others that are "more central". I loved the location. It may have been "on the edge" of the Red Light District, but that is part and parcel of the history of the area and its charm. It is very safe around the area as a tourist and has some great pubs and eateries. Kings Cross Station is a very short walk which gains access to all of Sydney and her surrounding areas. The reception staff are very knowledgeable and will point you in the right direction to suit any needs - a nice restaurant, lively pub etc. The room we had was recently refurbished - not the greatest view but clean and comfortable. For the price I paid I was extremely satisfied - give it a go!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
