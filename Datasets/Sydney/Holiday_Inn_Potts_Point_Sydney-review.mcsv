review_477279316~“A Pleasant Stay”~My room had a panoramic view of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, which was beautiful. It was a good sized room with a comfortable bed and nice bed linen. It was clean and kept that way throughout my stay.The shower had strong water pressure and a good supply of hot water. There was an ample supply of toiletry. The only thing I didn't like was that the shower was over a bath tub with shower curtain. The curtain had an unpleasant smell when I moved in, but it was promptly changed when I asked. The WiFi in the room was a bit sporadic, and occasionally, it stopped altogether.  The gym was well equipped, with a shower and plenty of bath towels.  Breakfast was very good with a good variety of cooked and cold food, fresh fruit, and coffee and tea making machines. *Watch out for a beautiful stork scavenging just outside the dining room in the mornings.  The staff in all was very friendly and helpful. I had, on arrival, strong issues with the allocated room (which was eventually changed), due to the nature of which was contradictory to what I booked and requested for. But, with the efficiency and competence of the ever so friendly Duty Manager, Mathew, they were resolved quickly.  The location of the hotel is within close proximity to a variety of eateries, in the nature of food and prices. The train stop is next door. Trains to the CBD are about 20 minutes. There are bus stops on the main road just round the corner, at one of which you can catch the Sydney Hop-on-hop-off Tour bus. If walking is a pleasure, the Botanic gardens is about 30 minutes away, the Sydney Opera House about a further 10.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476947113~“Location and comfort”~This was the 4th time I've stayed here. I always go back because the location is perfect and the prices very reasonable. I'm not a tourist to Sydney so don't have to stay in the CBD so that could make a difference to a decision to stay here or not.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_475726392~“Good value for money”~The location of the hotel would be more accurately described as Kings Cross and not Potts Point, being located just two minutes from Kings Cross station and the thriving Kings Cross area. The Kings Cross area has a certain notoriety, but if you are a family and are not staying out late in the immediate area, it is absolutely fine. We stayed in room 813, which is a two room suite with a fantastic view of the Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The room itself was very comfortable. The dining area is a bit "canteenish" but the food is fine. Would we go back? The answer is "yes", and this is because of the great effort that the Duty Manager Matthew Scarf made to make us feel comfortable. We arrived from Europe at 06.00 after two nights in an airplane. Very tired as you can imagine. The staff member at reception basically said that we would not be able to check in until the afternoon. I said that I understood that, but was it possible to have a temporary room until the afternoon - on a paying basis if necessary? The staff member consulted his boss and the response was "not possible", and so we resigned ourselves to a long wait. At about 07.30 we were feeling very tired and I saw another member of staff at reception, and this person turned out to be Matthew Scarf. Not only was he sympathetic, he made sure that coffee was delivered to us in the lobby, and said that he would immediately look into the possibilities for us to get a room. Within 5 minutes he said that he could make the room that we had booked available by 09.00. In addition, if we wanted, we could have a temporary room right away. I said that it would be inconsiderate to tie up a room for 90 minutes and that we were fine with having access to our booked room at 09.00. Matthew actually could be the subject of a masterclass in client service. So if we ever in Sydney again we will go back to this hotel.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_475394677~“Great location, and comfortable too!”~My wife and I flew to Sydney to attend a friend's daughter's wedding, which was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, at Circular Quay. Deciding where to stay was critical. We chose the Holiday Inn at Potts Point as it was:  (a) close to the wedding ($14 by uber);  (b) sits on top of an underground train station, which means it's very easy to get there from (and to) the airport (and central Sydney); and  (c) reasonably priced, being less expensive than hotels near Circular Quay.  The room we had (710) cost a little more ($30), but had a wonderful view overlooking the city, with the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The room (and hotel generally) were quiet, which we appreciated. The bed was really comfortable and the appointments were all we needed.  Nearby, there's Kings Cross, with lots of eateries of different styles and budgets - lots of choice. But that is also the one downside; while eclectic, walking around we felt a little - and I mean, 'a little' - but uncomfortable. Not unsafe, just uncomfortable.  So, it was a winner because if it's location for transport, eating and sightseeing and it's a comfortable, well priced place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474386303~“Great Location – Comfortable Bed”~A great location for access to public transport, restaurants and shopping. Kings Cross Railway Station is right next door and it is only a quick train ride into the CBD or Bondi Junction. Or if you are in the mood for a little exercise it is a pleasant walk down William St and through the gardens to the CBD.  Check in went without any problems, the staff were friendly and efficient. As were all the staff throughout the hotel. The room was clean and spacious, I had a view of the Harbour Bridge and although I didn’t spend much time in the room during the day it was a quite spectacular view at night. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the night curtains do their job.  Breakfast was good and at a reasonable price; plenty of choices and with eggs to order. Something new since my last visit, your eggs are delivered to your table no more waiting around the cooking station waiting for the chef to do his/her thing.  Speaking of changes, the public areas (restaurant, bar and foyer) have had a makeover and a considerable difference it makes to the ambiance of the place. Also in another positive step forward, the menu in the restaurant has also changed giving you more choice.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_473338389~“Great value for money”~We booked two suite on the top floor with views to the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. The suites were large and the view fantastic!

review_472998917~“Convenient to restaurants, train next door.”~Great place to stay. Good size rooms with comfortable bed, very friendly helpful staff. Lounge area to gather with friends for drink or coffee. We did not have time to try the restaurant. Located next to Kings Cross train station makes it easy to get around city, plus bus stop nearby. Lots of boutique restaurants & coffee shops within walking distance. We walked from Pitt Street Mall via Hyde Park & William St. to motel, it took 20 Minutes. Airport bus to & from this Holiday Inn, pay the driver. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_472605846~“Fantastic!!”~Enjoyed a great stay with a friend, both of us celebrating a birthday in May 2016, we were allocated rooms close to each other, beautiful Harbour view rooms and were blown away when we had a complimentary bottle of bubbly to our rooms! Absolutely beautiful bedding! Top quality furnishings, and bathroom! Close to everything, lots of restaurants close by, as well as one downstairs along with a bar..saw lots of airline personel staying there too so obviously great place to stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472510518~“Pleasant stay; convenient position”~It is a Holiday Inn....so you know pretty much what you will get. The rooms are big, a little on the spartan side - need more decorative touches - but very clean and the bed is big and very comfortable. The staff are always cheery, welcoming and helpful. The restaurant is adequate. The breakfast is a buffet, inevitably, which I hate with a single minded passion because there's always someone reaching across you and putting pressure on. But hotels do breakfast buffets because they are cost-effective in staffing. The fare is ample in choice and decent quality. For dinner they do a good steak and a reasonable pizza. The hotel is in King's Cross, the 'Soho' of Sydney. I stayed there many years ago and it was quite rough and risque. Today it is much less so and has touches of modern building and real attempts to up-market the area. Lots of backpacker hostels. The hotel is immediately next door to the main underground station and from there you can get to all the main sights of Sydney for AUD4.10 each way or a $10 (or up) Opal card is better value.  At a time when the Aussie Dollar is very high for unfortunates like we Brits, the hotel and the area it is in represents better value than its sister hotels like the InterContinental that wants nearly $600 a night! The HI Potts Point is well recommended.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_471015990~“Great location.wonderful night sleep.”~Usually stay with Holiday Inn when in Sydney. Love this Potts Point location in the centre of Kings Cross next door to the train station , easy to get around. I enjoy the buzz on the streets and the resturants near by. Rooms are spacious, clean and quiet. The beds are big and really comfortable there is a choice of soft and firm pillows. Ticks all the boxes.~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan

review_469339050~“Five star service from the cheerful and helpful staff”~We arrived at the hotel after a very long flight 21 hours in total. As it was only 10am we had not expected our room to be ready but the staff on reception said they would fast track the cleaning for us or if we wanted to they had an upgrade room to offer us right then. We took the latter option for a relatively modest sum and were fortunate to have a wonderful view of the Opera House and Bridge.  The staff were also very helpful with regard to our queries about transport and walking routes in the Sydney area. All this was done with great cheerfulness and courtesy. Well done Holiday Inn Potts Point.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_469296479~“Excellent stay, great location”~Stayed here for 5 nights, we had a road front room but experienced no noise ( not even on Saturday), The room was large and very clean, bathroom was a generous size. This is a busy hotel but we found it well managed so this was never a problem, from the front desk to the restaurant everything runs smoothly. The hotel is next to the Kings Cross station ( its underground and no noise) putting the hotel in an excellent position to reach the whole of Sydney - beaches as well as the city centre. Buses are also close by. What makes this hotel extra special is the staff, friendly, helpful and full of information from how to get round their city ( buy an Opal card) to the nearest laundry ( a couple of hundred metres down the road).~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469037452~“A good Hotel with some issues”~Recently staying in this hotel for extended days during the weeks. Fundamentally a good business hotel but needs some tweaking. Good points first. Whilst not the easiest hotel to get to access to parking is very easy and staff attentiveness is first rate. Being an IHG member helps but staff are very helpful and sort everything out.  Issues are always the things we point out but these are on a base of a very good business hotel which could be excellent: 1. Breakfast bar - In the over 20 days I have stayed so far this time, the chef is absent from the breakfast bar almost always. I have seen patrons give up in disgust and take the scrambled eggs. Not sure what is going on there but if you offer a choice for breakfast the chef needs to be available.  2. Room Service -sometimes you ring for room service and the phone rings and rings . It has gone to reception and back sometimes. Tonight I got a harassed response...take the order but not even a sorry for the delay and the staff member hung up immediately without a courtesy. I get they are busy but ...... So a great hotel for business but some thought in the little things. I recommend if you have business in this area stay here!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_465025294~“Pleasant hotel”~Nice hotel, but not keen on the area. Right in the heart of Kings Cross back packers area. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large, well appointed, and have comfortable beds and exceptionally good pillows.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_464915975~“My favourite hotel in Sydney”~I have visited this hotel countless times and ever visit has been nothing short of exceptional.

review_463610856~“Spectacular view but dated”~This hotel has arguably the most spectacular panoramic view of the harbour bridge, the opera house and the CBD. However, the building is outdated and refurbishment seems an urgent task. Rooms are classical design, windows cannot be opened so the a/c has to be on all the time. How nice it would be to breathe fresh Sydney air. There rooftop is not utilised at all, There could be a visitors terrace, a swimming pool or a night bar! Hope you remember my suggestions when you decide to refurbish.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_463383113~“Highly Recommend - especially on business”~I have been staying at the Holiday Inn in Potts Point for years with work.

review_461441302~“Sydney view !”~We last stayed here 3 years ago and it did not disappoint again, the staff were so helpful and welcomed us back with complimentary drinks.

Breakfast is amazing, fresh fruit, breads, yogurts, cold meats and cheeses and of course the traditional cooked breakfast of bacon, eggs (cooked any way you wanted by the Chef), beans, tomatoes, hash brown, fried bread and more.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461153723~“GREAT LOCATION IN SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA”~Hotel entrance is a few feet from their metro system. They are located within walking distance to the Botanical Garden, and even a healthy walk to the ferry and Sydney Harbor and Bridge activities. They serve a hearty cooked breakfast, with great fruit and juice choices. You can request a room with great views of the bridge. Staff was very helpful.

review_460820716~“Comfortable Hotel with many conveniences around”~Booked 3 nights in this hotel using the IHG online site for a wedding anniversary weekend and overall stay was comfortable and pleasant. The staff were friendly and accommodating to my requests. Service 5/5 Like I said, the staff were very friendly and I was always greeted with a smile, even got a daily "good morning" from the hardworking housekeeping staff as I exited my room.  Room 2/5 First impressions - when I first walked into the room it smelled like sweat, it wasn't particularly strong but very disappointing especially when you smell a really nice fragrance as you enter the lobby of the hotel and this is the absolute last thing you want guests to experience. This not particularly the fault of your extremely hardworking housekeepers, (especially in the really hot summer weather) but steps need to be taken to ensure that "smell" is also part of the housekeeping tasks, it should logically smell like the fragrance used in the hotel lobby. The TV in my room displayed different names each day for the Welcome screen - none of them were my name at all. Not a big deal but small details like this should not be overlooked.  The beds were comfortable and the view was quite nice as we were located on the 6th Floor looking towards the harbour bridge.  Convenience 4/5 The hotel is right next to the Kings Cross Station (don't let Google Maps fool you) and was super easy to find. From the airport to the hotel takes around roughly 30mins which is pretty sweet. Not only that across the road there is a Coles supermarket where you can load up on drinks/snacks and extra food right up until midnight. If you want a bite to eat from outside the hotel there are also plenty of eateries/fast food joints again across the road so it's quite easy to just walk across buy something and head back to the room to relax.  Friday and Saturday nights get pretty loud outside, but you don't really hear much of this from the room (well not from where I was staying anyway).  Good hotel and I would say this is slightly better than the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour.~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_460627476~“New Years Eve in Sydney”~It was one of the thrills of my life to be able to view the Sydney fireworks display from our room on the Holiday Inn Potts Point on New Years Eve, 2016. I made the reservations over six months in advance and the hotel delivered! Or should I say, the fireworks, not just over the Harbour Bridge but also visible in two other locations of Sydney Harbour, were everything I could have imagined.  Location of this hotel is wonderful. Next to Kings Cross subway station, in a neighborhood with a good mix of shops and bars and restaurants, and a longish walk to the Botanic Gardens. Checkin was efficient, the room clean, spacious and with that view! Even if it wasn' t New Years Eve, would stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_460555841~“OK for business”~Stayed here for two nights for business. Check in was relatively painless.  Hotel looks old and tired. Drab hallways lead to a room that is a bit tired.  Good points: * Good iron, not damaged, with no burn marks on the bottom * Bathroom had a good shower head (handle type) with lots of pressure * Pillow selection, between firm and medium pillows * Pretty quiet room * TV setup was good (almost a smart TV). Not so good * Not a dedicated shower; standing in the bathtub * Just a bit old and dated * standard Australian approach to coffee (instant and a kettle). Not a bad location; very close to the train station and the main strip in the Cross, but far enough off it that you don't get a lot of street noise.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan

review_456659255~“Overall impression: hotel, area, position”~Hotel : Staff pleasant and helpful. Breakfast which was included in price was good - no complaints here. Room was pleasant. Did not have nice fresh odour in long corridor to room and felt the carpets should be replaced. Positioned close to Kings Cross Station but you do need to change stations if you want to go to the harbour. Vicinity: Lots of places where one can eat/take away but being pretty fussy, I like eateries to look clean so not really impressed. The area looked shabby, fair amount of litter, several adult entertainment places which is not my scene. I did not feel unsafe but I certainly did not feel comfortable in the area. All in all I felt the hotel and area was average. The hotel decor did not strike me as either modern or old. I think I would choose a hotel closer to the harbour if I ever went back to Sydney. Australia is summer is terribly hot and if I ever went to Oz again it would not be during summer.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_456454656~“Great location...even better staff”~I loved the location of this hotel...right next to a (underground) train station...24 hour food places across the street...grocery store across the street...all sorts of restaurants, clubs, etc in the immediate area. It was a very nice 25 minute or so walk to Circular Quay, the Sydney Opera House, etc. My room was a good size and clean...coffee and tea provided plus a small fridge that I used to hold drinks, etc. The staff...with very special "thanks" to Jessica...was the nicest staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in.

review_455825374~“The hotel is good but the location not so good”~We landed in Australia after a 15-hour flight and reached this hotel around 9:30 pm. After checking in and all, we ventured out to find some dinner and found everything closed. And the street we ventured out on had nothing but strip clubs so that was a shocker too. Not a good location if you are planning to stay with kids and families. The hotel staff and service was very good though - helpful and accommodating.

review_454207475~“Good location, but stale interior.”~Stayed there 4 nights last week. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Restaurant seemed to offer reasonable value, although breakfast at a "discounted" $23 was expensive. Our room and many of the public areas suffered from tired and stale decor. UK readers will understand when I describe it as like an old style Travelodge. A refurbishment is overdue.

review_452230849~“great hotel, brilliant receptionist”~I would have rated this hotel a 4 except for one thing that made it stand out more than most other hotels in its range. The receptionist Emily is just brilliant, she is so helpful and friendly and she made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, from checking us in early and arranging a room with a view and her efficient dealing with our checkout. OK the room was comfortable and clean with a good amount of space, had everything required of a 4 star hotel and an amazing view towards the harbour and bridge,was vert quiet and had a good bathroom. breakfast was included in our rate and was very good. 2 issues I did have that did not alter our enjoyment of the stay are the high security deposit if you do not use a credit card, this was higher than any other hotel I have stayed at, and some carpet and wall damage in the 8th floor corridor leading to our room. but the great service from Emily made up for any shortcomings at the hotel. We both enjoyed our stay at this Holiday Inn and consider it to be great value for what you get~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_451320792~“Little nervous about location”~This was my first hotel on a 42-day trip down under. There are amazing stories to tell about most of my experience with hotels and other actives. So, look to more reviews as I post them for some great tips. The Holiday Inn Potts Point is in a good location intown. I spent two nights there in early December 2016. It is close to the Hop on Hop off bus routes. (If you do this do not buy the hop on hop off boat as a joint with the bus ticket. (There are better ways and you will most likely loose the ticket like I did.) Rooms were of good size and very clean. There are no views to look at. Breakfast was what you would expect from a buffet. Dinning around the hotel is limited but make a point of walking down hill for restaurants as if you walk uphill you will enter the red-light district. I do not recommend doing this at night. However, I would stay there again as I thought the staff was very helpful and friendly. They even stored some luggage for 10 days as I did some additional touring in the country. (Look for off to Ayers Rock).  Airport advice, you do need to look for the shuttle service from the airport. We made the mistake of taking a taxi and the cost was $56.00 one way. The shuttle is only $35.00. Now I am talking Australian dollars. I am from the good old USA and the exchange rate in December 2016 was about $1.22 Australian dollars for one American dollar. Stay away from the exchange cashiers as they will only give you $.80 cents. I am a big fan of ATM Machines as I get excellent rates from my bank. Taxies are a very necessary form of transportation in Sydney as there is a lot to do. I spent 8 days off and on in Sydney during this trip and spent about $400.00 on taxies alone. Be prepared I say. Next review Desert Gardens Novotel Hotel in Ayers Rock.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_451039669~“Great find only minutes from the centre”~I stayed at the property over the New Year period. The hotel is easy to find, directly outside the Kings Cross Station. The area does look seedy, with some adult shops and venues along the street, however I felt completely safe walking around alone. The train is only 2 minutes into Martin Place, and I walked there in 15 minutes, so this was a great alternative to the high-priced city prices. It's also only 10 minutes on the train to Bondi Junction. I arrived late, and was given a warm welcome, and a room on the 7th floor. I initially had a view of the street, and on my last night I moved to a harbour view room - definitely book the 'King Harbour View' for amazing views across to the bridge and the opera house. Lizzie was incredibly helpful throughout my stay, and there was a nice touch of a bottle of bubble on NYE provided to guests. I will definitely stay here again. This was a great-priced, well-located, friendly hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

My wife, and two children, 12 and 11, recently enjoyed a short stay at the Holiday Inn Potts Point on the eve of Christmas, on the edge of the infamous Kings Cross red light district hotel. We would certainly stay there again.   Stepping into the foyer, Sydney’s chaos and tumult quickly melts away, replaced by peaceful; sanctuary.  After a three hour drive from Canberra, including an inadvertent wrong way turn into the Victoria Street exit onto Oxford Street, we managed to find our way to the hotel and some guidance to the hotel’s underground carpark. Taking the life to the foyer and laden with bags, we were greeted by friendly staff who made us feel instantly welcome and explained all the features of the hotel. Taking the lift to our room we were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space afforded, with a sizeable living area and two queen sized beds, plenty of space for two active kids and two adults and certainly much more than afforded by a standard hotel room. The room was easily the equivalent in dimension of a two room apartment. Over the past two years we have done a lot of travelling and had experienced a range of hotel and self-service apartments but for affordable comfort this was as good as any. During our stay we did a number of longer walks around the city and it was always a relief to get back to our room and have enough space to relax, especially for two exhausted children. The mark of a hotel is whether it feels like a home away from home. In the mornings, the Sirrocco restaurant provided a delicious buffet smorgasbord of hot food as well as typical continental fare and the chef would cheerfully prepare an omelette or scrambled eggs on demand. Our kids were even able to enjoy their favourite Chinese pork buns, making breakfast one of the highlights of the day. However, the main feature of the accommodation was arguably not the room itself, but the view across to the city and the Harbour Bridge, especially captivating at night with the city lights glowing across the skyline.  We would highly recommend Holiday Inn Potts Point to visitors to Sydney looking for affordable and convenient accommodation where guests are treated with courtesy.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_477279316~“A Pleasant Stay”~My room had a panoramic view of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, which was beautiful. It was a good sized room with a comfortable bed and nice bed linen. It was clean and kept that way throughout my stay.The shower had strong water pressure and a good supply of hot water. There was an ample supply of toiletry. The only thing I didn't like was that the shower was over a bath tub with shower curtain. The curtain had an unpleasant smell when I moved in, but it was promptly changed when I asked. The WiFi in the room was a bit sporadic, and occasionally, it stopped altogether.  The gym was well equipped, with a shower and plenty of bath towels.  Breakfast was very good with a good variety of cooked and cold food, fresh fruit, and coffee and tea making machines. *Watch out for a beautiful stork scavenging just outside the dining room in the mornings.  The staff in all was very friendly and helpful. I had, on arrival, strong issues with the allocated room (which was eventually changed), due to the nature of which was contradictory to what I booked and requested for. But, with the efficiency and competence of the ever so friendly Duty Manager, Mathew, they were resolved quickly.  The location of the hotel is within close proximity to a variety of eateries, in the nature of food and prices. The train stop is next door. Trains to the CBD are about 20 minutes. There are bus stops on the main road just round the corner, at one of which you can catch the Sydney Hop-on-hop-off Tour bus. If walking is a pleasure, the Botanic gardens is about 30 minutes away, the Sydney Opera House about a further 10.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476947113~“Location and comfort”~This was the 4th time I've stayed here. I always go back because the location is perfect and the prices very reasonable. I'm not a tourist to Sydney so don't have to stay in the CBD so that could make a difference to a decision to stay here or not.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_475726392~“Good value for money”~The location of the hotel would be more accurately described as Kings Cross and not Potts Point, being located just two minutes from Kings Cross station and the thriving Kings Cross area. The Kings Cross area has a certain notoriety, but if you are a family and are not staying out late in the immediate area, it is absolutely fine. We stayed in room 813, which is a two room suite with a fantastic view of the Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The room itself was very comfortable. The dining area is a bit "canteenish" but the food is fine. Would we go back? The answer is "yes", and this is because of the great effort that the Duty Manager Matthew Scarf made to make us feel comfortable. We arrived from Europe at 06.00 after two nights in an airplane. Very tired as you can imagine. The staff member at reception basically said that we would not be able to check in until the afternoon. I said that I understood that, but was it possible to have a temporary room until the afternoon - on a paying basis if necessary? The staff member consulted his boss and the response was "not possible", and so we resigned ourselves to a long wait. At about 07.30 we were feeling very tired and I saw another member of staff at reception, and this person turned out to be Matthew Scarf. Not only was he sympathetic, he made sure that coffee was delivered to us in the lobby, and said that he would immediately look into the possibilities for us to get a room. Within 5 minutes he said that he could make the room that we had booked available by 09.00. In addition, if we wanted, we could have a temporary room right away. I said that it would be inconsiderate to tie up a room for 90 minutes and that we were fine with having access to our booked room at 09.00. Matthew actually could be the subject of a masterclass in client service. So if we ever in Sydney again we will go back to this hotel.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_475394677~“Great location, and comfortable too!”~My wife and I flew to Sydney to attend a friend's daughter's wedding, which was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, at Circular Quay. Deciding where to stay was critical. We chose the Holiday Inn at Potts Point as it was:  (a) close to the wedding ($14 by uber);  (b) sits on top of an underground train station, which means it's very easy to get there from (and to) the airport (and central Sydney); and  (c) reasonably priced, being less expensive than hotels near Circular Quay.  The room we had (710) cost a little more ($30), but had a wonderful view overlooking the city, with the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The room (and hotel generally) were quiet, which we appreciated. The bed was really comfortable and the appointments were all we needed.  Nearby, there's Kings Cross, with lots of eateries of different styles and budgets - lots of choice. But that is also the one downside; while eclectic, walking around we felt a little - and I mean, 'a little' - but uncomfortable. Not unsafe, just uncomfortable.  So, it was a winner because if it's location for transport, eating and sightseeing and it's a comfortable, well priced place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474386303~“Great Location – Comfortable Bed”~A great location for access to public transport, restaurants and shopping. Kings Cross Railway Station is right next door and it is only a quick train ride into the CBD or Bondi Junction. Or if you are in the mood for a little exercise it is a pleasant walk down William St and through the gardens to the CBD.  Check in went without any problems, the staff were friendly and efficient. As were all the staff throughout the hotel. The room was clean and spacious, I had a view of the Harbour Bridge and although I didn’t spend much time in the room during the day it was a quite spectacular view at night. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the night curtains do their job.  Breakfast was good and at a reasonable price; plenty of choices and with eggs to order. Something new since my last visit, your eggs are delivered to your table no more waiting around the cooking station waiting for the chef to do his/her thing.  Speaking of changes, the public areas (restaurant, bar and foyer) have had a makeover and a considerable difference it makes to the ambiance of the place. Also in another positive step forward, the menu in the restaurant has also changed giving you more choice.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_473338389~“Great value for money”~We booked two suite on the top floor with views to the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. The suites were large and the view fantastic! It could do with an overhaul, as it is old fashioned and a bit tired, but the rates were great and we were very happy. Very friendly staff.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472998917~“Convenient to restaurants, train next door.”~Great place to stay. Good size rooms with comfortable bed, very friendly helpful staff. Lounge area to gather with friends for drink or coffee. We did not have time to try the restaurant. Located next to Kings Cross train station makes it easy to get around city, plus bus stop nearby. Lots of boutique restaurants & coffee shops within walking distance. We walked from Pitt Street Mall via Hyde Park & William St. to motel, it took 20 Minutes. Airport bus to & from this Holiday Inn, pay the driver. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_472605846~“Fantastic!!”~Enjoyed a great stay with a friend, both of us celebrating a birthday in May 2016, we were allocated rooms close to each other, beautiful Harbour view rooms and were blown away when we had a complimentary bottle of bubbly to our rooms! Absolutely beautiful bedding! Top quality furnishings, and bathroom! Close to everything, lots of restaurants close by, as well as one downstairs along with a bar..saw lots of airline personel staying there too so obviously great place to stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472510518~“Pleasant stay; convenient position”~It is a Holiday Inn....so you know pretty much what you will get. The rooms are big, a little on the spartan side - need more decorative touches - but very clean and the bed is big and very comfortable. The staff are always cheery, welcoming and helpful. The restaurant is adequate. The breakfast is a buffet, inevitably, which I hate with a single minded passion because there's always someone reaching across you and putting pressure on. But hotels do breakfast buffets because they are cost-effective in staffing. The fare is ample in choice and decent quality. For dinner they do a good steak and a reasonable pizza. The hotel is in King's Cross, the 'Soho' of Sydney. I stayed there many years ago and it was quite rough and risque. Today it is much less so and has touches of modern building and real attempts to up-market the area. Lots of backpacker hostels. The hotel is immediately next door to the main underground station and from there you can get to all the main sights of Sydney for AUD4.10 each way or a $10 (or up) Opal card is better value.  At a time when the Aussie Dollar is very high for unfortunates like we Brits, the hotel and the area it is in represents better value than its sister hotels like the InterContinental that wants nearly $600 a night! The HI Potts Point is well recommended.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_471015990~“Great location.wonderful night sleep.”~Usually stay with Holiday Inn when in Sydney. Love this Potts Point location in the centre of Kings Cross next door to the train station , easy to get around. I enjoy the buzz on the streets and the resturants near by. Rooms are spacious, clean and quiet. The beds are big and really comfortable there is a choice of soft and firm pillows. Ticks all the boxes.~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_469339050~“Five star service from the cheerful and helpful staff”~We arrived at the hotel after a very long flight 21 hours in total. As it was only 10am we had not expected our room to be ready but the staff on reception said they would fast track the cleaning for us or if we wanted to they had an upgrade room to offer us right then. We took the latter option for a relatively modest sum and were fortunate to have a wonderful view of the Opera House and Bridge.  The staff were also very helpful with regard to our queries about transport and walking routes in the Sydney area. All this was done with great cheerfulness and courtesy. Well done Holiday Inn Potts Point.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_469296479~“Excellent stay, great location”~Stayed here for 5 nights, we had a road front room but experienced no noise ( not even on Saturday), The room was large and very clean, bathroom was a generous size. This is a busy hotel but we found it well managed so this was never a problem, from the front desk to the restaurant everything runs smoothly. The hotel is next to the Kings Cross station ( its underground and no noise) putting the hotel in an excellent position to reach the whole of Sydney - beaches as well as the city centre. Buses are also close by. What makes this hotel extra special is the staff, friendly, helpful and full of information from how to get round their city ( buy an Opal card) to the nearest laundry ( a couple of hundred metres down the road).~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469037452~“A good Hotel with some issues”~Recently staying in this hotel for extended days during the weeks. Fundamentally a good business hotel but needs some tweaking. Good points first. Whilst not the easiest hotel to get to access to parking is very easy and staff attentiveness is first rate. Being an IHG member helps but staff are very helpful and sort everything out.  Issues are always the things we point out but these are on a base of a very good business hotel which could be excellent: 1. Breakfast bar - In the over 20 days I have stayed so far this time, the chef is absent from the breakfast bar almost always. I have seen patrons give up in disgust and take the scrambled eggs. Not sure what is going on there but if you offer a choice for breakfast the chef needs to be available.  2. Room Service -sometimes you ring for room service and the phone rings and rings . It has gone to reception and back sometimes. Tonight I got a harassed response...take the order but not even a sorry for the delay and the staff member hung up immediately without a courtesy. I get they are busy but ...... So a great hotel for business but some thought in the little things. I recommend if you have business in this area stay here!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_467477144~“Great Value for Money”~stayed here 3rd -5th march with my sister who was visiting from Scotland. From the minute we arrived staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming and super eager to make our stay great.  Buffet breakfast was amazing and again staff really eager to do what they can for you. Car parking is an extra $27 per day but well worth it. Rooms spacious and beds comfy.  Granted it is a little tired and dated but clean,good value , central to Kings Cross, Paddington, and Darlinghurst. Kings cross station is on the doorstep which takes you loads of places.  Lots of quirky wee places to eat delicious food and visit. Fantastic vibe. Smashing market on a Saturday.  Will definitely come back and recommend it to ayone thinking of making it a base to see sydney.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466144692~“Great stay in a convenient locations ”~Had three nights in the Holiday Inn. Had a noice room on the 8th look overlooking eastern Sydney. (No sea views though). The room was dated but clean and comfortable. Rest pillows - with a choice supplied from firm to soft. Had a nice breakfast in the Sirroco restaurant in the lobby as well as a well priced room service dinner. The service was friendly and check in and out was quick with no problems. The location close to Kings Cross station is ideal. Will stay there again. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466144400~“A great welcome”~As UK visitors new to Sydney we were a little concerned initially about the location of hotel so close to Darlinghurst Road but we can honestly report that there were no problems at all. The location turned out to be excellent in many ways, especially being so close to Kings Cross station. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The restaurant served excellent breakfast and evening meals. Our room on the top floor was extremely spacious and comfortable. All in all the hotel was part of a very memorable visit to Sydney.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_465753561~“Location, location, location!”~Potts Point HH is centrally located for great walking as well as catching the train. Hotel is located in the Kings Cross district. The metro is actually located just below the hotel which really made my navigation of Sydney easy. Great eateries, shopping, convenience stores all in walking distance. So why only 3 stars? The rooms are in serious need of updating. The wardrobe, dressers, tv stand and night stands are all the same old drab wood color; maybe from late 70s early 80s. The drapes appear to be very old and are dark brown. There is also an old stale odor in the rooms ( I changed rooms during my stay).  The double queen bed rooms are a great size but mine overlooked an apartment patio in which I could see straight into their kitchen and I'm sure they could see in my room. Needless to say I requested a room change. New room was on a high floor with an AMAZING VIEW. I could see the harbor bridge and great city view. Although this room was still outdated I was very pleased with the room and accepted the trade off.  The staff at the hotel are extremely accommodating and friendly. Ready to assist in any way possible. I was in Sydney as birthday trip, and the front desk sent up a bottle of wine and chocolate; I felt so special . I also felt very safe here, elevator operates by room key only as well as the front doors after a certain time. The lobby offers an abundance of info on tourist attractions, tours, and things to do. I actually booked all of my excursions using the brochures from the lobby.  Hotel also has a restaurant which provides breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night eats. There's also a bar.  Overall I loved this hotel for its simplicity and convenience and I really hate scoring it so low but it's definitely time for some room updates. I would stay here again and would recommend to anyone not looking for luxury; after all how much time are you really going to stay in your room in such a beautiful city!?~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465670578~“Good location but a full refurbishment is necessary.....”~We usually stay at the Holiday Inn, Old Sydney which is on The Rocks however the rate there has increased so dramatically that we chose Potts Point instead. Location of this hotel is a much busier one but well located. Problem is the hotel needs a refurbish. Rooms, carpets, furnishings are past their best and this must be a priority. Staff are very knowledgeable and friendly however this does not make up for the refurb which surely must be on the cards... Where will we stay next visit will be the question!!~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465437286~“Quick trip to Sydney for Specialist appointment”~Took myself , my wife and mother in law to Sydney for specialist appointment. My mother in law is slightly disabled and uses a wheel chair so we asked for a disabled room. The staff at the Holiday Inn were so supportive and made sure everything was where we needed it.

review_465342723~“Old and Needs Lots of Work”~I was looking forward to my vacation and was happy that we chose the Holiday Inn as I have never before had any issues with any I have stayed in. It was a long flight from Toronto and we just wanted to get to our room and have showers and head out for dinner. The room was disappointing to say the very least. It was dark, dirty and run down. I could not believe this was a Holiday Inn. They need to renovate and clean this hotel top to bottom. The pictures on the internet are old pictures, that is not what you are getting when you check in.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan

review_463610856~“Spectacular view but dated”~This hotel has arguably the most spectacular panoramic view of the harbour bridge, the opera house and the CBD. However, the building is outdated and refurbishment seems an urgent task. Rooms are classical design, windows cannot be opened so the a/c has to be on all the time. How nice it would be to breathe fresh Sydney air. There rooftop is not utilised at all, There could be a visitors terrace, a swimming pool or a night bar!

review_460820716~“Comfortable Hotel with many conveniences around”~Booked 3 nights in this hotel using the IHG online site for a wedding anniversary weekend and overall stay was comfortable and pleasant. The staff were friendly and accommodating to my requests. Service 5/5 Like I said, the staff were very friendly and I was always greeted with a smile, even got a daily "good morning" from the hardworking housekeeping staff as I exited my room.  Room 2/5 First impressions - when I first walked into the room it smelled like sweat, it wasn't particularly strong but very disappointing especially when you smell a really nice fragrance as you enter the lobby of the hotel and this is the absolute last thing you want guests to experience. This not particularly the fault of your extremely hardworking housekeepers, (especially in the really hot summer weather) but steps need to be taken to ensure that "smell" is also part of the housekeeping tasks, it should logically smell like the fragrance used in the hotel lobby. The TV in my room displayed different names each day for the Welcome screen - none of them were my name at all. Not a big deal but small details like this should not be overlooked.  The beds were comfortable and the view was quite nice as we were located on the 6th Floor looking towards the harbour bridge.  Convenience 4/5 The hotel is right next to the Kings Cross Station (don't let Google Maps fool you) and was super easy to find. From the airport to the hotel takes around roughly 30mins which is pretty sweet. Not only that across the road there is a Coles supermarket where you can load up on drinks/snacks and extra food right up until midnight. If you want a bite to eat from outside the hotel there are also plenty of eateries/fast food joints again across the road so it's quite easy to just walk across buy something and head back to the room to relax.  Friday and Saturday nights get pretty loud outside, but you don't really hear much of this from the room (well not from where I was staying anyway).  Good hotel and I would say this is slightly better than the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour.~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_460627476~“New Years Eve in Sydney”~It was one of the thrills of my life to be able to view the Sydney fireworks display from our room on the Holiday Inn Potts Point on New Years Eve, 2016. I made the reservations over six months in advance and the hotel delivered! Or should I say, the fireworks, not just over the Harbour Bridge but also visible in two other locations of Sydney Harbour, were everything I could have imagined.  Location of this hotel is wonderful. Next to Kings Cross subway station, in a neighborhood with a good mix of shops and bars and restaurants, and a longish walk to the Botanic Gardens. Checkin was efficient, the room clean, spacious and with that view! Even if it wasn' t New Years Eve, would stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_460555841~“OK for business”~Stayed here for two nights for business. Check in was relatively painless.  Hotel looks old and tired. Drab hallways lead to a room that is a bit tired.  Good points: * Good iron, not damaged, with no burn marks on the bottom * Bathroom had a good shower head (handle type) with lots of pressure * Pillow selection, between firm and medium pillows * Pretty quiet room * TV setup was good (almost a smart TV). Not so good * Not a dedicated shower; standing in the bathtub * Just a bit old and dated * standard Australian approach to coffee (instant and a kettle). Not a bad location; very close to the train station and the main strip in the Cross, but far enough off it that you don't get a lot of street noise.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan

review_456659255~“Overall impression: hotel, area, position”~Hotel : Staff pleasant and helpful. Breakfast which was included in price was good - no complaints here. Room was pleasant. Did not have nice fresh odour in long corridor to room and felt the carpets should be replaced. Positioned close to Kings Cross Station but you do need to change stations if you want to go to the harbour. Vicinity: Lots of places where one can eat/take away but being pretty fussy, I like eateries to look clean so not really impressed. The area looked shabby, fair amount of litter, several adult entertainment places which is not my scene. I did not feel unsafe but I certainly did not feel comfortable in the area. All in all I felt the hotel and area was average. The hotel decor did not strike me as either modern or old. I think I would choose a hotel closer to the harbour if I ever went back to Sydney. Australia is summer is terribly hot and if I ever went to Oz again it would not be during summer.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

It was a very nice 25 minute or so walk to Circular Quay, the Sydney Opera House, etc. My room was a good size and clean...coffee and tea provided plus a small fridge that I used to hold drinks, etc. The staff...with very special "thanks" to Jessica...was the nicest staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in.

After checking in and all, we ventured out to find some dinner and found everything closed. And the street we ventured out on had nothing but strip clubs so that was a shocker too. Not a good location if you are planning to stay with kids and families. The hotel staff and service was very good though - helpful and accommodating. But the room was small and seemed bare even though it had all the amenities.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~3~4~nan

Hotel itself could do with a facelift we had a few maintenance issues, which staff were so happy to help with. Staff were so friendly and helpful with a specific shout out to Edzar in the restaurant, Zac on security and Jess on reception who all went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454207475~“Good location, but stale interior.”~Stayed there 4 nights last week. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Restaurant seemed to offer reasonable value, although breakfast at a "discounted" $23 was expensive. Our room and many of the public areas suffered from tired and stale decor. UK readers will understand when I describe it as like an old style Travelodge. A refurbishment is overdue. Best aspect is that it is only one stop on the rail network from the city centre.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452498074~“New Years visit ”~While the location says Potts point, it is right in the heart of kings cross right near the huge coke sign  But do t be perturbed by this location  It was clean safe quiet and completely met our needs for a New Years on the naval base a half hour walk down the hill  Hotel staff were excellent  We had booked three rooms to accommodate 2 couples and three single and the booking was handled perfectly  Break fast was good Lunch at pub next door was terrific  Plenty of transportation options being literally on top of the station and cabs plentiful outside the door  Was very pleased overall~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452230849~“great hotel, brilliant receptionist”~I would have rated this hotel a 4 except for one thing that made it stand out more than most other hotels in its range. The receptionist Emily is just brilliant, she is so helpful and friendly and she made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, from checking us in early and arranging a room with a view and her efficient dealing with our checkout. OK the room was comfortable and clean with a good amount of space, had everything required of a 4 star hotel and an amazing view towards the harbour and bridge,was vert quiet and had a good bathroom. breakfast was included in our rate and was very good. 2 issues I did have that did not alter our enjoyment of the stay are the high security deposit if you do not use a credit card, this was higher than any other hotel I have stayed at, and some carpet and wall damage in the 8th floor corridor leading to our room. but the great service from Emily made up for any shortcomings at the hotel. We both enjoyed our stay at this Holiday Inn and consider it to be great value for what you get~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_451320792~“Little nervous about location”~This was my first hotel on a 42-day trip down under. There are amazing stories to tell about most of my experience with hotels and other actives. So, look to more reviews as I post them for some great tips. The Holiday Inn Potts Point is in a good location intown. I spent two nights there in early December 2016. It is close to the Hop on Hop off bus routes. (If you do this do not buy the hop on hop off boat as a joint with the bus ticket. (There are better ways and you will most likely loose the ticket like I did.) Rooms were of good size and very clean. There are no views to look at. Breakfast was what you would expect from a buffet. Dinning around the hotel is limited but make a point of walking down hill for restaurants as if you walk uphill you will enter the red-light district. I do not recommend doing this at night. However, I would stay there again as I thought the staff was very helpful and friendly. They even stored some luggage for 10 days as I did some additional touring in the country. (Look for off to Ayers Rock).  Airport advice, you do need to look for the shuttle service from the airport. We made the mistake of taking a taxi and the cost was $56.00 one way. The shuttle is only $35.00. Now I am talking Australian dollars. I am from the good old USA and the exchange rate in December 2016 was about $1.22 Australian dollars for one American dollar. Stay away from the exchange cashiers as they will only give you $.80 cents. I am a big fan of ATM Machines as I get excellent rates from my bank. Taxies are a very necessary form of transportation in Sydney as there is a lot to do. I spent 8 days off and on in Sydney during this trip and spent about $400.00 on taxies alone. Be prepared I say. Next review Desert Gardens Novotel Hotel in Ayers Rock.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_451039669~“Great find only minutes from the centre”~I stayed at the property over the New Year period. The hotel is easy to find, directly outside the Kings Cross Station. The area does look seedy, with some adult shops and venues along the street, however I felt completely safe walking around alone. The train is only 2 minutes into Martin Place, and I walked there in 15 minutes, so this was a great alternative to the high-priced city prices. It's also only 10 minutes on the train to Bondi Junction. I arrived late, and was given a warm welcome, and a room on the 7th floor. I initially had a view of the street, and on my last night I moved to a harbour view room - definitely book the 'King Harbour View' for amazing views across to the bridge and the opera house. Lizzie was incredibly helpful throughout my stay, and there was a nice touch of a bottle of bubble on NYE provided to guests. I will definitely stay here again. This was a great-priced, well-located, friendly hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_450957177~“Good value for money”~Stayed there for 5 nights between Christmas and New Year. Had standard room with Harbor Bridge view - wow, what a view! Room was clean, had everything we needed. Bed could be bit bigger.  They have really great breakfast, all that you might need.  The situation is very close to main sights, train station is next. Line to Bondi Junction and in 30 minutes you are in the beach.  Recommend!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_450600261~“Xmas and New Year”~We stayed here over the Christmas and New Year with our two boys. Staff professional and friendly. Rooms clean tidy and more spacious than the UK in similar places. Clean and good sized gym. Really well placed and next to the metro so easy to get around abs get to the central station or city centre. Reasonable walk / run to the botanic gardens and the Opera House so happy with location. Manager left a bottle of bubbly in the room to celebrate NYE. Nice touch. Would recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450394357~“Great central hotel”~We stayed at the holiday Inn for 3 nights from in December, 2016. It is a good central location, rooms were clean and the bed really comfortable. Exceptionally good breakfast each morning and very pleasant staff.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_449633732~“great location”~This hotel is in a central location on the hop on hop off route. The light rail station is right outside the front door. The room was very comfortable with wi-fi. We were near shopping and restaurants. I would stay here again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_448714170~“HARBOUR BRIDGE VIEWS FOR UNDER $300 PER NIGHT”~Where can you find comfortable, high quality accommodation in the heart of Sydney for under $300 per night, just a few days prior to Christmas ? My wife, and two children, 12 and 11, recently enjoyed a short stay at the Holiday Inn Potts Point on the eve of Christmas, on the edge of the infamous Kings Cross red light district hotel. We would certainly stay there again.   Stepping into the foyer, Sydney’s chaos and tumult quickly melts away, replaced by peaceful; sanctuary.  After a three hour drive from Canberra, including an inadvertent wrong way turn into the Victoria Street exit onto Oxford Street, we managed to find our way to the hotel and some guidance to the hotel’s underground carpark. Taking the life to the foyer and laden with bags, we were greeted by friendly staff who made us feel instantly welcome and explained all the features of the hotel. Taking the lift to our room we were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space afforded, with a sizeable living area and two queen sized beds, plenty of space for two active kids and two adults and certainly much more than afforded by a standard hotel room. The room was easily the equivalent in dimension of a two room apartment. Over the past two years we have done a lot of travelling and had experienced a range of hotel and self-service apartments but for affordable comfort this was as good as any. During our stay we did a number of longer walks around the city and it was always a relief to get back to our room and have enough space to relax, especially for two exhausted children. The mark of a hotel is whether it feels like a home away from home. In the mornings, the Sirrocco restaurant provided a delicious buffet smorgasbord of hot food as well as typical continental fare and the chef would cheerfully prepare an omelette or scrambled eggs on demand. Our kids were even able to enjoy their favourite Chinese pork buns, making breakfast one of the highlights of the day. However, the main feature of the accommodation was arguably not the room itself, but the view across to the city and the Harbour Bridge, especially captivating at night with the city lights glowing across the skyline.  We would highly recommend Holiday Inn Potts Point to visitors to Sydney looking for affordable and convenient accommodation where guests are treated with courtesy.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
