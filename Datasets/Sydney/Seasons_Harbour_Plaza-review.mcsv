review_479044108~“i dont think its a 4 star hotel”~Below the belt, the interior furniture I really liked and the mattress is really good and comfortable. Otherwise don't be fooled by the posh looking main entrance. The Rooms are basic and bathrooms are outdated. The toilet is squished between the shower and the wall. Their is a tv and dvd player which is handy. The hallways are old and the parking underneath is horrible to navigate and scary. I would say its a 3 star hotel, their is no food facility's no room service.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478746423~“Spacious Apartment”~We stayed for 5 nights. Excellent location, 5 minutes walk to Darling harbour. Having read reviews prior to our trip we were worried about the level of cleanliness we might find. We were pleased to find our apartment was clean and tidy. The fridge had been switched off and ice had melted onto the floor we mopped up with a towel which was quickly replaced by Housekeeping. We didn't cook during our stay but there was a fully equipped kitchen if we had wanted to. The bedroom area has a large bed and lots of storage space. It was great to have washing machine and dryer because we had been travelling a week prior to our arrival. So cold Prossecco in the fridge TV on to catch the news feet up on the sofa whilst the laundry was done.  Good nights sleep in the very comfortable bed ready for a day of sight seeing.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~4~nan
review_477868251~“Weekend getaway”~Loved the apartment, really convenient for Darling Harbour, King St Wharf, Cocckle Bay & the CBD. Great amenities & staff really helpful. Walking distance go theatres, restaurants. Comfortable bed, great having separate living area.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_476634936~“Bad , dirty, not recommended”~We decided to stay with the hotel on Thursday 13th April to Saturday 15th April and was shocked at the condition of the room.  Although we only live fifteen minutes from the city, we decided last minute to have a romantic getaway unfortunately it was far from romantic.  To begin with the room Was very dark, smelt musty and unused. The cleanliness of the bathroom looked like it had been forgotten from shower tiles with dark marks. Dirty mirror and even floor had large amounts of muck (see attached).,  I mentioned it to reception and was advised it was the only room they had and we're fully booked and unfortunately couldn't do anything.  Since it was now late as we went out straight after checking. We stayed the eve since we had played both nights.  Friday morning we had a swim. I made breakfast and we found out both drier and dishwasher didn't work even once turned on. At the wall.  Also both mornings woken up early with the loud slamming of the laundry shoot directly against our rooms wall. There was also broken sliding door, marks in bathroom and a solid uncomfy bed. On top of countless times the room card kept stopping. Then connection door 703 and 705 locked so reception had to unlock with metal key In the end after another bad nights sleep and a early wake up. We checked out at 610am today and headed home, more tired than we came. I have worked in hotels in the past and understand rooms may not be used for a while. But cleanliness and everything no Matter the star rating should always be priority. Plus I found alternative rooms via online sites even though reception had advised fully booked. I wouldn't recommend staying at this place, as both staff and facilities were unhelpful~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~2~nan
review_471457496~“Nice place, horrible customer service”~Trying to make an online booking, TWO rooms for a single date, Site required the rooms to be booked separately. The site kept changed the date on the second booking, which I noticed when pushing the "book" button. Phoned hotel to try to fix the booking, but after half an hour of TRYING, hotel refused to change booking from 1 room on the 19th, one room on the 20th to 2 rooms on the 20th. As I had pre-paid, this has meant a significant financial loss and I am disgusted.~1~nan~nan~3~nan~3~1~nan
review_471339075~“Best Customer Service”~My friend and I came to Sydney for a work conference that was dedicated around customer service. Whilst staying at the Seasons we experienced amazing customer service from all the staff, but would love to give a extraordinary shout out to Kieran, he has made us feel very welcomed and has made our stay very enjoyable. We will definitely be back and will be spreading the word about our experience at the Seasons.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470178397~“Wonderful ”~After being messed about by our travel agent we were apprehensive to say the least about coming here. Thankfully we were really pleased as soon as we walked through the door. Staff member Kieran was helpful and happy and checked us in quickly which was good after 24 hours in the air. 1 bedrooms apartment was spacious and really clean. Great location 5 mins from darling harbour were lots of things going on. Pool wasn't that inviting - need something in there to help u relax like a few lounge chairs. Only critique was the construction outside my window everyday noise starting @7.30am but we were out most of the day so wasn't much of a hinderance. Would like to thank Jandro, Pasceli, David and any other member of staff that helped us during our 4 days at this lovely hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469315337~“Excellent Staff & Spacious Rooms”~I stay at Seasons Harbour Plaza whenever I travel to Sydney for work, and everytime the staff are exceptional. Kieran especially goes above beyond, always finding the best restaurants nearby based on what cuisine I feel like eating, and making me feel like my needs are the hotel's top priority. The rooms are spacious with a good sized kitchen, even for the double rooms, and the bedrooms are equipped with fully length mirrors. The hotel is in a prime location, less than five minutes to Darling Harbour and a 20 min walk to the Opera House. Good value for money.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469008726~“Close to darling harbour!”~We stayed here for a three nights after a two week cruise. Staff let us check in and leave our bags at the reception until 2pm, we got back about 1:30pm and our room was ready. First glance of the room looks very nice and clean, however the appliances were older when we went to use them which let the modern look of the room down. a few general cleanliness minor issues like soap scum on soap rails and buildup on tiles, didn't know there was construction next door so it was very loud. Some of the cutlery and crockery was a bit dirty so we did wash it in the dishwasher before using.  Our air conditioning was not working and it was very hot and humid in our room. We eventually got a portable fan air conditioner delivered to the room and were told a mechanic would look at the air con the next day. When we got back from our day trip the air con wasn't fixed and were told they are full so couldn't move us to another room. I got very sick that night and the ambulance took me to hospital, on return the man at the counter promised us a new room first thing in the morning, which we got and the air con was great. Thankyou to the man behind the counter who raced outside and got me a taxi to go back to hospital the next day and for extending our checkout to 12pm.  Overall a good stay close to everything in the city and nice rooms and staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468695187~“Perfect location and super friendly staff”~Stayed here on Thursday and Friday night. Couldn't fault the front desk staff. Keiran went over and beyond to help us when we had a booking stuff up (not the hotels fault) Kieran went over and beyond to try and assist us so we were able to stay together and have the girls weekend we had hoped for. We were always met with smiles and a welcoming vibe. Keeping our bags with them whilst we wandered the city on the final day wasn't an issue. You are a stones throw from Darling Harbour, which means you have a tonne of things to do and wont be short on good places to eat. A few minutes walk to Pitt St mall and a perfect location to stay if you have an event on at the new ICC. Would definitely recommend to friends and family and will definitely be back for our event next year! The room was spotless and a good size. Thanks team at Seasons for a very enjoyable stay!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468390001~“Seasons Harbour Plaza”~The hotel was reasonably comfortable but the cleanliness left something to be desired. The general decor needs an uplift it is old and dated. The laundry drains were blocked and smelt disgusting. The staff were very friendly and tried to sought out the issue. Overpriced~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468196603~“location, location' location”~Stayed here for 1 night. Location is perfect for darling harbour and the city. The room was good, maybe some updating for the bathroom needed in the future but thats all. Friendly staff. Good value for your money.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_468003068~“Overnight stay - suprise”~Stayed overnight in a large full amenity apartment, thinking i had booed a hotel. The single bedroom apartment had a separate living area with tv's in both bedroom & lounge, a fully equipped kitchen, a large bathroom with both a shower & separate spa bath. Good number of towels & bath products. Room was airconditioned, as well as glass doors which could be opened in both lounge & bedroom. Good hotel facilities with pool & gym. The check in process was slow which wasn't a great start but checkout was quick. Good location near Chinatown, ferries, rail, buses but easy walk to tourist areas. Lots or restaurants & bars close by.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_467902739~“Very tired and in poor repair”~Booked into this "hotel" early (at 9.30) left bag with reception as room not ready (book in at 14.00) no problems, came back at 19.00, found my bag behind reception (obviously no bag holding facilities), got into room and very hot, turn on air con and when out for quick dinner, came back about 1 hour later and still hot room, no air coming from vents. rang "9" for reception, phone rang out , dialed "6" for service staff, phone answered by duty manager. he cam up and reset air con no change, said leave main door open to get a breeze, he then got a fan for me, left window open for cool air and very noisy, traffic and building. Manager said he would change the room if the maintenance people could not fix the air con, he also stated that he would ring if could not fix, got back to room next night air con still broken and fridge had defrosted, water leaking from fridge. Toilet also required maintenance as was leaking. Checked out and requested discount and feedback form, was told by duty manager no forms as they are in rooms (no they are not in my room), and in other storage room, not at reception. he would look into discount. Lifts have graffiti in them covered up by message boards. very old tired hotel demanding high dollar value. It think it is owned by Basil Fawlty.!! Good luck to those whom venture into this hotel, you must have low expectations~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~2~nan
review_466365020~“Absolutely wonderful!”~We had a fantastic stay with Seasons Harbour Plaza. The staff were exceptionally friendly and very attentive. The location was great - very close to the Town Hall, Darling Harbour, City Centre etc. The rooms were more than I imagined with a kitchenette, laundry amenities and spacious rooms. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and would not hesitate to stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_465713271~“Great stay”~Very Nice apartment, kitchen, diner, living room and separate bedroom. Very clean, balcony with a view towards cockleshell quay, slap bang in the centre of all the tourist sites, everything easily walkable. Reception staff were brilliant, really helpful and polite. Would stay here again and recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465671029~“Disappointing”~Checking in didn't take too long but I was referred to a notice on the counter and asked to sign that if the Fire Brigade was called due to the fire alarm in my room being actified I would pay $1,600. There was also a notice in the room which in red lettering started "WARNING Read this before Cooking" It went on to say that steam and smoke should be kept to a minimum, that it is important food in the microwave should not burn and the bathroom door must be kept closed when showering as steam could activate the smoke alarm. This left me nervous of even using the kettle and we avoided any cooking and ate out. The main room was quite large but not clean. The sofa was badly stained and in an odd position for watching television. The work surfaces in the kitchen area were greasy as were the door handles - we ended up cleaning the kitchen and bathroom using sani wipes which picked up a lot of muck as evidence . I mentioned this to Reception who apologised but said it was because the Housekeepoers were contracted. No excuse! There was the barest minimum mismatched crockery and limited cutlery of poor quality. Only one saucepan was supplied which didn't look clean. There was an old plastic chopping board, aghain not clean. A sachet of dish washing liquid was supplied but no laundry powder. This was available to buy at Reception.The washing machine and dryer were in a cupboard. We found the lint filter for the dryer thick with fluff on top of the washing machine! The shower room was a reasonable size and toiletries were supplied though these weren't replaced regularly. There was no available space to put clothes to keep them dry. Hot water was plentiful but the shower door didn't close properly. The wash basin was without a plug, in fact there were three sinks / washbasins in the apartment and none of them had a plug. We asked twice for a plug and eventually we were given one that didn't fit any of the sinks so we improvised. There were various notices and requests around the Hotel and apartment one of which said they value the environment, saving water/energy etc. Using a sink without a plug wastes water! The bedroom area was roomy and the bed was large and reasonably comfortable. However the mattress had no cover other than the very thin sheet which didn't fit very well so it rucked up in the night leaving us sleeping immediately on the mattress. Bed making was very hit and miss. Twice we pulled back the covers to get into bed only to find the bottom sheet as we had left it in the morning no attempt having been made to smooth it. It was supposed to be a serviced apartment. On two occasions we had to request supplies of tea and coffee from reception as Housekeeping had failed to top them up. There was a good size wardrobe with just six hangers for two of us. There was an iron and ironing board. It was necessary to use a towel on the board as there was no padding. The lack of cleaning was our main concern. To save space in my suitcase when travelling, where slippers aren't supplied by the Hotel, I wear a pair of socks. On this occasion, the bottom of my socks were so filthy from the unclean carpet and floors, I ended up throwing them away. The hotel is about five minutes walk through to Darling Harbour and though situated close to a busy junction, we didn't find it to be terribly noisy. The Reception Staff were helpful and friendly. This is very much a low budget hotel but we certainly didn't pay budget hotel prices.On our last day, as we had a late flight, we were offered the use of the Swimming Pool shower. This area also needed a thorough clean. I wouldn't use this Hotel again and couldn't recommend it.~2~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_463939288~“Excellent situation, it also has kitchen and very comfortable and big rooms”~Excellent situation, very close to the Town Hall, Opera, Sea Life... Room is very big, has good sights and it also has a kitchen, highly recommended due to high prices of restaurants in Sydney. Very close there are some supermarkets. It doesn't have soap for washing dishes pills, neigher any lighter or matches to start fire. Bathroom has hydro-massage bathtub and separated, a shower. It also has a room with sofa, what a comfortable room! I recommend so much, I'll repeat if it's possible to me.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan
review_463310099~“close to harbour”~As others have stated, the AC was a concern. We didn't have any the first night and then were moved to another room where the AC worked, sort of!!

review_458589516~“Brilliant hotle for the price - spacious and qell-equipped”~We stayed here for 3 nights on the 7th floor. I was impressed with the space and the layout as I walked into the room. There's a small living room and a bedroom separated by two sliding doors. One of these doors' rollers was broken and didn't slide. The living room area has a couple of small tables, TV and couch. In the bathroom, which again was a good size is a tucked-away drier and washing machine. The hotel sells small packets of powder so you don't need to go out an buy a whole. The bed actually fairly comfortable but the sheets didn't stay tuicked under the mattress and kept riding up. We had a north-facing room - there's a balcony but it's so small it's really of no use. That's not a real concern though. We oversaw an empty lot with construction taking place but the noise was not noticeable. Traffic and street noise was also of no concern. The staff were pretty friendly and helpful when I had to check in before my partner, who booked the room, arrived. No dramas. There were some issues - the hallways smell a little but the room itself did not. Some of the fitting are little loose such as the soap holder in the shower. Some fittings that are no longer there still had screw holes in place. The elevator lobby is little small. The aircon works but it takes a while to kick in. It seems to reset back to 23°C when you power the room back up with the card key so knock it down a notch or two. It did cope with the recent 40°C days though. Overall, it was like a home away from home and in a great location. You can catch the M50 bus just on the corner to get to Central Station~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_457759921~“Awesome Sydney stay!”~My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying 2 days/2 nights in Sydney prior to embarking on a cruise to New Zealand. We stayed at the Seasons Harbour Plaza in Sussex Street. The location is fantastic; being 5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour and right in the heart of Sydney. The front desk staff were wonderful, and helpful; particularly Keiran who could not have been more helpful or obliging.  Would highly recommend to all familues, singles, anyone.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457227110~“Good location but tired”~Well located a couple of blocks from Town Hall Station and QVB, also near Darling Harbour. However the building is ill prepared to serve as a modern hotel. Positioned over a busy intersection with motorway on-ramp, I found the room noisy, the aircon not very good, corridor narrow with stiff door. Bathroom / laundry was narrow, with little room on the vanity basin surrounds.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_456323455~“Needs Condeming”~We booked this hotel as last two nights visiting family in Australia after three wonderful weeks staying in Nosa, Gold Coast, Byron etc. We booked a room with 3 bedrooms for 6 people. Got a phone call saying it would change to a 1 bed room and a 2 bed room as aircon not working. Check-in was at 2. We arrived at 4 and rooms not ready. When we got into the 2 bed room we could not believe the filth. The kitchen area smelled awful. The washing machine stank as if something had died in it. We opened the cupboard to get a glass out. The smell of all the glasses was disgusting. They had not been washed. I tried to put dishwasher on to clean them. The door was hanging off and started to leak water all over the floor!! The utensils had dried food on them. The shower and bath we thick with soap scum and dead skin. We tried to call reception but the phone didn't work. Eventually we cleaner was sent up. We could not believe it when his cleaning kit consisted of a bowl with white cloths some watered down bleach and a TOILET BRUSH!!!! When we asked him about it whilst cleaning the bathrooms he explained that he does bleach it!!!! He then came into the kitchen and washed the glasses under the cold tap with his fingers. We asked him to leave it. The manager came up with a bottle of wine. We explained this def wasn't going to cut it. We demanded a refund.  This hotel is in serious danger of cross contamination using cloths to wipe surfaces with a cloth sitting in a bowl next to a TOILET BRUSH. Avoid like the plague. It is the worst place EVER!!!! We booked into Novotel Darling Harbour. Beautiful and cheaper.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455933518~“Dated and needs a revamp.”~Hmm. Can only say this hotel was ok at best. Not the best rooms and while the location is good not much else to like here. The breakfast next door is awesome and you get a discount. Just come out and turn left. It's right there. Good tea and coffee in the rooms and plenty of cooking facilities in the room. Would not stay here though. Much better places for similar price point.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455752394~“Great location but disappointing experience”~We arrived shortly before check-in time and there was only one person working the reception. A number of people had arrived early and left their bags and so this one girl was checking in and sorting out baggage. There was another staff in a back room helping with bags. After about 15 minutes I finally got to the head of the line and the second staff member come out to assist with check in. He left me standing there and called the people behind me and served them ahead of me. Not a good start.  We went up to our room on the second floor, the rollaway was there for our son however no pillow, no towel and only enough cutlery, crockery, and glass wear for two people. I called down and they brought up a pillow, towel and a knife, fork and spoon. I went in to use the bath prior to going out and there was no plug so I rang down again and they brought up a plug, however when I went to run the bath there was no waste in the bath just the raw edge of the bath tub and the plumbing below. The toiletries were used and the bathroom not very clean. On a positive note the room was adequate and quiet, and the bed comfortable and check out quick and easy. The location is very good and the young woman who was working on reception who checked us in and out was very pleasant.  It may have been a series of unfortunate events, however it has coloured my experience and I would not stay here again. I felt that it was expensive given the issues.~3~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_454607593~“Great Location ”~Easy walk to Darling Harbour or into the city. Room that we had was on 3rd floor so no views. A quiet hotel with friendly staff also had a kitchenette. The cafe next door offered 15% off to guests and had fab food and coffee.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452912807~“Standard accommodation in CBD for business trips”~I didn't find any item to mention as great for this place. But again, nothing was too bad also. Room with decent size, proper cleanliness and with required amenities. However, everything everywhere had clear sign of age. This hotel can really do something with renovation. Those fitted microwave models are from so early era...~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_452569654~“Listen to the reviews...aircon dosn't work!”~I cant say I wasnt forewarned...Id read the reviews from others, complaining about aircon not working properly. But as the location was perfect I thought Id risk it. I emailed the hotel prior to arrival and specifically requested a room with efficient aircon, even told them Id see bad reviews so didnt want to have the same bad experience! Upon checkin I once again asked the young lady for a room with working aircon as I dont cope well with heat. She assured me this one as ok. WELL IT WASNT. We had to ask for a fan just to survive. On top of that, as others have said before, the shower was NOT CLEAN and mould/mildew was covering all of the grout...quite disgusting and such a shame. If these things had been fine, the room would have been perfect for our 3 night stay!! Building work next door was only heard on one of our mornings, as we were up and out early on the other days. Sorry, wont be back!~2~nan~5~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_451834667~“Disappointing service from management”~This apartment hotel is very well situated. The apartment was refurbished with good linen, comfortable bed and good carpet and curtains. It was let down a little in the bathroom where there was mould in the bottom of the shower stall, although everything else was fine. This was apart from a very poor air conditioning system which was set at 18, but as elevator conversations with other guests attested felt more like 25 degrees. It also had a brand new television which had not been tuned in and wouldn't work with on screen instructions written in French. For 3 days we tried to get it sorted, missing out on a range of important cricket matches, the news etc and the ability to relax. The weather was very hot and so we spent afternoons in the room with nothing to watch. The second day we were told it was fixed but it showed only Channel 7. We were told that all the rooms were like that! We finally, after much frustration and searching Google tuned it in ourselves. Apart from this frustration each day, the most disappointing aspect was that at no time did the hotel staff apologise. This continued to be a pattern when we had no towels left after servicing and I had to go to the desk to get them. No apology! It further continued when on returning close to midnight one night we found that our room key did not work. My husband had to go down to have it recalibrated. No apology! When we then went to access the safe, we had been locked out of it as well. We called down to get someone to open it and there was a long delay before it was also recalibrated. This took away much of the joy of a great night out and meant we had a much later night than we should. Once again, no apology! On check out there was no interest in whether we had enjoyed our stay. The staff on the ground were very pleasant, but management certainly could improve their attitude to paying guests.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451241091~“Good location”~The room was very spacious and clean. We had an outlook over to Darling Harbour except there are hotels that spoil your view! It is very clean, towels get changed every day. Roll up bed is not the most comfortable, but it fits in the room fine and di the job. There is a small kitchen with everything you need, tea and coffee gets replaced. It is a great location, just 5 minutes walk to darling harbour and easy walking distance from the rocks, circular quay, etc. Their air conditioning system needs a bit of attention but our problem with it was soon sorted. The staff are very friendly, The two staff on duty on 27th December in the evening were most helpful to us. We were in a room about half way up the hotel, so didnt hear much street noise, apart from motorbikes which there seem to be a lot of around. It is in a main street so there is a lot of traffic going by but it did not disturb our sleep. A great stay.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_450342630~“Sydneys 3 day adventure”~Great place, deluxe room with all amenities. Stayed 2 nights,Great staff especially Kieran. Having your own kitchen and a laundry within the room made it a nice experience. Mini bar fully stacked but if you wanted more you were able to walk down to the supermarket (down the road approx. 100 meters) and purchase items to take back to the room. Very close to Darling harbour complexes, and 20 min walk to Sydney harbour bridge and opera house.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_450248962~“Unhappy 2017 New Years Eve Price Gouge”~Yes it was New Years eve and even booking in October we thought we might find something so that an item on the bucket list (New Years Eve in Sydney) could be ticked off. So after a lot of searching for somewhere close to the action all we could find was this place. After paying in excess of $1200 for the experience of one night here we were extremely disappointed in being assigned a room on the 2nd floor with, a broken card socket which enables the electricity to flow (managed to fix by putting in 4 of my own cards),a broken sliding door, a dirty shower with minimal hotwater flow as well as misplaced tiles. Stay here again? as the saying goes, Once bitten twice shy.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~4~nan
