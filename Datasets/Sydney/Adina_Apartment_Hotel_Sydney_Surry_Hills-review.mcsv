review_478921644~“Fabulous Stay”~Lovely apartments spacious, very clean, and very friendly staff. A real pleasure to stay here. We stayed two weeks here and it could not be faulted, for the service and cleanliness. The location is also excellent for exploring the city~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478686054~“Fix the keycards in the lifts”~Fix the keycards in the lifts. Room was excellent. Reception staff very very good.  Location of property is perfect. Beds and bedding is excellent.  Decor is fine, rooms are clean.  Sometimes tea bags are not stocked and the teacups are too small. But it's the keycards in the lifts that are a serious fault of the property. ~4~3~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476684005~“Great apartment, too area!”~Great family apartment, fantastic area however a bit noisy of an evening. Rooms are so clean and fresh and parking on site. Rooms have just been refurbished so very comfortable and no old smells. Pool was great too.~5~4~4~4~5~5~4~nan
review_476025584~“Not up to standard for 4 star hotel”~My wife and I booked in for one night in Room 601 which overlooks the street. The staff are friendly and efficient on book in and out. The room was not of a suitable standard for a supposedly 4 star hotel. The room had long black strands of hair on the bath and sink; mould in the bath grouting; the bedroom A/C was extremely noisy with no battery cover on the remote; the fridge door seal was broken and ripped away from the door causing condensation in the fridge with water dripping inside; the lounge had a strong mouldy or cigarette smell; from a locked adjoining room, which gave my wife a headache and a large patch of paint stripped from the lounge room wall behind the curtains. The swipe card system is intermittent which makes using the lifts or unlocking the room door frustrating. We cannot comment on the more expensive rooms but for the price and supposed reputation, this is a hotel we do not recommend.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~1~4~nan
review_476022608~“Amazing location”~This apartment hotel is in the best location - the heart of Surry Hills close to the city and great restaurants, Oxford St etc. The hotel needs some maintenance- the rooms are really stale smelling, even with the doors open all day. TV only played ABC. Bathroom was pretty stained and icky in spots. The daily room servicing wasn't every day and on some days they just changed the towels and remade the bed. The lifts feel like they're going to break down any minute too. For the good stuff - pool was great, staff were friendly and Bill's is on the ground floor. Everything is on your doorstep here. Would definitely return to the hotel after its had a refurb.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475463785~“Holiday with grandchildren”~The apartments are very spacious, perfect for a family.

We have stayed here before and will return.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474777768~“My Work Trip Stay”~Recently stayed at the Adina apartments due to work. Stayed here for several weeks and would really struggle to find things to complain about. The apartment was cleaned daily and the staff are very friendly. They would always greet you and always had time if you had any questions.  Each room had two bedrooms and two bathrooms, some had ensuite's and from what I could tell most had balconies. I was on the 6th floor and had a great view of the city. Each bedroom has its own TV and Air Con unit, the bathrooms were a little tired but they did the job. The kitchen has a fridge, microwave, dishwasher, oven and stove top. There was also utensils, pots and pans. The fry pan was well used but because I was there for a while, I ended up going to the local Woolworths and buying another one. Dishwashing liquid and sponges were supplied. A washing machine and dryer was also in each room, and washing powder sachets were provided. Overall the room was comfortable with a couch and dining table but a little maintenance was required in the room I was staying in. Some power points were loose and the rangehood above the stove was broken. These did not make my stay in anyway uncomfortable. There is a small gym but the equipment is quite old. There is also a pool, spa and sauna but I never used those, so can't really comment on them. On Crown street there is many choices for places to eat. Pubs and restaurants are all a short walk from the apartments and there is a fantastic gelato place, only a few minutes away. A 10 minute walk to the local Woolworths and about a 20 minute walk to Coles. The city centre is about a 25 minute walk and Central train station is about 10-15 minute walk. Be mindful, the walk back from Central station to the apartments has the most steepest hills you probably have ever walked up in your life. Overall the Adina apartments was a nice place to stay, with everything you need in walking distance. Happy to stay here again next time I am in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_474378654~“Adina”~Very lovely staff for check in and check out, easy booking, good value, beautiful spacious room with everything you need, comfy beds, very close to city, restaurants and where we were going for work.

review_474253121~“Dirty and disappointing”~Rule # 2 in hotels is to not let it be obvious to new guests that thousands of strangers have also stayed in the room before you (Rule # 1 is comfortable beds, which they are).  Adina failed badly on this in our 2 bedroom, 2 bath room-the toilet bowl was dirty, the other toilet bowl had a used cake of soap in it, and the sink taps had a grime build up and sink drain was full of 'gunk', the lounges had water marks on them .....disgusting and not of the calibre expected of an establishment like this. I knew we were not the first people in this hotel room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fail!~2~nan~4~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_473533381~“Clean and comfortable!”~Great room with a beautiful view. Clean pool and good gym facilities. Very handy location close to lots of restuarants, bars, shops and cafes. Is an older hotel so needs updating in a few areas - but overall was great.~4~3~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_472778770~“Needs some maintenance”~Starting to show signs of neglect with regard to repairs and maintenance.

review_472519221~“Great experience”~Great sized room with well equipped kitchen. Friendly staff.  Would caution guests with mobile children due to opening windows above the couch and accessible balcony door. The toy box was a great touch, and made the stay more enjoyable.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472503623~“Great rooms, bathrooms need to be updated”~The good: - Rooms are great and spacious.  - The location is pretty awesome as you are in the heart of Surry Hills. The bad: - The bathrooms are old, sometimes leaking and with low water pressure. This would be fine in a cheap hotel but not at Adina. - I come to Sydney often and my flight always land early in the morning. I request early check-in and was never able to check-in early at Adina's. I stayed at the Meriton and the Old Clare where they were always able to find me a room when arriving early. ~3~3~5~4~4~3~4~nan

review_471263835~“Great Facility in Heart of Exciting Surry Hills”~This was a return visit for us for an extended stay (10 weeks) during the North American winter. The Adina is a fully serviced apartment hotel with first-rate facilities and service located in gentrifying Surry Hills with its shops and varied cafes, restaurants and night life. Moore Park, where the Sydney Cricket Grounds and Allianz Stadium are located, is only a 15-20 minute walk away. The Central Business District is a short bus ride or 30 minute or so walk. Central Rail Station is also close by. The Adina is very well run with a friendly and responsive staff. In sum, the Adina on Crown is a great base for exploring and experiencing Sydney.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_470175758~“very pricy for worn out apartment”~Very over priced for accommodation. Furniture worn, carpet lifted in places (trip hazard), key cards for lifts and rooms dodgy (heaps of people had problems with same). Reception staff very pleasant and helpful. But with $300 + per night, definitely not worth it.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_469248383~“Great stay, central, lots to do.”~Great location for local cafes, restaurants and a lively nighttime scene and also close to town. Great to have a full laundry and kitchen. Very pleasant experience. A bit more cutlery would have been ideal. We had a corner room looking on to the street and it was good. Would perhaps choose city view looking onto pool next time as they get the afternoon sun.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_469076906~“Wedding”~I traveled to Sydney for a wedding however my husband had emergency surgery and was unable to come. The Adina allowed me up to the minute changes and looked after me during my cut short trip. Thanks to all the staff at Surry Hills. Kind Regards Dawn~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468403583~“Business Trip”~Fantastic service from staff. Excellent location with many dining options. Clean and comfy rooms. Let down was wifi and TV/AV.

review_467051909~“Spacious apartment”~The Hotel is conveniently located in Surry Hills, just walking distance to numerous eateries, Centenial park and Oxford St. The apartment was spacious, convenient and clean. I would have appreciated if the bathroom cabinet doors would not have shown stains, but basins and toilet were very clean. Initially the room smelled as if it was an old smoking room, but that was fixed on the next day, when the sofa was replaced. The Adina is undergoing some renovations, replacing furniture. It really made a difference. Service was friendly and prompt. It was perhaps a bit pricy, but ... we are in Sydney ...~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466630564~“Nice and central to Sydney”~Nice place to stay. Overall stay was pleasant. Should have booked City Views. More glasses in cupboard would be good. Need more room in fridge.

review_466380989~“Room 201”~Great location. Excellent customer service. However our room stank. It was so bad we checked out after the 2nd night and went elsewhere. Couldn't work out if it was cigarette smoke or mould. Really bad and the smell got into our clothes etc. The beds could also do with updated and new mattresses. A shame as the location is excellent.~1~3~5~1~1~1~5~nan
review_465957490~“Central & Convenient but need coffee plunger”~Good place to stay central to Sydney. They need to leave more room in the fridge for food etc - so many drinks !

review_465217643~“Very Good Location”~Stayed for 6 nights. 2 adults and 12 year old in a 2 bedroom apartment. Apartment was clean, modern, spacious and well equipped. Great location. Crown Street was a hub for foodies. Lots of different cuisines and cheaper to eat here than in the centre of the city. There is a Coles supermarket about 10 mins walk away, which had everything you needed to self cater. There was also a bottle shop. The train station was about a 10 min walk away, which made it easy to get into the city. We liked the fact the apartment was a little way out from the main city as it gave some tranquility after a busy day sightseeing. There was some noise from Crown Street on Saturday evening but once the doors onto the balcony were shut it did not disturb us. The hotel had an outdoor pool which was great to cool off in and towels were provided. The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful. Thanks for a great stay. We have already recommended to friends and family and will definitely stay again if we return to Sydney.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465188913~“An enjoyable stay.”~Definitely worthy of consideration. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the room size very generous.  The staff were all friendly and welcoming. It's just a short walk to oxford street, and a convenient supermarket nearby.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan

review_463961126~“Good Location”~Right in the heart of Surrey Hills,well taken care of, comfy beds and plenty of space. Staff was good.

Signage for getting into the parking lot prior to registration could be better.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_462850864~“Great location in Surry Hills”~Pluses: We had a 2 bedroom apartment in the hotel. It was comfortable and clean. Probably better than photos. Good space and amenities. Close to facilities in Surry Hills. 'bills' restaurant in same building with celebrity chef. Nice restaurants in area, and local small grocery stores to walk to. Minuses: We were told that wifi was free on check in. But on check out was told it only applied to two devices. We were travelling with teenagers, and had PC's as well as phones. So the charge was a surprise. Also room had some minor maintenance issues such as wobbly tap in Kitchen, a couple of light switches with loose switches. Front staff were not as friendly/attentive as I have come to expect. Overall we would go back again.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_461562999~“need upgrade”~WAs a lovely hotel and stay for business however has recently been going downhill. I believe they are starting to refurbish. I hope so as it is in a great location and suits us for our business trips. Bathrooms mouldy tiles, broken dishwasher, dodgy air con, broken furniture and expensive. I do hope they upgrade as it was a gorgeous hotel so I recommend before you book to ask if it has all been upgraded as it can be fantastic staying here. Staff are very curteous and lovely. Great car parking below and a walk to many eateries etc.~3~2~4~3~2~2~4~nan
review_461270438~“Sneaky Hen's Weekend”~We were very happy with this apartment, all staff were friendly and welcoming. We had two apartments which the staff happily put us near each other on the same floor. Had to print out my reservation for some reason - they would not accept me showing my phone or email reservation, a bit weird considering I booked it online. Black spot with EFTPOS machine at reception, staff had to walk around with the machine over their heads to find a signal - very amusing for us, bit of a let down for staff not having facilities that work easily. A bit weird that our 6th floor windows opened up completely - didn't find that overly safe. Overall, we had a fantastic weekend away. This suburb is very quaint and nice for a little getaway not quite in the city but also close enough to catch an Uber to go out for dinner etc.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_471188526~“Good choice for staying in Surrey Hills”~Very nice apartment, clean, good facilities and well considered. I found everything I could have needed including a washing machine and dryer with complimentary detergent provided. Excellent location.~5~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_470175758~“very pricy for worn out apartment”~Very over priced for accommodation. Furniture worn, carpet lifted in places (trip hazard), key cards for lifts and rooms dodgy (heaps of people had problems with same). Reception staff very pleasant and helpful. But with $300 + per night, definitely not worth it.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_469734405~“Good acommodation”~Everything was OK and as advertised. Good and well maintained accommodation in a very convenient location, comfortable bed and good facilities. While the hotel is in a busy location there is no problem with traffic noise. Very friendly and helpful staff.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_469726114~“Accom”~Tired room, faulty toilet flush, faulty shower head, shower support railing hanging off the wall, generally run down room, disappointing, won't be staying again as rates are not reflective of the room quality~2~1~5~3~1~2~4~nan
review_469248383~“Great stay, central, lots to do.”~Great location for local cafes, restaurants and a lively nighttime scene and also close to town. Great to have a full laundry and kitchen. Very pleasant experience. A bit more cutlery would have been ideal. We had a corner room looking on to the street and it was good. Would perhaps choose city view looking onto pool next time as they get the afternoon sun.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_469076906~“Wedding”~I traveled to Sydney for a wedding however my husband had emergency surgery and was unable to come. The Adina allowed me up to the minute changes and looked after me during my cut short trip. Thanks to all the staff at Surry Hills. Kind Regards Dawn~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468403583~“Business Trip”~Fantastic service from staff. Excellent location with many dining options. Clean and comfy rooms. Let down was wifi and TV/AV. Sydney has had rain/wet weather 19 out of 22 days. If you want to stay inside and do some work or watch something on TV - forget it. Pretty simple fix TFE.~4~3~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_467985842~“Justin Bieber”~We came to Adina Surry Hills to enjoy a night out and to attend the Justin Bieber concert. We were met with a surprise picture of Justin Bieber in our room. This definitely was a fantastic beginning to our night. Thank you to The Hotel Manager Francis and Ruby at the front desk for making this night one to remember!!!! Regards, Beliebers~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467051909~“Spacious apartment”~The Hotel is conveniently located in Surry Hills, just walking distance to numerous eateries, Centenial park and Oxford St. The apartment was spacious, convenient and clean. I would have appreciated if the bathroom cabinet doors would not have shown stains, but basins and toilet were very clean. Initially the room smelled as if it was an old smoking room, but that was fixed on the next day, when the sofa was replaced. The Adina is undergoing some renovations, replacing furniture. It really made a difference. Service was friendly and prompt. It was perhaps a bit pricy, but ... we are in Sydney ...~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466630564~“Nice and central to Sydney”~Nice place to stay. Overall stay was pleasant. Should have booked City Views. More glasses in cupboard would be good. Need more room in fridge. Just need to pay a little more attention to detail when rooms being cleaned and replenish stock.~4~4~4~4~4~3~4~nan
review_466380989~“Room 201”~Great location. Excellent customer service. However our room stank. It was so bad we checked out after the 2nd night and went elsewhere. Couldn't work out if it was cigarette smoke or mould. Really bad and the smell got into our clothes etc. The beds could also do with updated and new mattresses. A shame as the location is excellent.~1~3~5~1~1~1~5~nan
review_465957490~“Central & Convenient but need coffee plunger”~Good place to stay central to Sydney. They need to leave more room in the fridge for food etc - so many drinks ! Also coffee plunger should be supplied. I ask everything I stay then get a cheap one cup one. Not much to ask nor to invest in !~4~3~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_465577590~“Excellent”~Perfect location. Nice rooms. Nice pool and garden. Perfect gym.  Nice and friendly staff. Would like to stay again. Perfect with children. Good size of the room. Lots of nice restaurants close by. Supermarket close by.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465217643~“Very Good Location”~Stayed for 6 nights. 2 adults and 12 year old in a 2 bedroom apartment. Apartment was clean, modern, spacious and well equipped. Great location. Crown Street was a hub for foodies. Lots of different cuisines and cheaper to eat here than in the centre of the city. There is a Coles supermarket about 10 mins walk away, which had everything you needed to self cater. There was also a bottle shop. The train station was about a 10 min walk away, which made it easy to get into the city. We liked the fact the apartment was a little way out from the main city as it gave some tranquility after a busy day sightseeing. There was some noise from Crown Street on Saturday evening but once the doors onto the balcony were shut it did not disturb us. The hotel had an outdoor pool which was great to cool off in and towels were provided. The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful. Thanks for a great stay. We have already recommended to friends and family and will definitely stay again if we return to Sydney.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465188913~“An enjoyable stay.”~Definitely worthy of consideration. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the room size very generous.  The staff were all friendly and welcoming. It's just a short walk to oxford street, and a convenient supermarket nearby.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_465187125~“Mardi Gras”~Perfect place to stay for Mardi Gras. Easy walking to Oxford st and parade viewing areas. Loads of great restaurants in walking distance catering for al $$ and cuisine. Easy parking. Very polite and helpful staff.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464606165~“Regular business stays”~I stay here while I run a course at the hotel every year and my experience has always been very positive. The staff are very responsive to requests and the facilities are great. The catering on the program is always superb. The hotel itself is located in the middle of a great cafe and restaurant district and I look forward to staying here every year~5~5~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_464172190~“Very good stay”~Had a great stay at the friendly adina apartments in Surrey hills a great area as well highly recommend staying there as the service is next none and the rooms have great appointments and views. The area has great vantage to all manner of shops and entertainment and coffee and it is close to the city~5~5~4~4~5~4~5~nan
review_463961126~“Good Location”~Right in the heart of Surrey Hills,well taken care of, comfy beds and plenty of space. Staff was good. Parking is difficult to find, you have to sneak into the side street and we drove around a bit not knowing where we should go. Signage for getting into the parking lot prior to registration could be better.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_462850864~“Great location in Surry Hills”~Pluses: We had a 2 bedroom apartment in the hotel. It was comfortable and clean. Probably better than photos. Good space and amenities. Close to facilities in Surry Hills. 'bills' restaurant in same building with celebrity chef. Nice restaurants in area, and local small grocery stores to walk to. Minuses: We were told that wifi was free on check in. But on check out was told it only applied to two devices. We were travelling with teenagers, and had PC's as well as phones. So the charge was a surprise. Also room had some minor maintenance issues such as wobbly tap in Kitchen, a couple of light switches with loose switches. Front staff were not as friendly/attentive as I have come to expect. Overall we would go back again.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~nan
review_461562999~“need upgrade”~WAs a lovely hotel and stay for business however has recently been going downhill. I believe they are starting to refurbish. I hope so as it is in a great location and suits us for our business trips. Bathrooms mouldy tiles, broken dishwasher, dodgy air con, broken furniture and expensive. I do hope they upgrade as it was a gorgeous hotel so I recommend before you book to ask if it has all been upgraded as it can be fantastic staying here. Staff are very curteous and lovely. Great car parking below and a walk to many eateries etc.~3~2~4~3~2~2~4~nan
review_461270438~“Sneaky Hen's Weekend”~We were very happy with this apartment, all staff were friendly and welcoming. We had two apartments which the staff happily put us near each other on the same floor. Had to print out my reservation for some reason - they would not accept me showing my phone or email reservation, a bit weird considering I booked it online. Black spot with EFTPOS machine at reception, staff had to walk around with the machine over their heads to find a signal - very amusing for us, bit of a let down for staff not having facilities that work easily. A bit weird that our 6th floor windows opened up completely - didn't find that overly safe. Overall, we had a fantastic weekend away. This suburb is very quaint and nice for a little getaway not quite in the city but also close enough to catch an Uber to go out for dinner etc.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461000847~“Housekeeping Shocker!”~While the location is good and the reception staff were lovely, the housekeeping is the worst I have ever experienced. I was in a two bedroom apartment and arrived at the hotel one day to find that only one of the rooms had been cleaned. The bathroom was also uncleaned. The room felt dirty and the handle to the bathroom was broken when we arrived and after 4 days of asking, it was finally repaired the day before I checked out. As I caught a lift to my room some other guest were complaining about water running out of electrical circuits and even though they had asked for it to be repaired, nothing had been done. I would definitely not recommend this hotel which is a pity because the location is great.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460249153~“Exceptional Service”~Very professional and accommodating staff, a great location and a very comfortable apartment.

review_459858835~“Perfect Sydney Spot”~We stayed in Surry Hills in our one bedroom apartment for 4 nights...Super location!! Loved having the laundry facilities!! Easy to walk to Opera House and the other sights!! Loved the pool area! The workout facility was good.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_458808957~“Housekeeping needs omprovement”~Housekeeping needs to be looked at seriously.cleaner did not listen request. bathrooms full of mould on all over the walls & asked them to bleach walls on checkin. kitchen not cleaned properly even we only cooked once.. no dishwasher detergent provided and cleaner just put all dirty cups etc into dishwasher and never turn on. beds were only tidy on top & when you uinfold to sleep, all the bottom of the beds were all unmade. receptionists were good & helpful..~3~3~3~3~2~2~3~nan
review_458767343~“Sydney stay - worthwhile knowing”~Good value Surry Hills accomodation. Steaming hot weather - cool rooms well appointed. All you need - conveniently located - good restaurants, cafes, bares in the vicinity. Very good value - excellent polite helpful staff. Recommended~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_458440446~“Great location, serious maintenance and housekeeping issues”~The Adina is conveniently located in Surry Hills, 1km from Allianz Stadium, which was perfect for our weekend at the Rugby 7s.  Unfortunately, our stay was marred by the maintenance and housekeeping issues we experienced with our two bedroom apartment. Issues identified and reported to the hotel during our stay: broken (cracked) kitchen tap that sprayed water everywhere when you turned it on ('repaired' with duct tape twice, but still sprayed water everywhere), a wardrobe door with runners that were broken so we couldn't access the room safe, smells throughout the apartment as a result of mould in both showers, kettle with burnt element (replaced), light not working (bulb replaced, but blew again), broken tumble dryer, and general dirty/dusty surfaces.  Whilst I did receive an apology from the hotel and was thanked for my feedback, I was advised I could not change rooms due to their 100% occupancy and that the maintenance issues could not be resolved until Monday, my day of departure. The disappointing thing is that these issues were likely identified by previous hotel guests or should have been identified by the housekeeping staff. Overall, extremely disappointing.~2~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_457795817~“Great Hotel”~I came to visit my daughter who lives in Sydney, this is a place home from home. I came on my own and always felt very safe and secure. The apartments have everything you need, very clean and comfortable. Next time I come back I will definitely stay here, great restaurants, coffee shops ets near. I can not recommend this highly enough, have so enjoyed staying here and the staff are all so helpful and friendly.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
