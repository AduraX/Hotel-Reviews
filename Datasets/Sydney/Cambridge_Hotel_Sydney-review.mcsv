review_478604217~“Will be back”~This hotel met all our expectations. We did not have the kitchenette as requested but were able to rent a microwave. We also had a kettle and small fridge so we were all set. I would recommend this hotel. It is very close to Museum train station and you could also walk to the harbor.~4~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_468406237~“my favourite hotel”~I've stayed at the cambridge hotel numerous times and every stay I've felt welcome, comfortable and always sad to leave. the staff are friendly and accomodating. the rooms are always clean. the beds and linen are very comfortable and the bathrooms are really nice with great shower pressure. the location is perfect for enjoying the city. love the irish pub across the road and the mo cafe around the corner serves great coffee and breakfast.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_478434419~“Excellent value, excellent location, excellent hotel!”~This hotel is amazing value for money and it's location is just a short walk from so many of the Sydney attractions. We parked our car and didn't use it at all for the duration of our stay - we walked to Darling Harbour; to the Australian Museum; to Hyde Park; to the Opera House; to the shops & malls etc. The pool area is lovely and the staff are very helpful. Our deluxe King room with city views was very clean. We will definitely stay here again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

Cafes and bars nearby. There is storage for luggage Guy at reception the first day (cannot remember name) was very nice and helpful, unfortunately I cannot say the same of all of the personnel at reception.

review_477516348~“Nice central hotel with excellent customer care”~We stayed at the Cambridge for 3 nights in one of their family / executive rooms with two double beds. We were given a room on the 12th floor, which was OK, but a bit small and dark. But because my wife does not like lifts the girl on reception kindly arranged to move us to a room on the 2nd floor for the last couple of nights. This room was much brighter and bigger. The hotel is an easy walk to all the main tourist spots and it takes about 25 mins to walk down to circular quay. There are loads of places to eat locally, with Mo's, just round the corner being a great option for breakfast. I would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_477299666~“Would stay again”~Stayed here for my 25th Birthday weekend. Staff were wonderful and accommodating. The bed and the Sofa bed were really comfortable.  Only gripe would be that the main bed in the bedroom was a little hard. Other than that they stay was wonderful and will be staying again~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_477252565~“Mmmmmm”~Not the best for customer relations .. the room was clean and tidy and nice but there was something false about the hotel , things it's a bit grander than it accurately is . The swimming pool is tiny and a bit scruffy . Didn't eat in the restaurant as it was full of loud .............people~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477211796~“Great location & value”~I recently stayed for 4 nights at this conveniently located hotel. The staff was friendly and welcoming. My room was not what I was expecting. I booked a premium room and received a room with no view/light. Nonetheless, I was happy with the value, location and friendliness of the staff. I would recommend this hotel but would suggest that you specify a room with a view/balcony.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_476744071~“my review”~My stay here sounded promising and I was highly recommended to this hotel to find my booking wasn't what it was said to be over the phone I made the mistake of not checking the email prior. I asked for a balcony did not receive one I also felt like it was very expensive for what we got we didn't receive a balcony the pillows did not smell clean. as a friend stayed around the corner for the excact same time who received a balcony parking and paid a lot less and there service was 10 times better when I asked about the issue I was given a rather abrubt reply I will unfortunately not be recommending you service again~3~2~4~2~3~3~2~nan
review_476729275~“Nice hotel in great location”~Great position with lots of shops, cafes and restaurants nearby. Staff were friendly, room was clean, comfy and quiet. There was a mix up with the room booking, but this was sorted out really quickly. It's tricky to find short term city accommodation that suits young kids, but our room had a little kitchen which was perfect for making breakfast and snacks and the 2 joining bedrooms (one with sofabed for the kids) meant we had privacy (and our own TV) once the kids went to sleep.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_476620599~“Great Hotel, excellent customer service.”~We stayed at the Cambridge recently for a week over the Easter weekend. This was a great Hotel. Close to the city and to transport stops etc. The Cambridge was clean and a reasonable price for where it is situated.The best thing about the hotel was the customer service. The staff were exceptional and provided excellent customer service. All staff were excellent, especially Anastasia who booked us in. She was so pleasant and eager to please, she was interested in us and ways to ensure our stay was a good one- she provided us with helpful information about Sydney. Hopefully this information is passed on to her as it is important that staff be recognised for their good work. Thanks!~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476325825~“Perfectly average hotel”~We enjoyed our four night stay at the Cambridge. We were really barely there, but we found the service to be really good. The building and the rooms are a bit dated and ours didn't have great lighting, but it was nice and clean. Bathrooms are renovated, although a bit small.~3~3~3~5~3~5~5~nan

review_475976092~“A good review”~I don't always get to choose where I stay in Sydney, but when I book my own accommodation I always go to the Cambridge Hotel, initially because of its convenient location to my usual key destinations. Over time I have come to enjoy the friendly, efficient and unpretentious staff and services and look forward to staying there.~4~5~4~4~4~4~5~nan

review_475404955~“No Worries!”~I initially requested a room with a mini kitchen from the travel agency but they booked me for a balcony something or other. I emailed the travel agency and said that's not what I want. They said too bad that's all they have. I emailed the hotel and told them I wanted the mini kitchen and they said "no worries." When we got there the front desk cracked me up, no matter what I asked their response was "no worries." I asked them to empty all the stuff our of our mini fridge so we could put our stuff in there and they said "no worries." Every night I would ask for a bucket of ice and they'd say "no worries." I'd call and ask for a wake up call and they'd say "no worries." We were so confused by what day it was we checked out and went to the airport a day early. CRAP, what if they gave our room away I called the hotel while we were still at the airport and told them what we'd done and they and they' said "no worries."  I walked in the bathroom one night and there was a roach scurrying across the floor it stopped and looked at me I looked at it and I said "no worries."  The hotel is also in an excellent location, easy to access the train, shops, pretty much anything you need. I read some reviews where people complained about the noise but I didn't have any problems with noise. The layout is a little funky, kind of like a maze but after a day or two you get used to it. We stayed six nights they seem to do a booming business with the cruise lines.  We didn't use the pool, hot tub or eat at the hotel so I can't comment on any of that other than I'm sure there are no worries! Thanks Cambridge staff you were great.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_475185982~“Cambridge hotel by a wheelchair-user”~I am a wheelchair-user. I was given a double room on the third floor. It was not an adapted room, as had been requested. The entrance was obstructed by a large wardrobe. I could just get past this in my powerchair but it would have been impossible in a manual one. There was a coffee table obstructing the turning area at the foot of the bed. The wardrobe doubled as the tea and coffee store, although the socket for the kettle was elsewhere, and if I hadn't been able to walk a little I would not have been able to manage to make a drink. The shower had a high lip and there were no handrails in the bathroom. The reception desk had no lowered section for wheelchair users and the guest computers were up a flight of stairs. There is no accessible toilet on the ground floor. The hotel is on quite a steep hill, which disabled guests should be warned about. Breakfast is offered in a restaurant next door.~4~3~3~5~2~4~4~nan
review_475161126~“Fabulous hotel”~This hotel never disappoints. It's a short walk up to Oxford Street and Hyde Park. The staff are friendly, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are spotless & there is security parking. The Cambridge Hotel is highly recommended. I will be back!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475144923~“Excellent room for a cheap price.”~Often when you get a cheap room, you don't get a 'good' room but that was not the case here. A fantastic room in the CBD for a great price. The added bonus of having a pool and hot tub were great as well.~5~5~5~3~5~5~5~nan
review_474851797~“A good value place close enough to all”~Good staff, service and standard for the price. Good area for some healthy food. And close walk to first main park and downtown, museum station is best access by train. Limited internet for free though.~4~4~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_474668350~“Very Nice”~This hotel is nothing special, but it is very nice. The location is good, close to the main hub of Sydney but still tucked away in a quiet area. The room was clean and beds comfortable, really nice bathroom. The air conditioner was a little quirky but adequate, not sure how it would be if the weather was really hot. The young people at the front desk were uniformly helpful, friendly and cheerful. There was only one older guy (perhaps the manager) who was rather rude. My only real complaint was that the door was not soundproof AT ALL. Loud noises whenever someone was in the hall, particularly in the morning when people were leaving and closing their door. Only real complaint~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_474604108~“Great Location”~Nice out of the way hotel, but the location is perfect. Only a few mins walk from central parts of Sydney.  Door to door from airport terminal to hotel takes about 25mins. Use opal card PROS: -Location- China Town a 10min walk, tube station is 7min walk and is about 2-3 stops to Sydney Opera House, loads of bars near the hotel -Breakfast was decent -Rooms were clean and big -Nice touch of the chocolate when checking out!

review_474367052~“Good location and clean.”~We stayed at Cambridge for 2 nights. The location was excellent and that was the main selling point to the property. The room was small but clean. It was a good spot to stay to visit around Surry Hills, Oxford Street and go see a game at the SCG. There was only 1 main lift working so it was slow to get up and down to your room. We didn't use the bar or eat on the premises.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_474299651~“Decent hotel ”~Decent little budget hotel. Very quiet. Extremely clean. Fridge. Tea coffee renewed daily. Small, but usable pool. Friendly and helpful staff. No complaints. City centre is walkable. A bus to the harbour goes from almost outside the door and takes about eleven minutes. Using an opal card its $2.10. On Sunday it's 2.50 all day and that includes ferry transport.  Aldi supermarket is three minutes away and, if you're from the UK, you'll be surprised at the cost of food. A packet of crisps in a sweetshop 3.50.  If you fancy the Opera there's a deal if you include the tour. 99 instead of 299 for decent seats + 37 for the tour. Ask at the box office.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474026835~“Convenient and clean”~I was happy with my visit here. Very close to Oxford Street and walking distance to Central Station. The area was quiet too.

review_472780071~“Clean, modern hotel in an ideal location”~Ideal location if you want to be near the Oxford Street area of Surry Hills. I arrived earlier than check-in time because it was when my flight arrived in Sydney. Fortunately they had a room ready, with the compromise that it was on the 2nd floor and had no view (in fact, the windows were frosted so that you couldn't see outside). I can't complain about that, since I was glad to get settled and rest after my long flight. However, I'd suggest that if you want a view, you should request a high floor and don't try to check in early. Although the room was very clean, it didn't quite have the same quality that the photos illustrated. Some of the furniture and fixtures seemed cheap. Finally, they don't tell you until you get into the room that the "free" WiFi is limited to "300MB at 512kbps for one device only for 24 hours from time of first log in...upgrade options available". This is laughable. I left my phone on WiFi overnight, it auto-updated some apps, and in the morning, my limit was exceeded. I understand the need to limit bandwidth in a large building, but 300MB per 24 hours is unrealistic for even the most casual internet user.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_472770802~“Economical in Sydney Central”~The Cambridge is always a great stay and close to the city, darling harbour and the restaurants and nightlife of crown and oxford streets. On site parking, bar, restaurant if you don't want to go out and generous sized rooms.~4~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_472524003~“regular Sydney abode”~We stay often to attend theatre and opera, what else is there to say! We need to be careful otherwise too many others will use the hotel making it difficult to get a room. Our only complaint is the carpark entry and the tight spaces, but that is as it is.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_472341930~“Friendly staff and excellent location”~The hotel was located at a great location, walking distance to many malls and parks. It's also surrounded by many cafes with amazing coffee. The staff were also very helpful and friendly, and even managed to get us checked in early after arriving in Sydney from a red-eye. Unfortunately, the room I was given was old and did feel a little 'ancient'. I was also a little upset with the Wifi even though it stated 'Free Wifi' but was technically given about 300MB every 24hours. Also, during my stay there, 1 out of the 2 elevators was always out of service and we ended up waiting for quite a while almost every day to 'travel' up and down our room. That being said, everything else about the hotel was great :) i would recommend this to anyone else for the awesome location :)~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan

review_472299712~“Friendly, helpful staff”~The front desk people here were excellent as is hotel's location in Surry Hills. Furnishings / decor perhaps a little dated (avoid looking at the carpet if hungover) and free wi-fi limited to just one device.~4~3~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_472276941~“Spacious room!”~We came here one night to celebrate a party so we didnt really stay in the room for long. but the room was big and spacious it had a reasonably comfortable bed and nice bathroom too. The noise whats the only thing i couldn't stand I'm a noise sensitive person the noise mostly came from the street though i mean your right in the heart of it but i pretty much woke every half hour to hour listening to honking horns and just weird street noises.

review_471988653~“Excellent location.”~Close to many of the Sydney features or these we easily accessed from the Cambridge. Difficulties- one off the lifts was under maintenance and made it difficult going and coming from our floor. Need a better "local" guide in the room. All that we had was two menus for restaurants that would do a room delivery. It would have been nice to have a "Cambridge guide listing amenities and a range of general hotel information.~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan

Very Clean & specious rooms with a good choice of minibar items. Has a convenient restaurant at the ground level.  It is so easy and short to walk to CBD!

review_471577054~“Another business trip to Sydney with last minute bookings”~Great location and reliable accommodation. The online booking process needs to improve. In the process of booking 2 nights and went to finalize the booking to only find someone else had booked the second night on the deal and had to start again and booking 2 rooms separately for 1 night each! Communication on the system could be better also. Was advised I wouldn't need to change rooms on arrival, only to receive an email during the day saying I had left my bag in the room, and my card not allowing me access to the room, upon my return. Not what you need when you are tired for a full day on the job!~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan

review_470876568~“Good Place To Stay”~We stayed at the Cambridge for two periods - in March 17 - just short of two weeks.  The hotel is only a little way out of the city centre - about 10-15 mins walk from the Central Station / similar time to the Opera House end of Hyde Park - so pretty central to everything/entertainment. Lots of places to eat / get a drink (at any time of the day) around the hotel itself - try Jo's (2 mins walk) it's tops! Staff at the hotel were great - helpful, professional and efficient. We went to Ayres Rock for a short while mid stay and they were brilliant, offering to (and then doing it) looking after half of our luggage that we didn't need on that part of our trip, at no cost. Room was spacious, clean, well appointed and comfortable. Loads of tea/coffee and milk everyday. Well stocked mini-bar at reasonable prices for a hotel. Breakfast were good and reasonably priced with full/continental options. Both my wife and myself would happily stay here again, without question.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470665876~“TRANSIT LAND”~We stayed here a decade ago and the hotel has changed little. It is still mainly a transit hotel in the Victorian area of the City but with good transport links to Circular Quay and the other City attractions. The area is quite pleasant in the day time but feels more 'iffy' at night although this may not be the case. We stayed several days on two separate occasions 12 days apart. The reception area is always busy with people checking in and out, ordering transport arrangements and waiting for airport buses. However, the reception staff were helpful and hard working.. On our first several days stay we had a very small and basic room and no real storage space so that living out of the suitcases was the order of the days. There was only one electricity plug to service everything and if you needed to recharge any electrical appliances or plug in a kettle you got on your hands and knees and disabled the TV. The bathroom was cramped and the bath and integrated shower very difficult to use because of an immobile plastic screen near the bath plug and taps. It was all very basic and uncomfortable although the room was clean. On our return for a few days we had a different room in another part of the hotel. Larger, better and more accessible bathroom, a series of plugs although storage space was restricted.  Its assets were external - a series of eateries covering all choices and palettes, accessible shops and bars and good transport links.  We had breakfast in the attached rooms and by choice took the continental. It was cold with an adequate selection of cereals, meats and cheeses. For what it provided, however, it was expensive. Being frank this hotel is so well located and used it deserves money to be spent on modernizing~2~nan~nan~2~nan~4~3~nan

review_470381568~“Average Hotel”~It is just your average hotel - nothing special During our stay one lift was constantly out of service which was very inconvenient, we had a 20 minute wait for the lift just to get downstairs! Then we had the lift constantly chiming outside our door for over an hour while the engineers worked on it. The location is a little dodgy, it is only a 15 minute walk from the heart of the city but the neighbourhood is not that great at night time~3~2~3~3~3~3~3~nan
review_470142270~“A good base”~The hotel is conveniently located for the CBD and Bondi. Rooms are spread over 14 floors with an unreliable lift. Room was spacious and secure but lacked storage space and the plumbing was antiquated. The breakfast choice was pathetic, less than many budget hotels would provide for free. This is a real surprise as the hotel restaurant is justifiably rated one of Sydney's finest for its evening meals~3~3~4~5~4~5~3~nan
review_469700349~“Wonderful place to stay for a working week away”~I travel to Sydney for work very frequently and have found it very difficult to find somewhere to stay for a reasonable price close to the CBD office and am so pleased to have found this place. A number of colleagues stayed at the hotel in the same week and we all agree that it surpasses our experiences at other hotels and we will definitely be staying here again when we're next in town. The rooms are a great size and very clean and the hotel is very centrally located. I have already recommended this place to all of our other travelling staff.~4~5~5~5~5~4~4~nan
review_469546996~“Quite an ordinary hotel but it ticked all the boxes”~We stayed at the Cambridge for 2 nights in February. First impressions were underwhelming, but our room had everything we required after a flight from UK. The room had tea making facilities, a safe, air-con, and most of all a comfortable bed. The next day we walked through Hyde Park to the circular quay area. The Surry Hills area is good for bars and restaurants. The reception staff were very helpful printing essential travel documents for us.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_469525759~“Great base, central to so much!”~Easy walk to so many locations. Very clean and tidy. Staff helpful and did that bit extra even when not expected. Only down fall view from room was a back alley way, luckily window was frosted over. Would definitely stay again.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_469469512~“A fine place to stay.”~Our room in the back of the hotel was quiet and spacious, the bed was very comfortable,the bathroom well designed, and it had decent closet space, and a safe. The room was clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel is well located with many restaurants, shops, a grocery store and public trans nearby..~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469341885~“Nice stay in the Cambridge hotel”~We had a nice stay in the Cambridge hotel. We were there for three days and booked a chamber with a balcony. Two things we did not like that there is no furniture on the balcony and the shower was hard to regulate.~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_469302687~“Overnight City Stay”~Was okay for a overnight stay. Great location. We booked this on reviews and location to our function which was a 3 minute walk. Comfortable bed and pillows. Spacious room. A long time it takes for check in & check out process - very ordinary indeed. Very stuffy rooms and lots of dust on side tables lamps and behind on the floor when I went to plug my charger in. Balcony was very grubby. Noisy corridors. Would I stay again (no) ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469123189~“Sydney in grey”~The room, but located on the 3rd floor, had windows giving on dark couryard where the sun had no chance to enter. The persons in charge of check-in demonstrated more interest for their private conversations than for servicing the customers.~4~3~5~4~2~4~2~nan
review_468978468~“Great price for great location and comfortable hotel”~The hotel is comfortable, and has the two things that are most important to me: opening windows and excellent staff. The location means getting around by foot or public transport is easy, there are great places to eat, have coffee and shop if you're so inclined. All up fantastic for the price!~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_468973059~“Another great stay”~Cambridge Hotel Sydney is always my first option - friendly service & fabulous facilities in the perfect location mean there are no other options for me :). The restaurant serves wonderful food and compliments all the other eating options within walking distance.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468870026~“Cambridge Hotel Sydney”~This hotel was located in a quiet, yet vibrant area of town. The rooms were nice and the hotel had a decent restaurant, I only had breakfast at the hotel, but the hotel restaurant always seemed packed for dinner. Once you figured out the area, the hotel was surrounded by restaurants and bars that you could easily walk to in a few minutes. The hotel was also close to public transportation, to get to you other parts of town if you didn't want to walk. While in Sydney, I took a couple of tours that I had to catch from other hotels....the hotel was a short walk from The Cambridge Hotel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468793046~“A let down unfortunately”~The hotel is centrally located and not bad but not as good as I expected/read on all the reviews on TripAdvisor. I'm thinking maybe it's just that I got a average room on the "B" grade side of this hotel. We were given a room on the 3rd floor with pokey, narrow, winding, mouldy smelling corridors that smelt like they were trying to cover it up with bleach of some sort. The smell was quite over powering. Definitely doesn't look like hotel corridors but more like youth hostel feeling on this floor.  The room was ok, with frosted glass windows with no fly screens that looked out to other rooms in the complex. There is no view here. Wanted to open the windows to allow fresh air in, but with no flyscreen this was not possible.  Bed was comfortable tho and room decor reasonable but with peeling sofa and bumpy uneven floor covered over by carpet I was not blown away as much as I was by the pics on the site I booked. Also reading other positive reviews on this site, I didn't think twice about booking it, but from arrival at our floor we were left with a below average feeling unfortunately about our stay at this hotel.  The bathroom was small and clean, but i have no idea how the toilet passed any council regulation as it was so close to the wall n shower screen, one had to almost lean over to one side to fit on and I'm of slim build. Would hate to see how a bigger sized person would fit on it. The toilet seat also wouldn't stay up by itself meaning my partner had to give up putting it up when he used the toilet!!!!Also the cold shower tap only turned a third of the way which was really weird as the hot water tap worked normally. Meaning water temp was hot and took some adjusting.  If you are thinking of booking this hotel, I would stay away from the 3rd floor.  ~3~3~5~5~3~4~3~nan
review_468726610~“A Few Days Away”~Staff were friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. The kids enjoyed the swimming pool and Surry Hills is one of the best locations to be in when visiting Sydney. Great restaurants nearby. Walking distance to a lot of Sydney features.~4~5~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_468709894~“Second visit, second time I was impressed”~This was the second time I had stayed at the Cambridge in the past six months - and what a pleasure to report it was just as good the second time around. This time, I was not upgraded into a one bed, but had booked into a Deluxe Balcony Room, which was huge and suited all my needs. But the three things I like about this hotel are: 1. It is clean. 2. The front desk staff are terrific and very ready to help out with whatever you need. 3. It is quiet. As someone who is noise-sensitive, I hate paying for noisy hotels where you are forced to endure other people's noisy comings and goings. Not here at the Cambridge. I slept so well, it was close to everything I needed and it was an easy, very pleasant stay. And the overnight parking was very reasonable and when it kicked into the second day, worked out to be a fine deal. Only one thing that let it down - no chairs on the balcony. It would have been nice to have a cup of tea on the balcony, but there was no furniture. Maybe that's a good thing, as there are no people out on the balconies talking until late, but it was the only thing this fine hotel lost only a few points for. Thanks to the entire great team - what a pleasure to stay with you.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_468330163~“Sydney pre cruise stay”~Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean, comfortable but small with very little storage place It was convenient to all transportation. Very nice restaurants were nearby and within walking distance~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_468293314~“Pleased!”~We loved our room: clean, nice view of the city and very quiet. Friendly staff and so many amazing restaurants in this neighborhood. Bacco Matto which is right downstairs was amazing. We would have eaten there every night but wanted to try other places too. The Buster Brown cafe on Crown Street had terrific French food.~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan~nan
review_468227059~“Average Hotel”~An average hotel that is ideally situated. If yr not that bothered then this is the hotel for you. Very dated which is probably why it comes up on your search of affordable accommodation!! Staff are so/so. Some good. Some below average! Our room was entered whilst we were out. They really didn't care! One staff member couldn't be bothered with anything. Another (Anastasia I think) couldn't have been more helpful. It took 3 days to get our wifi sorted. They even had me talking to their IT guys!!! Don't expect big things here. You get what you pay for literally!!~3~3~4~3~2~4~3~nan
review_468173015~“Great location”~Cambridge hotel Sydney is located near central station, so it's quite easy to access everywhere I want. I could visit center of city, opera house and harbor bridge on foot. There are some nice reataurants near the hotel.~4~4~5~4~4~4~3~nan
review_468132180~“Quality Hotel in a good location”~Good comfortable clean and well serviced rooms in a good central location at the top of town. From our first encounter with reception we knew this was going to be a good place to stay. Friendly, helpful and efficient staff. Very close to Museum station and a short walk from Hyde Park. Lots of restaurants and bars in local vicinity. Free in-room wifi, safe, tea and coffee facilities and a radio with an ipod docking facility. Spacious well maintained rooms and shower. Can certainly recommend staying here.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468101254~“Lovely Hotel”~I stayed in the Cambridge Hotel with my 2 daughters for 2 nights. The hotel is in a good location. The room is a good size for 3, it was clean and well equipped. The indoor pool was very nice. The staff were helpful with telling us where we should visit and how. They had a great system for looking after your luggage, they took it away and gave you a receipt and they then collected it for you unlike many hotels were anyone can go in the room where luggage is stored. We did a 3 hour bus tour which was great too. The Opal travel card is great, we bought one for $20 and used the ferry to Manly and busses and still had money left on it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467985479~“Find Somewhere Else”~I was always a very regular guest at the Cambridge, with work taking me to Sydney quite often and the location was very suitable to access arterial roads as well as the airport roads. The staff were always welcoming and remembered their regulars. But my last stay there was definitely my last. During an evening shower the drain started to back up and foul coloured water started gurgling back out of the drain. Needless to say it was disgusting. I ended up finishing washing myself in the basin.  On my way out to my evening appointment, which I was very late for due to the plumbing problem, I went out of my way to report this to the front desk and asked if it could not be fixed ASAP, to change my room as it was unacceptable. I was told someone could come up with a plunger then and there (which wasn't convenient or acceptable) or would be seen to ASAP. So imagine my horror when showering the next evening, the foul water started up all over again. I rang the desk and it was simply oops, something got overlooked and would I like someone to come up with a plunger?  This was the last straw. One time I checked in and there were brown dribbles down the front of the toilet which Mark the duty manager willingly cleaned up but was acutely embarrassed and the visit before that was the under-carpet water leak which had gone mouldy and stank. Breakfast seems to be going down hill with the range shrinking and somewhat aloof staff in there sometimes who make you feel like an interruption. Not to mention the slow cooker food warmers that just stew everything. The final insult was to be offered a 'fantastic discount' of 20% on my next stay for the blocked drain. No thanks. I do have a simple expectation of functioning plumbing or guest service to give me a room with does have this. Not a staff member with a plunger.  I have since discovered some fantastic hotels in and around the Cambridge area and now that I am in Sydney more than ever, I have a couple of new home away from homes.~1~nan~5~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_467984637~“Jason”~The Cambridge hotel is a great place to stay while in Sydney. Great location with lots of cool bars and cafes close by. The front desk was outstanding they help with ever question we asked. I really recommend this hotel.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_467850727~“Good Value in a Pricey City”~Finding a good hotel in Sydney is akin to finding the same in New York, so we found the Cambridge Hotel to be a great value. It is modern, clean, has quiet air conditioning, good wifi, comfortable beds and is located on a quiet side street, so even if you have a balcony facing the street (as ours was), it was nice and quiet at night. It is also across the street from the Sydney police headquarters so you know you are in a safe neighborhood. We walked everywhere and never had any qualms about it. It is about a 20 minute walk to the CBD; about a 10 minute walk to the metro and from there it is only 2 stops to Circular Quay and the Opera House. Yes, the hotel breakfast is a bit on the expensive side (A$15 for continental breakfast, A$20 for full breakfast), but the coffee shop around the corner was even more expensive. Note: the hotel restaurant is hectic during breakfast so you will be elbowing your way in. However, we found the hotel staff to be very helpful. In particular, George at reception was unfailingly cheerful and polite, especially when the airlines lost our luggage for our first couple days. The hotel pool is a nice perk, especially as Sydney was going through a heat wave when we were there, but we were unable to try it as our swimsuits were in our lost luggage. We would not hesitate to stay here again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467718471~“good location”~I was pleasantly surprised by the quiet room (since the hotel is in a busy area) and had a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed. Small negatives were: lack of a microwave oven, charging for the bottled water in the fridge, and the toilet paper holder ridiculously placed just in front of toilet - leaving no room for your knees!~4~3~4~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_467709965~“lela”~good location and friendly staff. well equipped kitchen. clean bath tub and bathroom. quiet if the windows are shut. relatively expensive probably because it was Friday night. A backpacker could choose the hostel in the same building.~4~3~5~4~3~4~4~nan
review_467687776~“A quick stay”~Overall very good. We stayed as I had appointments at St Vincent's Hospital and I think it would be appropriate if they had cheaper rates for hospital stays. I found it still quite expensive in comparison to some of the other accomodation available. Upon saying that, it is in a good position.~3~2~5~5~4~3~5~nan

review_467415452~“Low-key Brothel”~The title says it all really. Unclean, smelly, hopeless. We were greeted by the hotel manager who was high and didn't have a clue what was happening. Didn't even know how to find one of the rooms we were staying in so made us find it ourselves. Never stay here.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467369821~“Comfortable & Functional ”~Very well situated 15 minutes walk fr9m Sydney CBD the Cambridge is a comfortable hotel. The rooms are functional and the beds comfortable. The staff are friendly and keen to help. Just for the really tall folk the showers are a bit low but a very minor point. If you don't want budget or 5 star this is a good choice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467120091~“Great location”~This was a great hotel for us. Room was a premium double. Clean & fresh and everything one needs for a comfortable stay. Close to eateries, and can walk pretty much anywhere but easy to transport links. The staff were welcoming on check-in & check-out was seamless. Greeted when coming in from an evening out. On check-out a nice touch was the personally named chocolate bar. We did get the airport shuttle which was a mistake. Fortunately we had plenty of time but allow an hour-and-a-half not the recommended hour if you are catching a late afternoon or early evening flight. Next time we will be using the air train.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467077394~“Perfect for Mardi Gras!”~I visited Sydney for the sole purpose of attending Mardi Gras. This location is perfect for that. Clean, convenient, easy. Great pub across the road. Not ideal for people hoping to walk everywhere (even though we did - it's about 20 mins into the city centre and about half an hour to Darling Harbour on foot). Completely do-able, but only if you don't mind walking! Would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467071185~“Complaint”~Good afternoon , My husband and I stayed at the Cambridge hotel last Friday and Saturday nights. The staff were lovely and friendly, however we were not happy to pay close to $590 to stay in the tiny room, no balcony and could not even open the window enough to let any fresh air in!! The breakfast was not worth $20 each as the Sunday morning half the food was not even available and was cold and clearly had been sitting there a while. There were no coffee/tea cups available and we had to request these numerous times.  Overall, the motel was not worth the amount we paid and we are extremely disappointed.
