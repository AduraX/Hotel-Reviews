review_477726238~“Wow wow wow!”~This hotel was a dream. The rooms were beautiful, with a balcony and lovely views across the houses to the Bay, the location was fantastic for access to the shops and Bondi, and the service was brilliant. We stayed in a Club Level room which meant that we had access to the Club Lounge. This is highly recommended. One evening we sampled tapas and wine, one morning we enjoyed our breakfast in a wonderful peaceful setting, and one afternoon we were treated to a beautiful Afternoon Tea; all of which was part of the benefit of staying in a Club Level room. Without a doubt, the most impressive part of this hotel is the rooftop pool and terrace. It's almost unbearably chic and stylish, and it's actually difficult to tear yourself away on a sunny day. My advice is to order a Frose - you won't regret it!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477380655~“Ok but not impressed”~I stood there for two days and I was expecting something different.  The balcony with sea view advertised on the website, is far from what you would expect (i.e. you can see the sea... a few miles away and with many many buildings in between). The room itself was very nice and so the bathroom. Very clean and modern. However, quite disappointed by the Club Lounge, which unlikes the IC in Sydney, is small and in which the service offered is not up to the standard. Bottom line, nice place but over priced I think (at least when I was there the room rates were very high for the value delivered).~3~3~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_476746355~“Could be better”~Our family of 5 decided to book a night at the hotel as we were having dinner at Sake Japanese restaurant downstairs and although living in Sydney we enjoy weekends staying in 5 star Hotels once every now and then. After checking in at 2pm we decided to go to the rooftop Pool to relax and swim.The area is quite small and only would hold around 25 people or so but has fantastic views and there was a DJ playing music which was great. What was not great was the service with firstly a basic cocktail (Mohito) taking 45 minutes to arrive after numerous requests then being told if went to another guest. Then when we moved to a Sun Bed the wet towels and dirty glasses and plates were left there from previous guests and no attempt was made to clean up for the next guests in fact this was the case at all lounges when guests left. Our Fries we ordered were stone cold and the sliders we cancelled as they took so long to arrive. Breakfast the next morning my Wife and children went down and were told that I had already eaten and booked it to the room to which she denied and said it must be somebody else but the staff member was adamant it was us but let them in anyway. When I arrived the waitress seemed to joke about it and shrugged her shoulders! Breakfast was pretty basic and although it was around 9.45am and most guests had already eaten there was no real attempt to make new eggs or bacon or replenish so most dishes were old and dry. Apart from that the Rooms are fantastic and the overall ambience and amenities at the Hotel are really good with Double Bay being a great location but although these issues may seem rather petty it has left a bad impression.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_476099367~“Top 10 Australia; great Sydney alternative”~We arrived from the InterContinental Sydney by taxi (same price as going to the airport).  You could also take the ferry from Circular Quay, but be aware, the ferry to Double Bay only sails in the morning and later in the afternoon. Can not recommend taking the train when you have luggage.  Double Bay is an oases away from the city, still very near if you want to visit the attractions. Great relaxed atmosphere with good value restaurants. A great alternative to stay, at least for a couple of days.  The hotel is small but impressive. Retaining the chique of the RitzCarlton it once was, offering good service, modernity and informality of a new InterContinental hotel. Concierge and reception staff were friendly and well trained.  The pool area is small, but nice. And they now finally seemed to appreciate the staying guest above the crowd just visiting the pool bar (see other Tripadvisor reviews).  This hotel has been voted number 6 in the DestinAsia top-10 luxury hotels in Australia for 2017 and we think we agree. We though feel there is still a lot of work to be done on details and (pool) staff attitude towards these details. As a platinum ambassador, we were upgraded to a very well decorated suite (one of the best decorated rooms in any InterContinental we know). It did not have a balcony, view to the inner courtyard was blocked by a wall which was used as a storage for broken parasols. We would have preferred a smaller room with balcony. Suites normally include club access, but not with an upgrade, making this room, even by their own standard a downgrade from a deluxe bay view (check your rates!).  During our stay the pool staff removed a piece of furniture from the pool area, leaving some dirt (and hair). No staff member even noticed this. We suggested them to clean it up, which they did after a few hours.  Breakfast was ok. For a five star in Australia, the rate was very acceptabele. But you will have to pay extra for many choices, leaving you with a limited choice from the buffet. Poached eggs were on offer at the buffet, but were always like hard boiled eggs. This is not a buffet product! Worst thing was the fact that our room was ready a 5 PM. We checked in at 3 PM and they asked us to wait for half an hour at the pool where we received a welcome drink.  When we told a guy at reception we did not like the long wait without being informed about the progress, he made it our problem by telling us he was not informed about it by his staff and by us.    The GM came to offer his apologies and we had a much appreciated conversation about hospitality. He offered us transport to the airport. Biggest surprise however was the club and harbor view upgrade he arranged for us at the InterContinental HongKong. Wow!  We are confident the current GM will 'fix' the problems/details mentioned and the hotel will only get better in the near future. Hope to return.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474408636~“Character hotel.”~Great. Hotel, quiet location. friendly staff. Views from roof top pool is refreshing, so check about functions before you book. It Would have been lovely to lie by the pool, but it was closed to hotel guests on sat afternoon. ☹️~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472993341~“Fantastic Harbour Side Hotel Experience”~The Intercontinental Double Bay is an excellent hotel experience. The reception from the friendly staff is warm and welcoming with no issue too much for them to respond to. A lovey environment surrounds the hotel with a short walk to amazing harbour views, restaurants and cafes. The rooms are modern and very well appointed.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472530063~“Great place”~An enjoyable stay with all the luxuries. The check in was fast and efficient, and the front desk staff were very helpful with a few enquiries during my stay. The rooms are large and well appointed, with automatic curtains and sheers. The breakfast was pretty standard, but the coffee was above average. Complimentary water was provided which is always good.  A couple of negatives - the lift is very slow, and the hot water is absolutely scalding. Be careful with youngsters.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471719197~“My new favorite hotel in Sydney”~This hotel is one of the best hotels in Sydney. The design of the facilities and rooms are excellent. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and have quality features and fixtures. The staff are warm and genuine. The hotel while large also feels like a boutique hotel. Double Bay is a great area to explore with beautiful views, great shopping and entertainment and 5 mins from the city. Going to have a stay-cation here again very soon.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470282366~“Beautiful hotel and room”~Was fourtunante enough to stay overnight recently in one of the intercontinental's rooms overlooking the courtyard.

I look forward to my next stay overnight.. hopefully soon.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_470006099~“Hookers!”~Very poor service from the lack of greeting by concierge to poor assistance from the manager then just to top everything off, saw two very obvious hookers walk past us in the lobby here today! While this would be totally fine for some, maybe reconsider staying here with the family!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469985224~“Shortest visit in history”~Two words: doubled booked. Left the hotel with no option to stay but still had to run the gauntlet of the rude concierge team, who made us wait 20 minutes for our bags after we had checked them in to a room that became no longer available to us. A confusing experience and hospitality at its worse.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468449990~“Awesome all round!”~Intercontinental is always a great spot to stay, but double bay has been the best so far. The staff are friendly and attentive and the rooms are excellent.

review_467421707~“Beautiful location, hotel and some great staff”~We have always loved the Intercontinental, even before it was the Intercontinental. It is beautiful and elegant and fabulous service. Christina in the club lounge was brilliant, as were two of the male staff that helped us. It is definitely one of the better club lounges in Australia, particularly in flexibility and service. The Shangrila was also fabulous, just bigger with more staff. The decor at the Intercontinental is calming and stylish. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Very smooth visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465695009~“Beautiful pool ”~What isn't there to love about this hotel. Great location , beautifully appointed rooms, great service and potentially the most beautiful pool and roof top bar in all of sydney. I stayed here for a week and loved every minute of it~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465201033~“Totally brilliant”~Lovely hotel in a fab location with brilliant and very responsive staff. Very comfortable and a perfect place to stay in Sydney away from the city centre. Well worth paying for a bay view room. Can't fault them and we will be back. Thanks!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465086489~“OK Hotel but not as wonderful as other InterContinentals”~A very nice hotel in am upscale business/residential location. The hotel was previously a Four Seasons. The neighborhood reminds me of a Palm Beach type upscale area with very high quality restaurants and shops. The physical hotel is very nice - but not spectacular. Of course the service is great, bar/restaurants were very good but not spectacular (also stayed at InterContinental Sydney and Melbourne where were both spectacular).  I stayed two nights at the InterContinental Double Bay before a cruise. The front desk assistant manager, Kate, did not seam to care that I was a Spire Level and did not make me feel as welcome as ALL OTHER IHG properties I have stayed at throughout the world. She seamed very arrogant. Another Manager, I think his name was Richard or Robert was more helpful the next day and did seam to care about my IHG status.  The rooms at the Double Bay were very nice and roomy. All the usual IHG InterContinental Amenities were there.  The taxi into downtown Sydney was about $20 Aus during rush hour. I did not take an Uber which would have been better.  I would recommend the InterContinental Sydney over the Double Bay if visiting Sydney. The IHG Sydney (in downtown Sydney) was terrific in every way. Staff more customer focused.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464672137~“Bar staff need a refresher in customer service. ”~Whilst I understand Friday afternoons can be busy in a bar, that is no reason to let professionalism lapse. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel and I expect the equivalent service. Unfortunately I got a surly attitude with no customer service at all. Very disappointing from a quality hotel group.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464656982~“Great hotel”~Great hotel, friendly staff, nice quiet out of the way location. The gym is off site and leaves a bit to be desired unless you want to lift free weights or run on a treadmill next to a big window. Very fish-bowlish.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463723277~“Great place to stay”~Double Bay Intercontinental was the perfect place to stay for a few nights at the start of our three week visit to Australia. Its been recently refurbished I think and the rooms and public areas are very tasteful with some great Art. We had a bay view and loved getting the ferry to and from the main tourist area. It shows Sydney harbour at its best and if we didnt want to use the ferry or the times didnt suit we just got an Uber cab. The roof top bar and pool was also an excellant place to relax and get over jetlag. Would definitely stay again!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461283622~“Pleasant but not outstanding ”~We decided on the spur of the moment to spend the night away. We found a discounted room $550 per night including breakfast. The room was clean, spacious and well set out. The bathroom was large and clean also. The water pressure was somewhat lacking. The lounge area is pleasant and the staff were very good. Down sides, scuffed marked paintwork in many areas - room, hallways etc. Being charged for internet - really ! $10 for one hour or $25 for the day. It's not the dark ages anymore. This should be free for guests, particularly at the price charged Breakfast, the bacon was appalling, the buffet offering bland and not worth the $25 per head - in the room charge  It was nice to stay but not enough to feeling compelled to return~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459482353~“A plush oasis in the heart of Double Bay”~I stayed here for 3 nights last year for working holiday. The hotel itself is very plush and opulent looking with their Gatsby-esque Art Deco gin bar called the Stillery and entrance. The rooms are quite standard in size with a King end and Juliette balcony which looked out to the courtyard (there are many different aspects you can request). The room was nice and fitted out with a table to work on, tv and sofa, similar to what most corporate hotels have except more luxe. When we arrived there were complimentary chocolates on arrival although I don't eat sugar however it was a nice gesture and touch. The room was comfortable, standard but roomy in size and clean however the biggest let down was the bathroom. It was disappointing as it looked tired with the tiles having black marks due to wear and the worst part was the water pressure was absolutely shocking, a drinking fountain has more. Not what you would expect for the Intercontinental brand. For someone who very long thick hair, it was painful, so for guests who have similar heads, may I suggest booking into the Blow Dry Boutique on nearby Cross St to have a wash and blow dry for $40 because once you finish washing your hair in the shower, don't even bother about the hair dryer! I don't understand how 5 star hotels do not have good hairdryers. It is one thing that all 5 star luxury hotels should have! I was also disappointed that the toiletries were very average and expected a higher end boutique range. Lucky I had packed my own. I had just returned from Emirates One & Only Wolgan Valley where the amenities are beyond exceptional with proper salon level Parlux hair dyers and beautiful toiletries locally made organic shampoos, conditioners, bath salts, moisturisers the list goes on. I must say having come straight from Wolgan Valley probably isn't fair to make comparisons but it really did make me realise the vast difference of ultra luxury to 5 star hotel. However in saying that, the staff were all very professional and smart especially the front of house manager. The concierge were fantastic and all in all a great spot to stay as the location is a nice distance between the city and Bondi beach for those who do not want to be in the city. The other positive is that there are great restaurants, bars and clubs around the hotel, literally 2 min walk so that comes in very handy in case you have had one too many. Finally, the rooftop was a great place to chill after a night out, however I was expecting the pool and lounge area to be bigger in the likes Soho House, the Standard etc. There is not much room if it's a hot day and the pool is not overly big so it's more like a long plunge pool. The view is lovely looking out to all the boats in Double Bay and the sunsets are something else! However this is the only hotel in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney that I would stay at for a holiday or weekend away unless you stay in Bondi.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458592269~“Weekend in Double Bay”~This Hotel is very nice. Located in the heart of Double Bay it has everything close by.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.  The lounge areas are very relaxing and comfortable.  Our bedroom is on the 4th floor with views our Sydney Harbour.  It is expensive but hey it is Double Bay. Definitely worth a visit~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458443320~“Charming ”~Loved the way we were greeted with afternoon tea , while they readied our room .  The room was lovely as was the service , club facilities and the food . The ferry ride was the icing on the cake  Only spanner in the works was when I had to call thrice , be disconnected half a dozen times before our toothbrushes and shaving kit was brought to the room .  We will be back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458170387~“Perfection”~I stayed here the night before my wedding. I enjoyed the most fabulous experience imaginable. Even as a long time Double Bay resident I was so impressed. The staff, particularly concierge Medhi, went to incredible lengths to make my best friend and I feel special. We enjoyed a stunning Bayside suite, bubbles on arrival, tremendous service and surprise champagne the morning after. It made a wonderful weekend in my life absolutely perfect. The hotel is gorgeous, glamorous and exclusive. Splash out and stay here for a special occasion.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457021697~“Nice hotel with uneven service”~I enjoyed the departure from the ordinary. It was nice to stay in a quite and classy area of Sydney. And the hotel reflects the attitude of the area. Rooms were very comfortable with a balcony large enough to stand on but not big enough to lounge on. But the best place to lounge is the Rooftop pool area. Top-notch service from the staff there. Also excellent service from all staff members at the front desk. I used them in lieu of the concierge because they were more helpful and knowledgeable and easier to physically access right off the elevator bank. I was confused about the main dining room being closed on both nights during my visit and would have appreciated an honest answer. Bar and lounge staff were distracted and unable to offer solid recommendations. I would have appreciated a more welcoming tone and a helpful suggestion. Nevertheless I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_456548991~“Comfortable, classic hotel with good service”~This Intercontinental is in a quiet suburb with lovely views over Double Bay (but be sure to request a room with view). It's very comfortable and staff are efficient. The area has stylish cafes and bars - be aware it's a short walk to the ferry terminal and sea shore (there's an outdoor seawater pool at Redleaf, near the ferry terminal, although the hotel has its own rooftop pool (closed when we were there due to rain in mid summer!)). The minibar, drinks etc. are expensive, and the hotel hosts weddings etc. so not really a place for a touring/family holiday - unless for a special occasion or if (like us) you have a particular reason for choosing this location, which is great for the Eastern suburbs and the atmospheric beaches known better to locals (Watson's Bay, Shark Bay, and the elegant Rose Bay, for example). Recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_456065927~“Like Home”~Friendly staff man this brilliantly situated comfortable hotel. It is expensive and has a few faults such as curtains that do not quite reach the floor.

review_454320830~“Beautifully refurnished but lacks a little energy”~We stayed with our family at the hotel before Christmas and were really looking forward to seeing the refurbishment and understanding all of the hype. We were expecting a lot but got a little disappointed in the energy of the place. The rooms are beautiful and we had great views of the water, the service was great during check in but i was expecting the hotel to be a little more vibrant and alive. We had drinks in the bar and the clientele was not what i was expecting. The breakfast area is nice but there wasn't a big range of food to choose from and the service was very slow with very few people there to serve. Overall an average experience but this could be due to us expecting a lot more.~3~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan

The rooms are very light and well furnished. Our room had a small balcony which was nice to be able to let in some fresh air at times. The room amenities were excellent as is the bar, restaurant and pool areas. Staff are very accommodating. We will definitely stay there again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_452014357~“Location & ambience make this a top spot to stay”~The only thing that stopped this being a 5 star review was an unevenness in the service from the staff. Some staff were excellent, others not so much. Its not as though the service was bad, it wasn't, but things that other 5 star hotels do without a second thought this hotel seemed to struggle with. A couple of examples - our room was not ready when we arrived, no problem we went for walk and returned 2 hours later to be told it still wasn't ready when it fact no-one had followed up to see if it was ready which became apparent while I stood at reception..... once in our room it took 2 calls over 30 minutes to get our bag delivered. Neither issue was a big deal, my point is that these things just get done in other hotels without the guest needing to chase. Having said that the room was a great size (King), bed very comfortable, A/C in the room worked brilliantly, the general feel in the hotel was one of relaxed elegance. We spent a couple of hours at the rooftop bar and the service we received from the waitress was very very good - it was a great spot to be on a hot Sydney afternoon. Location of the hotel in Double Bay suited us fine.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~3~nan
review_451837786~“2 night stop over ”~Never stayed in Double Bay before , time for a change and not stay in the city .  First impression was great looked forward to staying .  We arrived and parked our car in the driveway, we were asked by the concierge employee ( the tall staff member ) to hurry up because he can't have our car in the driveway.  He said he would take care of the windows ( that were down ) and make sure they were up .  We were hurried out of the way .  After 1 day I needed to go to my car , the windows were all down .  Thankfully nothing was taken .  Staff did not really care .  I was not greeted at reception as a club member .  We had a village view room which was nice .  Room was clean and tidy and looked great.  Kids loved it .  Bed was comfortable and we all slept well .  Pool deck / bar was fantastic, great views and staff were great .  Lounge bar was great .  The only negatives were the concierge desk not very helpful and very rude .  $50 valet parking is very steep .  The lack of care for my property ( my car ) was very annoying .  Overall we had a great stay.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451637705~“NICE COMFORTABLE HOTEL”~We stayed at this hotel as a change to staying in the city. Once you have walked around the shops a couple of times there isn't much else to do. The shops are pretty high end and nice to roam around. The hotel itself is lovely. We had a club room and all the staff in the Club Lounge were fantastic. All very helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough for you. I would definitely recommend taking a Club room. Our room was large too with a lovely sitting area and balcony. The pool isn't very big and its on the rooftop and while we were there it was full of kids jumping in and out so not very relaxing. I wouldnt recommend more than a couple of nights stay here.~4~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451555543~“Beware: Rooftop Pool/Bar & Private Functions”~I booked a night at the Intercontinental on 1st of December to celebrate my partners 30th in style with the rooftop/pool the number one reason we booked the hotel. Without any prior notice, alerts or an email to let us know we found upon checkout that the entire rooftop pool/bar was booked out for a private function and we could not go up there for the night. Sent email feedback to the hotel, never heard back. (Expedia Itin# 7212823965668)  Very disappointing experience - if you're booking this hotel for the rooftop pool/bar like us then don't bet on it being available at all for hotel guests despite it being the main photo on all booking sites and in all the copy selling the place.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451329038~“One of the Worse InterCon ever”~My wife checked us in u der her membership and name so they did not have any records of my status etc however we booked our family for a 2 night stay as we had a family reunion in Double Bay. When we got there it was extremely hot and we were given room 216, upon entering it looked nice however when we went onto the Balcony we found a lighter and 6 cigarette butts. The family wanted to go for a swim as I had a dinner meeting, and when we were at the pool , the are was crowded with the majority being non-guests and very apparent that they were enjoying some other recreational substance. My wife then told me that after I had left one of the "happy visitors" took their towels. We ordered aTurn Down Service, but that. Ever came either. They ordered room service two of the meals were kids meals one Pizza for my wife. The Kids burger was burnt. I sauce and no taste. The Pizza inedible!  Then came the time to sleep! I e spent last year over 188 nights in 5 star hotels, and my family have also spent a considerable amount of time in 5 stars and we have never ever had such a horrible night sleep as we did here. The mattress felt like they were full of rocks and everyone of us had back pain and slept poorly! I went and spoke to the Assistant Manager, Jeremy, who to his credit was very genuine about our concerns and deducted the rooms service and car parking which was appreciated but not expected. Even when we checked out Jeremy came in on his Day Off which was very appreciated. We found Jarrett to be absolutely wonderful and very sincere! He was genuinely surprised, but took our concerns on board. I doubt. Dry much we would ever stay there again as it's not family friendly, but I do highly commend Jeremy once again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We have stayed here before when it was the Sir Stamford. The hotel has been nicely upgraded and is a definite improvement. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. We did not eat in the hotel. Good location if you have a car. Many shops and good restaurants well within a very short walk~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_451185887~“Modern with a not so great staff”~We found the rooms updated with the latest technology , that included a control to operate the lights and blinds, but I had to have the bathroom cleaned twice when I checked in, you could clearly see lipstick and urine spots on the floor and the room hadn't been dusted in days. When this was reported to the front desk, they seemed less than willing to address the issue but did and offered free breakfast, which was a good experience. Modern updated hotel with a not so great front office and cleaning staff.~5~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan

One morning we had no soap...lol maid forgot to replace.. When we called to have bed light fixed the repairman said it would take him 1hr and he would have to move the bed. You would think they would have come and fixed the next day when we were out. no.. They staff were all very nice and professional.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan

Its upmarket village environment has an eclectic mix of cafes and restaurants, exquisite fashion boutiques, and with easy access to stunning parks and beaches. The hotel is in the heart of the village. It offers the luxurious facilities of a high-end establishment, but the staff attitude and capability is truly exceptional. It has proven to be a perfect base for our three week holiday around Sydney. We'll be back!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_440244792~“Weekend stay on IHG Rewards Points”~Overall a good experience, friendly welcome and service from the Club Intercontinental staff (especially Sothea) and our later checkout was very welcomed. The Double Bay area is relaxed compared to other parts of Sydney with a good variety of restaurants and local shopping a short walk from the hotel. The hotel is well located in this regard, with access to the ferry terminal a short walk away should you wish to go to other parts of Sydney the scenic way. Probably the only thing we didn't like was that the rooftop pool bar area was accessible to the public, perhaps this should be kept only for hotel guests, however I assume this is a business decision by the hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439371697~“Disgraceful. Where is the security?”~Our stay at the Intercontinental Double was enjoyable, but unfortunately a few shortfalls have left me lost for words. As for the décor and elegance of the hotel, I don’t think I have much more to add that hasn’t already been said. It is a very classy, tasteful hotel, located in a very nice area in Double Bay. The rooms are very nice, bedding is comfortable, bathrooms are spacious, and the only disappointment was that our iron did not work properly. We were staying for just 1 night to celebrate an anniversary, and to our delight, the hotel offered us complimentary drinks at one of the bars or restaurants as congratulations. We went up to the rooftop bar to order some cocktails before dinner, expecting to kick start our evening with a beautiful sunset and something nice to drink.  When we arrived there was one table of people having a quiet dinner, and another large group of people having drinks. As we were ordering our drinks one man from the large group went over to the pool area and started stripping off. We had just sat down in front of the pool area when we noticed the man had jumped in the pool completely nude, with the group spurring him on and becoming very loud. Ourselves and the other table of people became quite awkward, as the man got out of the pool and didn’t put his clothes back on. Instead, with the encouragement of his friends, he begins to do lunges and full leg spreads right in front of us! What a disappointment. We had come up to enjoy the beautiful view from the roof, only to have a drunken bunch of pigs carry on and spoil everyone’s enjoyment. There were 3 staff members present, one man behind the bar and one young woman, who only looked on disapprovingly. Another man, who I’m assuming was a manager, quickly took a photo of the incident and then disappeared, possibly to call the police. We told the barman to not worry about making our drinks anymore as we wanted to leave, to which they said we could go down to the bar inside and order something. As we were leaving, the large group of people made a few rude comments to us about leaving, to which my husband abruptly told them that their behaviour was disgraceful.  Frankly, I find this appalling. What a disgrace for a high end, reputable brand like Intercontinental to allow this to happen. The staff should have warned the man to not undress, but they just stood there and watched. No consequences or warnings were communicated. They should have had security at the bar, as I can probably safely assume these people were not hotel guests and supposed their behaviour was not accountable to anyone. Other bars and clubs have security, so I find it completely unwise that Intercontinental have NOTHING. The staff were not adequately trained to deal with this situation, and just stood there in disbelief.  Furthermore, I cannot believe that Intercontinental are happy to allow anyone off the street up to the rooftop bar and allow them to commit a criminal offence without consequence, forcing paying hotel guests to either leave or finish their dinner in discomfort. Perhaps the police were called and they did not turn up – I don’t know, but while we sat in the indoor bar we saw no one go up or anyone from the large group come down from the rooftop. I can understand Intercontinental must rely on getting business off the street for the bar, but I believe it is completely unacceptable to allow this behaviour, angering paying guests, and then not even throwing out the man who was naked. Hotel guests shouldn't have to leave! With the use of platforms like Tripadvisor it’s far too easy to communicate to multiple tens of thousands of readers what a disgrace this set up is. Perhaps instead of losing hotel guests who would be put off by this situation, not matter how upperclass the hotel is, it would be easier to either ban walk ins off the street, or employ security. Whilst the reception staff were apologetic when we informed them of the incident and brought us more complimentary drinks, it’s frustrating to see how complaints are brushed off so quickly. Obscene exposure is a criminal offence, and I don’t doubt that the man faced no consequence whatsoever. Whilst I would’ve loved to return to this hotel, I don’t feel like I want to anymore.~2~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_437025409~“Husbands birthday treat”~Friendly welcome at reception, although early check which had been requested in advance was not quite ready. Roof top pool and bar area was very nice, with great views of Double bay. Service was a little slow but forgiving!  Our Room was well appointed and beautifully decorated. Bed was very comfy, pillows excellent. We especially liked the electric curtains. Communal areas were smart, clean and sophisticated. Overall a very pleasant experience.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_436681059~“An Intercontinental letdown”~With a brand name like Intercontinental, I expected far more. Check-in was slow, only one person at the front desk with many others wandering around aimlessly. Room was small with little wardrobe space and there were no drawers for clothes. For the price being charged the delivery was not very good. Better value hotels elsewhere in Sydney.~2~1~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_435655546~“Great staff, big rooms and top service ”~Stayed here for three nights in august for a conference. Great sized rooms, awesome breakfast buffet and great Gin bar.  Double Bay is circa 3km from the CBD and is a very affluent area. Heaps of cafes etc and great if you want to be just out of the city and closer to Bondi Beach etc. One random thing was the addition of mature ladies or the night that frequent the bar looking for wealthy old guys. They were there every night. Didn't bother me and in fact found it funny.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434933170~“Drinks at the Rooftop and dinner at the Stockman Restaurant”~The Rooftop views are wonderful but the experience is not supported by the service or the list if wines and beers. Service was very slow. Wines were low grade but still cost $16 per 100ml glass. The beer list was disappointing. There is no excuse to serve mass produced beer when Sydney is awash with spectaclar craft beer. The Stockman restaurant has a better level of service but the food lacks imagination and flavour. Again the wine and beer list is second rate and charged at premium prices. Overall a very forgettable venue. The management really need to do more than just over charge for poor food and patchy service.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434446156~“Excellent”~Booked 2 rooms to visit my son who was stopping by in Aus for a week, I have spent a total of 5 nights which I have to say has been excellent , from the moment we arrived concierge was welcoming and helpful promptly taking our bags and directing us to reception, there we were greeted warmly and promptly checked in, not only did we get interconnecting rooms they put us on the same floor as our son which we thought was very thoughtful. The rooms were clean and elegantly modern, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and luxurious, the hotel in general is well maintained and clean. Went on a few occasions to the roof top pool and bar from which we could enjoy beautiful views to the bay, light meals and drinks. If you want to chill out this a great place to be but if there was one place I could fault it would be here as it seemed to take sometime to get our drinks and with the exception of one time there was no table service, this was not a big deal for us as the views and ambiance made it worth the wait. This not a cheap place to stay but as my experience dictates on most occasions you get what you pay for and even though it is on the higher end in terms of hotel accomodation it is well worth it. The hotel is located in the snobby suburb of double bay , there are a number of good eateries around the hotel and numerous high end retail stores that are quite expensive, this is a safe and clean area, just a short walk from the hotel you can hop on the fairy which for $6.90 you can make your way Circular Quays and enjoys amazing views of the opera house and the harbour bridge. Service across the board here was excellent. This is a nice hotel that backs its quality with great service. We will be back!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434119022~“A superb hotel”~This newly renovated, gorgeously appointed hotel is very well situated in Double Bay. The room I had was luxurious, large, comfortable with a sizeable balcony with view on the bay. The spa-like bathroom is sheer joy after a long flight. The staff were efficient and friendly. The rooftop pool and terrace is comfortable and very scenic. A good place to relax.  A small, easily solved problem: driving up to the front door, one has to cross the street to access the driveway. If they changed the direction of the traffic signs, it would make entering a whole lot easier for drivers to pull up.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_432868393~“A few but major flaws”~I was looking forward to staying at the Intercontinental Double Bay, unfortunately it was a disappointing stay. First with the positives, the decor and building itself is pretty. The concierge, bellmen/doormen, cleaners, room service staff and staff in general were friendly, professional, attentive and impressive. The room is spacious and clean. The breakfast was good and had a variety of food. The only flaw for breakfast is that for a 5 star hotel charging high rates per night, they should really have freshly squeezed juice available at no extra charge. Room service was quick and food was delicious. The major issue I had was in regards to security. Unlike most 5 star hotels, there is no security in regards to accessing different floors in the hotel. Anyone regardless of if you are a guest or not, can access all floor levels in the hotel. Personally I found this alarming. In addition, the pool access. Because anyone can head to the pool bar, by late Saturday afternoon there was a sign by hotel staff that the pool was full hence advised guests to stay at the lobby bar. At the same time, I saw non-hotel guests heading up to the pool. This is a bit frustrating. There should be a restriction of non hotel guests having access to the pool/pool bar. Unfortunately because of the security and access issues, I cannot give the hotel higher ratings. I feel for the price I was paying per night and for a 5 star hotel, security and exclusivity are crucial which were lacking at the Intercontinental Double Bay.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_432308742~“Seven nights in two stays”~Stayed at the Intercontinental, Double Bay for a total of seven nights in two different stays. Our first two nights were our first in Australia as we landed on the Friday evening and wanted to stay somewhere fairly close to our friends who live in Rose Bay. Arrived at about 8pm that evening, hotel reception and concierge were efficient and welcoming, after nearly 30 hours of travelling all we wanted was something to eat (and a glass of wine) before heading to bed. Ordered room service - Waygu Beef Burger and Butter Chicken with a bottle of Squeeling Pig, all arrived fairly quickly but some confusion as only a single glass of wine was brought to the room rather than a bottle, very quickly rectified and we were not charged for the extra glass of wine. We were also introduced to the "delights" of Australian GoggleBox that night! The Bay View Rooms are quite large although if you actually want a view of the bay make sure you are on floor 3 or 4 as the balconies are a little larger and you can see into the bay. Very nice hotel with excellent staff and quality fixtures and fittings. Our second (five night) stay was the last few nights of our three week holiday in Australia, we had requested a room on a higher floor and the staff were happy to accommodate us. Room was exactly the same layout as our first stay but had a much better view of the bay. The rooftop bar / pool is nice to visit and I enjoyed a beer one evening there but didn't use the pool at all. For snacks and those little things you forget there is a small convenience store right next door, for larger purchases there is a Woolworths just around the corner across the road (after some confusion I worked out the entrance is actually on the first floor!), there is a ferry terminal in Double Bay and this is a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel, excellent for travelling into the city centre or out to Watsons Bay. An excellent hotel but I'm glad we didn't have to pay the high season room rates (which were three times the price of what we paid in September).~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_432271569~“One of the best in Sydney”~This has to be the best Intercontinental I have stayed at (compared to Fiji, Seoul, Sydney CBD & HK) in terms of the fitout & service. Also has to be the best hotel I have stayed at in Sydney thus far.  We stayed here for 3 nights, unfortunately, we did not have a chance to eat at the restaurant/ club lounge/ or drink at the bar so I cannot comment on that. Because I travel to Sydney a lot for business, I personally prefer to dine at the local rests and there are plenty in the vicinity of the hotel. Nonetheless, the service is extremely courteous, professional and prompt.  We stayed in the village view room. The furnitures/ amenities are modern, stylist, good size and the electronic controls of curtains, lights etc are expected of this standard hotel. The double sink in the bathroom was great for us travelling as a family of 4.  The roof top pool has a nice vibe to it, pool is relatively small, but would make a great spot for a private function/ party overlooking the bay. The gym is usually a let down for me in many 5 star hotels/ resorts, but not here because guest gets access to the snap fitness gym adjacent to the hotel with plenty of equipment. I was able to get a bottle of water and towel from reception before hitting the gym each day. Again, little gestures like this go a long way to enhancing the stay and although is expected of 5 stars hotels, I have stayed in many that seemed to lack in this area. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Sydney with the family. The excellent management and professionalism of the staff made our stay a memorable one despite we were out and about for most of the day during our time here.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431409475~“Sensational spot in Sydney's East”~Went there as part of an evening celebrating our anniversary. The view is sensational and the cocktails second to none... The highlight was our genuine, friendly and capable barman Nicolas who could not have done a better job absolutely spoiling us. We highly recommend making this a regular hangout for locals as well as a special pre-dinner drink experience for any tourists visiting our beautiful city...~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_429539021~“Close to perfect”~We stayed here when it was the Stamford and when it was the Ritz Carlton. It is nice to see such an iconic hotel get a refurb and who better than my beloved Intercontinental brand. I always book directly with the IHG website so booking is never a problem. Despite being a windy and rainy Sydney night when we arrived, the hotel looked superb. Clean and well attended by the valet staff. Check in was friendly and super professional. Our Ambassador status was recognised immediately and a staff member actually accompanied us to our room and showed us round. The property has been beautifully restored and is quiet and comfortable. We had booked Bay View and they offered us Club privileges in lieu of an 'upgrade' so we wouldn't lose the view we had paid for. We didn't use the club facilities as I was there for surgery but the gesture was lovely.  Bay View rooms are the only way to go. Lovely view with little balcony, chairs and table. the rooms we well appointed and the only criticism I had was that it didn't seem to matter what we did, we found it difficult to cool the room. the bathroom had beautiful fittings and all the amenities you would expect in and Intercontinental.  Room service was prompt and decent. The menu is on the television and we didn't think the choices suited the property. There weren't enough options for us. Breakfast buffet was well presented, clean and warm. Location is easy to get to from anywhere in sydney and nice and quiet. There are lots of little restaurants and cafes in easy walking distance and heaps of things to discover in the Double Bay area. I highly recommend this property to business travellers and groups of friends. I can't wait to stay again soon.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_429008005~“Relaxing, Quiet and will be back”~This is the first time I have ventured out of the Intercontinental in Sydney and was pleasantly surprised. Stayed for 3 nights from Thursday and booked on the club level. The club is very nice and was not as full as the club level in the CBD can get. The staff were all very helpful and there was a wide array of options for you to choose from. The room we had overlooked double bay on the higher levels and was well appointed, although there was no desk making it difficult if you wanted to work from your room. Check in was easy, as was checking out - indeed our entire stay was great!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_428309577~“First tme”~I wish to compliment the exceptional service I received from the Intercontinental from the day my husband & I arrived to our departure Special mention to Mr Potaka the duty manager who unexpectedly turned a problem we encountered over a noice situation into a positive, we really did not expect this approach and truely we were very appreciative to him for taking this extra step to make our stay special. Thank you~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_427550933~“Nice relaxing stay”~We stayed two nights over the weekend in early September. The suite was spacious and the balcony was looking over the village and the beautiful bay. The hotel is close to the beach as well - a bit too cold to swim in September, but the beach looked lovely. The restaurant on the ground floor named Sake had some awsome food and drinks. The bathroom was huge and the toiletries were perfect (though we were not sure why room attendants threw away perfectly fine, still full, used soap and bottles). Towers were all replaced next day as well although we did not want them to be changed (we didn't place them in the bath tub). Not sure whether the hotel thought about environmental impacts caused by wasted goods. Club lounge had wonderful afternoon teas. Canape was good but we thought Intercontinental Sydney CBD had a better one. We wanted to check out a rooftop pool but couldn't because there was a party at the bar right next to the pool for nearly all afternoon and it was very noisy. We went to check for a couple of times, but were not successful. Service was fantastic! Everyone in the hotel (reception, concierge, and club counge) was professional, knowledgeable and helpful. Thank you so much!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_426873197~“Lovely Boutique Hotel... Just missing the 1 percenters”~Stayed 3 nights as a family with 1 child. Received a lovely welcome at the entrance and was shown to go upstairs to check-in. Check-in was fine - nothing special. Was not told about anything of the hotel... i.e. where to have breakfast, any restaurants or even how to get to the pool. Room is spacious - overlooking the street with a balcony on 5th floor. For a 5 star hotel, I think these days given the space in the room, I would expect 2 x queen beds. A family would struggle in the 2 x double beds and made sleeping a challenge.  Rooftop pool was amazing and the view very worthwhile. However, I felt the food and beverage was a let down. For $15 for a glass of wine I would expect 150ml. But, when I received my glass it was clear that it was more like 120ml. When questioning the star she said she had measured it in something before putting it in the glass! really who does that. When I asked how many ml's she ignored the question. Wen to order hot chips for daughter and was told not possible as there was no fryer. Which I understand, however when I asked if I could order from room service was given a flat NO. Even though we were on 5th floor and they could have just gone up 1 more floor. Room service - 30 minute wait. Asked if the kids $18 mini burgers came with chips - NO. Can I switch one of the burgers for chips... Immmm I will have to ask! Really? The answer was yes. Just wanted the meat and lettuce... it comes with meat, lettuce, tomato and tomato sauce! Complained and said don't worry about it. Got a phone call half hour later said another one was on the way. Did not want another and as way too late. Drinks in the main bar were great and the staff were fabulous with our chid and friends child. Aside from these few issues, thought the style and location of the hotel were fantastic and would stay again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_426699549~“This place is epic to the max”~It's gorgeous. Staff are top top notch and super attentive. Food, drinks and pool and bar on the roof rock! My birthday, and they did a birthday sweets tasting plate with candles for me. The bar snacks are delicious. The room service was great. The view and the vibe is so sleek and relaxing. Rooms gorgeous with marble bathrooms and comfy beds. Literally the only thing that they need is the Foxtel E entertainment channel. Too many sport and business channels.  Oh, and the breakfast... Amazing selection in such a beautiful dining area.  I want go go back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_423661181~“Nice stay but disappointed ”~I stayed for two nights for a work conference. All was very nice, great location, rooms were lovely and the service excellent. The only negative was I had some money taken (by the cleaning staff) that was sitting in my table. It was only change (about $8) and I know it is my responsibility to to make sure all valuables are in a safe etc but a hotel of this caliber I would expect more. I did tell reception and all I got was a sorry and we'll look into it. Maybe better screening of staff for a hotel of this standard. I was looking at coming back for a weekend with my wife but I'll try somewhere else.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_422288420~“Lovely location”~For many years we have stayed in downtown Sydney, but decided to try Double Bay, a near CBD suburb. The quiet location was in stark contrast to the bustle of downtown, but the shopping malls and major department stores of the CBD are just a short cab ride away. The leafy and upmarket Double Bay with some fine restaurants and proximity to the beach suited us just fine. We had a suite overlooking the Cross St. I would have preferred a harbour view and will ask for that next visit. The rooms were large and comfortable, with good coffee and tea making facilities. However the lighting was poor, based on standard lamps rather than overheads. At night I had to use a cell phone torch to see the numbers on the in room safe. Rooms are nicely decorated and clean.  Staff are well trained and friendly. The breakfast is as you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but we did not enjoy the food in the ,main dining room and I will avoid eating in the hotel for lunch or dinner. The occupancy was low when we were there third week in September and it did lack some vibe because of this. Will return for sure.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_421250237~“A suburban gem”~This hotel is new enough that my taxi driver in Sydney wasn't sure where it was. The hotel is bright, clean, and tucked away on a leafy street in Double Bay, just a few steps from the suburb's busy thoroughfare, but removed from the hustle and bustle of central Sydney. Highly recommend checking out the hotel's "High Martini," which puts a grown-up spin on the traditional High Tea experience. And walk down to the waterfront to catch a ferry. It's a quick walk, and it's a fun way to explore, rather than taking a bus or cab. Our room had two queen beds and was brightly lit, had a nice spacious bathroom, and pretty views out to the water. The rooftop pool was set up, but no one was there during our visit. I imagine it's a great spot to hang out when the weather gets warm and season kicks in. I really enjoyed this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_419666544~“Intimate 5 Star Luxury”~From the moment you arrive at The Intercontinental Double Bay you know you are going to experience 5 star service. The concierge and reception service is second to none, fast, efficient, professional and friendly. The rooms are true 5 Star with beautiful furnishings, nespresso machine and fine teas by TWG. The mini bar is stocked with fine quality beverages and nibbles. Marble bathroom with bath and separate shower and toilet complete the room. The rooftop pool has incredible harbour views and divine cabanas to relax in while you sip Champagne and take in the sunset. The hotel is located in beautiful leafy double bay. We regularly walked to all attractions including Opera House, Watsons Bay & Rose Bay. The area is filled with wonderful boutiques, restaurants and day spas. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and the Intercontinental Double Bay is without a doubt my favourite. The Service is faultless, this establishment ticks every box for the fussiest traveller. Love it.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
