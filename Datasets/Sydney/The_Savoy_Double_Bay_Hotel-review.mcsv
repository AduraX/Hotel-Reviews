review_467701898~“Reasonable accommodation at a fair price.”~The hotel is very well located in a very nice part of Sydney out of the CBD. Our room was on the top floor and was large. We also had an outdoor private balcony. However no lift access to the top floor - stairs for the last floor. Limited services at the hotel but plenty of restaurants, bars etc in the immediate vicinity.~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_465892909~“Nice hotel great location”~First the hotel is in a great location, pedestrian friendly neighbourhood, nice for walking around a good local pub and plenty of good eateries. Ferry just down the street into city. Room was small as you would expect in a city hotel, wish we could have stayed longer but not in the room we had as no street view.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_465577398~“Small and Quirky ”~Just a two night stay. Rooms are small but ok. Unusual lay out with a big atrium in the middle, no windows or natural light. The lady at reception was less than helpful for change. Location is good for food and shopping.  Derek NZ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463358820~“Not amazing, but just a place to stay”~Quite easy to find hotel in a quiet neighberhood, around 15 minutes walk from the nearest train station, which will connect you with Sydney centre.  The hotel is small, a little out dated as same for the rooms. The room is small, but almost has a same sized bathroom in there. For internet and breakfast had to be paid extra. The hotel is fine, just to stay for a night - else it is quite expensive for the location where it is at.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_462362161~“Very Pleasant stay in Sydney ”~Room was clean and tidy, complementary tea/coffee.  Great position, close to the city centre and public transport.  The area where the hotel is located is very nice, shops, cafes, restaurants and supermarket at walking distance!  Good value for money in Sydney!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460563205~“A little quirky gem ”~What you need to know...  The room is clean! The beds comfortable. Water hot. Air con cold!!! Location is remarkable. And staff extremely welcoming and very friendly. Going above and beyond to make us feel welcome!  It's a quirky little hotel in the middle of an opulent environment!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456312355~“The staff let this place down....”~So we stayed here for 2 nights last weekend. Rooms are good size and the hotel is in a great location. The problem were the staff. We were constantly told off just for talking in our room after 10pm, anyone would think we were staying in a convent. And when I say talking, it was myself and my friend, no one else. We even woke up to a note under the door telling us to be quiet, written in capital letters and quite blunt. Not to mention that the next morning I could hear the staff laughing etc outside my room quite loudly!! Disappointing really as I travel to Sydney almost monthly and this would have been a great hotel to stay at.~2~3~nan~4~nan~nan~1~nan
review_452781242~“Great location, quiet and roomy room”~We organised a Saturday night stay as we were attending a party near-by. A lovely Boutique Hotel situated in the heart of Double Bay. Our Balcony room was of a very generous size and included a King Size bed, Kitchenette, Lounge, Dining Table and a huge bathroom with Spa. Some of the bathroom and Kitchen fittings were a little tired looking but besides that we could not fault the Hotel given the great room rate that we paid.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_451758890~“Not good at all”~Firstly we booked a room that had 5 beds, however the fifth bed was a sofa bed. But not just a little roll away, but a 5cm thick mattress out of the couch.  When it's pulled out there is NO ROOM to walk through. We had to climb over the beds to move around!!!  The stairs are open to the public so you could literally walk onto every floor without a pass.  The bathroom was horrible. The toilet did not flush, and you needed to hold the buttons both down for 20 seconds really hard for any water to flow through. I had to literally pull the toilet apart  The only good thing was the shower pressure. The fan in the bathroom was so noisy, and there was no cover on it.  The beds were nice and the over all room was clean however we were upset with out service and stay.  We also were woken up by the fitness class across the road on Saturday morning. You can hear literally EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL NIGHT LONG there is no sound proofing anywhere. There is LIMITED parking so make sure you get here early otherwise you'll only get two passes over 3 rooms and 15 guests....... not happy about that.  It's enough of a place to sleep and the location is nice but it was not what we expected and that is the Biggest let down !~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451516093~“Great Find”~What a great small hotel in the most perfect location. Just away from the centre of Sydney but with easy quick access by Ferry or train. All the staff day and night were helpful and friendly and our room was spacious and clean. I can't see myself returning to Sydney anytime soon but if I do I would book straight back at the Savoy Double Bay - Thank you for a great stay. Great cafes, restaurants and bars close by but it is not a noisy location~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_447538344~“Quirky Hotel-Superb Location”~Double Bay is a suburb of Sydney, with the homes of the super rich. The most expensive properties in Australia. The Savoy is a small quirky hotel in the middle of all this opulence. We stayed here for ten days and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel was clean and the rooms were comfortable and well appointed. Being in the busiest part of the suburb we thought it would be noisy but it wasn't. The staff were friendly and eager to help. Double Bay is a great place to window shop but unless you've got deep pockets you won't be able to afford the prices. Using an Opal card you can use the train to get into Sydney's centre or better still use the ferry. There's also a very nice small beach for sunbathing or going for a swim.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_447416383~“Quaint Motel in the Middle of Double Bay”~Clean, comfortable and in the middle of Double Bay. Savoy Hotel is a great place to stay. Friendly staff who helped with advice on restaurants. Would recommend for short stays. Motel room style with king bed and 2 singles in our room, separated by closing bifold doors. Bathroom small but serviceable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445698592~“reasonable stay”~hotel could use a real good clean up. the first room i was put into had a broken double bed and the shower kept filling up with water, obviously a drainage issue there. i complained as i wasn't able to sleep on the bed, i wasn't happy when the guy at reception told me 'its not broken' but wouldnt actually sit on it to find out! anyway, he did move me to another room which was so much better.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_445451893~“Great Value, Clean room, Excellent location and Friendly staff”~Needed to stay near a function mid week and this Hotel was great. It's affordable,usual small fridge i.e. no mini bar (not licensed), clean and very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I did not utilise many services or have breakfast so can't comment too much but the location is excellent with many possible local choices eg: from cheap to fine dining for dinner/lunch etc. Highly recommend.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_439643078~“Good stay”~Stayed for one night when volunteering for the 2016 Australian golf at nearby Royal Sydney golf club! What a good find! Stayed in room 104. Very clean bedding, big room and hot shower also a continental breakfast for $8.50 each made this a reasonable price stay, will stay here again. Staff friendly. Stayed midweek. Some minor drawbacks: 1)Shower area drain has glass frame covering half of it, so water rising over sill into bathroom floor.2) No outside window! window looked onto a atrium type area which was messy--and lit, shining into room even with blockout blind down. A/ Cond good but had to have on all night.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_437292040~“Comfort and value in an expensive suburb”~We stayed for one Saturday night, while attending a wedding. We had booked a superior double room but were upgraded to a very large room with seating area, spa bathroom and kitchenette. There was also a deck area, which could only be reached from outside the room. The furniture and fittings were a little dated, but the room had everything needed,was quiet and the bed large and comfortable. We did not access the Wifi, so are unable to comment. The staff were friendly and very informative about the street parking which is free 6pm--9am and all day Sunday. There is also separate undercover parking which costs $25 overnight. The location is in the centre of Double Bay, an upmarket Sydney Harbour-side suburb, and right next to cafes, restaurants, great pubs, boutique shopping,parks, taxis, buses and the ferry to the CBD, beaches and harbour attractions. I doubt that there is better value in Sydney, considering the location.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_432538202~“Does the job for a good night sleep”~Sydney CBD is getting a bit pricy for what's on offer, the Savoy did the job for are three night stay, firstly Beautiful Double Bay is very close to the city it offer great public transport as for the Savoy it's location is central property seemed very fresh & presents well, staff all super helpful it also presents equal distance to Bondi, Kings Cross & the CBD~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430646132~“So so”~As a little boutique hotel, the Savoy provides a room with all the basics, fresh sheets/towels, a/c and very hot showers. The locality is right in the centre of Double Bay shops & cafes which is sometimes noisy and parking difficult & expensive. Our king size bed was two singles with a hard join that made cuddling uncomfortable. The level of cleanliness was poor and disappointing. A useful feature was a common kitchen with microwave, sink, dishes, cutlery and ice-maker. The breakfast option was $7.50 pp in an honesty box, which must work or it would have been discontinued.~3~nan~4~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_421306935~“Dirty and Noisy!”~We were so disappointed with our stay at the Savoy! We knew it was going to be basic as it's an old hotel and my mother in law had visited to check it out before we arrived. When we got there and walked into the room there was a pharmacy bag under the bed and towels left unfolded on the bed which gave the illusion the room wasn't cleaned properly. There was mould all through the shower so we wore thongs every time we showered as it clearly wasn't cleaned properly. I moved the bedside table away to charge a phone and there was a dust balls behind that had been there for years. The noise was also horrific which kept me awake from the cleaners in the hallway to the people walking upstairs and the gym across the lane pumping music at 6:30am in the morning. This place could be great with a good clean but will always be noisy so i recommend ear plugs. Staff were really accommodating. Great location.~2~nan~nan~1~nan~1~4~nan
review_421015081~“Great Location Great Price”~I have visited The Savoy a number of times for my trips to Sydney and have always found this place to be exactly what I need. As other reviewers agree its not the flashest hotel, but it is a nice room, clean, and in a fantastic location. I had originally booked a standard room but when I came to check-in, the guy at the service desk upgraded my room for free! I didn't even need to ask! The location is fantastic with an awesome cafe (Taste of Europe) just up the road, and just down the road is a wonderful pub for a decent priced meal. Whenever I am in the area, this is the hotel I choose~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_418656416~“Great little hotel in an excellent locale”~Had a great short stay at the Savoy in Double Bay. The Savoy was clean, quiet and well situated. Lots of cafes and restaurants close by and I think a small local market on Thursdays. I had a family room to myself, two singles and a Queen. Only complaint was the lock on the door was a bit flimsy. I recommend the Savoy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415610114~“Best Value and great location”~I yesterday stayed at the Savoy in Double bay - have stayed a number of times over the years and tho it isn't a flash Hotel it is very well run, great attention from the Staff at the Desk, very clean rooms. Not luxury by any means but clean, and secure. The Savoy is in just the best location at Doubler bay, walking distance to the lovely Restaurants and Cafes shops and hairdresser. Not far from the Harbour - good walks near by.and handy to public transport.~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_408531446~“Good accommodation for the price”~Very nice service from most of the staff especially from Katrina and Patrick. Price wise, good accommodation. Quiet. We stay there often. We always get a window or a balcony room. ACs could be cleaner. Sometimes the card swipe in the lift doesn't work. Blankets could be more comfortable - like duvets.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_381382756~“STORMAGEDDON WEDDING”~Despite the torrential weather this hotel provided a lovely, comfortable room with a view of Knox Street. For $147 on a Friday night in Double Bay it struck me as very good value. The bathroom was modern. The room was not large but was fine for a 1 night stay. I had a good night's sleep - the bed was very comfy. Staff at reception were very friendly. If needed I would return there.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_379572998~“Okay”~We recently spent 3 nights at this hotel. The staff when we arrived and throughout our stay was very helpful. The room was nice and clean. The bathroom clean but the ceiling could have done with a lick of paint. There's lots of cafes and some restaurants close by and lots of upmarket shops. One little complaint would be the breakfast. It was cheap enough but i personally didn't like the set up but that's just a little niggle i had.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_377249202~“Family run older hotel in the center of Double Bay, convenient and well priced.”~Staff was very friendly and helpful. I had one the base level rooms and it was fine although not terribly large, would recommend the upgraded room. Location is really good, staff was always helpful.

review_373965076~“Lovely stay.”~Stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed the stay very much. Great location for shopping and restaurants. Parking costs extra but access is quite good. Rooms were comfortable and quiet also had a great balcony. Only issue was that there was a lift for the first 3 floors but we were on the fourth. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Basic continental breakfast was more than adequate and great value.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_366617345~“Terry”~I found The Savoy a unique, well kept and satisfying accommodation choice and I would find it hard to pass it by on future visits to Sydney. The location is wonderful since there are 3 choices of transport to the city and up towards South Head within a short walk from the hotel, while Double Bay is a beautiful suburb. Also the staff were friendly and helpful.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_358743233~“Very nice hotel - good value”~Stayed for four nights over the week days in a superior A room. It was a nice neat hotel that was close to restaurants, cafes and bars. The room had modern decor and had an outlook over Knox Street. The room wasn't massive but was of a good size and with a nice sized bathroom.  The hotel was a bit noisy, with sounds from the street including people and traffic noise (the occasional loud car or bike) at night and general noise in the morning from the corridors, but I know they offer rooms in quieter areas if this bothers you. Unfortunately a shop next door was being renovated and the sound of power tools in the mornings spoiled some sleep-ins, although this wasn't the hotel's fault, it would of been nice if this had been mentioned.  We were in easy reach of buses from the main road, New South Head Road, to go into the city or to Bondi Junction for shopping and it helps having a Woolworths nearby if you need some supplies. The staff were helpful and friendly and my room was clean and well presented.  My only complaints were the bathroom extraction fan wasn't working, the bathroom window was high up and out of reach and open a crack letting in more street noise than I'd like (probably open because the fan was broken). The water pressure was low and the tap was hard to position right to get in the goldilocks zone, it seemed to be either scolding or stone cold. But these are really minor annoyances as all in all it was a good hotel and good value. I'd stay again.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356089130~“Poor acoustics....unless you like noise”~Situated in one of Sydney's finest suburbs, the building is archaic and unsuited for use as a hotel. Let me continue- my room was situated adjacent to the reception which was, as it eventuated, convenient for making complaints. My neighbours above had a room party and I heard crashing and noises all night long. I finally complained around 3.00am and the porter attended the offending room. Later he told me that "some guests left the room and they were tipsy". I complained again at 4.00am however, when the porter visited my room the talking noises had diminished and he said he could only hear birds ( perhaps they were complaining too!). I cannot blame the Porter for the lack of sound insulation however that parties upset paying sleepless guests is surely an issue for a hotel and I was made to feel that I was a problem..... I should have been grateful that the noise had been reduced at 3.00am?~1~nan~nan~1~2~nan~2~nan
review_352569685~“Shabby, dirty and not befitting of Double Bay”~My business partner and I got the two last rooms - "family rooms" which means four beds jammed into too small a space and a shower/basin/toilet in a space so small one could not use the toilet without closing the bathroom door. The rooms were dirty - as in pubic hairs in the bathroom - and the musty smell was indicative of the lack of air conditioning in a too humid environment. This is not a hotel that fits into the upscale Double Bay. I would NOT recommend you stay there at even 1/10th the price. I could not get the front desk to answer the phone to give me the internet code so I finally gave up and slept in my clothing.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_351023627~“The worst hotel ever”~We came here for a girls weekend. We are pretty low key people. We weren't expecting much, but this place really was appalling.  Loud leaking aircon that cleaning staff left a bucket underneath with a rolled up towel to help absorb the noise. When we asked reception to fix it he suggested turning on the heater or turning off the air con.  There were cockroaches, the twin room booked for two people twin share had a double bed and only one towel.  Really average service and below average rooms.  Great location.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_350143234~“You get what you pay for!”~Great location close to lovely restaurants, boutique shopping, beach/harbour front. The downside is that it was not clean - saw a cockroach in the bathroom, the bathroom door was filthy, the floor hadn't been cleaned in the downstairs breakfast eating area and place mats on the table were dirty. The room was nicely decorated and had the basic facilities. Could open the window for fresh air but the room overlooked a noisy lane way where very noisy fitness training was going early in the morning. The room was directly opposite the lift and the hallway was cluttered with furniture and bags of linen. The reception is located on the first floor and had to climb the stairs or the lift to get there. Staff were friendly. Overall the location is great and reasonably priced but the hotel needs a lot of maintenance.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_346777277~“Location”~Right in the heart of double bay this is a fabulous, unpretentious little hotel. Sensational location. We just had a basic room but I see they offer suites which I can't comment on. Located near The Royal Oak hotel and all of the outrageously expensive shops. A good people and car watching spot.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_345676915~“Laid back location”~Double Bay is a great location to visit and stay in Sydney if you want to avoid the busy city and yet be a 10 minute train ride away from everything. The hotel is small but very friendly and comfortable but not luxurious. The area is surrounded by up-market cafes and restaurants including a Supermarket. The jetty for the Circular Quay ferry is a few minutes walk and the distance to Edgecliff train station is about 10 minutes of safe walk. Get an Opal Card and use the public transport system of buses, trains and ferries for about $50/week including airport access. A very comfortable stay in one of the most pleasant areas of Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343199233~“Great position. Good family sized suite - but a dump.”~Stayed here for 2 nights following a cruise. The family sized room is great layout but there was a lot that I really did not like about the place. Bathrooms have mould on the grout. Carpets are worn and mismatched. Pillows are cheap and uncomfortable. My daughter's mattress was terrible, One of the TV remotes was missing. One staff member helpful. Another could not have cared less. My worst was that there is a smoking area and they do not make people close the door which means that due to the layout of the place you can smell smoke everywhere. Positives are that the curtains in the room are good and it was very quiet. Some staff were helpful. I am not a princess, but this place is not what I would describe as a boutique hotel.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_342471146~“Great Locality!”~This little hotel in Double Bay is quaint, easily accessible and is in a fantastic location. We stayed 2 nights.

review_340307750~“Good place to stay”~We come to Sydney often & always stay at the Savoy. Rooms are clean, location is great, staff are more than helpful, especially Tommy. The price is reasonable so can't understand why people complain. Go around the corner to the Intercontinental & you would pay 3 to 4 times more. Close to all transport as well & huge choice of restaurants, so don't believe the negative comments is my advice.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_338654819~“great hotel for Double Bay”~Stayed two nights and found the hotel well situated for nights out in Double Bay and visiting the eastern suburbs.

review_335556994~“Checked in, checked straight out again !”~My family and I arrived here just before midnight following a flight from the UK. This hotel was only intended to be a short stay (2 nights) before our long term accommodation in the area became available.  The family room we were allocated was of such a poor condition that I immediately checked out and found suitable alternative accommodation.  The room allocated wasn't clean, it appeared well worn and threadbare, was dark and dingy with poor security to the room door leading onto the atrium. I certainly wouldn't have felt confident to have left my belongings unattended.  Our room bore absolutely no resemblance to any of the photographs that I found on the Internet.  The person on reception couldn't even be bothered to get off his stool and help me find the light switch in the room. His only comment when we checked out was that the Savoy is only 3 star, I would say that is very generous for our allocated family room which in my opinion was more suitable for back packers or a group who just needed to crash somewhere after a night on the town. In fairness to the Hotel they did refund my second nights fee and do have better rooms which have been refurbished.  However they appear to operate a policy of those arriving early get the refurbished rooms and those like me, no matter when you made the booking, get what's left. So if you are considering this Hotel and have a late check in be warned.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_334854786~“Excellent Visit”~Stayed three nights here just before Christmas and cannot praise the staff and venue enough. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Close to ferry terminal but what made it for me was the staff. They were truly excellent and could not be nicer or more accomodating. Nothing was too much trouble. Every request or question reached a positive outcome immediately. Stayed her a couple of times now and would definitely recommend it to anyone else. Price was very good and location excellent.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_333795184~“I wish I had gone elsewhere”~There is no parking any where nearby on most week nights. I ended up a few kilometers away and had to walk to the hotel, where I was given a pass for a parking lot, that was again a block or two away from the hotel. I walked all the way back to my car, drove to the lot, then walked back to the hotel. The staff seemed quite disinterested upon my arrival. I was directed to my room. I followed the directions, however when I got to the Atrium (which apparently my room was situated off) I was greeted by about 20- 25 students, all with chairs out having some sort of a meeting. I assumed I had walked to the wrong location. I went back and saw the man I had just checked in with. I apologised and advised him I must have misunderstood. Again he gave me the same directions. I walked back around, following his directions and again walked smack bang into 25 people who were all seated around having some sort of meeting. I went back again and asked the staff member. I advised all I saw when i followed his instructions were a group of people having a meeting. He said "yeah, just go around them. Your room is right there". Well I went back, and sure enough my room was behind a row of about 7 seated students. I had to walk through their meeting. There was awkward pauses, and lots of people looking at me, and a few of them had to get up and move their chairs just so I could see my door. Anyway, I got in, awkwardly. The room was ok. I have seen better for the price range. Baring in mind I still had 25 people within 60 centimetres of my closed door. The students eventually dispersed and I was able to bunk down for the night. At 3:00am the beside alarm clock went off. It took me a minute or two to find the power point to turn it off. I cant blame this on the savoy, it must have been a practical joke from the previous occupant or just something that was simply overlooked. It was quite a shock, on full volume, and it took me a while to settle and get back to sleep.I cant help but think though, "who uses bedside alarms in this day an age of smart phones'. I would suggest to the staff they leave the thing unplugged and people can plug it in if they are so inclined to use it. The next night I was reading the folder found in each room, trying to work out how to order a room service meal. Apparently they don't offer it any more, and you are instructed to call a near by cafe who would deliver. I called them only to be told, they couldn't help me tonight as they were tending to a function. Well, that was enough for me. I had one more night booked, however that was the final straw. I checked out. I went and got my car, then spent 20 minutes finding a park so I could return the parking pass to the hotel. Terrible terrible experience! Never again!~2~nan~nan~2~3~nan~2~nan
review_332562744~“Good and nice place to stay yet so relaxing and convenient”~Arrived to find the hotel to be a boutique hotel - no fancy entrance and lobby, but was greeted by a cheerful Tom who provided lots of information on public transport, where to eat, etc.. Our family room consisted of 2 rooms and 1 toilet to share, Good size for 4 adults,room was decently cleaned, but not tastefully decorated. Most importantly, the bed and mattress were good for an excellent sleep. I liked their common area - sort of hotel lobby, just sit and chill out - perfect and cosy place to do so. Stayed for 3 nights. We had a room facing the inner road and we woke up early about 6ish as the gym across the back lane was opened and you can hear the music and pounding. After investigation we noted the owner of the gym stayed upstair so I guess he woke up early and started his routine without realising his neighbour hotel has guests sleeping. As long as you do not mind waking up early by the sound, it is okay, but who knows this issue may be resolved by now. Savoy is in Double Bay and it is really convenient, just 3 minutes walk to the bus stop you can be in William street, Kings Cross within half an hour or so, you can also the ferry from the Rocks back, and walk about 8 minutes or so back to the hotel, Surrounding the hotel you can find café, restaurant, supermarket, chic retail outlets. Decent pricing for their rooms and breakfast.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_331904815~“Boutique Hotel in relaxing surrounds”~Recently had a 3 night stay at The Savoy Double Bay. Hotel is well located in the middle of Double Bay. Being close to Christmas, the area was beautifully decorated and had a lovely, warm feeling to it. Wherever we went we encountered lovely, friendly people, great service and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff at The Savoy were friendly, approachable and helpful. Room was clean, tidy, comfy and sound proof. Slept well all 3 nights. If staying for more than 2 or 3 nights I would recommend upgrading from a studio room as it can get a bit cramped. Our fault for all the shopping we did. Enjoyed the self service $7.50 Continental Breakfast offered - suited our needs and we were more than happy with the options available. Close to ferry, bus and train services so easy to get around if you don't have a car. We did have a car and were able to park just up the road which was convenient enough for us. Lots of shops, restaurants and pubs all within walking distance from The Savoy so you don't have to venture too far to enjoy being Sydney. Was a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_328273450~“Boutique Hotel”~The Savoy is located in the heart of Double Bay,close to cafes and shops. Friendly staff, comfy beds however pillows could be improved.Rooms are mostly clean however noticed fly screen in our bathroom hadn't been cleaned for a while someone had drawn a face in the dust. Overall not too bad conveniently located.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan
