review_478144608~“Comfortable Guesthouse in interesting neighbourhood”~Simpson's is a comfortable guesthouse, with spacious guestrooms, interesting artworks and an excellent breakfast room. It is within walking distance of Kingscross, Woolloomooloo, and botanical gardens. Good bars and restaurants within walking distance.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_476025485~“Recommended”~Well positioned, characterful and comfortable boutique hotel in Sydney. This hotel felt like a gracious old home. Our room was large and pleasantly decorated; the continental breakfast generous and tasty. Positioned in vibrant Potts Point, the hotel is within walking distance of the central city. I would happily stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475794302~“Elegant & Homey”~We spent four nights at Simpsons after a 33 day cruise around Australia and New Zealand. Prior to the cruise we had spent one night in the CBD with the hustle & bustle of the city but we enjoyed the peace and quiet of Potts Point so much more. We set off on our first day with a map and directions from Ree and found that walking to Darling Harbour or Circular Quay was very easy - going down the 113 McElhone Steps was much easier than going up! Our room - "Victoria" was absolutely lovely with a very comfortable bed, sitting area and a well equipped bathroom. There are great restaurants within a few blocks, one was so good we ate there twice - The Opium Den with some of the best Thai food we've had since visiting Thailand. Breakfast at Simpsons was very good, fresh fruit, pastries, meat & cheese, juice & coffee. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this B&B; so much nicer than a chain hotel.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475751168~“Great place to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary”~Our room was located on the first floor in the front of the house (off the main street). We couldn't hear anything from the street- granted the street is a quiet street. The room was very spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a nice continental breakfast every morning for us to enjoy. The location was convenient.. there were some nice restaurants on the same street and a convenient store about a 2 minute walk away. If you wanted to head to the harbor area there were 100 stairs that you could go down and head over to it. The walk was lovely. I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474134160~“Outstanding stay at Simpsons Hotel;”~My wife and I recently celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary with a 3-night stay at Simpsons Hotel. The facility was exactly as advertised....very spacious and comfortable room, a delightful breakfast, very convenient location for walking to nearby restaurants and to the hop-on/hop-off bus, complimentary sherry & port, and very helpful local attraction recommendations from Keith. An outstanding facility with outstanding staff....well done!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473248586~“Potts Point gem”~We stayed here for four nights. It isn't in the CBD, but the beautiful quiet neighborhood makes up for having to do some lovely walking. We loved walking from the Simpson through the Botanical Garden. We also found the subway very convenient to get anywhere in Sydney we needed to go. It isn't a "modern, luxury hotel" but it is a charming, comfortable home. We found the breakfast to our liking and the staff very accommodating. One wonderful advantage was the laundry a short walk away that did two bags of laundry including ironing for $30 Aus. We didn't visit any of the nearby restaurants, but there were many appealing ones. Please don't stay here expecting a modern ***** hotel and then complain. The quiet charming neighborhood and staff are the draw.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473131280~“Quaint but tired”~We started our holiday in Australia with three nights in Sydney and chose to stay at Simpsons as we did not want a 'chain'.  This B&B is in a colonial part of the city and within walking distance of the opera house and bridge. The owner, Keith is very welcoming and is very helpful.  We wanted a quaint place to stay, which this is. The breakfast is good and the only down side of this B&B is that it is tired. The bathrooms need a refurb, shown by such things as the shower taps being difficult to turn off properly and the odd cracked tile. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472972304~“Lovely Victorian house in funky district”~I stayed here both before and after my cruise to New Zealand. I had two beautiful comfortable suites with very comfortable beds. The breakfast was excellent with great coffee. Thank you Damien and Ree. The area was full of small restaurants and many shops. It was within easy access of downtown Sydney on the #311 bus. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472333613~“Just as Great as Last Time!”~Four years later, we were in the Cloud Room again and it was just as magical as before. This time, we enjoyed two stays, two days in January and 6 days in February. Our room was large, comfortable and relaxing, with crisp bed linen, loads of bathroom toiletries, fluffy towels and robes, and very well maintained by the room service staff. The guest lounge downstairs retains its charm with lovely old furniture and rugs, piles of books and the ever-filled decanters of sherry and port. The breakfast room was also unchanged with Damian dancing his efficient attendance with tea and freshly-brewed coffee and resupplying the bountiful breakfast buffet. It was great to be welcomed back by Keith and Ree, both knowledgeable about Sydney and the local area and keen to help with any enquiries or just have a good laugh. Simpsons is superbly located. During the day, it is an easy walk to the Sydney CBD for shopping sprees or to visit the many wonderful sights. One evening we strolled down to Woolloomooloo and across the botanical gardens to the Sydney Opera House to see a superb opera production. Other nights we wandered around Challis Avenue and MacLeay Street, trying out some of the many restaurants in the Potts Point area. Staying at Simpsons is like coming home and relaxing in your favourite and most comfortable outfit. Strongly recommended.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471404923~“Just like coming home to family..................”~We spent a total of eight nights here in the fabulous 'Cloud Room' during a recent two month trip to OZ. When you fly into Sydney and just want to regroup before continuing your travels - then Simpsons is the place to unwind and relax. We first stayed here in January of 2013 and were delighted that it still retains all its charm. It is situated in Potts Point which is just the right location to access the rest of the city. It is upmarket yet 'villagey' with a plethora of restaurants to suit all tastes. Damian, who serves brekkie is as sweet,delightful and handsome as ever.Keith retains his cheeky charm and Ree is still a bundle of joy. ( 'Hope your Dame Edna cozzie went down a storm, Possum' !) The staff who service the rooms are as efficient and discreet as always. Whenever we touch down in Sydney - Simpsons will always be 'home from home'. TIP: if you want the chocolate goodies that are left alongside the complimentary sherry in the library- skulk about early after brekkie-the competition is fierce.Naughty- as they say - but nice!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471245564~“Lovely week-end home from home!”~We were comfortably accommodated at the Simpsons Hotel on a recent visit to Sydney. Our focus was a family celebration, and we missed in house breakfasts due to other commitments, but I would like to re-visit the hotel to make better use of the guest amenities: spacious lounge with fully equipped bathroom, continental breakfast, maps, guides, and the very helpful host. This was more like staying in an old-fashioned and well appointed guest house than our usual hotel experience - excellently presented!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

First of all, the location is superb, with easy access to the ferry, the Opera House, the train - excellent if you want to walk around (free parking too). The room was very nice and comfortable, and we had everything we needed. The hosts were wonderful. They will gladly offer you directions to anything you want to see. The breakfast was also great. They had a lot of healthy selections.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_463367089~“Very good historical boutique hotel (B&B) in charming Potts Point”~Simpsons is a nice alternative to the glass and glitter of the modern hotel chains. Built in the late 1800s, it has an interesting history, and now provides very comfortable accommodation. Situated in Potts Point, it is also a nice alterative to being in the city or rocks areas, yet still very assessable to both, as well as Woolloomooloo, Elizabeth Bay and the Opera House. Potts Point is a just a few streets, a lovely little area with excellent restaurants, just up but snuggled away from King’s Cross. Breakfast (described as continental) was more than adequate, with hard boiled eggs, smoked salmon and ham, as well as the usual cereals and toast.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_460811701~“Charming B&B”~Very nicely located in Potts Point. Close to restaurants, shops and taxis. Original rooms, high ceilings.

review_460253773~“Lovely boutique hotel”~Simpsons of Potts Point is an exquisite boutique hotel in a very charming and posh part of Sydney. There are a number of popular restaurants on the adjacent street (don't miss Apollo!) and convenient services such as drug stores, grocery, and laundry are all nearby. Ree was cheery and helpful with suggestions and reservations.  Daily breakfast was very good and the rooms were large and pleasant, with marble baths and plenty of fluffy towels.  One note: the distance to the Opera House isn't far, but be aware that there are LOTS of stairs. The McElhone stairs, all 112 of them, take you down to the waterfront level, then more steps take you back up into the botanical gardens for a short walk to the Opera House. We enjoyed the walk every day, but you have to be prepared for it.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_456602925~“Personal, heritage and friendly”~A small scale hotel with personality. A heritage building (1892) with nice spacious rooms. The owners are treating you like acquintances. Very personal, they remember your firstname. The building iscrealy nice and well maintained considering the age.the rooms are clean, jave airconditioning, tv and everithing. For some the fact that there is no elivator might be a problem, but there ate room on the ground floor. Just ask Keith  It was a pleasure to stay there.  Oh. The breakfast was great, lots of choices and all fresh.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454634796~“Home away from home ...”~We could not have selected better accommodation for our visit to Sydney. Simpsons is very comfortable, quiet and conveniently located near good restaurants and transportation. Keith, Mary, Ree and Damion ensured that our needs were met, and we were well supported with local information and a great breakfast. We enjoyed our room and additional space to relax in the library/parlor. The library was well stocked with Australian travel guides and an eclectic selection of interesting books. Wifi was good and we appreciated the computer provided to guests.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_453018406~“Lovely hotel in great location”~We were lucky enough to stay here on a 3 night whistle stop visit to Sydney. From the booking process to checking out; everything ran like clockwork and Keith and the rest of the staff could not have been more helpful. The hotel itself feels very special and historical and is located in one the nicest and picturesque neighborhoods in Sydney, with a fabulous choice of bars and restaurants within a short walk. The harbour is only a delightful 30 minute walk from the hotel that takes you through the botanical gardens. If. like us, you're an out of towner be sure to get a heads-up from Keith on the key places to visit on your trip. He provided us with all the information required for a day trip worthy of any international tour guide. Cheers Keith!! Would absolutely recommend Simpsons to any visitor to Sydney and look forward to staying here again next time we are in town,~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452524903~“We were recommended to stay at Simpsons by previous guest”~Travelling by car from Adelaide to Noosa Heads for a Family Xmas we had to be in Lorn Victoria with four days to get there, remembering our friends recommendation whilst on the road we booked Simpson through tripadvisor from Armidale the night before leaving. We were advise our booking was made and soon received mail from the hotel explaining how to get to the premises and how to let ourselves in as being a smaller establishment the premises would be locked. Having staid in many such establishments this was no problem. On arrival and conveniently being able to park in their drive, as street parking would have been in possible, entering the premises with not problem we found our host in his office, Kieth introduced himself and explained the workings of the hotel and the fact they serve a breakfast in the morning. Showing us to our room asked to leave the car keys in a designated draw so it could be moved if any other vehicle need to pass through, left us to the comforts of our large spacious air condition room. Only being in the district of Pots Point we enquired where would we walk to take in the district, Kings Cross or as Kieth suggested Woolloomooloo. We were not disappointed and dine Indian at Akis, stunning food and enjoyed an Indian Shiraz a good quality. Then back up the 120 steps to our hotel. We enjoyed a comfortable night with the breeze from the large Singapore overhead fan, then breakfast with a dozen other guests laid out in a beautiful court. Before leaving we had a great conversation with Kieth and Marie about the history of this historic building and Suburb and look forward to a time when we can again join them may be for a longer stay.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_452236635~“Great boutique stay in charming Potts Point”~Quiet, spacious and tastefully appointed; well priced with a continental breakfast (that has more than just croissant and coffee) and pleasant unobtrusive staff. Get a bit out of the city, it's worth it! Located near the thriving restaurant and shopping scene and a short walk to Kings Cross makes this Hotel hard to beat. Air con, refrigerator and most amenities required.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_446183377~“Favourite place to stay in Sydney”~From the moment you walk into Simpsons, you feel special. The decor is elegant and tasteful, yet warm and welcoming. As are the staff - friendly and knowledgable, but never intrusive. The location is wonderful - you're a short stroll from all the cool cafes, arty shops and fine restaurants around Potts Point. You're also an easy walk to the Botanical Gardens and beyond that, Circular Quay. Breakfast is included and you have a selection of eggs, smoked salmon, toast and cereal as you read the morning newspaper. The rooms are all individually decorated with historic prints and the beds, most comfortable. Can't recommend this historic and delightful place highly enough! Oh and there's space for parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_440533225~“Charming and convenient”~This is the second time I have stayed at Simpsons in the last 6 months. It is a great location in a quiet residential street with heaps of restaurants within a short walk. The waterfront is close by and it is an easy 20 minute walk to to the city. A beautiful heritage building provides you with a very pleasant room with everything you need at a very affordable price. Definitely will be back for a long weekend in Sydney~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

This is a great place to stay, it is a short walk to cafes and restaurants and in the other direction in 10 minutes you are in the Botanic Gardens.

review_436940679~“Excellent stay in Potts Point”~Stayed for 4 nights in november '16. The hotels location was good, with lots of restaurants and shops nearby, large grocery store / supermarket (Woolworths) just around the corner. About 15min walk to the royal botanical gardens and a few minutes more to the opera house / circular quay.  The hotel was situated in an idyllic old australian heritage site mansion, with very relaxed and quiet atmosphere. Our room was in the top floor with quite a few steps up. Free parking for a few cars in the hotels front yard. Our room was clean, tidy and spacious, warmly decorated with big flatscreen tv. Small fridge was provided, as well as ironing equipment, electric kettle with tea and coffee, efficient AC and a fan as well. Queen bed was comfortable to sleep in and the room was very quiet. Bathroom was clean with good quality amenities. Free WiFi was provided in the rooms and around the hotel. The quality of the WiFi connection was pretty much the only downside of our stay, the connection was somewhat unstable and slow (around 0.5-2mbps). Complimentary buffet breakfast was excellent and high quality, with lots of different kinds of toast, cold cuts incl delicius cold smoked salmon, fresh fruit salad with delicious blueberries and strawberries, yoghurt, boiled eggs, different cereals and muesli, walnuts etc. Fresh coffee / tea was served to your table. The breakfast room had very relaxed and intimate atmosphere with no crowds. The hotels staff was excellent, very friendly and helpful. Upon arrival we were provided with useful information about the city, and tips for things to do. Also we were lucky to lend leftover opal cards for public transport from the hotel, left by some previous customers. The cards became very handy to get around the city. Would definitely stay again. WiFi quality might be something to improve.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434923127~“Great b&b style hotel”~Very much the location and the place to stay, I thought, in Sydney. Close to the city and park, but set back and private. We have stayed in the main house as well as in the smallish rooms/apartments off to the side of the main location. I was disappointed that we would be staying away from the main location, but it turned out that the rooms had views of the bridge and were fully equipped for meals, etc.  even though it's expensive, I'd stay there again, and thoroughly enjoy myself.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433399442~“ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL”~This is just the best place to stay if you are visiting sydney. Located in Potts Pony, away from the hustle and bustle of Sydney, within walking distance to Restaurants, Art Gallery, Botanical Gardens, and if you are up to it, a 20 minute walk to David Jones! Lovely charming old world ambiance, with very comfortable rooms and beds. Good lighting in bathrooms, which is a plus, and a very nice continaental breakfast served in the conservatory each morning. Could not fault this Hotel.  See and Jamie are wonderful hosts and I will definitely be staying there again on my return visits to Sydney.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_427970700~“Old world charm in the city”~Great hotel, really lovely old fashioned and with genuine period piece furnishings. The sitting room was beautiful with period couches, chairs bookcases and a fireplace. Our guest room was cosy and comfortable with a good bathroom. There are no lifts so you must be fit enough for stairs if on the upper floors. Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast room was adequate with a glass roof. Buffet breakfast was good but no hot food and no variation day by day. Tell them in advance if you want to pay other than by the credit card you used to reserve, or they will charge to it.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan

It's a grand heritage listed mansion converted into 12 ensuite rooms. Spacious and comfortable, our room had everything you expect to find and more. A lovely luxurious bed, immaculate en suite, and lots of hot water ensured we would enjoy our stay in this elegant hotel. The continental breakfast was delicious. The staff were efficient and helpful too. This is a four star hotel with a five star feel at a very reasonable rate. Free WiFi too. We would certainly stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan

From our first correspondence the experience was a pleasure. Keith was wonderful, and very helpful by leaving a map as he knew where we were headed. Our room (family) was so beautifully decorated. Loved the sitting room and the sherry. Make sure you look at the artwork. Breakfast in the conservatory is fantastic and a wonderfully relaxing way to start the day.

review_392440394~“Always a pleasure to stay at Simpsons”~Great location and wonderful food venues within walking distance makes Simpsons my choice whenever I stay in Sydney. Simpsons offer an elegant alternative to most hotels and the comfort and hospitality of the staff and owners make you want to return every time. The rooms are spacious and individual in their own style. Simple conveniences like strong flowing showers and comfortable beds helps make staying there an easy decision. The breakfast is light and refreshing and there is quality coffee everywhere nearby. I recommend Simpsons to anyone who likes grand old home boutique hotel that offers great value for money.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_385949741~“Still stunning and welcoming”~We were offered an upgrade but the original booked room was far more to our liking. The upgrade room had a leaking tap that I found needed more strength than I had to turn off and the original room was lighter and bigger, just up a level so more walking, or should I say climbing. The stairs are a but steep. The room was eleganlty presented and the service was wonderful. I have stayed here before and loved it. Nothing has changed.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_384214153~“Good Value”~We had a Family room with our adult daughter. The common areas were the best part of the Hotel with sherry and port on offer. Fake open fires and older style furniture. The room was showing signs of neglect with three lights not working wardrobes with hinges off and terribly uncomfortable beds. The hosts were lovely people . And Breakfast fine. It is great value for Sydney prices but next time eyeing off the Hotel across the road. As the area of Potts Pt. is buzzing and a short walk through the Domain to the City.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan

There is also a lovely, large front room where one could sip sherry, play chess, or read, and a fresh, well stocked continental breakfast is served in a quiet breakfast room at the back of the hotel. Potts Point is an interesting neighborhood with a number of small, unique restaurants. One night we ate at Sopra, a small Italian restaurant in the middle of a grocery store, the other at “Fei Jai”, a small Asian fusion restaurant. Both within walking distance. We were also able to walk to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Botanical Gardens, and the Opera House.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

The Simpsons of Potts Point House is tastefully decorated with antiques and is well supplied with everything we needed. Breakfast was included and provided a good selection of breads, cereal and fruit. The location was perfect for walking to most of the Sydney attractions and great restaurants. Keith painstakingly spent time with us providing great information on the history of Australia and "must sees". His insight was invaluable and we felt like he was sending us on our own personal adventure. We got to see some of the best aspects of Sydney and surrounding areas. We will definitely refer friends who travel to Sydney to stay at Simpsons of Potts Point Hotel!!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

You will cruise Sydney Harbour and watch Sydney light up on an early-dinner sunset cruise aboard the luxurious MV Sydney 2000, the most prestigious cruising restaurant on Sydney's waterways. Whether you're enjoying an early pre-theatre dinner or wanting to complete your Sydney sightseeing in style, you'll enjoy the MV Sydney 2000's relaxed atmosphere, first-class service, fabulous food and superb views of Sydney Harbour.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_377695875~“Unique and cozy stay!”~We enjoyed our visit very much. Accommodations in a dormer queen room were fine, and breakfast was straightforward but nice, in a very bright pleasant breakfast room. They did microwave an egg for me each day to have a poached/ soft boiled egg on toast, as only eggs were hard boiled otherwise. We especially appreciated being able to use your microwave to heat leftovers, as I NEVER can finish a whole dinner when eating out. And being a typical American, I was glad I could get some “mini” ice cubes a few times too, I love my ice! Lots of books to chose from, guides and novels, and some sherry and chocolate candies in the dining room were nice touches. Fresh flowers in hall lovely. Location great for restaurants, and good for walking to opera house, botanical gardens and pier IF you are a walker in good shape, as there is one REALLY long stairs between Potts point and city harbor area. You'll walk past Harrys Famous Meat pies in Wolloomooloo on way to harbor, make sure to try a meat pie, I had mushroom and meat I think, excellent. It's maybe a 10 minute walk from the Kings Cross station along Victoria st, past little shops several hostels, and some once grand row houses and St. Vincents College, enjoyed seeing all the girls streaming out after school in their uniforms, took me back to my Catholic school days!~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_375975779~“A Delight”~In December 2015, I spent several days at Simpson's of Potts Point. I arrived on an early morning flight and manager Keith invited me to rest in Simpson's beautiful guest living room. A staff member Damien brought me a cup of tea. This is the key to Simpson's success - its service and ambience. Location is key too. Simpson's is close to Macleay Street restaurants and a wonderful bookshop; it's within walking distance to the city, the Art Gallery of NSW and Hyde Park for those inclined, and close to bus and train links. Excellent!~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_372720064~“Wonderful”~My husband and I went to Sydney this March and stayed at Simpsons Hotel Potts Point. It is a beautiful English Queen Ann style brick house, built in 1892. The interior and rooms are decorated comfortable and cozy. We, two architects, were very pleased with the hotel. We were welcomed warmly by the host, Ree and her helper, Damon and feel like friends at our first breakfast. Not to mention that the location is great. Within a few blocks, there are excellent restaurants, coffee and pastry shops, wine and food market. This charming and friendly hotel made our Sydney trip special. I am very touched, the afternoon we left the hotel and it was down pour rain, Ree walked me out to the taxi with umbrella and got socked. She is doing beyond a hotel host.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_370652835~“An excellent choice if you want a hotel with character in a central location”~Stayed at this hotel in March at the start of a 3 week stay in Australia and what a great start to our visit. We had hesitated in booking as it was just off the Kings Cross area, with its past reputation, but it proved an excellent area as Challis Avenue is a delightful tree lined avenue with many older characterful houses and Kings Cross is a changed area.  As our flight arrived early morning we had not expected to have a room available on our arrival but Keith had advised us by email that changing facilities would be available if required. To our delight a room was ready. Before showing us to the room we were sat down in a delightful sitting room with coffee provided and Keith explained both the hotel facilities and gave us details of the area and the best routes to attractions. The room itself met all expectations being very clean, well equipped and spacious despite having booked a 'cosy queen' room. Breakfasts were a delight with a very good choice which set you up for the day. Keith, Marie and Ree were all very friendly and helpful. Location is excellent with many restaurants around the area. Walking into the harbourside and main attractions was easy and very pleasant through the Botanical Gardens. To go further afield or at night the train subway was available at Kings Cross and is easy to use. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and were amazed to read the recent review 'Shabby Simpsons' as our own experience could not have been different and the review was unrecognisable as being the same hotel. There are many modern stereo type hotels in Sydney but if you want a different, characterful hotel in a good location do not hesitate to try Simpsons of Potts Point.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_369300970~“Friendly place, close-in location”~Situated within easy walking distance of the Botanic Gardens, CBD, Art Gallery of NSW and the very cool Surry Hills (dining, clubs, shops). Potts Point is served by a single bus line, so trains and buses are a brief walk away at Kings Cross. Potts Point is becoming very cool, so cafes, restaurants, shops are starting to move in with gusto. Simpsons is a grand old house, could use some updating. Management and staff are extremely courteous, outgoing, and resourceful. Breakfast (included in our rate) is spectacular -- will energize you for the day.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_365738050~“Shabby Simpsons”~This was the worst B and B we stayed in during our trip to New Zealand and Australia. The hotel is in a wonderful location and is a lovely old building but ........it is vastly overpriced, very poorly maintained, and badly in need of renovation. Our queen room had dirty-looking brown blankets on the bed. When I asked whether they were washed between guests I was told 'no,' by Ree, one of the owners. The blankets were totally unsuitable for the hot weather--you would think washable cotton blankets or a light duvet with washable cover would be supplied. I used a clean top sheet to place over the blankets which I had requested earlier. This is really unacceptable bedding for a boutique hotel! The cramped bathroom was dirty and had mold on the floor as well as obsolete faucets (see pictures). The wardrobe where the mini-refrigerator was placed was similarly dirty and chipped. The breakfast room was run like a cafeteria and the breakfast was minimalist with very little fresh fruit and limited choices. The hosts were not very pleasant nor welcoming. This is not a place I would recommend nor stay at again!~2~1~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_360601862~“Fabulous Stay”~I stayed at Simpsons of Potts Point for a one night and then 3 night stay over the Easter Period. The property is beautiful and the owners (Ree and Keith) made me feel very welcome. On my arrival I had a very heavy case which Ree helped me to carry up the stairs. My room was lovely and very comfortable. When I returned for my second stay, I was put back in the same room which was very convenient. I was made very welcome again on my return. The continental breakfast in the conservatory was lovely. I would definitely recommend this property for a stay in Sydney. It is right in the middle of Potts Point and only a 20 minute walk through either the Botanical Gardens or the Domain to the city. There is also the Kings Cross Station nearby and also buses which run down the main road. There are plenty of options for eating very close to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again!~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_356511816~“Convenient”~Very well placed for Circular Quay, Downtown, Botanical Gardens etc Pleasant if slightly old fashioned hotel - not that that's necessarily a bad thing  Just a bit austere. Owner very helpful. Good breakfast. Can't just give it full marks as somewhat soulless.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_356425609~“The perfect location!”~Simpson's hotel B&B is in a perfect location for touring Sydney. Located on Challis Ave. We were able to walk to all the sights in Sydney. Plus the fact that some of the best restaurants in town are on Challis Ave--a short 3 block street with loads of side-walk cafes. The hotel itself is in a beautiful heritage building on a street with many other historic buildings. We had the least expensive room at the top of the house and it's was lovely. Breakfast in the sunroom was wonderdul the two days we stayed here. The hosts let us clean up and change in a parlour bath, and leave our bags, so that we were able to get a full day of sight seeing in after our 6:30AM arrival from the US. They were also very helpful in giving us a map of the must-see places with directions, as well as the best restaurants. Overall Wonderful stay!!!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_356172921~“Excellent location- beautiful character building”~Potts Point is an excellent location with many great restaurants located just literally a stone's throw away from Simpsons hotel and a ten minute walk to Wooloomooloo. Our hosts couldn't be nicer, both rooms located on the ground floor were of generous proportions. Breakfast in the conservatory was a great start to our busy sight seeing days. I have already recommended this hotel to others looking for an alternative stay in Sydney. We really enjoyed exploring on foot and public transport which is 20metres away. Our best memory is the tree lined street and the birds singing in the trees in the garden - lovely way to start and finish the day.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_353897298~“Perfect Place To Stay in Sydney!”~We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at the Simpsons of Potts Point. Keith, Marie, and Ree were wonderful hosts and the home is quite charming. We loved our room -- it was spacious and very cute. The lounge area is perfect to read a book, play cards, or just relax with a glass of wine. It's in a great location -- walking distance to all the sites, but a super quiet neighborhood. Keith even showed me options for my morning runs -- I went to Darling Harbor as well as the Botanical Gardens, which was wonderful! Breakfast was perfect -- healthy options that kept us full. Would highly recommend!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_352269277~“Charming oasis”~My wife and I stayed at Simpsons for four nights and the positive reviews are accurate. It is a small and quiet spot, excellently run. We had a ground floor room and it included a delightful bricked balcony - ideal on which to sip a nice wine at the end of a busy day. Kings Cross is far enough away that you aren't bothered by noise and there are a number of nice places to eat vry close by. Keith, Re et al are very welcoming and if you like small and approachable, this is it.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_350347354~“Excellent B&B with a Terrific Location”~After searching through what seemed like an endless list of standard hotels, we decided to stay at Simpsons as it appeared to be "different" from the rest. What a charming hotel! Our room had lots of space with a great bathroom, and the hotel was nice and quiet. Breakfast was continental, but had a nice variety, with coffee/tea being served at your table. The front of the hotel had a large and quaint sitting room. The staff was excellent and extremely helpful. The location was great - located in a nice neighborhood with Sydney Harbour and Opera House only a half hour walk away. Parking is limited - there is a circular driveway that can hold up to five vehicles, but we never had an issue - keys are left at the front desk in case someone in the middle needs to leave. I highly recommended this hotel if you plan to stay close to Sydney CBD.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_350317756~“Lovely property in a very convenient yet quiet location”~Well maintained historic property with lots of charm. All sleeping rooms were on second and third floors. Sure glad there was help with luggage! A well appointed sitting/living room with lots of books and magazines to enjoy. Keith was especially helpful in acquainting us with the attractions in the area. Free wifi was really appreciated.~5~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_349572875~“In need of refurbishing. ”~Stayed this weekend for two nights. Hosts were really friendly and the property was full of old world charm. Continental breakfast was served in the pleasant surroundings of the conservatory . Unfortunately we felt our room was in poor condition and in need of maintenence. Ceiling fan was too noisy to turn on. Shower tiles were mouldy and shower rose sprayed over the top of the shower and flooded the floor and ceiling. Toilet pan was badly cracked. Overall room looked tired.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_348476001~“Great B&B in a charming neighborhood”~This is a great B&B with wonderful people and location. It is very easy to get around from here. The neighborhood restaurants are great.

review_348081248~“Terrific bed and breakfast in great Sydney location.”~Great location within easy walking distance of Sydney Harbor.

I would recommend to my friends.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_346735917~“Ruined Wedding night!”~We had booked to stay at Simpsons of Potts Point Hotel weeks before our wedding. They decided to tell us on the evening before our wedding that they had a supposed 'double booking'. THE EVENING BEFORE!!! They offered no solution to us-- other than booking us into surrounding accommodation. How ridiculous! We are well aware that this was to do with price bumping which independent hotels are allowed to do. What hotel does not call you as soon as they know about a double booking? The last time it happened to me I was called within the hour of making my booking. I just can't believe how rude and inconsiderate these people are. BEWARE.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_342205814~“Sparkling Simpsons!”~I met a wonderful team at Simpsons working with flair, enthusiasm and friendship in a beautiful, elegant house. Well done! I loved my 1st 10 days in Sydney - certainly enhanced by all your help and local tips. Magic sunny ferry rides, weekend fashion and art markets at The Rocks, The Magic Flute at the Opera House and the Hawkesbury River trip were a few of my highlights. I have a list for next time too! Thank you Keith for the initial help before I arrived, Ree for knowing everything and for my printing and Damien for being a super breakfast host. Sad to say goodbye Sydney - just for now! Liz Cheyne. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_340885513~“Second visit and still wonderful”~Simpsons is a great place to stay for many reasons. A warm welcome from the owners Keith and Marie and lots of helpful advice from the lovely Ree. We also have to mention Damien who looked after us so well at breakfast.  Simpsons is located perfectly for getting out and about in Sydney plus it has the advantage of having excellent restaurants just at the end of the road.  This was our second visit and felt like a home from home. Should we get the opportunity to visit Sydney again we would definitely stay at Simpsons.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_340522387~“A perfect inn”~The inn is in Potts Point a 20 minute walk from the opera house along the water front. You are on a quiet street but with 4 good restaurants right down the street so you never need to walk far for dinner. It is a great local neighborhood. The owners are very helpful with reccomendations and maps and suggestions. The rooms are charming and really feel like you are living in a mansion. I recommend you ask for a second floor room with a balcony in the front of the hotel. There is a delightful living room to sit and have a glass of wine or a cup of tea.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_338345040~“A Gem”~Central location, but tucked away from the crowds, lovely room, great brekky and delightful slightly crazy hosts - short but lovely walk through Botanical gardens to centre, olde worldly without being fusty - a little bit of tranquility in the middle of a bustling city - we loved our stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_336801666~“An Old But Excellent Bed and Breakfast...”~The Simpsons' is a beautifully restored old mansion that has been converted to a modern bed and breakfast in an eclectic part of Sydney.

review_330991523~“Beautiful boutique hotel with personality”~During our holiday in Australia, we stayed twice at 'Simpsons Potts Point Hotel. This boutique hotel is a true historical gem with nice stained glass windows, wooden floors and build up with red bricks. Keith, the host, is very friendly and gives you any information to make nice day tours in and around Sydney.  On top of that, as I'm fan of Art Deco, I loved walking through Potts Point as this neighbourhood is packed with nicely restored art deco buildings. Also for visiting Sydney, it is located very conveniently, near the Botanic gardens, the Opera house, the Central Business district & Circular Quai, where all ferries (to Manly & Bondi) depart. We recommend this hotel definitely.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_330776431~“Large comfortable rooms in a small boutique hotel in a hip part of town. Recommended.”~Simpsons is a small (14 room) boutique hotel in a completely refurbished Victorian mansion in Potts Point. Wifi works well, A/C, continental breakfast is more than adequate. Very good location in a hip part of Sydney with lots of cool restaurants around, but much too far to walk (more than once) to the Central Business District, Circular Quay or Darling Harbour. Easy walk to the Botanic Gardens, Art Gallery of NSW, and Kings Cross station. Recommended.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_328759606~“A perfect stay”~Thank you to Ree and Keith for another wonderful stay. We stayed this time with our 2 children who loved Simpsons. Ree and Keith are so helpful, with nothing being too much trouble. From printing forgotten tickets to suggestions of activities and helping us work out which bus to catch, nothing seemed like a bother.  It is nice to get up in the morning to a very healthy and delicious breakfast while chatting  about what we did yesterday and our plans for the day.  We all loved sitting in the front room and enjoyed many games of chess.  Thank you for another perfect stay. Hope to see you again soon.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_328594710~“Great Stay”~We spent two nights at Simpsons of Potts Point. A great place to stay. Our room was large, clean, and quiet. The breakfast, included with the price, was exceptional. Our hosts were generous with their time in advising us on places to visit and methods of navigating around Sydney. It is centrally located and the harbourfront, together with the botanical gardens and within easy walking distance. A terrific experience here and we will revisit whenver we return to Sydney~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_326664663~“Comfortable and Welcoming”~I recently stayed here during my trip to Sydney. I found it to be very comfortable and welcoming. My room was on the top floor and was quite spacious, with a queen bed and full bathroom. There was also a sitting area that was perfect for having dinner or just relaxing in front of the tv. Only issue I had was with the shower; it worked well enough, but dripped constantly. Breakfast is included in the rate, and was timely served each morning between 7:30 and 9:30am in the converted conservatory. I don't eat meat, so I enjoyed the fruit and breads. The B&B is located on a beautiful street in Potts Point. There is some traffic, but not so much that there's constant noise. You can walk to Kings Cross subway station, which will take you into town our out to Bondi Junction. You can also easily walk into downtown Sydney in about 15 minutes. Kings Cross itself is formerly Sydney's red light district, so there are still some elements of that in the area. However, there are also lots of residences, newer condo buildings, several backpacker hostels, and cool restaurants (try the Thai place on the corner of Macleary and Roslyn streets - yum!).  Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend it to others.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_325847317~“Charm, character, and walking distance to everything!”~My husband and I stayed at Simpson's of Potts Point for two nights, and thoroughly enjoyed it! This quaint little B&B is in a beautiful Victorian home built in 1892. It is located on a lovely tree-lined street. a short walk from the waterfront, Royal Botanical Gardens, Opera House, and downtown Sydney. The proprietor, Keith, was incredibly helpful and basically planned our entire itinerary for us. He gave us great advice on where to go, how to get there, where to eat, etc. It was very much appreciated! Our room was spacious and very comfortable, and the breakfast was delicious. Damian made me the best cup of coffee I've ever had ... and that's saying something! We highly recommend SImpson's of Potts Point, for those who prefer to stay somewhere unique, rather than at one of the big franchise hotels. It's simply lovely!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_321775856~“Cosy B & B”~Lovely quaint B&B with lots of history. Ree was welcoming and helpful and made our overnight stay enjoyable and relaxing.

review_319174275~“Home from home.”~Such a beautiful house with heaps of history Ree made us feel so welcome as soon as we arrived, which was very early. We were offered the use of the shower room so we could freshen up from our flight from London and Damian made us a great pot of strong coffee armed us with a map of the city and by 9.30am we were admiring Sydney Oprah house!  The room was gorgeous with a super comfy bed and we always had plenty of hot water. The breakfast was just perfect to set us up for our busy days exploring. Many thanks again for such a wonderful stay.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_316738193~“Lovely, cosy and fun”~We stayed for three nights at Simpsons in a Dormer Room (small but perfectly adequate) and want to thank Ree and Damian who were so friendly and lovely. They provided a personal service and we felt relaxed staying there. Simpsons is in a wonderful position close to Macleay Street and Rushcutters Bay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_314658393~“A most enjoyable stay at Simpsons”~Our thanks to Keith, Marie and Damian who made our stay at this lovely B&B most enjoyable. Damian was very helpful in the mornings at breakfast with maps and ideas of beautiful places to visit and Keith gave us a warm welcome when we first arrived and was most helpful with explaining how to walk into the City via a lovely walk through the Botanical Gardens. Our room was delightful and the bed one of the most comfortable we have ever experienced. Arriving back at Simpsons after a busy day out exploring Sydney was a treat sitting in the lounge full of interesting books and the wonderful cosy fireplace with a glass of sherry. We used to look forward to this at night!  Breakfast was excellent with a choice of cereals, fruit, ham, smoked salmon, nuts and bread and was more than plentiful and very enjoyable. We thank Keith, Marie and Damian for their kind hospitality and would most definitely recommend Simpsons as an excellent place to stay whilst in Sydney. The area of Potts Point was lovely with lots of gracious character homes and a great choice of restaurants, takeaways and shops and very handy for the bus too. Highly recommended. Many thanks and we look forward to staying at Simpsons again when we next visit Sydney. Warm Regards, Pam and Steve Lord, Cape Town, South Africa~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_312144139~“A homely reterat”~Simpsons is an elegant B and B in Potts Point, near Kings Cross. An old turn of the century Edwardian House has been tastefully converted into very superior accommodation that still manages to retain its former residential character.  The staff are warm and engaging, and the ambience is one of relaxed old world charm. There are generous buffet breakfasts and there is a real sense of conviviality which makes this an ideal place to reside when in Sydney.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_307788186~“Lovely place”~Located in a nice surrounding, this little house in the Queen Anne style is simply a cosy pearl. Everything is done with an eye to detail and it was also taken care of that it does not seem to be dusty. I had the Victoria Room on the 1st floor which is quite large and has a lot of light. Bed is comfortable, everything spottless and prices for mini bar absolutely reasonable. On the ground floor is the salon with cosy armchairs and sofas and a lot of books to read. Awsome place.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_305573646~“Almost too good to tell anyone. Must be one of Sydney's best kept secrets.”~Special place. 30 metres to all the action in Macleay St Kings Cross but a VERY QUIET peaceful sanctuary in a quiet street. Attention to detail is everywhere in this renovated Historic 1890's mansion. Circular drive was great for parking. Nice library. Port. Sherry. Open fire. Very comfy bed. Good sized room. Nice decor. AWESOME BREAKFAST. We will be back. THANK YOU.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_299104823~“Gorgeous private B&B tucked away off Kings Cross”~Simpsons is a restored late Victorian era mansion, now a beautifully decorated B&B in a quiet street 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross, in Potts Point.  If you're looking for somewere a little more personal and intimate than the big hotels, and close to the harbour and city centre, this is excellent value. So close to Kings Cross and its eclectic mix of restaurants and bars, but in a quiet street away from the noise and crowds. Woolloomooloo is a 5 minute walk away, and the Opera House andCircular Quay a lovely 20 minute walk around the harbour foreshore. It's an easy walk into the city centre or there's King Cross station around the corner, where you can head off to Bondi. The hotel itself is gorgeous, with charming clean rooms and a beautifully decorated ground floor sitting room with lots of books. Luggage storage pre and post check in is available plus there's the possibility of off street parking - great value! Keith and Ree are very welcoming hosts and very knowledgeable about what to see/do/eat.  The breakfast each morning was fabulous with great service, and the bed super comfortable. I stayed on the top floor which is the newer part of the mansion, and found the welcoming bottle of champagne a lovely touch.  Simpsons is excellent value for the location, beautiful rooms, and great service. This B&B is a discreet, quiet and elegant gem just minutes from the harbour foreshore and Kings Cross.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_298120946~“Back in time with modern comforts”~Lovely historic B&B with exquisite large comfy rooms in period décor but with modern conveniences. Clean and ideally located to access the Botanic Gardens. 30 - 40 minute walk to Opera House and Circular Quay. Breakfast was great and served in a welcoming sunny room. Management/Staff are well informed and obviously proud of the establishment.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_291911173~“Calm, personal, home from home.”~We loved it here. We had a great room overlooking the road, and the double windows made it quiet. The room was light and roomy. Cleanliness was extremely high by any standards. The downstairs lounge area was a quite, calm place to relax and felt very homely due to the open fireplaces. It is an amazing position right in the heart of Potts Point, with world class bars and restaurants (like Metropole and Cho Cho San) all within easy walking distance.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_291609346~“Our Sydney home”~When moving a few hours out of Sydney a few years ago we knew we would need a place to stay from time to time when visiting friends, family, theatre etc. Fortunately we found Simpsons and now call it our 'Sydney Home'. Great location handy to the CBD, theatre, terrific range restaurants and close to the harbour. The owners and staff are very friendly and we often notice them giving knowledgable advice to overseas or out of town visitors. The atmosphere at Simpsons is relaxed, comfortable and homely. The lounge, with a fire in winter, invites you to grab a good book and settle in for a few hours R&R. The rooms are quite large, all a little different, and the bed are comfortable. The entire place is kept spotlessly clean. If its full parking can be a bit of a squeeze but we've never had a problem and Ree even insisted we use her person parking spot once when it was packed. We'll continue to use Simpsons as our Sydney Home.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_286245745~“Simpson's - space, grace, and relax at your own pace!”~In an ever increasing pace of life why book into a high spec/ tech highrise with bland service, when you can step inside the graceful world of Simpson's of Potts Point, pour yourself a warming sherry and snuggle up on one of the comfy lounges or chairs in front of the open fireplace and read one of the many good books on offer. The owners and staff are proud locals who are always on hand to provide accurate advice and knowledge about the locale and Sydney in general. Its like having three or four concierges at your disposal. Go on... you know you deserve the Simpson's service!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_285971452~“Great Location”~This is a grand old mansion, and in a great spot for discovering some of the historical features of old Sydney on foot. Some nice restaurants just up the street and around the corner. The breakfast is magnificent, no need for a cooked breakfast when everything you would want is provided. Enjoyed meeting the helpful owners and staff. Free parking was a bonus, even all day on the day we checked out, with a late flight.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_282771235~“A home away from home”~We spent a week at Simpsons from 15 to 20 June 2015. We fell in love with the house (yes, it was more of a house to us) at first sight. There was something about it that made us feel that we was coming home instead of leaving home. Keith, Marie and Ree were the perfect hosts, helping us to arrange the Blue Mountain trip and the wine tour. The location of the hotel was ideal and convenient, walking distance from almost everywhere. I could go on and on about the place, the living room, the fire place, the cozy bedroom, the decor and classy vintage style.  Thanks Keith for making us feel at home.

review_282510675~“A luxurious step back in time with all the mod cons!”~What a delight it was to stay at Simpson's Hotel. Luxurious, private and quiet. when a continental breakfast was advertised, we expected the usual tat of cereal and toast but this set us up for the day, with fruit compotes, a varieties of juices, boiled eggs, artisan breads and even smoked salmon plus an endless supply of tea and coffee served to us by the witty and hospitable Ree. We appreciated the attention to detail and the clever procedures the owners have in place, like umbrellas in the foyer for use in this wet city and the special place for keys if any car got trapped in the semi circular driveway plus a never fail security system and the offer that our bags could stay safe before our flight home to Melbourne.  Knowing we were celebrating our anniversary they even put champagne and chilled glasses into our little fridge with a welcome note. It is touches like that that made us feel like worthy and important guests. Our return is guaranteed. Fabulous!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_279158650~“THIS FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS ON EVERY LEVEL!”~Keith Marie and Ree are dream hosts! So charming - They were brilliant at arranging day trips including Riverboat Postman which few tourists are aware of - if you are considering a stay at this fantabulous hotel DO book this trip. From meeting some guests I can understand why so many re-book. If I return there is nowhere else to consider. Simpsons is much more than just a hotel it actually felt like being 'at home'  Lounge to die for, love the Victorian period features so beautifully preserved ( but not in aspic! ) - complimentary port & sherry. The rooms really do excel with great attention to detail. More often it is the small details that make all the difference. Breakfast out of this world. What a FIVE star gem with the 'personal touch' THANK-YOU Michael Peacock visiting from UK London~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_278616620~“Highly recommended”~A group of 14 friends recently spent two nights at Simpsons. We were provided with excellent accommodation and warm and friendly hospitality during our stay. Within walking distance of the CBD, the Rocks, Circular Quay and very good restaurants, Simpsons is a an excellent choice when you prefer a quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_275654219~“Great location and comfortable”~Located in a quiet neighborhood, but within walking distance to central city, including the Rocks and Circular Quay. The management was very accommodating. In fact, there had been a small fire in the kitchen just before we arrived. They made arrangements for us to have breakfasts across the street at a lovely cafe. And when we checked out, they gave us a credit because the wifi was not operating when we first arrived (due to the fire). We would definitely stay there again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_271243147~“Perfect spot”~Just spent 4 nights at Simpsons and everything was excellent. Keith was delightful and extremely helpful with daily activity suggestions. Room was very clean and quiet. This is a great location, not in the bustle of the city but very walkable to everywhere. I will stay here again next time in Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_269390088~“Ripper!”~Turn left at the Coke sign (used to be eponymous too, before the cops tidied by the area) go down a bit and hang a right. There's the double style in and out entrance on the left. There's an easy entry pad at the front door but if they can meet you they will. There's off street parking for four cars, five small ones if the drivers park askew. Don't worry about blocking people in. You leave your keys in a drawer in the hall and then phantom chauffeurs move cars around to accommodate the departure designs of others. The Kings Cross area, just up the road, used to be a really rough drug area of Sydney. It's been cleaned up a lot recently but it's still home to back packers and rainbows so lots of amusing sight seeing to be done there. Kings Cross underground station is just a few minutes walk away and the excellent train service from there provides easy city access. Sydney stations seem to have good lavatory facilities which is a wonderful thing to someone used to European undergrounds. There's plenty of good restaurants near Potts and a couple of posing ones too. Two laundries within fifty yards of the house means that you can travel light and there's a small supermarket just up the road for snacks while next door to that is a good place to buy booze and sticky buns. There's not much opportunity to smoke a decent cigar in Australia but if you need to buy some, there's a first class small cigar shop at the Westin Hotel. Simpsons has a small verandah just off the pleasant sitting room where you can smoke it. The house provides free port and sherry and you don't need to take books with you. The place has a fine little library. There's decent wi fi and a share computer downstairs and some comfortable chairs and a sofa or two. There are tip top rooms that are clean and well maintained. There's lots of towels, toiletries and loo paper with a kettle and so forth in the room as well as a refrigerator, iron and ironing board. There was a television but I've no idea what Australian TV programmes are like because we never turned ours on and we never heard anyone else's either. You could travel here with a large piece of aircraft carry on luggage. It's that user friendly. I never ate breakfast but reliable reports indicated that the spread in the conservatory was excellent. Then and as if that wasn't enough, there are the people who work there. A personal thank you to all of you for making our stay in Sydney such a splendid one. We look forward enormously to seeing you again. The haunting goodbye kiss at six in the morning will long be remembered. Thank you for appearing so early to say goodbye. Oh yes, one other thing, the other guests, the ones whose paths we crossed from time to time, were perfectly quiet, calm and pleasant. It' terrible really, the sort of people one can bump into in hotels these days. Simpsons is a fair dinkum place! Bonzer!~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_267415585~“Comfortable and quiet”~This small hotel/B&B is well-located in a quiet street in Potts Point but with easy access to local attractions and transport. Kings Cross station is not too far away and stairs off the street adjacent to the hotel lead down to Wooloomooloo. Our hosts happily provided information about local restaurants and Keith in particular was extremely courteous and helpful. Our room was huge, with a couch and armchair and a very comfortable bed. The small ensuite was spotlessly clean. It would be good to have a greater selection of TV stations (there is only local free-to-air available), however to be fair, most people are not coming to Sydney for the TV... There is a delightful and beautifully furnished double room at the front of the hotel where you can wait for transport or just sit and read. The weather was cold during our short stay and the cheerful fire kept the room cosy. We did not have the breakfast as we met friends on both mornings, however it seemed fine. The breakfast room is probably a little cramped, but again, that does not detract from the fact that this is a very good option for people visiting Sydney who wish to avoid the major chain hotels.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_266570241~“A hidden gem”~Thank you so much for a beautiful weekend stay. Simpsons is such a peaceful place to get away from it all. It is in a convenient location if you want to explore the city, otherwise you can just sit in the front room with a book and watch the world go by. The staff are lovely, we were greeted at the door with a friendly smile and showed to our room (which was spotlessly clean). Our room was the cloud suite and was a gorgeous room. Our bed was so comfortable we wanted to sleep all day. Breakfast was served in the sunny conservatory and was fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_265799274~“A lovely 'Old Fashioned' hotel”~Simpsons is a delightful bed and breakfast in a lovely part of Sydney. The bedroom was large with a comfy bed and the ensuite was well appointed. Everything was clean and the owners were extremely helpful and friendly. There was even sherry and port available in the living room along with masses of interesting books!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_263513599~“Perfect Sydney Aida Accommodation ”~We travelled to Sydney from Perth to see Aida. What a magnificent performance and venue. Equal to the show was our choice of accommodation. We could not have chosen a better place to stay. The majestic room and historic ambience transported us to an era long gone in our hustle bustle lives. Ree and staff made our stay very comfortable and relaxed. We won't forget the nourishing breakfast in the sunroom to get us going each day nor the satisfaction of a quiet sherry in the lounge or verandah upon our return. The location is ideal for all who enjoy the good things in life. So much to see and do within a short distance to tempt your senses. Thoroughly recommend it for all. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_263372147~“Great location in a historic home with wonderful breakfasts”~We were in Sydney for a family wedding and the location was ideal. We could walk to circular key, and enjoyed a lovely sized bedroom in a quiet area. We enjoyed a relaxed, quality breakfast without the formality of a large hotel. Daniel was extremely accommodating in allowing us to leave our bags and return after climbing the bridge to shower and then depart in an pre-ordered taxi to the airport. A delightful place to stay if you want to experience a part of Sydney history.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
