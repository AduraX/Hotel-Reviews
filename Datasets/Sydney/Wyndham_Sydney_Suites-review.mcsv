review_478606058~“Ill mannered and patronizing personnel”~We checked in on February 3rd. A nominal charge was processed to validate our credit card but despite assurances was not reversed after check We had to pay for in-room Internet. We were also offered to show how to operate the elevator with the room key, in a very rude and patronizing way by a woman with a Latino accent. In the room there was no hot water and the Internet did not work. Our calls to reception were not answered for the longest time, I had to go downstairs. They send a guy who was hovering around the reception up. He barges into the room without knocking, opening with the house key. He informs us that there nothing wrong with the hot water system and proceeds to turn on all the hot water taps and tells us to wait. Then he leaves by telling us to "be good". Really! Some manners! It took over 15 minutes to finally get some lukewarm water to shower. The next day, there was no housekeeping, no replenishment of the tea or anything of the sort. No hot water again, just lukewarm. This is not the kind of attitudes, manners and service one expects from a supposedly four star hotel.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_474552674~“Great for quick Sydney visits”~Delux 1 bedroom suite. Perfect size for 2 blokes to stay for just a few days. The people at the desk are just fantastic, make sure that eat breakfast at the cafe next door. Great variety and taste hmmmm~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473248230~“This met our requirements”~Booked through airbnb, the location was great. The suite was great through the three of us. Only problem was the shower which would not lock in position. The rooms were clean and basics provided. Internet costs 5 dollars a day.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_473055920~“Great location, good enough room”~By US standards of Wyndham time share properties, this place is good enough. The staff is top notch. The room is well equipped, you'll lack nothing in the kitchen. Our one bedroom does not have a clothes washer/dryer or dishwasher. The bathroom toiletries are adequate but not upscale. The location, however, is convenient to city bus and train lines. The nearest grocery store is about six blocks away, so not really too inconvenient. We have not rented a car and we find it has not limited us. We are using public transportation and taxis to get around. We are touring within Sydney except for one tour out of town, but the tour is picking us up next door, very convenient. We took a limo from the airport here and that worked out beautifully. Location is great, the greatest benefit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472797134~“Great Location Very Comfortable”~This was the second time we've stayed here. This place is a stones throw away from Hyde Park and within walking distance of World Square and public transport such as Museum and Central train stations. The rooms and facilities are of a very high standard and our room on the 10th floor had an awesome kitchenette, dining table, lounge room and couch. Heaps of room for just the two of us. Staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful. I'd recommend this place to anyone coming to Sydney for a visit as a base from which to adventure from. We'll be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470451436~“Terrible stay”~Terrible experience, no restaurant, room service, have to pay for wifi. Last night there dirty towels left on floor, cupboard doors left open, bed made but room not cleaned. One morning had trouble getting taxi, asked the girl at front desk for help she stated nothing she could do and smiled as she said good luck in meeting our excursion. Upset as our last stay during our 3 week trip to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469595260~“Excellent!!!”~This place is excellent to stay! I'm a frequent traveller and this one lived Upto and exceeded my expectations! I stay in Wyndham resorts if I can usually! The aircon wasn't overly great but as it wasn't overly hot it didn't worry me so much! The room itself was very roomy, and has all the mod cons! I love it.. The traffic I thought I wasn't used to, was not an issue with noise, the parking service (valet) this resort has is brilliant! I use this as it's also cheaper then other car parks within Sydney CBD.  Position in proximity to the city is excellent!! It is fairly easy to get to if you're capable of Sydney city driving :)  Foxtel was great to watch the footy, and is a short walk to anywhere in Sydney such as Chinatown!  Staff at this resort are excellent!  Sleep quality 4/5 - because I'm wrestless! The bed is really comfy! The wifi I brought my own - highly recommend Vodafone 4G as it flies! They do have wifi from here I prefer to use my own!  I'd definitely stay here again! Love it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468442810~“Ideal Location for City Break/Visit”~Stayed here for 12 nights during our first visit to Sydney. We chose room only option with a small kitchen which enabled us to have greater flexibility. Took a $17.50 (20m) train ride from Sydney International Airport to Museum followed by 5 min walk to Wyndham. Alternatively a 10m walk from the Railway Station. Located to the south end of the Central Business District (CBD) for us this was ideal. It's a compact hotel but our room was substantial with ensuite and a small but very functional kitchen. Very comfortable bed and everything worked. Wifi is available at an additional cost of $5 per day which in this day and age seems unusual. We didn't have breakfast included but there is a very nice cafe linked to the hotel at ground floor level, excellent choice of breakfast options and fabulous coffee. We walked to most of the main areas of interest, Darlington Harbour (20m), Circular Quay (30m) but these could easily be reached by bus or rail. We bought an Opal Card for $30 and this can be topped up and used on buses, rail and the ferry. On Sundays you can travel anywhere on the network for $2.50 which is an absolute bargain. We took the ferry to Manly which would otherwise cost $7.50 single trip. The staff were very helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great value.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468192957~“Good Hotel and good location”~We were pleasantly surprised how good this was. We received a nights accommodation in a package deal with a cruise. The room was very spacious with meals area, Kitchen, lounge area and separate bedroom and separate ensuite, great shower. We were on level three and my only concern was a little road noise, higher would be better. Close to China Town and Paddy's markets. Easy walk to Darling Harbour and Circular Quay. Would certainly stay there again and would be great for an extended break~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467715812~“Long weekend stay”~The hotel is very close to Museum Station which makes getting to and from the airport a breeze.

review_467708950~“Negative experience, do not get sucked into complimentary items.”~A family member is currently on a trial period with Wyndham hotel resort and we stayed here for one night. We were invited to a complimentary buffet breakfast at 7:15am the morning of our departure and were given a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival. After our 'complimentary' hotel breakfast we were ambushed by hotel management to inform us that if we did not attend a 45 minute information session that we would be charged $100, on top of our already expensive room, to pay for breakfast as we were not willing to attend the session. After speaking to 2 of the hotel staff we were told that there was nothing that could be done and that we should be prepared to pay for our 'free' breakfast if we weren't going to have a one on one seminar with a manager. This would have been fine if we were informed of these conditions attached to accepting complimentary products however we were not and I believe that it was unfair on their behalf. In the end they did accept our decline and decided not to charge us for the breakfast or make us go to the seminar as it was our first stay and we had been told the wrong information. This has dampened our experience with Wyndham resorts and has made us feel quite negative and hesitant about rebooking.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467436692~“Great CBD Position To Access Tours, Transport Shopping and Restaurants”~How easy this place was to get to and away from. With the Museum Train Station close by so easy to get a train to and from the airport. A short walk via the gardens to access the Sydney CBD as well as Chinatown in the opposite direction. While we had a 1 bedroom deluxe, I found it tight for bedroom space as our two luggage cases had no real place to be conveniently located. The rooms however had everything else you needed to be very comfortable. The staff were very welcoming and even called a few hours after our arrival to ascertain that all was well with our room.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467076512~“Central location!”~We upgraded from a studio to an apartment for a very low cost when we arrived at the hotel even though we booked months in advance. The staff were very accommodating! The cafe in the hotel although owned by a separate company is cheap and good quality for breakfast. $10 for bacon and eggs with a coffee. Easy stroll to central station, Pitt st mall and China town.  I wouldn't get a studio for a stay longer than maybe one two nights they are tiny! Also avoid the lure of the room discount and free breakfast for the sales pitch of the timeshare. It's literally some cereal and toast. And your check in time is after all other guests. One family were waiting until 4pm.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465680157~“Overnight stay”~Great reception, room clean and comfortable. All fixtures and fittings in working order.

review_465215253~“Small 1 bedroom , nice staff”~We are wyndham owners . We booked in January and rooms and choice were limited.. didnt realise it was Mardi Gras weekend at the time . we ended up booking a Sky 1 bedroom which is on the top floor.  We have stayed in a 1 bedroom before and the sky 1 bedroom is definitely smaller. According to booking confirmation the room sleeps 4... virtually impossible. The third dining chair we popped out in the hall as it was so cramped. The bedroom was very cramped as was the bathroom with one towel rail, no hand towel rail and no robe hooks which could double as a towel hanger.. the furniture is tired and definitely in need of upgrading, the paint work scruffy and cleaning of the room prior to our arrival could have been better, with a few bits and pieces under the coffee table.   Definitely room for improvement . ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464441091~“Nice friendly hotel”~This hotel / apartment was clean & roomy enough for 2 people. It was surprisingly quiet considering it is on a busy corner. It is in walking distance of many things including the train station, bus stops that take you to Bondi beach & Sampson bay, good restaraunts, light rail to paddys markets, fisherman markets, darling harbour etc. if you don't feel like a longer walk. The staff were super friendly but do push the free breakfast with the Wyndam resort presentation. They offer other good incentives also. We were going to go however were not feeling great on our last day in Sydney so gave it a miss.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_464186508~“Average studio hotel room in a very good location”~We went to Sydney for an extended weekend. We chose the Wyndham "Resort" a venue in Surrey Hills as this is close to what we wanted to see. The lobby/hotel entrance was very basic. Four people were ahead of us and the place seemed packed. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. We booked a studio apartment with kitchenette style facilities as we were staying for three nights. I'd want a bigger room for a longer stay. Still, all in all the room was serviceable, clean and suited our needs. The location is very good and in easy walking distance to shops and attractions and is also close to public transport. The other residents (apparently an international tour group) were as noisy as I've ever encountered. They were up half the night playing cards, banging doors, laughing etc. Sound insulation is definitely not the building's strong point.  Location wise, I'd stay again, however I would check other nearby offerings first.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_463980355~“Perfect for a stay in Sydney”~Stayed in a one bedroom deluxe - ample room for hubby and I with a well equipped kitchen, Coles is just up the road in World Square or convenience store is right next door. . The location is great, easy to catch the train to Museum Station from airport if need be. Walking distance to Martin Place, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour etc. If you don't want to do a presentation...just say 'NO', that simple!! Reception was very helpful, plenty of eateries within walking distance......suits our needs whenever we visit Sydney.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463969408~“Reasonably standard apartment, but not a resort.”~Wyndham Vacation "Resorts" in Sydney is a short walk from Central or Museum train station, making it reasonably well located in the Sydney CBD. It's a very short walk to World Square and Chinatown, and a comfortable walk to Darling Harbour. The Hotel itself is very standard-fare for an Aparthotel, and this was where I was a little surprised. It doesn't feel like Wyndham standard, and it is certainly no resort. From the outside the building is quite plain, located in a plain area; there is no pool nor recreational area, the foyer is very small, and the "restaurant" from what I observed looks like a cheap takeaway joint. Having stayed elsewhere with Wyndham previously, and knowing their resort standard, this feels miles apart. As for the rooms, they are again pretty standard apartment-style, no problems there. What was a problem however was the blood-or-other-substance stain on our bed quilt. That's just gross. Also, we were only given one roll of toilet paper for our stay and even when it was just about all used, housekeeping still didn't give us any more, so we had to ask for some... now I know that's not a big deal, but seriously... are they trying to save money? Oh also, one of the bathrooms in our friends room smelt a bit off, like faint smells of sewage wafting up through the shower drain. The staff at Wyndham were friendly and welcoming and made check-in easy. However, they can be rather pushy with trying to get you to sign up to their Wyndham program. We had barely been their for 10 minutes and they were insisting we have a session with them to discuss their packages within the next 24 hours. There was also a miscommunication on their part regarding parking and the associated fees. I very clearly established what I needed over the phone prior to our stay and agreed to the amount, and then was charged double that amount as I left the hotel. Eventually after some insistence on my part, they gave me the cheaper rate, but it was a pretty poor way to finish our stay.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~2~nan

review_461077036~“No Resort”~Very disappointed from the get go. Our room wasn't ready until 4.30pm. Was pounce upon by Wyndham sales staff pressuring us for a free breakfast & presentation. Wouldn't take no for an answer. When we cancelled they would just try harder. When people are on holidays there's nothing worse than being pressured, maybe give them the option, without the pressure. No pool. No free Wifi. No information about the so-called resort in rooms. I had to ask where the Laundry was. No information about where to put rubbish, My Husband found the rubbish room on our departure day. Staff weren't overly friendly and when we checked out all that was said to us was ok your done. Very disappointed. All the timeshare resorts we have stayed in would be 100% better and friendly than this one. Won't be coming back~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan

review_457178157~“Central base for Sydney with great customer service!”~I've stayed at Wyndham Sydney a couple of times now. Always great customer service, clean and tidy rooms and a very central location Love the kitchenette when staying for more than a night. Valet parking option takes away the drama of navigating city streets.  Recently renovated rooms with great facilities including range of free movies, wifi and 2 televisions with the option to seperate the sleeping and entertaining areas of the room. Value for $ - Sydney accommodation at its best.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455217879~“Well located accommodation”~This place does not look much from the outside and is easily missed, especially as the entrance is not actually on Wentworth Avenue. However, it has many floors, each of which only contain about 6 apartments. The apartments are reasonably spacious and comfortable, with a small kitchen included. The bed is comfortable and the room quiet, lending oneself to a good night's sleep. The furnishings are rather 'tired' but still perfectly functional. For the first couple of days, only one lift was working, which proved to be annoying at times. There is small cafeteria on the ground floor, which some guests seemed happy to use for breakfast and snacks. The best thing about the place, though, is its location. No, it is not on Sydney Harbour but it is within easy walking distance of the harbour, botanical gardens and Sydney Opera House, which we never tired of seeing. It is also well placed for using public transport to explore further afield. A great base for spending a few days in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan

Kitchenette was usable but fridge was too close to cupboards and you needed to ensure it was shut properly and not caught ajar on cupboard. Loud music from near by venues was a bit of a problem but was quiet after 11pm.  Didn't appreciate the hard sell to hear about the advantages of joining. Quite invasive questions about finances etc. Was booked in for breakfast before we could blink and then when we said 'no' the attitude was markedly changed.We were staying as guests of a friend and this apparently shouldn't have happened.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_444568281~“Go somewhere else!”~When I joined Worldmark many years ago I was told all their resorts are at least five star. I have visited other resorts and can say they are five star or above. The Sydney resort is 3 star at best. It's decor looks cheap and nasty and run down. The outside is almost embarrassingly so. A five star resort ought to have good facilities. The gym is the size of a small living room and the equipment is old, and when we were there, wasn't working. I have never been to the restaurant but the menu looks very much like something you would find in a food court. As a member who has been with the club for years you would think I would get some perks. But these resorts charge you for everything. I don't know many hotels these days that charge guests for Internet use. Wake up Worldmark. I also have to park my car a block away because they don't ever have any spaces for me. Plus parking is not free even though I pay and annual fee and housekeeping fees. It's not like membership is free. I paid a lot of money for my membership and don't feel like I have gotten much back for my tens of thousands of dollars I have spent. I would recommend you find another hotel it will cost you the same and will probably be nicer. Sydney resort is a big disappointment.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443339536~“Walk A Thon”~This Wyndham is in a great location, just blocks from museum and central train stations, grocery store and shopping. We had the 1 bedroom, it's tiny, even for just us two. Staff were very nice and helpful for towels, coffee and directions as needed. It has a nice little kitchen to help self cook, which we did use most of our meals for to help save on $. We averaged about 12 miles a day on foot playing tourist to all the sites in Sydney, with trains rides in between. We started by doing the I free walk tours off George street, rode the hop on/off bus for 48hrs in Sydney and over to Bond Beech, which helps see the bigger spots. Sydney fish market is must stop for a meal. IFood tour of Surry hills was a great little afternoon snacking on some great food. Sky tower view was cool, but the food lacks any flavor or good variety. All the walking caused us to miss the blue mountains this time as we did need a little rest on vacation, lol~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_441348815~“Enjoyable Stay”~Over Thanksgiving break, my husband and I spent 9 days at this WorldMark by Wyndham hotel in Sydney, Australia. Upon arrival at around 10 am, we were thankful that Tandra Williams, an outstanding staff member at this hotel made it possible for us to have a room available - after a long 21 hours flight from USA. The room was comfortable and clean. Tandra assisted us tremendously during our stay and we thank her for her professionalism and her happy go lucky demeanor. Olivia and Katy helped us in our checking into Quantas for our return journey for which we are thankful. Whether it was exchanging towels or requesting for a newspaper, the staff at this hotel were very friendly and courteous. We had a lovely time during our stay and because of the location of this hotel, it was easier for us to walk to restaurants, and the station. Again our sincere thanks to all the staff at this hotel for their customer service and a big shout out to Tandra Williams for her outstanding service to us during our stay.

review_441028661~“Value for money, pleasant and comfortable”~My teenage son and I stayed in a one bedroom suite for a two night weekend holiday in Sydney. The layout of the room was perfect, because my sleeping area could be completely closed off from his with a solid bi-fold wall. The main bed is two king size doubles pushed together to form a king size bed. The other bed is a sofa bed, which my son said was very comfortable, but just a bit short for his 6'4" body. The room is large, modern and very well appointed, with a nice kitchen area and large bathroom. Having to go through the bedroom to the bathroom was a minor problem that was easily overcome with good planning between the two of us. In the living area, there is a small dining table, large TV, sofa, chairs and desk. It was really very pleasant! Everything in the room worked, the drapes were effective in reducing light and the air-conditioning was very quiet (so all my "pet hates" were addressed). The hotel is located on a busy intersection, but the noise levels in the room were very low. There was a small balcony off the living area that looked onto Goulburn street. The staff were pleasant and attentive in all our interactions. The hotel is located a long way from Circular Quay and The Rocks, but anyone with moderate fitness would enjoy the 3km walk there. The Museum train station is nearby. It is well located for Chinatown, Darling Harbour, the theatres around Haymarket and World Square Shopping Centre. Overall, a nice experience. Excellent value for money. We would stay there again.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_440724802~“Great Location - helpful staff - average room”~Coming from Canada we expected a LOT more from a Wyndham property - especially one supposedly a premier property. This had the feel of an old Holiday Inn!  First the good points. The location is GREAT. The staff VERY helpful. The room is a good size and has a decent kitchen . However the kitchen amenities were barely adequate andthe layout of the "suite' was awkward! The shower always leaked over the flood so we constantly needed new towels to replace those on the floor soaking up water.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan

review_440534256~“great location”~We are timeshare holder, we asked about housekeeping visit they said for timeshare holder they do clean or visit our room not until we check out or upon request we charge ( According to Zoe from the front desk). We stayed in 2 bedroom suites with 2 bathrooms and kitchenette. Our view from 15th floor is decent. During our stay we asked for extra towels on our 2nd night (oct 24 at approx. 10pm) since it’s the 5 of us, we waited but they never delivered it. We just came down the following day to get some. Towels are free of charge but for linen, there will be charges, I don’t know if this is applicable to timeshare holders only. WIFI charges were 5$ for 500 MB and 7$ for 1.5 GB per 24hours, and 6 of us were able to connect without any problem.  The location is very convenient, close to Elizabeth st. where the bus stop located. One thing that is problematic was their keycard. It’s very sensitive, 3 out of 5 key cards stop working because it was demagnetized. Different people had the cards, and it all demagnetized.  Tip: there’s convenient store right next to the lobby of the hotel, but I will SUGGEST you go toward Elizabeth st. and make a right turn if you are coming from Wyndham, there’s this better convenient store right in front of the bus stop, they offer more items and they sell and top up OPAL cards. Or you can walk along Wentworth's and there’s coles store there~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~3~nan
review_440007712~“Not a vacation, nor a resort”~I would not stay here. The room is decent The area is within walking distance of many good locations for dinner and entertainment. However, we had an experience this morning that is reflective of their negligent customer service. My wallet accidentally fell out of my bag in the reception area as we were checking out. By the time I returned to retrieve it - which was five minutes - they had allowed a stranger to take it to the local area police station instead of holding onto it. My wallet was never handed into the police station. I am also disappointed that even though I was not the registered guest, they could not remember that I was a guest in that short period of standing before them checking out. It was not rush hour. It is evident, they had looked my name up, saw no match to their guest list and therefore washed their hands of any further responsibility. Whilst I am sure the staff are good people, their practices around their guests needs to be reviewed. They created unnecessary distress with no accountability. I think the way staff manage a hotel says a lot about a place. Maybe they need to focus less on pushing their time share program and actually connect responsibly with their guests. We will not be coming back nor recommending it.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_435478934~“Great location, amazing staff, super comfy room”~I loved my home away from home at the Wyndham. The staff were absolutely amazing. They were friendly, extremely helpful and honesty, just lovely. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. The bed was great, but there was a noticeable lack of any significant bureau or shelving to put clothing onto. You have two small drawers in each of the bedside tables, and another very small cabinet with 3 small drawers in the closet and no shelves except the one across the top. Since everything else is so wonderful here, I just did my best and just semi lived out of my suitcase for the week. There was lots of hot water and good water pressure, and the central a/c and heat worked well. There’s laundry on 3 of the floors and it costs $3 AUD for either a wash or dry. They’ll provide soap if you ask at the front desk. The kitchen has an electric hot water kettle, French press for coffee, toaster, 2 burner stove, small refrigerator and microwave. They have lots of cookware, utensils, plates, cups, glasses, silverware, etc. There’s also some starter coffee, tea, sugar, milk, and some salt and pepper packets, dish soap, sponge, and a kitchen towel. No paper towels.  Wifi is $5 AUD/day or $7 AUD/day depending on how fast you want it to be.  To get here from the airport, buy an Opal card at a WH Smith store at the airport and load it with some money. The fare to the Wyndham on the Airport Link was slightly over $14 AUD 1 way if you pay with the Opal card or I believe about $18 AUD if you just buy a ticket. Take the Airport Link to Museum Station and from there it’s about a 5-minute walk to the Wyndham. Just head outside to Liverpool and Elizabeth Streets. Head directly across Liverpool and walk down the hill on Elizabeth to the next light at Goulburn St. At Goulburn go across the street and to the left and the hotel is a block down on the right. Any Airport Link train you take from the airport will take you to Museum Station, but when you go back to the airport, not every train from Museum Station in that direction will take you to the airport. I believe only the T2 line goes to the airport, so make sure you check the board and get on the right train when you return. The Wyndham is very centrally located. It’s about a ½ hour walk to Circular Quay, or instead just go back to Museum Station and take the train 2 stops to get there. The fare is $2.36 AUD 1 way. If you walk out of the Wyndham and take a left, 3 blocks down and across the street is the World Square mall. On the lower level you’ll find Cole’s Supermarket, Liquorland, Priceline Pharmacy and a bunch of ATM’s. You’ll also find lots of shops and restaurants there including my two favorites there: Hero Sushi and Grill’d, which are both on the street level floor. If you buy too many things here and didn’t leave sufficient room in your suitcase, I totally recommend to the Sydney Luggage Center in Town Hall Square. I bought the best expandable carry-on bag there from Anna and I’ll be bringing with me on all my future travels! Enjoy Sydney!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435146553~“Great location”~Found this hotel great for getting about. Was quite quiet but just a short walk from museum station which takes you to circular quay, harbour bridge, opera house. Very clean and staff where friendly. They provide you with a 2 hour gym pass at SnapFitness which is a 1 minute walk from the hotel for $6 which I thought was great value!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434999648~“We use this frequently and its handy to everything”~Rooms have always been great, no wonderful views, but location v good, lots of food at all prices around. If your fit you can walk to town otherwise catch a bus or the train. Museum and park and train very close and handy. You can catch the train in the next street to the airport~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433834614~“Wouldn't stay there again”~Weeks ago we send an request for an early check in.....  Arriving at around 10am the Girl said check in is at 4pm but you will have priority, so we will let housekeeping know to do your room now. After asking what time do you think we get our room ? we got told, we don't know when the Guest will check out. ....hello ???? At 2pm on the dot ( normal Hotel check in time !!!! ) we got a call, room is ready Also we send weeks ago an request for an upper floor and got the key for the first floor. So far for requests. But than? we are no members Location is not too bad but we stayed in more central located areas. Coming from the Airport we got out at Museum station and from there its a 5 min walk. Studio was spacious and clean. Hardly any noises from the outside road even that we were nearly street level Beds were comfortable. Late afternoon we got a phone call if we would like to attend a time share seminar in the morning at 7.15 or 9.00 am  Sorry ...but no thanks When we booked it didn't even click that Wyndham is time share otherwise we would never have booked it. Staff was while checking in very friendly, cheerful and helpful, but checking out we didn't even get a good bye Their job was done NO FREE Internet It will cost $5.00 or $ 7.00 for 24 hours. Suitcases can be stored in a secure area~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_433125237~“Little far from the heart of everything and everything is a bit off ”~The hotel is a 45 min walk from circular Quay. There is the world market with a coles and lots of restaurants within 4-5 blocks. The rooms are efficiencies. With an emphasis on little. We had a King bed and hardly any room for opening a couple of suitcases. The bathroom is really a bad design. The sink overhangs the toilet. Convenient if you want to brush you teeth while using the toilet, otherwise just a big design dilemma. You can't even open one of the cabinet doors. The shower is very small and ours leaked all over the floor.  Our booking came with a "full breakfast". However, day one we left too early. Breakfast starts at 7:00. Day two we had a pick up at 7:30. We went to breakfast at 7:00 to be told, we were not " on the list". Three trips back and forth between the front desk and the separately run restaurant finally fixed it but we felt like second hand thieves at that point. If we come again, I would find something closer to the Harbor~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431673400~“Centrally Located - Ideal position”~Wyndham Vacation Resort at 35 Wentworth St, Sydney is an ideal location to access all areas in Sydney. The main entrance to the Hotel is actually around the corner in Goulburn Street. It is approximately 5 min walk to Railway Stations, Bus Stop, Restaurants & Pubs. Handy to everything. We purchased an Opal Card (Public Transport Pre-Paid card) each with $20 on them and traveled all over Sydney included catching a bus to Bondi, another to Watson's Bay then we traveled by Ferry around the Sydney Habour back to Circular Quay which gave wonderful views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. We then traveled on the train back to the Hotel. We still each have $12.98 left on our Opal Cards. What a wonderful time we have had see the sights of Sydney.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_431369080~“Central location - good room size”~I've stayed at Wyndham resorts many times and nearly every year. The location is excellent as it is within walking distance to China town and world square and is surrounded by shops.  This time around we stayed in the 2 bedroom sky suite and we were on the 16th floor. The room was clean and quite spacious and the view from the room that we had was good of the city views. I think it certainly helped that we were on the second highest floor.  Tip : 1) if you are staying in a one bedroom, you will find the room sizes not as spacious. The two bedrooms are roomy. I've stayed at both.  2) sky suite in my opinion are only worth it if you are staying in a 2 bedroom as a 1 bedroom sky suite (the room we had previously) is less spacious than a standard 1 bedroom normal room. Our previous 1 bedroom sky suite was only on the 9th floor with a view of a blank wall of the opposite building so save your money or go pay for higher level.  If you are only concerned about location then it's a great place to stay in Sydney. Comfort, views and room sizes is luck of the draw unless you get 2 bedrooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_428283963~“Good for location not comforts.”~Nothing special. Very tiny one-bedroom unit. The so-called kitchen was super tiny; you wouldn't want to have to do any cooking as you could barely move in the place. In comparison to other Wyndhams I've stayed at this was the smallest one-bedroom unit. I guess maybe because it's Sydney? I took great pleasure in being 'out of the hotel' and walking all over the CBD and doing things that Sydney has to offer, including eating out.  The staff were pleasant.  There is no pool at this hotel, and the gym is a joke - a tiny room with 1 treadmill, 1 bike and a weight machine. Good thing there were so many walking opportunities outside to get the exercise in.  Bed was not very comfortable, and the water took forever to get hot in the shower and in the basins. I hated the thought of wasting so much water just to take a shower. Disappointing.~2~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
