review_478703228~“Song hotel”~We were happy with everything, the breakfast was especially nice when booked on line. The location was great as we were already in city center. The parking was fine and it was not too far away. The staff were always very helpful and friendly.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_466334111~“Location!”~Love the location. Start of oxford st and opposite Hyde park and a short stroll to train station so no need to take the car. All staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is also included in the price. The rooms are clean and neat. Good value as staying in Sydney is getting ridiculously expensive and the Song Kitchen offers a great budget alternative. Highly recommend.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan

review_478379073~“Never again”~Yhotel needs to go back to basics - booking, check in, room facilities and breakfast all needs an overhaul. Very poor internet access (inability to check on my booking/payment), the bed was on wheels and kept moving around the room, breakfast was a disaster- you don't put salt in eggs and the bacon was cooked on a dirty plate. I would not recommend this to a homeless person - they deserve better.~1~1~3~2~1~2~1~nan

review_477843061~“Rude staff”~I booked this hotel through booking.com. I called to change my booking for the following days and the receptionist told me my card was declined even though it does appear in my bank balance the transaction was done. I even told him I had an email saying the payment was already done and he kept insisting it wasn't and try to charge me again the whole amount. Also, when I asked if I could move my booking he did not give me an option to pay an extra fee and moving the booking for the next two days and told me I could not make any changes and I had lost the money I have paid for the 3 nights booking.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_474051110~“Good value stay”~The hotel's location and value are very good. My stay included a hot breakfast and it was a good simple breakfast that included choice of eggs& bacon or spinach. There was cereal, bread, butter and ham too with coffee or tea. My only grouse is the single pane windows in my room that allowed the loud sirens and conversations of bar goers till early hours of the morning. I had to use ear plugs to sleep.

review_472751338~“Avoid this dump”~I would advise travellers to give this 'hotel' a big miss.  Unfortunately I have 1 more night to stay as my accomodation was pre paid, but I am looking for other options. The rooms are extremely noisy as the window glazing is inadequate, I feel like I have slept directly on Oxford Street. The sliding door onto the balcony cannot be locked, so whilst the room is not secure, this also adds to the noise factor. Then to make matters worse, the shower is just one stream of water, with poor pressure. Staff on duty seem to have a care factor of zero when asked to address these issues.

review_471992691~“Like a backpackers but clean”~Rooms did not look like pictures on website. The room had no access to balcony, one chair, no tables. The women's shared bathroom was across the floor we were staying on. The fridge froze our food. The tv was next to a locked door that stood between our room and someone else's and with the volume down as low as it can go and subtitles they still proceeded to bang on the wall for us to turn it off. The keys took 5-10 tries to work and then eventually (tried all 3) didn't work on the last night. Got them 'fixed' worked once then all didn't work again (didn't store them near phone) so had to have someone stay in room at all times to get back into it. Front desk staff was rude while asking them to fix them.  Says included breakfast on website so we told the restaurant staff in the morning that we were there for the included breakfast in the reservation and the staff member took me to front desk to see if I had payed for it but then soon after realised I was there for the included breakfast in reservation after I told him firstly that's what we wanted.

review_471532539~“Very budget”~Very budget hotel, no onsite parking.  Don't think I would stay here again . If you are looking for cheap accommodation it would be suitable but I wouldn't suggest for families.

review_471269404~“Great hotel”~Stayed here for 6nights. Brilliant price for the location. Breakfast was included, although 8$ if you want a hot breakfast.  Hyde park nearby! Was great. Close to CBD and the opera house and bridge are within 15mins. Access from the main rail line is a 10minute walk. Had a shared bathroom, was super clean and tidy.

review_470701317~“Overall not a bad stay”~The hotel needs an upgrade in their bathrooms etc, They also need to get wifi.

We liked walking and crossing Hyde Park was very enjoyable every times. Closer to museum station than central it was only 5 min walk. Easy to walk to Kings Cross to eat or to a nearby Street.

review_475401589~“An updated YMCA type hotel”~On the plus side this is a centrally located clean hotel right by Hyde Park with nice staff. The breakfast is a basic continental affair with cereals and bread on offer with coffee tea fruit juice etc which can be upgraded to eggs and bacon for an extra $8. The decor in the common areas is bright and attractive. The room had the usual facilities and was fine. The shower was just great! On the down side this is a cold impersonal hotel with grim carpeting in the long endless corridors and I had a view on some depressingly plants on a grubby patio from my window. There was a false fire alarm in the evening but they kept us up to date with what was going on so we didn't need to leave our rooms, just put up with the annoying ringing. I discovered my sheet had blood on it - not mine - it was clean though, nevertheless disconcerting. I wouldn't stay here again although the price was good. It might be the blood that did it for me!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474996069~“BEWARE OF TRAFFIC NOISE AT THE SONG”~Having previously stayed here, we were surprised by how noisy it was this time on the 7th floor in our mini-apartment. Double-glazing is needed. It was good to have some basic cooking facilities. Space on the wardrobe side of the comfy bed was about A4 width - walked sideways. Guests can use the pay-by-use laundry. A staff member was very lazy, pulling up our bed twice, and leaving the room and bathroom uncleaned. Reported to management the 2nd time, and Bobbi did an excellent job to fix it. This hotel is getting old, and the bathroom is tired - missing tiles,on floor, grout gone on bath edges, sharp "plug" edge in bath - I hurt my toe on it. Breakfast is good and the front staff are helpful. Many school and other young groups stay here, so the lobby can be crowded and the lifts busy at times. We will not stay here again because of the dreadful traffic noise 24/7.~3~3~5~1~3~3~3~nan

Rang up for late check out at 12, staff were happy to but around 11:30 at staff member opened the door to clean the room up without knocking.~2~2~4~3~2~3~2~nan
review_471965912~“Sydney stay”~The hotel is good value for money with a great location and pleasant staff. Unfortunately the noise from the street below meant that there was no sleep. I had requested quiet rooms - and these were not quiet.~3~4~4~1~5~5~5~nan
review_471773430~“for a song”~Great location, small but clean tidy room, bed comfortable,. As I had need of only minimal contact with staff, and spent no time in my hotel room except for when I was sleeping, I can make no further comment . . .~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan

review_471553097~“Just what we needed!”~Perfect location, and just what we needed, we had a middle of the night check out due to having to go to the airport and the staff were very accommodating, served the exact purpose we needed. Hotel bar very nice~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_471532539~“Very budget”~Very budget hotel, no onsite parking.  Don't think I would stay here again . If you are looking for cheap accommodation it would be suitable but I wouldn't suggest for families.  I didnt find it easy to get to and from parking, and there is a hill you need to walk up from closest parking to the hotel if you have a lot of luggage.~2~3~3~1~2~2~5~nan
review_471269404~“Great hotel”~Stayed here for 6nights. Brilliant price for the location. Breakfast was included, although 8$ if you want a hot breakfast.  Hyde park nearby! Was great. Close to CBD and the opera house and bridge are within 15mins. Access from the main rail line is a 10minute walk. Had a shared bathroom, was super clean and tidy.  Room had maid service everyday if you requested it. Overall a fantastic stay and I would definitely stay here again. The wifi was good too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471005935~“Very good”~A nice hotel. Simple and small room but fine for the price and a good location. Walking distance to museum station. Yummy breakfast, helpful and attentive staff. Clean hotel but outdated bathrooms. Happy hour in the cafe next door was good!~4~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_470753416~“Fantastic location in an older hotel”~Fantastic location (close to city, Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Surry Hills, Darlinghurst), great price, room is doable and has shown its age though the staff kept it as clean as it could be. The room smelled of mold but I couldn't smell it after a while.~3~5~5~5~3~4~4~nan
review_470701317~“Overall not a bad stay”~The hotel needs an upgrade in their bathrooms etc, They also need to get wifi. They need to get rid of the musty odour in the passages and rooms which is overpowering. Does not smell fresh. The breakfast area and dinner at the restaurant was the highlight.~3~3~5~4~3~3~5~nan
review_470697506~“Great Location”~A great location just opposite Hyde Park. Simple rooms but this was offset with a good breakfast. I upgraded to the cooked breakfast and was surprised at the quality of the scrambled egg and bacon I received. Would stay here again.~4~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
