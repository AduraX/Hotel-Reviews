review_476311124~“Average ”~It would be easy to see how people would get excited about this, but there are much better options around. It is part of the whole Establishment building/network of bars on different floors. Rooms are small, but give good space to the bathroom which is good. Door between the room and bathroom is heavy and didn't close properly and door to toilet doesn't provide much in the way pf preventing smell or noise. Wooden floors in hallway mean plenty of noise throughout day and night outside the room and if your room faces the laneway get ready for some serious noise during the night when the recycling truck comes to collect the bottles. Sydney is arguably the world's most expensive city and the Establishment does nothing to change this view. Around the world hoteliers are want to use 'quaint' as a great coverall for a while bunch of stuff that's wrong with the location or the standards and this is a good example. Other good standard properties are literally within a stone's throw and in much better locations. Don't buy the hype.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474435968~“Hidden Gem”~Tucked away in an alley off Pitt Street and only literally five minutes walk from Circular Quay, the totally unassuming frontage hides a real hidden gem. Behind the big black door is a very pleasant surprise. We had an Establishment Room which was large and spacious, as was the bathroom, with plenty of storage space and a very comfortable bed. Tea and coffee making facilities, biscuits, fruit and even bedtime tisanes were provided. A really nice touch. The whole place had a great atmosphere, especially the breakfast room and bar, which was really funky. The staff were smiling and pleasant and more than ready to assist in any way. However, if you want a room with a view this is not the place for you. Our room faced straight across the alley into offices but that didn't bother us. The blinds provided privacy (we hope!). The location is excellent for Circular Quay and The Rocks. We would definitely stay there again.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473576838~“Seriously funky hotel in great location”~I love this hotel. I've stayed here twice and intend making this my 'go to' Sydney hotel. The staff are wonderfully friendly, helpful and professional. The rooms are gorgeous - individually designed and decorated, spacious and well equipped with everything you need. I especially love the extra touches in this place: the fresh fruit in the rooms, the turn down service complete with herbal tea bags and cookies; not to mention the free wifi..I haven't been bothered by any excessive noise during the night although there is some road work being carried on nearby which is audible in the morning. The breakfast is excellent and served in the beautiful atrium room, and there are some terrific restaurants nearby that the staff can refer to you.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470945166~“Be like a rock star”~Sydney-siders know The Establishment Hotel as a popular place for afterwork drinks and as a pickup place for suits, but most are unaware that there is also a fine hotel. The entry is discreet through a back lane - perfect for making an incognito rockstar arrival. The rooms are immaculate, open plan and exquisitely designed. Whether you're looking for a staycation in Sydney or visiting its a wonderful choice.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_468147757~“Top Hotel with some serious charm”~This hotel oozes character.From the moment you enter the hotel you a greeted by sincere and genuine staff.  We are currently staying in the hotel and we love it, we do not want to leave, We were hesitant after reading some reviews about noise, however it is nothing to be concerned about, just what you would expect from an inner city hotel.  The concierge staff will go out of their way to make any reservation or any of your travel plans. SushiE is amazing !!! Can't wait to come visit again !!!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465504997~“Wonderful staff but don't expect any sleep!”~We had 3 nights at the Establishment, the hotel is very handy, just off Bridge Street and only minutes from Circular Quay. Every staff member is really great, they recommended and booked some fab restaurants for us and went out of their way to be helpful. The rooms are nicely done, modern and stylish, as are the public spaces. However, its incredibly noisy, there is no double glazing, the windows let in every sound, even on the higher floors. Partying goes on until the early hours, including on weekdays and then the refuse trucks and delivery vans arrive. The interior doors are really clunky and noisy too. We barely slept, despite the ear-plugs they'd left for us. If you value your Zzzz's, you might want to book somewhere else but if you're a party animal, go for it, you'll love it!~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465131491~“Some Bugs to Work Out”~The upside about The Establishment is the great location, a few minutes walk from everything, especially Circle Quay and the ferries to the various beaches. The downside was how nearly impossible it was to find; the entrance hidden in the alley ways created some interesting drama upon arrival and departure. For example, it took three attempts with the concierge to access a cab after my Uber driver gave up trying to find us and charged us $10.00 for trying. Tight on time to get to the airport, we had to drag our luggage out to Bridge Street to flag a cab down. The concierge helped us. Better signage maybe? Or tell them it's beside Mr. Wong's...I'm not sure. Loved the modern unique vibe of the hotel. Great rooms. Although by comparison for the same money, our friends lucked out on a much better spread and in a better position in the hotel. Beautifully designed and lovely rooms, extremely helpful staff on the front desk. Of the 4 nights we stayed there (Room 28), one caution – Saturday nights can be LOUD! Our room happened to be right above the dining / bar area, which, as it turns out, becomes a live band dance club until the wee hours. Fortunately (I think) the incessant thumping was interrupted by a false fire alarm at shriek levels which hopefully is an anomaly most weekends. Tried to get through to complain several times, but the switchboard was busy with other calls. They compensated us for the shenanigans. The two large cockroaches we saw in the hotel created some upset. One coming in the entrance just as we were leaving and one I killed in our room just before going to bed. We called management and they came and sprayed with apologies. Lastly, the bar dining area called "The Garden Cafe" was a beautiful space and provided an excellent self-serve breakfast. Over the few days we found the service cavalier, sometimes dodgy. The food is really good, but the service could definitely be improved, particularly later in the day. There was enough good about our stay to overlook some of the challenges. That was our experience, for what it's worth.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_464864708~“Beautiful warehouse Hotel with lots of character and charm”~This was such a unique Hotel... An old warehouse from the 1800's turn into a lovely hotel... Staff was very friendly, and the room was absolutly gorgeous.... Breakfast a bit pricy, but it was one of my favorites in all of Australia....Location is great, walking distance to Opera House, and the rocks... cute coffee shop right next to hotel.... enjoyed our first few nights here...~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_464045618~“The Staff is out of this world !”~Our family had a wonderful experience at the Establishment Hotel ! Adriane and Meg went above and beyond anything we could of expected ! The entire staff was so very helpful. They helped us get medical help, taxis, and even  really great pizza !  They helped us out in so many ways and we appreciate all that they did for us.  Jonathan , our server at breakfast ,was excellent and very cheerful !  I also want to acknowledge a very nice tall, blonde young man that we met while he was cleaning the elevator  and later he also took care of our room . He was a very hard working and polite person. Mr. Wong's was delicious and we were treated so well while dining there.  When we come back to Sydney we will definitely be staying at the Establishment Hotel! Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so pleasant! The Fisher Family Naples , Florida ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463526748~“Excellent hotel & location”~This hotel is in prime location for all of your business and personal travel needs. Only a couple of minutes walk to the Opera House and ferries, and shopping right outside the door. The staff were very helpful and friendly every day as we came and went from the hotel. The room was fantastic, great closet space, comfortable bed. The bathroom was very nice with a soaker tub and large shower with really great water pressure! Nightly turn down service with tea and a treat was a nice way to wind down after a busy day of work or play.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_458181024~“Stylish”~Stayed with business colleagues. Stylish hotel. Room large although a little dark. Difficult to shave in bathroom as no direct mirror in front of sink. Mattress either needs tu Int or changing. Lovely and helpful team.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450821470~“Industrial chic city hotel with fabulous dining options”~When in Sydney we normally stay at the Shangri-La, but have been wanting to try the Establishment Hotel due to the fact it houses some of the best restaurants in the city. It's a hidden gem - some taxis drivers will find it hard to find.  The rooms are chic and beautifully appointed.Very spacious for an inner city hotel.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449831137~“Worth Losing Your Big Hotel Chain "Points"”~Love this hotel-stayed 10 days. Was recommended by a friend who is equally a "points person" and I'm so glad my daughter and I booked. Hidden in the nice part of the city on a back alley next to the amazing "Mr Wongs" it is surprisingly quiet, bathroom is insanely spacious and hotel staff quaint and made you feel like they were your personal concierge. Turndown service was addicting! The only negative about this hotel was that the gym was a little old school but works in a pinch if you are looking just to maintain your fitness level while on vacay. Everything else makes up for this minor ding.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_449656216~“Great menu”~We managed to get in last minute for a 9 o'clock booking but they weren't fazed when we arrived earlier. We had pre-dinner cocktails and leisurely chose our food. I had the 2 course chef menu and my husband the 3. They even brought a small taster in the course where I wasn't eating. All of the courses were beautifully cooked but a special mention for the bugs and strip loin. We had side dishes of mashed potatoes and green vegetables and one portion we ample for both of us. I loved my coconut sorbet dessert with hints of passion fruit. Service was excellent with waiters taking time at the end of the evening to talk about our visit to Australia and our home in the U.K. We asked for a glass of recommended wine with each course and the selection was spot on. It was a great and special way to end our holiday. Prices aren't cheap but worth it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448010776~“All style, little substance”~Very attractive hotel and room. My husband and I spent two nights in a Penthouse apartment, and looks aside, the other great feature of this hotel is the accessibility it offers to Merivale restaurants.  On the downside, it's expensive, noisy, has no views to speak of, is hard to find and feels unsafe at night, and doesn't offer much in the way of service or facilities. No parking, no onsite restaurant, no gym, no day spa. In summary, it's ok for a fun night or two if you just want to dine at good city restaurants, but is not a destination hotel in its own right.~3~nan~nan~1~nan~4~2~nan
review_447924945~“Drinks”~Had a great time at this trendy bar. It is very large and had a great interior. If you want a good place to go that is not a tourist but local destination this is the place to go. The snacks are quite nice and not to badly priced.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444310731~“Luxury and character”~This hotel can be hard to find in a back laneway with no real frontage but once found is a delight to behold.What was once an old seemingly abandoned building has been cleverly restored and reborn into a smart hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, a large modern room with all the modcons, free wi fi and a comfy bed. Our breakfast the next day was good although the service could have been more attentive.Great location in the heart of the city. We will definitely return.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_441806544~“Personality Plus”~Funky hotel, huge bathroom (could do with a bigger mirror though). Comfy bed. Parking is an issue. Central to everything.

review_439815017~“Beautiful inner city room”~My partner and I stayed overnight during the week for a special getaway. We had the best experience! The studio room we stayed in was generously sized and included a myriad of added little extras which made the stay extremely comfortable and luxurious. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the bathroom was exquisite. All staff were extremely helpful and nice. Overall, the hotel made a lasting impression. Would return for sure!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_439135400~“Average boutique stay”~You really know what you're in for when you spot two sets of earplugs in the bathroom. But let's start with the positives: Great city location. Attentive and polite staff. Comfortable bed. Beautiful and modern interiors. Delicious room service. Good amount of space inside. There's an iPad in the room that you can use as well. Lots of items in the mini-bar. Ok, now onto the negatives: The NOISE. So. Much. Noise... from both inside the hotel and outside. Perhaps some sound-proof windows need to be installed? We could hear everyone outside (people chattering, cars going past... everything). Now let's talk about the inside noise. As the floors in my room had timber floors (and I'm assuming so do my neighbours), I could hear everyone else walking around in their room. I could also hear my neighbour's TV blaring at one stage too. I went without wearing ear plugs to bed (which I really regret), because at several points of the night I could hear people talking (I'm assuming the staff?), doors slamming, people knocking. I couldn't believe how much noise there was, and it wasn't even the weekend - I was there for a mid-week visit. I don't think I would stay here again simply because of the noise. If this was fixed, it'd really be a great hotel. Can't fault anything else.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_437254636~“Happy to stay there”~The best and attentive service from the first moment we checked in. Beautiful rooms, professional stuff, perfect location, lovely breakfast area, the night club at the first floor can be overpacked some days, but if you want excellent dinner and more relaxed atmosphere- my advice to go to Japanese bar at the 4th floor~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435716805~“Spacious room and city noise”~Best location if you want to be in the middle of night life in Sydney CBD. You can definitely hear the outside noise. You need ear plugs (provided) if you need to sleep early and wake up late. Room is very spacious as well as toilet and shower. Toilet is thoroughly cleaned everyday; I can smell cleaning products this is a very good practice. Water from the shower leaks towards the toilet and onto the hallway. Bed is great while pillows can be improved. Breakfast is average. NO bulgari products anymore like they used to.~3~nan~nan~1~nan~4~3~nan
review_433492868~“A welcome return”~It's been a while since my last visit and I don't know why. I really love this place. The rooms are super cool and the bathroom magical with stunning white marble and a fold away screen so you can view the tv from the comfort of your bath-tub. The bed is set up on a platform that makes you feel like you're sleeping on a giant throne. Carpet was a bit tired and could be spruced up a bit. Heed the advice of wearing the earplugs not because of the noise from the bars (I didn't hear a thing) but you may be there for the 4am rubbish collection. And yes, it's a tricky side entry into the hotel but I loved having Mr Wong next door so I could have dinner with a friend and then head straight to bed. And the staff are all very professional and super friendly making for a lovely arrival and farewell.~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433176577~“Ear Plugs”~Great location. Fantastic City. Excellent entertainment and good way to get into Mr. Wong restaurant. Staff quirky, maybe need a better presence, a uniform perhaps. The bars are excellent. Rooms are located in an old building and this is definitely historical as well as charming. Bathroom spacious and excellent. Now for the not so GOOD. The room is not user friendly, light switches are a nightmare to find let alone use. They have Samsung large TV in room but they are out of focus with only 90% of full frame showing, crazy in this day and age. The air-con buttons are all worn out so you don't know how to use the damn thing. No introduction to room. As for security, not good at all. You can not lock room from inside so anyone can walk in as was the case with us, where one of the staff unannounced just entered said virtually nothing and ran off. Scary but true, he apparently made a mistake and did not have the common courtesy to say something let alone apologize as he was scared, buddy so was my WIFE! Not Happy. Finally the corridors and doors are so thin that they provide you with EAR PLUGS so you can sleep. Not good folks, planning and renovating this old building was not well thought out at all.  Would I go back for many reasons yes but then I think about the sleep facilities and have to say sorry not for the prices they charge......~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_430821030~“Great welcome to Sydney ”~My wife and I stayed at the Establishment Hotel on our first visit to Sydney. The reception was welcoming. The room was spacious and of the highest quality. The breakfast in the atrium was wonderful. I echo some of the comments about the water from the shower. Another frustrating feature was the seemingly high tech light switch.  Overall a very nice hotel in a great location.  Thank you, Keith~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427101946~“Romantic and trendy”~As an aging baby boomer - Im not really the target market for this trendy boutique hotel but enjoyed my overnight Sunday stay nonetheless. Good service and not having to queue for Mr Wong's was a huge bonus. Lovely room. Only niggles were the flood from the shower that others have noted and not having anywhere to hang up our towels. The breakfast in the beautiful atrium was great the next morning - somewhat limited buffet choice but outstanding quality and absolutely everything I love to eat!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_426210008~“An inexpesive Jewel for foodies”~From the street you might never stop at this motel. It was obviously built in the seventies and has no street apeal. But once inside it is terrific (let's be honest here for $99 you don't expect the Ritz) we were just stopping over one night on our way to Queensland so we were not after something that was too expensive and saw this on the Internet for $99 so we booked. I must confess to having some misgivings as my Wife booked us in with a charming Asian lady owner. All my fears were alayed however when we entered the very large room (in the seventies they made them much bigger than today) we had a king sized bed brand new carpet TV etc. In fact the whole room had been completely renovated it was for our needs just perfect. But when we opened the blinds the next morning we realized that it has a great view out of the back window of the swimming pool and behind that the river bank to be enjoyed by someone with more time than we had as we left early to complete our journey. Well done to the owners, you see never judge a book by its cover~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423426076~“Delightful hotel”~Establishment Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel with elegant and very modern rooms, and a very intimate and relaxing atmosphere. The connecting restaurants and bars are all of great quality such as Mr Wong's, the Establishment Bar, and Palmer & Co. The beds were very comfortable, and the blackout curtains kept the lights from the surrounding offices out. Some noise heard from the hall/other rooms but was not much of a disturbance. Power outlets by the bed would be appreciated. The one bad experience took place at the bar Hemmesphere - lacking service and when it was provided was extremely disorganized and bordering on rude. Would recommend Establishment greatly, just skip the rooftop bar.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_421368268~“Fantastic quirky hotel”~We loved the hotel near Circular Quay in Sydney. From the moment we dipped off our luggage on a very wet day, to the moment we left, the staff were brilliant, helpful and friendly. Our room - number 46, was amazing. It was huge with an equally huge bathroom, with a very comfortable bed, and great facilities. There are a selection of bars and restaurants in the building, and they all seemed to be popular with locals as well as tourists. I have already recommended this hotel to family and friends, and if we visit Sydney again we will definitely stay there.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_416297369~“Private luxurious and personal.”~When staying away from home I always adore staying in smaller boutique hotels that are individualised. As a result I am always surprised. I stayed here for 3 nights. This hotel was no exception and a truly Delightful surprise. Located down a small lane way tucked away in inner Sydney.  A large heavy wooden door with a brass handle leads into a magnificent private warm welcoming small foyer of the small private boutique hotel. Smells of lovely burning incense drifted through out my stay Rooms spacious, bed soft and comfortable, pillows also soft,bathrooms large with delightful toiletries in them. Decorated with style simple yet had taste. The rooms were spotless. Coffee was a bonus. The staff where professional friendly and delightful. The staff also assisted me and went out of their way to direct me through to the next level where the lovely Japanese restaurant was located. I noted some complained on trip advisor of the noise level. I was concerned yet heard none. I will be back and thank the staff again for making my stay so enjoyable. My only complaint was on the 3rd day a family moved in next door who where very noisy.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_411413884~“Boutique hotel with extremely spacious room”~Stayed three nights on vacation visiting family in Sydney. When we arrived, the taxi took us to a tiny "alley way" and the only thing that indicated that it was a hotel was a large door with brass sign indicating the hotel name. Behind the door was a cosy small lounge and greeting us were 2 very friendly and welcoming reception staff.Check in was quick and efficient and we were shown to our room on the 2nd floor. (room 26). Location was good, within walking distance to Circular Quay, the Rocks and also to the main shopping mall. It is in an old building but obviosuly renovated internally to a very modern style property with our room being extremely spacious and well appointed. The bedroom, bathroom and toilet were spacious with a fantastic "rain" shower with great water pressure. Only problem was that the glass partition was not long enough to prevent the occaisional 'flooding". The other problem we had was that the toilet needed unblocking and also fixing daily (no water to flush). This however was managed very promptly each time. The amenities were great and it had iPad controls which included NetFlix movies. Turn down service included biscuits and new bags of tea to help with our slumber. Our first 2 nights were great and we slept soundly but Saturday night was another story, it was way too noisy. It was as if we were staying above a nightclub. Even the ear plugs and special slumber tea bags provided that evening did not do much!! Our daily breakfast included a hot meal but unfortunately we were not told that the breakfast plan did not include the other pastries, bread, fruits and cereal on the central serving table and hence were billed for the "additional" costs. We obviously complained about this as we had breakfast on 3 separate mornings and each time we were not told that there was an additional cost and so they waivered the costs. A big thumbs up to the management. For that alone I am happy to recommend this hotel but ask them for a quiet room on a higher floor!!~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_410704123~“Lovely and Relaxing (for the most part!)”~Cannot rave about the staff enough--particularly Dayo, who went out of his way to help us in every possible way. Rooms were spacious and lovely--we were on the fifth floor. Comfortable bed, and wonderful rainfall shower (although we did have a problem with it flooding the bathroom floor until we realized we were just turning on the water too forcefully). Love the little chocolates and/or cookies left at turn-down service. Location is fantastic, however I suggest having your cab drop you off/pick you up on one of the bigger streets, particularly if you are in a hurry to get somewhere. The hotel entrance is in an alley which can get quite congested at times. (Our cab to the airport was "trapped" by delivery vehicles for several minutes). As mentioned in many reviews below, the noise can be a bit of a problem. Seems there's a dance club at an adjacent building's roof--on the third floor. We found we only needed earplugs on Friday and Saturday (we stayed for five nights total), and didn't think it was terribly bad anyway--but then, we were expecting it, thanks to reading reviews ahead of time. Only other tiny thing was that they appear to burn sandalwood incense in the lobby constantly. I mention this only because it is a very strong odor that some people in my party found overbearing (I did not).~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_410427233~“Back again”~Had two separate stays to Establishment Hotel in July and August 2016. My preferred place to stay in Sydney for the following reasons: - free and easy connection to wifi made it easy to work from room; - reception staff (Adriane and co) make everything easy with this hotel;  - location in CBD and top restaurants within the complex; and - hotel breakfast is fresh and exciting - not the run of mill expensive buffet in most 5 star chains. Yes, it can be noisy but there are ear plugs are in the room. Or join everybody else enjoying the entertainment close by.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_408511642~“Unique an delightful boutique hotel in a wonderfully restored old building”~Staff were professional, courteous and very helpful throughout stay. While we had already had lunch and dinner engagements, staff were very helpful with recommendations. On arrival found that had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise ... The hotel itself is unique, with a lovely ambience. It also smells wonderful! The room was large, plenty of muted natural light and delightful with a raised platform for the bed, a little area with a sofa and chair for relaxing, and a wonderful bathroom with full deep bath. Just wish had had the opportunity for a longer stay - would be perfect for a romantic getaway, and will certainly be back for a more leisurely stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_401105246~“Zen out at this bucolic boutique hotel”~The polished stone facade of the hotel's central pivot front door gives some indication of what to expect from this boutique establishment tucked away in one of Sydney's CBD lanes; trendy minimalist decor with a calming Asian vibe; subdued lighting highlighting the massive wooden beams and brickwork reminders of the buildings' former warehouse life; the soft waft of burning incense and an unobtrusive and welcoming front desk; and that's just in the foyer!  The rooms have been pared back to feature Japanese black lacquer wooden floors and exposed beams in the ceilings, offset by a muted white and grey pallet in the soft furnishings and stone tiles in the ensuite floors and vanity. Lack of space is not an issue. There's a guest lounge area, another chair for use at a copious desk, a massive bathing tub in the middle of the bathroom and loads of bench space to house guest toiletries. Hanging space in the inbuilt wardrobe will comfortably house business suits and evening wear. Guest robes are included, as well as a guest umbrella for private use. The room ammenities are controlled by an iPad. Everything from dimming the lights to watching Netflix or even checking out the room service menu, can be accessed via the in room computer. Guest coffee pod machine, T2 brands of tea and quality shampoo and soap are all part of the guest experience. The service from the well briefed staff is slick, efficient and unobtrusive and carried out in a convivial and friendly manner. The hotel menu is on point with fresh and seasonal dishes and a meal in the Garden Restaurant, or a drink in the adjoining bar is a welcome and calming respite from the bustle of Sydney's streets. Some of the best restaurants in the city can be found just a short walk away. For guests wanting a calm bolt hole, with all the modern luxuries, to revive after a hectic day of meetings and shopping then this personable accommodation venue ticks the boxes.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_390241909~“Nice but not amazing”~The hotel is quite nice, service is very good. Room was large but for its target market probably could be a bit nicer but that is fussy. Mini bar range is excellent. The real issue is it seriously lacks sound proofing. Given how low down it is to street level, it is very noisy. The bed was average.

Amazing room, incredibly well decorated, furnished and comfortable. The staff were fabulous, I just wish I'd stayed longer!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386338857~“Glamorous accommodation”~I was absolutely blown away by the rooms at the Establishment Hotel, they are spacious, romantic and just perfect. We were happy to get straight into Mr Wongs for lunch thanks to the hotel staff and didn't have to wait at all. Only negative was some noise in the room from the nightclub down stairs at about 1.30 am, didn't bother me but stopped me giving 5 out of 5! I would definitely stay again and would recommend to any couples looking for a hotel and restaurant combination!!  Also, valet parking is available at Four Seasons for $65 per night, it's not too far to walk at all!~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_385976764~“Spacious boutique hotel with class”~The hotel is a lovely, modern, luxury boutique hotel. Rooms are massive with loads of space, but good technology to keep you company. The beds are amazing and you just sink into the marvellous pillows. The bathrooms are exceptionally clean. The staff are wonderfully friendly and helped me with every query, even getting a last minute booking at the famous Mr Wong restaurant next door. The pub and Thai place that link with the hotel is perfect for business drinks and dinner. I will be returning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_378232369~“Regular guest - always excellent”~I stay at the Establishment most weeks for work. My stays are either one or tow nights. This hotel is consistently excellent. the rooms are well set out and extremely comfortable. Some of the rooms have huge showers and others have lovely big baths. The beds are all beautifully comfortable and the linen is crisp and white. The room service is great and they have a specialty Thai menu from Mon - Thurs which is delicious. The staff at the front desk are very friendly and always willing to lend a hand. The hotel can sometimes be a little noisy given its location but this is a minor inconvenience at most. I have many options to stay in the city and I would always choose this hotel.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_377966439~“Perfect Stay!”~Our stay at the Establishment Hotel was nothing but perfect. The staff is exceptionally friendly, the location is great, and the rooms are spacious, modern and very comfortable. The hotel is in a bulding with architectural value which also houses Mr. Wong (an outstanding Chinese restaurant) and a couple of bars which were very popular Friday and Saturday nights. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in a chic location, right in the city right near Circular Quay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_375246953~“Great boutique hotel in chic area”~We did a lot of research to find a boutique hotel with lots in the hotel surrounding it. This hotel did not disappoint. The room was large and very modern and comfortable. Not one issue here, others complained about a place for side table, just need to flip down the side of the bed backboard and you have tables and plugs. The front desk was very helpful in reservations and recommendations. They also gave us directions around town. We did try breakfast in the room and it was fast and very good.  This hotel has lots of options for dining,bars and shops around it. It also has two or three bars that are very active.  The main bar is very hip and active, nice bonus. We would like to again call out the front desk for being so attentive to us and whenever we walked by asking how things are going for our stay. That is just a very nice personal touch.  Great property and we'll be back.  We had room 48 and they even sent up Champagne for our anniversary.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374983271~“Super smart”~The Establishment is a place that very much sets out to be smart, and it succeeds, but sometimes at the expense of comfort and charm. The rooms are as you would expect, on the stark side but a good size and comfortable enough for all that. The bathroom was great with the deepest basins I have ever seen.  It's one of those places you can end up never quite leaving....the complex includes Mr Wong's restaurant next door, the Hemmesphere Bar upstairs. We only had time for a quick drink in the downstairs speakeasy type bar and eatery but the food looked good and it didn't suffer from all the showing off going down upstairs. Breakfast is in a roofed-in atrium affair, light and airy but seemed a little understaffed when we were there. The breakfast salad I had the first morning was truly excellent but utterly indifferent the next, small and a bit flabby. The $20 breakfast buffet was excellent value though. Still it is a perfect location, you can walk to it from the airport train stop at Wynyard, and though on the expensive side I would go back.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
