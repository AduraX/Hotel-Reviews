review_463319967~“Unique stay”~On busy street but room was quiet and very roomy; bathroom lovely - comfy bed. A lovely long verandah area also outside the room. This was all we needed for an overnight stay there. Yes as others have said an 'oldish' hotel (need of some maintenance) but the atmosphere; antiques and big lounge/library area were very homely and interesting to see all the photos of famous guests who have stayed there. Breakfast was in a lovely area (glassed in so quite hot) but a nice area with ample continental breakfast. Again lots of room. Yes away from anything but a couple of blocks walk to cafes and restaurants. We are seniors so walked while still light. Also seniors be aware of number of stairs (no lifts) but staff were very willing to carry out bags upstairs Staff were friendly and welcoming. We loved it there, would stay again.~4~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459791275~“Ermmm!!”~Well on the Internet it looked and sounded great. But, in real life it was very tired & neglected. Our bathroom was not very nice room was dirty. Continental breakfast was terrible. And it was miles from anywhere! The area was a bit scary & depressing. Would not recommend!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458095001~“Quirky”~We selected this hotel as it was close to our daughter's place in Surry hills and reasonably priced. We interrupted our booking with 2 away trips and the Hotel was very accommodating holding onto our cases whilst we were away. Our room for our first 2 blocks was on the small side - no space to do our morning stretches! We got an upgrade for our final block but in fact found the room upstairs not as good - it was overcluttered with furniture so we gained no extra space. Breakfast was pretty basic. The best part of both rooms was the air conditioning which was quiet and set at the right temperature. There is a communal lounge where you could read the paper and help yourself to beverages. Wi fi was OK but no good for streaming. What made the stay enjoyable was the staff and service. The cleaners, person on duty for breakfast, receptionists were all lovely and friendly. I particularly enjoyed the piano playing of the sister of one of the receptionists on the grand piano in the breakfast room!~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_457023225~“So charming!”~Located on a busy street, but this charming hotel was nice and quiet. Very charming place, love the antiques, stained glass, and the celebrity food. Great food around and is about a 10 min walk to the train station. Would def stay here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452063654~“A nice place to stay”~We found this hotel to be quiet even though it is in a busy street. Our room was towards the front of the street which had us a little concerned about the traffic noise. It is a beautiful old hotel . The bed was comfortable and the shower was a little mouldy but it didn't bother us as the overall feel of the place was very pleasant.The lounge area was an added bonus where we could watch TV and relax. Continental breakfast was included and was very basic. We would definitely stay here again for the location and the person checking us in was very friendly and efficient. We were also able to park our car inside.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_450222807~“Quiet spot but a little bit dirty”~Charming old fashioned building that would need some sort of refurbishment anyway. I stayed at a room at the back which was very quiet ( very good sleep ), but rather dirty unfortunately : a little bit of dust everywhere. Very comfortable bed and decent bathroom. Very friendly staff particularly helpful with my luggage, the taxi reservation and by providing info about the area. Reception closes at a certain time in the evening but with your room key you can open both gate and door of the Manor House. There is a common lounge room for guests. Continental breakfast was poor and quite disappointing.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_435935794~“Step back in time - in a good way”~Character-filled building near Oxford Street, just 20 minutes walk to the CBD. Lovely wooden furniture in the rooms, great water pressure in the shower, free continental breakfast varied and generous in quantity. Guest sitting room a nice touch from the past, for when you stay as a group or just want to chat with other guests. Polite friendly staff, well maintained.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434121789~“Old charm.... loved it!!!!”~My husband and I stayed for 1 night.The staff were friendly and the establishment was neat and clean. The breakfast was yummy and the memorabilia was a nice touch,which gave us a big surprise.Overall we loved it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434004594~“Pleasant hotel with character but a bit tired”~On the plus side, the hotel was reasonably well located, only a few minutes' walk from Oxford Street & about 10-15 minutes from Hyde Park. The staff were very helpful & friendly & we were able to leave bags there on our check out day until we left for the airport late afternoon. However, whilst the hotel clearly had character, it was all a bit tired. The room wasn't the biggest & large, heavy, dark wood furniture made it much smaller. The bathroom was OK but the lighting wasn't great as there was no light above the mirror, neither was there any alternative mirror in the bedroom. Although housekeeping made up the room each day, the complementary mini toiletries weren't replaced, despite having used them. Whilst dirty coffee cups were replaced, complementary biscuits were not & dirty wine glasses were left where they were.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_420232047~“Doesn't live up to reviews!”~The front desk was very knowledgable about the area and had great directions. The rooms itself was not what I consider clean. The dust on the clock radio had been there for awhile. Also the bathroom shower had A LOT of mildew and the fan a ton of dust. It could stand a good bleaching! The continental breakfast was one of the poorest we have seen. It had canned fruits and sliced wrapped cheese. We went out to breakfast! The location is great! It is just in some cleaning and TLC~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410397298~“Quirky heritage warren”~A more interesting heritage option than the standard nondescript business hotel. Perfectly located for St Vincents & Oxford St. Helpful service from the reception staff, who know the local area well. Clean rooms - check ahead though, as mine was very small and both of its windows opened into public hallways, not outside - weird! Generous continental breakfasts included - served in an odd atrium out the back with detritus from former roles (a plastic wedding cake? half a kids' playground?).~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan

review_367649620~“Place needs a lot of work.”~My wife and I stayed here for six days to celebrate her birthday. We selected this hotel because of the photos and information we viewed while searching the Web. Their price and location were  the deciding factors. After a long trip arriving there from our home in Hawaii, our first impression of the hotel was a five.  Settling in our room it soon turned to a one. Our sinuses soon started affecting both of us. We discovered the wall plaster lifting from under the window curtains due to mold. We also found traces of mold along the edge of a bathroom window in the shower. The carpet in the room had a weird slick feeling to our feet with faint traces of past stains. The entire room just needed a really thorough cleaning including the bathroom. We felt we couldn't complain because we made our reservations through a booking website and not directly with the hotel. The good - the hotel and room fixtures were impressive, the front desk personnel were very helpful and there is a bus stop right next door for easy commuting.  Unfortunately I do not recommend this hotel and we plan to stay elsewhere on our next visit. For more details and photos, view my wife's review on Bookings.com.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365539445~“Friendly and Funky”~Gorgeous Victorian deco with extra interesting style in the breakfast room.. would love to hear that grand piano in action sometime! Very friendly and helpful, quiet room, comfy bed, hottest shower I've had in ages and off-street parking.  Couldn't get a better location for the Oxford st vibe and spoilt for choice for cafes. So much more charm than the sterile high rises.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_360970108~“Short stay ”~Central to all my needs, rooms spacious with nice bed and bathroom. Balcony didn't look to safe and old cup stains on bedside table. Breakfast was adequate. Overall nice stopover and would recommend to all..Get Foxtel in the rooms please~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356155406~“Nice quiet room”~Arrived 9am and dropped bag off, so when I returned it was nice to see that my bag had been taken to my room. Don't see that in many hotels. This is a boutique hotel which features old style furniture and decor. No stainless steel or chrome in sight. My room was a "King Room" with a small entry foyer, balcony, large bedroom and bathroom. I gather there is a range of rooms from small to large so be specific on your needs when booking. Bed was very comfortable. Staff were all very pleasant. There is continental breakfast available and a lounge with comfy leather lounges. Close to CBD  Will definitely stay here again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355900334~“This old lady has charm!”~It would be true to say this charming old hotel has seen better days, but this does not distract from the wonderful welcome we received from the staff. Eddie was helpful from minute one, providing us with a description of the local area, maps, places to eat, bus service information and more. Our bag was carried to the room, which itself was full of Victorian charm. It was a hot hot afternoon, but the air con and fan coped without fault. The bed was a super king, and comfortable. The bathroom provided a huge shower, and the brass fittings and tiles matched the Victorian style perfectly. We could hardly hear the traffic on busy Flinders St, and the walls were solid, with neighbours peaceful. Breakfast was continental but offered a good variation. If I had to be negative about anything it would be that the bathroom tiles in places could be bleached a bit better, and maybe a couple of wine glasses would have helped us sip our bubbly, but the normal glasses sufficed well enough. The carpets and paint work in places are a bit tired, but in some ways that added to the charm. We loved our stay. The location to Allianz stadium and Oxford Street was perfect for us. We also strolled to the CBD, shopping and Darling Harbour in 25 minutes. For buses back we used the Sydney Opal card, and the bus stop is right outside the hotel. Perfect for tired feet! Love Sydney, love Manor House! x~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~5~nan
review_353745219~“Just Like Coming Home”~Another great stay at The Manor House in Sydney thanks to Eddie and the team. The Manor House has everything, warm friendly team that cannot do more to help you, great property steeped in history, superb location with the CBD in walking distance and on the main routes to access all the key spots in and around Sydney.Always ask for Eddie for the best tips on everything from dining, to touring, to the best ways to get around Sydney, his local knowledge is superlative.  I stay here for both business and pleasure and it ticks both boxes perfectly. My home from home in Sydney. Thank-you Eddie and the team, i'll be back!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_351694463~“Not bad.”~Stayed here for two nights. Not our usual location but the rates suited us as everywhere else was hiked up due to Mardi Gras Festival. We were also going to the Football stadium one night and we were able to walk which was great. It was our anniversary and we received in our room a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates, which was a lovely gesture. We had the front room and the noise from busy Flinders Street was not a problem. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The room however, is very dated. The carpets and furnishings need up dating and the bath towels are a little worn - one of ours had a hole in it! My husband used the iron board in our room and ended up with black streaks all over his white shirt! The hotel laundered it for us and swapped the iron and board, but when we got the shirt back the next day it was damp, and there were still traces of the black streaks on his collar. Luckily it was a warm afternoon/evening and it dried on his body as we walked! The hairdryer in the en suite was a bit scary to use - it had a high pitch rattling noise when turned on, and I was worried it might blow up in my hand! We didn't spend much time in the room, so the dated environment was ok. We took advantage of our location and frequented the many restaurants and cafes around Surry Hills. Public transport is easy and accessible from this hotel and the city is close as well. We also didn't utilize the complimentary breakfast as we were having long lunches and dinners, so cannot comment on that. The Hotel has a charm and quirkiness about it that makes me stop short of saying we would never stay here again, but it would not be our first choice.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_351249525~“Loved it”~We stayed here for one night with our 10 month old. We got the king room and it was so lovely! But the outstanding part was the customer service.

review_339098302~“Very special”~Decided on this establishment in looking for lodgings close to the SCG. Checking in was easy and quick, and plenty of advice on restaurants etc. on offer. We had a beautiful room with all the appointments. TV reception was a little hit-and-miss and Foxtel would have been a bonus but given the location to Darlinghurst bars and restaurants why stay inside? Bed and bath were large and comfortable, and the room very large in size. Breakfast was simple but adequate. Really nice hotel with plenty of charm and character!~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_318159529~“Disappointing stay”~I read all of the reviews of this property so had high hopes of something different from the run of the mill. The house itself is lovely but on a very busy street. We were a few rooms back so traffic noise was not a problem. The room itself however was very small and we had nowhere to put our suitcases (we were on a 2 week holiday so had large cases). The bathroom was under the stairwell so we also had to contend with the sound of people going up and down the stairs. Being an old house the noise is quite loud. The bathroom itself was very grimy and I notice on a previous review of this review a comment was made about the fan being dirty. Clearly the hotel doesnt read the reviews because the fan was literally covered in black dust. The grouting between the tiles had orange and black mould and needed a good clean. I can live with basic conditions but a dirty shower is unacceptable especially given the price. The continental breakfast is very basic. A couple of cereal choices and toast. There is also tinned fruit. Parking is down the side of the house for $25 and is very limited. If you want your car you have to arrange for it to be at the front of the driveway so plan ahead. We won't be coming back but given all of the good reviews I can only think that the position of your room is the most important factor in your booking.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan

review_292505059~“Grand Old Manor House”~Beautiful big room with lovely high ceilings. I had Rm 14 upstairs and towards the back of the hotel which was lovely and quiet. Friendly & accommodating staff. Great common areas like the Breakfast Atrium area and the lounge room. I enjoyed my stay that next time (and there will be a next time) I'm going "the whole hog" and going from the King Manor Room to the King Manor 1 Bedroom Suite.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_279824402~“The Harry Potter Room - Life Under the Stairwell!”~This easy to find hotel has many pluses - the on-site parking would be a boon for regional visitors especially those who need to frequent the major hospitals nearby and who can arrange long stays at the hotel. The vases of white fragrant fresh flowers in the entry added to the charm, and are in keeping with the historic tone of the front part of the hotel. Room 5 is on the ground floor in the original part of the historic house in what might once have been a rear parlour. It has lovely plaster decorations on the ceiling. As a lady travelling alone I was happy not to have to heft my suitcases up the stairs. Room 5 is located just opposite the Guest Lounge - an under -utilised and spacious area where there are tea/coffee/biscuits, TV and reading areas - something many lovely boutique hotels seem to offer and which sets them apart. And, given the quality of lighting in my room where reading in bed was impossible, this Guest Lounge was invaluable. My bed, a bit skewed on its base, was comfortable.The pillows were fine. But the room seems to last have been redecorated far too long ago for the price charged. I was the sole occupant of my room, so the fact that it was tight didn't particularly concern me, though I wouldn't have liked to share even with my husband. The ancient A.C. worked, and as the Hotel was not fully booked (there seemed to be only 3 tables used at breakfast) the fact that the driveway was right outside my permanently-shut window wasn't an issue because I didn't hear any cars. I was pleased that there weren't too many folk staying there as room security seems quite lax. I had to ask for someone to fit the interior chain-latch to my door - despite several screw holes, it came away in my hand because they'd used incorrectly sized screws. To their credit, I only had to report this once and showed the young manager on duty and it was fixed while I was out. The breakfasts were on par with many continental offerings around the globe and were fine. Decor - well again, this is a matter of taste; myriad potted plastic blooms, fake grass & grape vines may appeal to some; they certainly are colourful! So those were the good things. But yes, I did feel I had scored the Harry Potter Room, despite booking more than 2 months in advance. In someone's great wisdom/ingenuity back in the 1970/80s, it seemed the way to add an ensuite was to build in under the original stairwell. And it seemed "Uncle Bob" decided to do it himself - it is very much a handyman's effort, tiling slapped onto every surface, and probably wouldn't be approved these days. That said, it works - in a very tight configuration, less than a metre wide, with the WC fitted in the short end of the understairs, (I'm only 165 tall, so watch your head if you are tall!) a very small vanity, and shower you need to be lean to fit into - no good for pregnant ladies or the portly of figure - and an extractor-fan that is held together by cobwebs and dusty film! Has no-one ever told them they can take off the covers and clean these things? I don't think it's been touched for 20+ years. Grimey in the extreme (as were all light fittings, and ditto for cleaning the AC - I hate to think of what I was breathing in!). The WiFi was inconsistent. More reliable to use the local restaurants than to try to get it in my room. It's a shame owner/managers don't seem to "get" Facilities Management and realise that some things have well and truly outlived their fully tax-depreciated lives! This is such a terrific location and it could be SO much better, without needing to put prices up to compensate for much needed overdue expenditure.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_279143249~“We'll be back”~We go into the city once a year for Vivid. We need somewhere you can walk to the Quay from. The last two years we stayed at a big chain hotel a couple of blocks away but it was full this year so looked elsewhere and found this place. We had the Stable Room, Room 19, off the verandah, and it was wonderful. Really quiet, spacious, well appointed, lovely bathroom, friendly staff, for $230. Lovely continental breakfast. Very happy, and we'll be back next year.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

We were allowed to check in a few hours early, they were courteous and pleasant whenever we dealt with them. The room was nice, quite old fashioned but cosy. A couple of pieces of furniture were quite dusty but overall it was relatively clean. The breakfast and common areas were very clean and the selection laid on for the continental breakfast was pretty decent. All in all a very nice stay and I would easily stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
