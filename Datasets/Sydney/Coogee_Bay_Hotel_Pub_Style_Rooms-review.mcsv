review_476261706~“Close to the beach but noisy”~We have been staying at the Coogee Bay Hotel for many years, often in the heritage part of the hotel which is now referred to as 'pub-style accommodation'. The rooms themselves are fine, definitely no luxuries here. In our most recent stay we found that the remote control for the TV did not work and neither did 2 of the 3 lamps in the room. It looks like no-one checks these things however they were promptly fixed once we made a complaint. The location of the hotel is fantastic as it is literally a stones throw from the beach, close to public transport, shops and restaurants. On booking the 'pub-style accommodation' you are made aware of the fact that there will be loud music because the rooms are above the nightclub and open-air bar/eating area however we found this time the music was much louder than previously. Because of this we have decided not to book in again. The staff are all very friendly and most helpful so we had no problems with the staff. The room tarriff includes a light breakfast and this has also changed. Previously you could choose from various cereals etc but now it is a set menu - take it or leave it. If you decide to choose something outside the house breakfast then it is pretty expensive. This hotel may be fine for some people but no longer meets our needs which is a real pity considering its location.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473973331~“Great location - clean room but disgusting carpets.”~We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a sea view room which offered lovely views of the ocean and waves. The room had been well cleaned and the linen was spotless. Sadly, the carpets smelled putrid and like those of a subway stairwell. Heading up to the room, carpets were smelly, threadbare and housing fluff and dirt (possibly due to age, lack of cleaning and lack of ventilation). Luckily opening windows allowed the sea breeze to help to clarify the aromas. Breakfast inclusion was great (layered berries, muesli and granola, coffee and sourdough toast). We ordered and paid for extra coffees which after waiting 20mins on a quiet morning we had to cancel. Overall this was reasonable value for the price though shame parking was extra.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_473471853~“Short conference stay - April 2017”~Good experience had - nice property, gorgeous beachside location, good amenities, clean shower, comfy room, good WiFi, extremely convenient to beachside cafes and walks, friendly staff. Can recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_468744465~“Charming”~We booked a pub style room due to budget however it surpassed our expectations.  The room is old, but it's clean and with updated bathroom facilities. The bed was amazingly comfortable!!  We were warned at time of booking to expect noise, however none of the pub noise filtered into our room. There was only some minor street noise. Breakfast was also included which consisted of toast, yoghurt and muesli.  All in all very good value for money for a one night stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451492346~“Convenient”~We stayed at the Hotel for 8 nights Nice breakfast. Very easy access to the beach Close to the bus stop. We really enjoyed ourselves. No gym or pool but the beautiful Coogie beach is at your doorstep  We stayed in back of the main hotel. No view of the beach but much quieter~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451328377~“Great Location”~The CBH is located directly across the road from the famous Coogee Beach. We stayed three nights in the Boutique Hotel which is behind the main hotel which I would recommend rather than staying in the front section which is noisy. Upon arrival the staff member offered us an upgrade to an ocean view room which was great. The room was spacious with a spa in the bathroom. The staff were friendly as we arrived and departed each day. I've stayed here many times over the years and it's always been great. You need to remember this is not a five start hotel, however the location is certainly five star.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_443235890~“Overnight urgent stay”~Absolutely awesome staff member served us on arrival late at night. Received an upgrade due to injury and staff kindness and professionalism and room was sensational. I highly recommend staying here to anyone visiting Sydney as the rooms in the heritage section are beautiful, the staff are second to none as far as service go and the parking is great (well, for all you who can park, thank god for my partner hehe). Awesome place to stay. Awesomely brilliant professional staff to deal with (a huge thank you to them all, especially the gentleman on checkin, he made our stay welcoming and brilliant). I've added three pictures of the room we stayed in, stunning indeed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440235711~“Noisy!!”~We arrived at the hotel to be checked in then faced a hike with all our luggage down a ramp through a beer garden, rammed with customers to a less than well signed entrance. Initially heading into one door where we were just told no not in here whilst the girls just stood looking at each other unable to direct us. Being tired and hot and the lack of assistance did not bode well. We eventually got to our room. Well we may as well set up camp in the beer garden. The review said some background noise, that was the biggest understatement I've ever heard!! The room was tiny and felt grubby. I was most disappointed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432787451~“NO”~I find that when I stay at hotels, it's the small things that make the stay exceptional in this case it was the big things that made it terrible. The woman on the front desk was rude, the room was dirty, the bed aaa uncomfortable. It's comparable to some backpackers I have stayed in. At the price of $155 for the cheapest room this place is a rip off.  One star for a great location One because we had a roof over our head. Would not stay here again!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429494273~“Sand and Great Food”~This Hotel is great value compared to others with a similar beach front location, we had a spa room that overlooked the beach and with the Coogee Bay Hotel just a few meters away makes this accommodation very appealing for couples or business. The amount of restaurants that cater food from around the world is amazing just within a 5 minute walk from your hotel, South American, Thai, Mexican, Chinese, modern Australian with all the usual fast food outlets thrown in also the Hotel has the best beer garden that`s packed from 1pm to early am. The beach is great with walking tracks that can be as long or short as you like going from beach to beach North or South a good way to walk off the calories from lunch or dinner. I have one warning if you plan to stay on a Friday or Saturday nights it can get noisy with party goers coming back to their rooms at 3-4 am, but that aside we had a great stay from Friday to Monday and even the hotel food was good.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_426032150~“Fabulous location and value”~Stayed in the Heritage wing. These rooms are better than some other so-called four star joints I've stayed in. You can't get any closer to Coogee Beach, there are stacks of food options and you have a pub downstairs. The beer garden used to be a bit wild years ago but now alot of families migrate there after the beach for dinner. Nice simple breaky included too. There was some noise from the street with the windows open but it was fine with them closed.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_416462009~“Coogee bay boutique hotel rooms ”~The Coogee bay boutique rooms are really good, very modern and clean rooms. Lots of room and the staff are very welcoming. The breakfast is included which is great as well. The accommodation is close to all shops and a minute walk to the beach.  Really recommend staying here, very affordable and an ideal location  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336087552~“I keep going back to Coogee Bay.”~Now called the Coogee Bay Boutique Hotel I always stay here when in Sydney. About 10 minutes from the airport and has all the facilities you could want on your doorstep. The Hotel is on the quiet side of the Coogee Bay Hotel so Friday night revelries won't intrude. No kitchen or laundry facilities are included but a laundrette is around the corner and the dining options on Googee Bay Road mean you wouldn't want to stay in anyway. Part of a larger complex which does include a beachfront bar there is also pub accommodation. All sorts of dining options are within a 5 Minute walk, options include Thai, pub grub, Fish and Chips, Italian, etc. Maloneys Grocers are over the road for all kinds of different foods, and the beach is a 2 minute walk away. Head north at the beach and Bondi is a brisk 1 hour walk away along a purpose built path with sensational views out over the Tasman.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_283101144~“Look elsewhere”~Stayed at the Coogee Bay for a week. Great location, but that's about where the positives stop.  Rooms in the pub wing are tired. Bathroom water temperature varied when in the shower, changing from too hot to very cold without even touching the taps.  Have to walk through the pub to get to the rooms, and then climb the stairs.  Will stay elsewhere next time I head to sydney for work.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_258317063~“budget accommodation in great location”~Conscierge at front desk appeared to have little knowledge of rooms.we had booked with friends who had 4 family members in their party. We were given their room despite us querying configurations upon our arrival.  Upon representing at the front desk after unpacking our case and having a drink on the balcony, finally they ascertained that yes, we werehg in the wrong room.so we packed up and moved, to a small smelly room over the pub, no view, no balcony, no safe, no mini bar (which the Conscierge had swiped our credit card to the value of $100 in case we used it). So, 3rd trip back to front desk which is located in a separate building.to advise them of the sickening odour and also have our room rate changed.as we had been charged for the larger room, with a view, balcony, safe, you get the picture. The smell was so bad we felt ill. We were told that unfortunately all other rooms were fully booked. On the plus side, bed was comfortable and the room was quiet.if the odour can be rectified then it would be reasonable value for money. The room mixup causing several visits back to the front desk and relocating to a room some distance away (with luggage)could also of been avoided had the conscierge of listened to us upon our initial presentation to desk)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_241057325~“Perfect for a fun weekend away”~We stayed in the pub style ocean view room and had a fantastic time. The room was very spacious, clean and the beds were very comfy. Our room opened up to a balcony with beautiful views of Coogee bay - we spent many an hour enjoying the view with a cold drink! The pub rooms are above the beer garden so the noise was pretty loud all night long, but that didn't bother us much - this place is best if you're in a partying mood though. If u want a quiet location, choose somewhere else! We loved it!~4~4~5~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_173487965~“Not good”~Coogee bay hotel We booked on line claiming its a 4 star hotel this it's not, they have two blocks one above a bar area the other by the main entrance. The first room we took was above the bar, the aroma of style beer and urine filled the lobby on onto the room, which was filthy. The view from the window was of a banner, you could not actually see out of the windows. Later that evening the room shook to the base of the band, overall I think a back packers type place. The second trip we paid to upgrade to the 4 star side wow the room was clean, and staff friendly Breakfast not much if your a guest you are very much second class. The staff tucked into bacon and eggs while the guest where given just DIY toast and cold coffee. My wife requested a got coffee where she was growled at by the lady serving the hot drinks to staff " hotel guests drinks are over there " As she pointed to a cold coffee jug . Later we tried to buy a beer from the bar where we had to Que. 3 deep in the night club, no guest bars, Internet in the room is Aussy 8-50 per hour wow !!! Would I stay here again a big No Would I recommend it again No Was it value for money No Three No's don't do it !~1~3~2~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_125598861~“Better than expected”~My wife and i stayed at Coogee bay hotel (pub style accommodation) having read reviews and on a previous visit to Coogee tho stayed at different hotel we already had a good idea what it would be like ie a very popular/noisy busy place. We decided to go for a 2nd floor superior room  hoping the noise from bars etc wouldn't be to loud,what a pleasant surprise, we had some noise but only like a loud murmur no problem sleeping,and the accom was good very nice, pleasant helpful staff,if we need somewhere to stay in Coogee on our next visit to Oz would definitely stay at same hotel as long as 2nd floor room available~3~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_123762047~“Fancy Pub or mediocre hotel.....? "Walk through the bottle-shop to your room, sir" says it all.”~We travelled to Coogee from interstate and booked this place online. It all felt like a legit hotel, but soon discovered that we were staying in the Pub. "Walk through the bottle-shop to your room, sir" was a bit of a surprise, but found the room was ok. The music played late and the trucks on the road started early so not the place to stay if you need a solid 8 hours, but perfect if you've got a gut full of beer and keen for an early surf.~3~4~5~nan~3~3~3~nan
