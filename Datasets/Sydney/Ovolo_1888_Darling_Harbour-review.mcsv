review_478112022~“Cool and funky”~I guess this is caring for those that seek a modern experience. It sure is funky. We liked it. We found it a little expensive but all the same, we would go back. Rooms are well appointed and the service was very good. thanks.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478099967~“Boutique hidden gem with plenty of character”~We wouldn't normally choose to stay in/beyond Darling Harbour but there wasn't a lot available in our price range on this particular weekend so we gave it a go. The hotel is a little tricky to get to from the Light Rail stop, especially with construction works on (we went through the shopping centre and then the Novotel, which it is opposite), so I would recommend a cab. The hotel is in a converted wool store and retains some of that character with exposed brickwork and the like. The rooms are smallish, but very well fitted out and full of little touches like modern artwork, boutique toiletries, free wifi (which should be standard these days), free slippers and free minibar - yes, that's right, including booze. The bed was super comfy and the room was quiet and dark. Breakfast didn't include cooked options (available at extra cost I think) but the contintental spread was excellent anyway. Location-wise, Darling Harbour isn't really my cup of tea, but it does make for a pleasant stroll, and once through there you are practically in the Rocks. I would compare the Ovolo to thew QT in terms of feel and look and it stacks up pretty well against it. Would definitely stay again. My only quibble was the quite hefty credit card surcharge, which was not brought to my attention upon paying. Also surely 99% of people pay by card these days so just include it in your room rate. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477591108~“Visual and technological delight”~My husband and I stayed at Ovolo 1888 for 3 nights to attend a conference at the ICC. Firstly, we were so impressed by the rate we received - it was around half of what a lot of the other hotels in the area charged. Breakfast was included, which meant a lovely continental breakfast laid out beautifully. You can order off the menu, but we didn't even bother looking at a menu. The breakfast was more than sufficient. The building itself is an "instagrammers delight" - so much to feast your eyes on, both with the age of the building, but also the way that it has been designed. Loved the fact that at the bottom of the glass elevators, they had miniture basketball courts set up just to give you something to look at. Every details was thought about. One day I needed to ask reception something, and found the girls behind the desk making up these beautiful Easter gifts for all the rooms - very cute little bunnies filled with goodies. While we weren't there for Easter, I secretly wanted one of them!  We loved our room. It was a "King" room, but I would still say it was compact. It was fine for the two of us though. Our friend stayed in a "Shoebox". It was a bit smaller, but fine for a single person. I wouldn't have enjoyed staying it as a couple. The room was set up for technology savvy people. They had an Apple TV, so we could simply log into our itunes account and watch the shows we would have been watching at home. Or log into your Netflex account and watch like you've not left home! The power points besides the beds had USB ports in them. Often we have to rummage around the room to find a powerpoint to charge our devices. But here they were easily accessible and with the added bonus of having a USB port. Loved it! The room layout was really funky. The toiletries (while we didn't use them) looked so good I really wanted to take them with me! Ovolo love the F word - Free!! So the minibar was free. We'd come back from conference and have a couple of glasses of wine. They also give you a little snack bag to enjoy. And if you are around during happy hour, drinks are free too! No problems with their wifi either. If you are attending the conference at ICC, the Ovolo couldn't be much closer. Just a walk across the street, through the carpark and you are at Harbourside Shopping Centre and ICC. So it was perfectly located for us! I can't rave about Ovolo enough. We will be staying here again next year for our conference!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474812977~“One of the best hotel experiences I've had”~So I have had 1 night at the Ovollo. Everything and I mean everything is exceptional. The service are bright and friendly ( not snooty and too cool ). The atmosphere although not necessarily a light place, has a soothing, casual yet totally professional feel.  The rooms are comfortable, especially the bed and pillows (a must for me). They have really good food (fresh) and great coffee (my. Wolves almond caps).  I haven't even started on all the amenities and goodies included. Im a new fan and will be staying at more of their hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474461278~“Such an amazing experience”~Just want to say a big big thankyou to everyone at this awesome little hotel! Such great staff, amazing food (try room service in the big comfy beds). We were so happy with the whole thing, I actually made an account just to leave this review! Thanks again, we will be back!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474368015~“Small and central”~Ideally situated, small and competently operated hotel in the Darling Harbour area. Free wifi available with reasonably priced breakfasts and importantly at a competitive room rate. Ideal for singles and couples who want to take advantage of what central Sydney has to offer over a 2 to 3 day period.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474364296~“great boutique hotel, very cool vibe, close to the ICC”~I booked the Ovolo for a business trip when we where exhibiting at a trade show at the new ICC. Really easy walk across to the venue from this hotel. Car Parking was also super easy - literally across the road. What I loved about the hotel - lovely staff, cool vibe, great decor, free minibar and nice complimentary breakfast in the lobby. We missed happy hour due to work. Will be back next time for a leisure stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474029038~“Air con issues”~Stayed there mid March when the weather in Sydney was really humid and hot and guess what? The air con had stopped working. We had a shoe box room and the humidity and heat was out of control in the room which meant we had to get out of it. Pretty poor when you've paid $400 for a room that you can't even enjoy. Won't be rushing back.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_473931595~“Great Hotel”~Everything they do they do well from the free well stocked minibar to the free laundry and high speed internet. I will definitely recommend this hotel to all friends and family traveling to Sydney! Five stars all the way.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473798418~“The little details make this place really cool”~Ovolo 1888 is a lovely hotel. The airy, well-designed rooms are cool, but it's the little details that really stand out - happy hour bar with free snacks; free minibar; free DIY laundry room (OK, OK I'm liking the free stuff).  Staff are friendly and the Pyrmont area is really cool to hang out in, with loads of choice for drinks and eats.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_473704515~“Simply Amazing!”~The entire experience was just simply amazing! All the staff were very friendly and hip. Shout outs to Michael and Cory at the front desk, who gave me loads of ideas on the nightlife! Another amazing thing I loved about my stay at this hotel was that the staff was very flexible. My stay included (I think all stay includes if booked directly through the hotel) breakfast but it didn't start until 7 on my last day. I had to leave at 6:45 to catch my flight, so they were kind enough to fix up a little bit of something for me even before they were supposed to put food out. I'm so grateful for that. The location of this hotel is fabulous! I ended up not taking any public transportation and walked everywhere. The only time I took a taxi was at the end of my night from Circular Quay and I was wearing 10 cm heels. A must stay when in Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473610468~“Nice stay”~Excellent stay here. Rooms were big with couch and minibar. Breakfast was good with fresh fruit and pastries. They had bowels of lollies which was kind of cool. Great location, walking distance to darling harbour~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473483231~“Pretty Much All Bad”~Rooms, even the presumably larger ones (like the "deluxe king" are small, as are the associated bathrooms. The drawers, such as they are (only 2) have some kind of "felt" lining which makes them impossible to clean--and therefore dirty. The closet(s) is nonexistent--sort of a hanging bar with no door. So the rooms are not good.  But here's the biggest problem. A reservation, made by my client, months in advance asked for two things: a room (actually a junior suite) not facing the street; and since I would have to work shortly after arriving at the hotel on an early-morning flight from the U.S., a place to change. They offered me a shower--sort of like an airline club. And as for the room, on the first floor, facing the street. So, 0 for 2 in what was requested. Find another place to stay, that actually keeps its promises.~1~nan~3~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_473446363~“Stay in Sydney for a few days”~This hotel is one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. Having been converted from a wool warehouse, boutique hotels aren't everybody's "cup of tea". But what gives this hotel an excellent rating are: the free facilities, such as an all inclusive laundry; IPAD in each room; free mini bar (Wine; beer etc); the excellent food including the free fresh coffee day or night; the sumptuous breakfasts and most importantly; the first class service by the staff. Brilliant!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473442121~“Stylish, homely and super-friendly”~Really impressed by the quality of food. Staff are exceptionally friendly and the whole atmosphere is very stylish and cosy. Well designed, well fitted-out and I loved the Loot bag, mini-bar and breakfast all included. Close to Darling Harbour, carpark straight opposite and light rail connections right there as well. Definitely recommended and will stay again. Loved it!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473422965~“Fantastic stay”~We really enjoyed our visit to Sydney and this hotel was excellent. It was a great location and the room was really well equipped. The staff couldn't have been nicer and I would definitely stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473242737~“Boutique Bliss ”~Surprising hotel - easy access and parking opposite. Great room and bathroom with the addition of free fridge items and a goodie bag of snacks, the perfect welcome. Also enjoyed their happy hour treats - free drinks if you book online at their website. Just a short walk across the car park and over the pedestrian bridge and your in the Darling Harbour shopping and restaurant precinct. Will use this hotel again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473099054~“Darling Harbour Gem”~Found this hotel on Tablet. What a great place after being disappointed with other hotels nearby. Rooms are very clean, service is friendly and efficient. Good access to Darling Harbour and Barangaroo. I've booked in again for my next trip so will make this my hotel for work trips.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472954958~“Amazing free breakfast!”~I stayed in the loft and was very impressed with this hotel. I enjoyed the modern touches throughout. The staff were all nice and helpful. The free breakfast was absolutely delicious with a wide variety to choose from. They also provide infused water and a candy jar in the afternoons. Great location. Free wifi worked well. Ended up being our favorite hotel we stayed at through our vacation to Australia and New Zealand. Would definitely stay here again.  Only minor complaint is that our room was a bit hotter than we would have liked despite turning down the A/C.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_472844882~“Unique "funky" hotel in great location”~Location We stayed here for one night at the end of a whirlwind trip to Australia for 8 nights. The hotel is perfectly located just a few minutes walk from Pyrmont Bridge which takes you across Darling Harbour. If you want to get to Circular Quay (Opera House, etc.) the public transport ferry dock is at the end of the street. The journey (about 20 mins) is well worth it to get photos of Harbour Bridge (you sail under it) and Opera House from the water.  Hotel The hotel lobby looks great with a modern feel mixed with original wooden beams and stonework. Reception staff were friendly and check in was a breeze. We booked a king room. The room was very nice. The hotel has a unique concept - if you book directly with them you get free stuff thrown in that you don't get if book through hotel websites, etc. Part of this is a free mini-bar with beer, wine, soft drinks and a snack bag with popcorn and jelly beans, etc. The king size bed wad very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed with an overhead step in shower and robe and slippers provided. Another of the free perks is free wifi, which was good in lobby and room.  Yet another free perk from booking directly is the happy hour from 5:30 - 6:30 in the evening when you can get free drinks and canopes. There's chips and dips, wraps and pizza and you can get a good selection of drinks.  The final perk is the free breakfast which consists of pastries, cold meats, breads, etc. There's a coffee machine, which didnt work for me so the staff member made me a barista cappucino (normally $3). You can also pay for a hot breakfast if you want that.  Overall, we loved the hotel and would definitely stay again when back in Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472805092~“Really slick and fun stay”~We left with a good feeling about Ovolo. Brilliant service and great location, really good breakfasts and coffee. The hotel is well designed and modern without being over the top. Our only gripe was the size of the shoebox room which was tiny but that's why it's called a shoebox! Next time a bigger room for sure.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472801502~“Wool Store Stay”~For a small hotel we were surprised at the quality of the meals. Our first night we ate in and it was a fantastic meal, do not hesitate in staying in. Our room was spotlessly clean with beautifully appointed bathrooms and lovely products. Staff are friendly and helpful. Convenient location.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_472780064~“Great spot for a visit to the new icc”~What a great find. If you have a need to be on the darling harbour side this is a must. Beautifully restored old bond store with all the modern comforts. Very boutique and a feel good atmosphere. Lovely room with wifi, free minibar and a gym nearby free of charge too. Small and cosy cafe with good service and tasty food. Had a bit of a problem locating the ironing board but after a quick visit from housekeeping all was revealed.  Well appointed room with modern touches as well as 100year old wooden beams. Really nicely done. A 5m walk to icc makes this a great stop for the darling harbour side hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471569958~“Boutique Old/New Homeliness.”~We stayed in a shoebox room to attend a concert at the nearby International Convention Centre. We were only there for a shower and to sleep for two nights. Even though the rooms are quite small, we didn't feel cramped. This hotel was made with the customer in mind. Power points next to the bed, on both sides, including USB charging points, even an ipad in the room! Unlimited, high speed internet, snacks, bar fridge contents included in the tariff. There is plenty of character about this old place, a mix of rustic and modern. and every staff member I met was happy to see customers in their hotel. The bar/restaurant downstairs is quirky, hip, cosy, and very affordable. Next time I'm in Darling Harbour, I'll stay here, without a doubt.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_471546524~“Lovely hotel”~Stayed there for 3 nights (17/18/19Mar) and found the hotel to be spotlessly clean, the staff were very helpful and to be honest neither myself or wife could fault anything other than the size of the room which was very similar to NY hotel room sizes i.e. pretty small. That said we enjoyed our stay and it was really close to Darling Harbour and all the bars and restaurants in the area. Would stay again.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471502031~“Something SO unusual”~This was my second stay at this fantastic hotel in two months. I had to go back to check it was as good as I thought! IT WAS. Great staff, suberb thought as to what a customer needs, comfort, clean and heaps of freebies! And did I mention the freebies? Cant wait to try other Ovolo hotels. Dont take my word for it please give.it a try! Footnote. Its not for those who seek a sterile 5 star standard but it is most definitely for those who want a GREAT stay in a funky modern WELCOMING hotel right next to the pulsating Darling Harbour~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470461410~“Birthday getaway”~Loved this hotel. Friendly staff. Went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. Would definitely go back. Lots of freebies....mini bar, happy hour, continental breakfast. Funky interior - WOW!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470215659~“Like staying with friends ”~We spent four nights in a Loft room and the stay was near on perfect. We booked direct which meant we got a whole heap of freebies - from breakfast, a free minibar, free washing to a fabulous free happy hour - it all lead to a great stay. The general manager runs this place with a huge amount of energy and kindness and we were impressed with how she gets to know just about everyone staying. The hotel arranged a lovely birthday surprise and they react instantly to feedback. It felt small enough to feel like we were staying with friends and were genuinely valued and felt welcome. The location is good, the light rail is just across the road and through a car park and that gets you to the airport, via Central, in under an hour. Alternatively a short walk across the bridge gets you into the CBD or there's the ferry right round to Circular Quay. This hotel is seriously impressive. They want you to stay here and they want to get to know you. It looks great too, has a modern vibe and was a whole heap of fun.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Ovolo 1888 is a hidden gem.I would not look at any other Hotel if returning to Sydney.The staff called the cab to take us to the cruise terminal the next morning .It was a great start to our fabulous getaway cruise. P.S loved the freebies especially the little Ovolo canvas rucksack.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469507367~“Fantastic week!”~We have just left after our week long stay here. Loved the hotel's funky vibe & all the freebies! The rooms are a little small but adequate, we had a king room (308). The bed was extremely comfy & black out blinds allowed for great sleep. There's not much storage so you just use the space wisely, not a big deal. We loved happy hour, quality drinks & canapés, served with a smile. Breakfast was fabulous with great coffee. Loved the free sweets also. The ability to do washing was a real bonus too as we're travelling for 3 weeks. Darling Harbour is lovely & we walked everywhere (it's a 25 min stroll to the Opera House). The best option from the airport would be a taxi (check price first with the driver), we went by train & light rail & whilst easy cost about the same as a taxi. Buy an opal card if you're travelling around Sydney (not accepted on the airport train). Loads of places to eat & loads to do, would have loved a second week there. Thanks Ovolo for a great stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469329863~“Best hotel experience I've had”~I booked the Stirred suite for my boyfriends birthday. I planned it all as a surprise for him and even got permission to invite his friends along for a pre drink before heading out. The hotel was happy to oblige this request and from the moment we turned up it was nothing but amazing service. When we were taken to our suite they had set up some cute lights for us, goodie bags,wine, balloons and a card!  The room was exquisite and the bathroom was OH MY GOD!  Hands down it was the best hotel experience and we will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

I called to organise it with less than 24hrs notice and the receptionist, Brenda, was amazing!!!! After a brief phone call and a super responsive email, she had organised everything and my sister-in-law was surprised the next day. My brother and his wife had a wonderful stay and had a great experience there too. Thank you for providing great service and many thanks to Brenda!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469033744~“Awesome hotel...highly recommended!”~My reservation was booked through work and I was a bit skeptical as I hadn't heard of this place before. But it is oh my god amazing. Such a cool spot. Easy access, parking across the road, the friendliest staff and a very funky hotel. The room I had for my first stay was tiny but all I needed for one person. Enough room for luggage and to move around. Free mini bar and a loot bag were a couple of nice surprises. On my second stay I had a larger room but it faced inwards to the lobby so was a little noisy at night. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, a must stay in Sydney!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468975618~“Still a favorite”~It is a long time since I have last stayed here. It is good to note it is still a great place to stay, in fact, the best place to stay in Darling Harbour.

review_468437457~“Very good stay!”~This is an interesting hotel in which to stay not only from the internal layout of the renovated wool store but also from the extras like the free happy hour with canapés and loot bag with snacks and guest laundry .This makes for such a refreshing change . The hotel has a very pleasant , "funky" atmosphere. The staff are extremely helpful . The hotel is very well situated close to Darling Harbour but in a quiet street . The hotel itself is very quiet at nighttime. We had a standard room on the ground floor which we liked. Although on the small side everything you needed was there although I would have liked a heated towel rail! All round a very nice experience.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468166203~“A hidden gem”~I stayed in this hotel as I was at a conference in Darling Harbour. I loved it from the time I walked in. Its very 'funky' and has a warm atmosphere. The staff are great, very welcoming. I booked a shoebox room, which was plenty big enough for one person and I think 2 could stay quite comfortably. The room is very well appointed, very modern and they have thought of everything. There is a free mini bar in the room - YES, free - and snacks. The bathroom has very nice toiletries, including toothbrushes. The bed was VERY comfortable. There is a free happy hour in the bar for guests and breakfast was included. I spoke to the manager who served us breakfast and she explained that the philosophy of the owner is 'stress free travel'. It was reasonably priced (cheaper if you book direct) and only a few minutes walk to darling harbour or the light rail. I loved this hotel and will stay again if I have the need.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467864835~“Pre cruise stay”~Stayed for two nights before cruise . The location is perfect for Darling Harbour and ferry service to Opera House etc .When you leave hotel cross road and walk inside the car park turn left and walk until you see a bridge which will take you to the inside shopping mall . The staff make this hotel from the top to the bottom . We stayed in room 2 on the ground floor no view from the window as at basement level . All the extras are great but only get if you book on hotel website (breakfast,happy hour ,mini bar and sweets ) The room was small but not in it that much ,no wardrobe which I did find hard as only had four hangers . Great shower and a nice big bed .~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467394909~“Refreshingly relaxed and accommodating”~From the moment I first checked out their website, through to my wife and I walking out the door at the end of our stay, everything about Ovolo 1888 was just terrific. Every staff member was pleasant, happy to say 'hi' to us and eager to assist. We arrived much earlier than expected and the room wasn't yet available, but they happily stored our bags for us and provided a map of Sydney with some further assistance. We were then out for the day and when I called to see if it would be OK for us to come in late (even though we didn't yet have the room key) they were so obliging and suggested we find somewhere nice to eat and just arrive at the hotel at our leisure - the key will be ready for us at the front desk whenever we arrived and our bags had already been moved to our room. The hotel is a considerate restoration of a woolstore with exposed beams coupled well with modern fixtures. The loft room was well set out and the 'freebies' were well appreciated as an after dinner treat. Breakfast was also really well presented and delicious. I can't recommend Ovolo 1888 highly enough. I'm back there for a few nights next week too and looking forward to it!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467151822~“Quite Nice”~This is a nice Hotel located very close to Darling Harbour. I stayed 3 nights whilst attending a Conference at the Convention Centre. It is quite nice but nothing special. Rooms are very small, clean but quiet. The staff are great and its all that others have said. But its not a Classical Five Star - just a funky modern place. I would stay again if wanting something close to the Convention Centre. Its fine.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_466804183~“Great Hotel”~Having had a gruelling and long flight the welcome we received was second to none. Our room wasn't ready when we got there (we were early) but coffee and pastries were offered while they turned it around. The room was a junior suite and it was fantastic.

The decor is fun and modern, and we loved the free mini bar and snacks, a simple touch that immediately made us feel at home in our room. I only ever leave reviews if I had a flawless or appalling experience lol, and this one was flawless! Our best stay in Sydney ever. Thanks Ovolo :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466635308~“Great cool place small but great rooms”~We stayed for three nights during our visit to Sydney. We truly enjoyed the stay, the free happy hour helped to create a good atmosphere in the late afternoon in the lounge area. Super friendly staff, great breakfast the coffee could improve but at least past the ok bar. (Even better coffee could be bought separately) We had the smallest room which was very good with a high standard but it was small but due to the nice atmosphere in the lounge/bar area it was not a problem if you wanted to hang out at the hotel. The only negative aspect was the the hotel bar was not open for an afternoon beer at 4 pm. We where new to Sydney and it is a bit of a walk to the Opera house but there are many places around Darling Harbour as well. Would definitely recommend staying here and there is a good vibe around the hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466446043~“Different in a good way”~Staying in Darling Harbour for a trade event is usually a grudge stay where the Novotel or Ibis rips you off due to proximity and gives you nothing in return. My EA found the Ovolo and we couldn't be happier - quiet room, great bed and free stuff because we booked direct. Fantastic location if you want to base yourself near Darling Harbour, welcoming staff and a fun environment make this one of the best places to stay in Sydney.

review_466404812~“Pay a little more”~There is a great atmosphere in this hotel, very welcoming and relaxed, and loads of extras included in the price (bar fridge with free drinks, a loot bag etc). We chose the wrong type of room, ours had no window overlooking any outside area, and because the weather was particularly bad while we there for 2 nights, we felt very boxed in in our show shoe box.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466217494~“Love this place”~If you get the chance book in & enjoy the beauty of this fabulous place ~ it's a real gem. Extra comfy bed, great extras included & try not to miss happy hour.  Parking across the road & its very close to everything in Darling Harbour .~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465969692~“Mardis Gras ”~This hotel is so nice and clean and friendly. Only used it to sleep but every morning and evening it's was busy with people dining so good must be good. With just a short walk over Pymont bridge you end up near everywhere in the city. So staying here again. Loved the free drink in your room and lolly bag.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465963645~“awesome hotel”~The experience was so refreshingly positive - great welcome, customer service++, nothing too much trouble, extra comfy bed, very clean, extra services (breakfast, free mini bar, snack pack, happy hour). Small room but more than adequate for short stay. 5 min walk to Darling Harbour. Highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_465740510~“+++”~We are currently staying on our first night at Ovolo, and cannot complain about anything! We arrived early, and Amanda made sure we had breakfast and coffee before our room was ready, well before official check in time. The staff here are absolutely amazing, and no request seems a problem. We especially enjoyed the free happy hour (you get this when booking directly with the hotel) and the free minibar. It has been a great start to our honeymoon!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465635803~“Loved our stay!!!”~Had an incredible stay at Ovolo on a recent romantic get away with the hubby. Cool and charming - the Devine Shaken Suite had everything we needed! Additionally there was the free mini bar, free happy hour and nice gift pack (which we took home for the kids). Staff were all friendly and helpful; and the entire place was seeped in character. Very impressed Ovolo!! I will be back!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465181134~“One of the best!”~We were so,happy with this hotel. The room is spacious comfortable and spotless and the little touches even a loot bag of sweets were very welcome! The staff mended one of our suitcases for us without charge and looked after us very well and the breakfasts were great! The position of the hotel is right in Darling harbour but in a very quiet corner. Couldn't have asked for more !~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464652619~“Well managed, fun boutique hotel”~We enjoyed our stay here. Often urban boutique hotels can often be too trendy for their own good (ie poor service, sparsely equiped etc.) but this hotel was the opposite. Friendly service and well appointed (if small) rooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464468041~“A gem in a big city”~What a find. Forget the big hotels, forget the chains. This is a MUST hotel to stay in Sydney. The location is superb. A few minutes walk to bus,ferry, shops,Darling Harbour. Reception staff very good, friendly and efficient. Little tip - book direct with the hotel it opens up a wealth of free things including free drinks during happy hour. They think of everything here ...sweeties to eat whilst you unpack, bags for clothes little ironing board. sweeties during the day. Fantastic. The breakfast is lovely and fresh. cold meats, cheeses hard boiled eggs etc. You really feel that they care for you and make you feel very special.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_464436679~“Love this hotel!!!!”~Wow what a surprise ... this hotel is perfect !! Parking across the road but next time we will catch the light rail ( 5 min walk) Right in the heart of Darling Harbour , it's a converted Wool Stool , beautiful ambiance , tasteful decor, great service, comfy beds and a free mini bar with other treats .  Greeted warmly and a lovely little bar/ cafe downstairs  This is a definite big tick~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464355544~“Great Stay, Great Location, Great Staff”~Great boutique hotel a 3 minute walk to Darling Harbor. Stayed in the "shoebox" room...and it was perfect for single traveler. Two people would be stretching it unless you really packed light. Staff was great, very helpful with directions, recommendations on what to see and where to eat.  Definitely book on their website. If you do, breakfast, happy hour, wifi, minibar, and laundry are all free. Will stay here next time for sure.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464210104~“Fantastic Stay”~Hubby and I stayed for 4 nights, 1st-5th Feb. It was fantastic! Our room was as expected, small but cosy and very clean. We had the snack bag and the free mini bar, which was re-stocked daily. We also had the complimentary breakfast and happy hour. Both were excellent. The staff at the hotel were really friendly and helpful, They organised a taxi for us on our last day to take us to the Passenger Cruise Terminal, for such a short journey the fair was very high at 37 dollars and then the taxi driver demanded a 12 dollar booking fee (the hotel did not tell us about this?). Overall loved our stay and Sydney was amazing, definitely one to return to.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464171878~“Cool, Happy, Perfect”~One of the best hotels and values ever! The rooms are comfortable and stylish. Book through the hotel website to receive a healthy, extensive breakfast buffet and a lovely happy hour. All rooms include a free mini bar with drinks and snacks. Could not think of anything that wasn't included...they seem to think of every amenity! Everyone was so happy and helpful. Barcha was a star among stars!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_463988549~“I have to return soon”~Stayed just the one night before going on a South Pacific cruise, and I hope to return to Sydney soon to enjoy a few more nights at Ovolo 1888. I loved the aesthetics of the hotel, and its blend of the funky and modern with the old and historic. Great staff, fantastic inclusions for the price, and great location close to Darling Harbour. Our room was one of the Shoebox rooms which was adjacent to the internal atrium, great for a very, very quiet nights sleep as you will not hear any outside traffic noises etc. We were on the first floor with the dining area just below. We wanted to wake early, and I presumed we would hear noise from the dining area such as plates and cutlery clinking, but I was surprised when our alarm went off, and I had not heard any such noise. I realised the windows are double glazed, so you can be sure you won't be disturbed by hotel guests if you do want to sleep in. The Shoebox room is small, but has a very comfortable bed and pillows, a desk area, room for bags, hanging space, and a mini bar, and the bathroom is actually very spacious, with great lighting and lots of bench space around the vanity. The free mini bar was very welcome, as was the loot bag, and personally, if I'm going to compare two different hotels to stay at, with the prices being similar, I would go with the one that gives me little gifts and does things a little bit differently. But the quirky and fun design was what really swayed me to choose the Ovolo, rather than any other run of the mill and boring hotel. The others all look the same. I can't wait to come here again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_463506146~“Fab hotel”~This hotel is such a great place to stay. Staff were all exceptionally helpful. Good location. Comfy bed, great breakfast and lovely lot of extras that added to the experience. Would definitely recommend~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463083249~“An experience not just a hotel”~I really loved Ovolo 1888. I travel quite a bit for work and this was a totally different type of hotel. Every detail had been considered to charging options in your room, the free mini bar and happy hour to the Apple TV. Details matter and there was nothing left out.  The breakfast was great and had a wide variety and the staff were very friendly. Super fast free Wi-Fi too.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461906340~“It's a gem in a great location ”~We had been recommended the boutique style Ovolo 1888 in Darling Harbour so booked ourselves a 3 night stay. We had a fabulous stay, booking a "shoe box" room. It was little in size but had a very clever design layout. Extremely trendy and totally comfortable. We loved the free mini bar, loot bag and wifi. Our delicious breakfasts had not been included in our value deal so we purchased from their restaurant menu. The location is excellent, being just a very short walk to the railway station, Convention Center and Darling Harbour. The employees were exceptional to deal with, congratulations to Ovolo on hiring excellent people. We will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461898339~“Fabulous. ”~I went to Sydney for a conference. Chose to stay here. It looked quirky and was close to where I needed to be. I arrived. It was everything it looked. Fun, quirky and welcoming. The room was clean and generous in its minibar, toiletries and size.  During the course of my stay, I became unwell. Needing an ambulance unwell. Yikes. The staff were supportive, concerned, attentive and present. They sat on my bed with me and waited until paramedics arrived. They shared insights to help me feel as though I wasn't exactly what I was: alone and a bit scared. All ended well with me not having to go anywhere. However, the compassion shown meant that I will go back. Thank you. This place is well worth your time and your money. I was grateful to be there. F~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461776636~“Fun Place in a Great Location”~We stayed here based on Tripadvisor reviews and were quite pleased. First, the location is great, very close to the shopping center and restaurants in Darling Harbor. The hotel itself is very fun and interesting, being a converted old woolshed warehouse. The renovation has been very nicely done and the space is very pleasant. The staff were helpful and the wifi and airconditioning worked very well. We ate both breakfast and a light supper at the hotel, as it was very convenient to do so. One suggestion: book directly with the hotel, as this gives you free breakfast and happy hour snacks, a great benefit. Our only reservation relates to the size of the rooms. We had a king room, but not a suite. As a result, the room is rather small, lacking space for a lounge chair. A great place to stay for a couple of nights, but for a longer stay, I'd prefer more space. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_461057135~“Such a treat! ”~Stayed for 2 nights as a little getaway and loved every minute. The staff were so friendly and have thought of everything! Beds super comfy & book direct for nice little freebies like a wine at Happy Hour or yummy pastries for Brekkie. Super convenient location too! Perfect for a visit to the theatre and a spot of shopping :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461022044~“Hip hotel - great location”~The Ovolo hotel at 139 Murray street (there is another Ovolo at a different location) is a fun hotel. The building is a former wool shed and the original old beams are exposed. The decor is urbane, moderne, and fun. The rooms are nicely decorated and come with a fully stocked mini bar (which is free) and restocked every day. There is a welcome snack bag upon arrival. The rooms are tiny but more than adequate since you're out touring every day. WiFi is very fast. You can opt for a continental breakfast but we decided not to and ordered a la carte which was cheaper and more than satisfying. Staff was very helpful and very responsive to questions. Great little hotel located in Darling Harbor - very convenient to shopping and many excellent restaurants!~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_460766277~“Good Business Hotel”~Ended up here due to the normal work hotel not being available. Loved it. For business I want a good desk, lots of power points, cleanliness, comfortable bed, quiet, tv channels choice and access to room service. They nail it on all fronts. The rooms are not huge but that is not a requirement. They do have very personable staff, everyone of them smiles and acknowledges guests (not common these days) and appear relaxed in their jobs. The TV one is important as I generally work into the small hours and a lot of hotels only get the sports / news channels plus free to air. Ovolo have chosen to put all the normal subscription channels on (like Discovery / Nat Geo) and they are much better in the background at 2 in the morning. The other bonus is the minibar being included in the room rate (as well as breakfast). Have added this one to my list of hotels to use in the future.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460605553~“Easily The Best”~The 1888 hotel was easily among one of the best boutique hotels I've ever visited. Period. Their attention to detail was second to none. Happy hour with free drinks for guests, personalised cards and a free minibar with beer, wine, chocolates and my personal ultimate naughty treat...Gummy Bears. If I'm ever able to go back to Sydney, without a shadow of a doubt that will be the only place I stay. If it's full, I'll wait. Within walking distance to the CBD and Sydney Opera house. Travelled Jan 2016.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460545219~“A Fantastic hotel”~We found this hotel when searching for accommodation in Sydney. Sydney is never cheap, but this hotel was reasonably priced and in a good area, so we took the plunge. I cannot express how impressed we were. This hotel includes so many extras as standard, from the free mini bar in your room, (which we really appreciated after arriving at 11pm from a long London flight), which is also restocked daily. A delicious breakfast and evening drinks and canapés. Oh and the free sweets.... The hotel is very well decorated in a modern/warehouse type style with so many little gems. ( look at the floor under the lift when it leaves the ground floor). Location wise it is only a short stroll to Darling harbour where you can get a water taxi to the rocks. This hotel deserves praise, but I don't want to say too much or everyone else will book there and we won't get in!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460495751~“Amazing”~Could not fault my stay here. I had a crazy day with removalist not showing up so I booked into Ovolo, best decision. The staff were fantastic and the room was lovely. The stand out for me was all the *little things* - they had thought of everything! Didnt have a chance to try breakfast. Highly recommend!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460483641~“Fab find in great location”~What a great find this place was. From the moment I made the booking right up to my checkout out the service was excellent. Book direct and you get lots of treats that add the finishing touch to your stay, from a little bag of snacks left in your room to the umbrella that's available for you to use should the heavens open during your stay. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460213407~“Great stay for Valentines Day”~We stayed at the Ovolo for Two nights on Feb 14 and 15 as James Taylor was playing at the ICC and it was a great location.  "You never get a second chance to make a great first impression" should be the battle cry for anyone in hospitality and the team at Ovolo get it.  We could not fault the customer service from the moment we met BARCHA on reception till the morning we left. Everyone is customer oriented.  The free minbar, happy hour and candy bar all nice extras that makes your stay different to the other chains.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that I felt I was staying in a renovated wool store (which it is) and at times the room felt a little small. But 5 stars to BARCHA, the lovely lady who cleaned our room and all the team. Will stay here again - especially if I need to be in Darling Harbour.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460093162~“Everything we wanted, nothing we didn't need”~Found the Ovolo Woolloomoolo first and was torn between the two, but happy with my choice (we did check out the other space while there). It was perfect for this first visit to Sydney on the tail end of a week's sail in the Whitsundays with friends.    Exposed brick/raw wood beams in center atrium lobby, very comfy bed and clean, modern bathroom. On top of that, it's a really happy place. We arrived tired and hungry but needed to clean up before dinner - so the snack bag upon arrival was perfect. Did I say free mini bar and free happy hour? And free breakfast? Free washers/dryers with free detergent seems like a small thing, but not if this Sydney visit is part of a larger trip including outdoor activities. Just for fun, entertainingly cheeky phrases on everything.  The location: steps from the Pyrmont pedestrian bridge to downtown. We easily walked to the Rocks and the Lord Nelson Pub. Surrounding streets are not much to write home about, but do feature a super Thai place and the maritime museum. (The other Ovolo is kind of cool in being on a pier but is more isolated from these areas. Sure, it could be cool to walk across the park, but not at night, and it is a longer trek.) Used Uber for Surrey Hills, Bondi, etc. In both cases, I like that Ovolo repurposes older structures. The room: we had the "shoebox." No outside windows, just one looking inside into the lobby which is charming and extends the height of the building. (Surrounding streets nothing to look at, anyway.) If you're here to enjoy the city and care about bed/bathroom, save your money and stay in this small room. (Of course, if you spend the prior week on a sailboat, this feels like a presidential suite.) This place is not cheap, but the extras made it a better value than the standard chain hotels at the same price. Book directly on Ovolo website, and in advance, to get the free breakfast (same price).~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_459113790~“no value for money - so mediocre, felt like a hi-tech hostel”~I want to start by saying - the staff are lovely and we hadn't a single bad interaction with anyone at Ovolo. I booked Ovolo for a 4 day stay in Sydney - in an attempt to do something different/ a little more boutique than the usual 5 star chains. In this case however, boutique equated to no-frills (no Porter, no room service, no facilities on site except a laundry room and a little cafeteria area which reminded me of high school). All this would be understandable if we had made some big savings. However we forked over 845 AUD a night for the Shaken suite assuming it would be something special! The suite was tiny, making me wonder how small the regular rooms must be ...and the only novelty factor was having the bed on a different level than the living space. A nuisance more than anything else - especially having to climb down a flight when you need to use the loo at night! Pros - stocked minibar, kind staff, supposedly "cool, young vibe" with the Apple TV and sound bar in room.  Cons - insanely overpriced when you compare to more central 5 star hotels with far more facilities and a service - oriented culture - and probably cheaper per sq m than our crazy expensive/tiny suite at Ovolo. The hotel is also quite a way from the CBD ($10 Uber drive each time) - which was far from ideal. Must've spent $150 just getting into cbd everyday - it was too hot to walk. Bearing in mind distance to cbd, tiny room sizes, and very basic facilities - there is no way I can justify $845 AUD / night at Ovolo. Totally shocking.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459094752~“POCKET ROCKET”~Sometimes when I go through trip advisor, I proceed with the notion, different folks for different strokes. Well I was so glad I stayed here. Had the shoebox room, what a pocket rocket. Loved it. Had everything. I really loved it. I grabbed a great deal. $229 Friday night. Great deal. Loved the music. Loved the a/c. I was suppose to head down to Sokyo, or the outdoor pop up summer bar star city. But chose to relax, however did let my hair down , happy hour. I had a great shower was having a dance along and sing along. To all the r and b classics. Was having a moment. Loved dancing in the shower.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_459062090~“Staff try really hard to please”~Lovely positive welcome after a long flight, it really gave us a boost. We arrived pretty early an knew our room would not be ready, but our luggage was whisked away allowing us to explore with a personalised map in hand. When we returned our luggage was in our room, slight error from the receptionist who told us that breakfast was included, it is but only if you book direct with the hotel.  The room we chose was quite small but fine for us, bathrooms modern and sparkling clean. Air conditioning in the room did not want to be controlled from the room control and had a bit of a mind of its own, but we did sleep comfortably, bearing in mind the time difference that our bodies were going through.  The good news is the mini bar is free but we could not do it justice, perhaps we will give it a better go when we return in a weeks time!~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458991846~“great hotel, right price and nice surprises”~Loved it, funky feel, airy room, comfy bed, right price then free mini bar and friendly staff it was all good.  I would come back, but book directly so you get the free breakfast.  The location was good for us, right behind darling harbour means you were close enough to the action, but also easy to grab a cab and get where you need to go.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_458835170~“Fabulous!”~This is a really creative approach to the hotel experience. Free mini-bar, Apple TV & Netflix, very helpful and friendly staff. I recommend booking directly as you get even more freebies. Congratulations to the people driving this. I hope they open lots more hotels around the world. I would definitely seek them out.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458833460~“Funky and fun - a welcome departure from the corporate hotel”~Initially I wasn't very sure that I liked this hotel but it very quickly grew on me. The rooms are a bit small especially if you have large amounts of luggage. Storage space is also limited. The beds are supremely comfortable and the rooms are spotlessly clean and properly air-conditioned. The staff are incredibly friendly and well motivated by the manager who rolls up her sleeves and helps out at breakfast. A good sign, that, leading from the front. If you go for breakfast included when booking, the continental buffet is more than adequate, but having to pay for hot cooked items on top is a real shame. The freebies are fun and welcome. The hotel has a clear USP and fulfils its brief. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. So it's worthy of a five star rating. The hotel is very convenient for Darling Harbour and the CBD. You can also take the ferry around to Circular Quay from Pyrmont Bay. Get an Opal Card if you're going to use the public transport, it's well worth it. If you have a lot of luggage, book a larger room.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_458795862~“funky, great (free) breakfast and drinks but noisy”~While its not the hotels fault that our stay was marred by noise from the traffic and people walking outside, I believe they should bear some of the responsibility as we specifically requested a quiet room on booking.  Sadly the hotel forgot about that and put us next to the lift. They moved us to the end of the corridor and wow, what an awful nights sleep... right on the end next to the road junction. sigh. Free mini bar and snacks was an amusing little addition, and it was good to have some free waters and beers so that was great. The happy hour was superb, tho the (local) beers were unpalatable to us, and were locals and have tried most of the small brew houses round here, no worries tho the wine was excellent. Snacks were great too. Included breakfast was enjoyable and was above average for sure. Location was great, easy for the tram (just walk though the carpark and use the lift), tho it was a bit smelly as all carparks tend to be when tramps use them, but its a great shortcut and the smell isnt the fault of the hotel of course. So all in all a nice hotel with some good inclusions for the price, but we wont be back. The awful nights sleep put paid to that. Shame really, it could have been sooo much better with decent soundproofing and better staff who were on the ball.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
