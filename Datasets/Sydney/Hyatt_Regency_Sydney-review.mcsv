review_478683304~“Great location”~You are within walking distance to everything you would want to see. Awesome view of the city at night with all the lights on. Had a nice room and was clean. Breakfast served every morning was good as well.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_432871978~“Worth every penny - a luxurious stay”~Service - very welcoming and professional. Hotel is spotless. Bar is appealing and looks very relaxing. King, Standard room with view across Darling Harbour just ideal. Air con a little noisy but not to the extreme but air was pleasant to sleep in, can be adjusted. Bed very comfortable, great night sleep. TV easy to use. If light sleeper use ear plugs. no paper to write on but pen, not drastic to have but would be ideal. Tissues in bathroom. nice touch was a toothbrush with toothpaste for each person and other toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and bath gel. Ironing table in cupboard which lights on when you open the door. electric kettle with various coffees and teas. small refrigerator with items to purchase. slippers in cupboard if you need them, in plastic wrapper. Bathroom was absolutely spotless. Lemon soap available to use. Shower very easy to use. mirror on wall, ideal for a woman. I found the bathroom a little dark to put makeup on but thats only because i require glasses. No welcome tourist book, tried to find information about the hotel on the office table but nothing there which i always like to read. Buffet breakfast was AMAZING. Four different areas to choose from. hot food, ie scrambled eggs, bacon well done/and not as well done, hash brown, sausage etc. other table, slices of meats, salmon, various breads for toasting, with fruits on the other side. other buffet table, juices and smoothies and other danishes, smallish fancy donuts and croissants. Enjoyed this stay thoroughly and will use again. Recommend for a stay in Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_477946752~“Great location, pleasant outlook”~Just stayed a single night prior to a business meeting the next day. I used to stay here in the e2000 - 2005 era when it was the Sheraton, and my feeling is that Hyatt are doing a better job than Sheraton did. The room was clean and comfortable, reasonable sized desk for working, and great view across the Darling Harbour aquarium. Reception effective and friendly. Handy IGA just directly across the road for picking up snacks if you don't want room service or the in-house restaurants.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477253545~“Vacation prior to cruise”~We were promised an early check in after our 17 hour flight and arrival at 6:00am however we had to wait until after noon to get to our room. Guests arriving after us waited much less time. Hotel had very poor lighting in the room. Room was very clean and bathroom well stocked with needs. Location is great and within reasonable walking distance to restaurants and attractions. Food over priced. Concierge (Gary Chan) was very good to work with. Very noisy hallways~2~1~5~2~3~4~2~nan
review_476946025~“Sydney in Easter”~Average ranking among the Hyatt Regency hotels I have stayed in before. Rooms were not well clean, somecservicing was missing, particularly Concierge service which was badly needed and glaringly missing, housekeeping service was poor, toilet had no water for flushing once and when the technician came the water suddenly returned and he did not believe there was a problem. He was also very unfriendly and thought we called for help frivolously. Toiletries not well supplied. Food was good. View was good from room into Darling Harbour. Receptionists were good. Cafe was good. Gym was small and ventilation should be improved. No swimming pool though!~3~2~5~4~4~3~2~nan

review_476713843~“Terrible”~We were given the room next to the nightclub. As a platinum member this is unacceptable. Drunk people were overly boisterous and rowdy all night with many hitting our door as they passed by. We will reconsider our loyalty from now on.~1~1~4~1~4~4~1~nan
review_476664001~“Okay Stay”~Stayed 5 nights at the start of April. Had a harbour view room at the end of the hall so I think it is in the new part. The hotel room was very small. I kept tripping over the legs of the luggage stand that was in the way when you got out of bed t go to the bathroom. The other case was put on the top of the bar area as there was nowhere else to put the case. Bathroom was reasonable although there was only 2 towels. As a female with long hair I use 2 towels and that leaves my husband using a wet towel. The shower was very hot but there was not much water pressure. I didn't like the shower as it didn't have a door and it was quite cold once the water was turned off. The soap supplied smelt lovely but the conditioner didn't leave my hair nice and soft. It just felt like it had been shampooed. One ting I did find difficult was the flush buttons to the toilet were behind the seat and very low down. It was really difficult to press them. If someone was old and a little bit feeble they might have trouble pressing it. The view from the room was great. Room service was prompt and there was no ridiculous extra charges for someone to walk 2 minutes down the hall and deliver it to me at 10 pm at night. Staff on check in were very friendly as too were the housekeeping staff. Every time we saw them in the hallway they said hello and wished you a good day. We asked desk staff for a couple of directions to various events and we were given the wrong directions. We were told to catch a train to one event that doesn't have a train station anywhere near it.  All in all the stay was ok but I wouldn't say it is a 5 star hotel. Would I go back? Possibly if the price is right but I wouldn't run back there due to the fabulous room. Best thing is the location. Above us must of been a bar or restaurant as at 3 am to 4 am we could hear furniture being moved across the floor then at approx. midnight another night I could hear it again.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_476618370~“Staff training is very important”~Stayed there for a one night city break. The experience that I had was completely different for the check in evening versus the following morning. When checking in, I was not addressed by the reception even once in any form. She was talking to a colleague went I went to the desk. The colleague stopped the chat and walked away but gave me a dirty look (don't know why). Went to the room which was reasonably comfortable. Asked for tooth brush (a new trend for hotels aiming for group tourist to not having tooth brushes in the first place). The housekeeping staff that delivered the tooth brushes was outright rude. Then went downstairs to the concierge. No one was there, so spoke to the receptionist (only staff in the whole lobby at 7 pm !!). I asked specifically if there was fireworks at the Darling Harbour in the evening. The first two times, I was told how to get to the Darling Harbour. On the third, she finally understood the question and said she needed to consult someone. She went outside but to no avail. Came back and looked up on the computer (could have done it first up) and finally gave us the correct answer. The following morning, we were met two housekeeping staff wearing smiles and greeted us warmly. The check out queue was very slow with only one person on duty but finally, a staff walked past and helped to clear the queue. With the great facilities (the gym was divided into cardio and weights room) and central location, the hotel has great potentials only if there is adequate staff who truly embraces hospitality.~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_476588312~“Awesome place to stay”~Arrived at 6.00 am had room ready for us which was just what we needed after 30 hours of travel. I can honestly say they couldn't have been more accommodating, All the staff were superb, reception guest relations and the concierge in particular they go the extra mile. Harbour facing room on fifth floor perfect good size and amenities. Good location steps away from Darling Harbour and a nice 20 minute walk to the bridge and opera house~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_476585291~“A very comfortable and quiet hotel”~We had a lovely room with nice amenities. The hotel is located just steps from the Sydney Aquarium and many restaurants in Darling Harbour. Staff were very friendly and professional and the concierge arranged the airport shuttle for us. WiFi was free and available throughout the hotel. They have a restaurant that serves a buffet breakfast that was excellent, but rather pricey. We enjoyed our stay and would come back.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476362762~“Modern refurbished hotel close to Darling Harbour and Barangaroo”~This was my first visit to the Hyatt Regency and I was pleasantly surprised by the refurbished rooms and common areas. I would describe the overall experience as pleasant and efficient rather than luxurious. Service was good but not great, same with food and drink. The location is great for Darling Harbour and Barangaroo (5 to 10 min walk) or Circular Quay is about 20 mins. There was no bath in the deluxe room I stayed in and no bathrobes either. I would have expected both to be honest. Wifi was free and reliable.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_476679933~“excellent location but not much else”~brilliant location, but staff are inattentive and the rooms are small for the price.

review_476236420~“Mixed feeling mostly good”~We stayed here at the start of April. We asked to upgrade our room but ended up speaking to multiple people and moving rooms 3 times mainly because of lack of communication between staff, we wanted a twin bed and they kept accidentally giving us double beds. The breakfast buffet was delicious and the staff were very polite. I am unsure if I would stay here again mainly because of the trouble we had with the room the first night. However the hotel did have a great location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476051103~“Comfortable stay”~Hyatt was a great hotel to stay for 3 nights for business. Rooms were clean, the bed was big and comfortable to sleep in. Not close to many restaurants, buffet breakfast downstairs is awesome but is pricey. In peak periods I would definitely recommend checking the prices for Hyatt because they were actually cheaper than the Novotel & Ibis which are directly across the water from this hotel. Has a great roof top bar upstairs, make sure you get a room not close to this bar as it can get very noisy as patrons leave the bar.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_475686718~“Great Regency Club ”~Hyatt just took over this from Sheraton. It has a brand new tower where I had a King room with a great view. They had a great, large brand new Regency Club with very nice continental breakfast but also cocked to order omelets. Nice snacks and drinks at night with light dinner, gnocchi one night that I was there. Nice modern hotel. 4* +~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475503352~“Great Hotel Location”~Hotel was perfectly located. In hotel restaurant services were excellent. Rooms were clean, well appointed, but on the small side. Nice view of Darling Harbor. Near center city and the "Rocks." Reception desk personnel were incompetent. The reservation for our 14 person group was "lost." All first level personnel could tell us was that our reservations were not in their computer.

review_475482750~“GREAT STAY AT A GREAT HOTEL”~This was a fantastic stay and a beautiful hotel. For being such a large hotel, the level of service really impressed me. I stay at a lot of Hyatt hotels this was very nice. The lounge had great food and impeccable service. We arrived early in the morning and they checked us into a very nice room and due to our status (Globalist) we were offered a suite for our second night when it became available. When we checked in it was very early in the morning and the room wasn't quite ready so they invited us to have breakfast while we waited about 10 minutes for the room to be ready. GREAT SERVICE! I also noticed that the General Manager, Mr. Zancanaro is now the GM at this hotel. He had previously made our stay at the Grand Hyatt Beijing very special a while ago. I want to say thank you him and the all of the staff at this hotel for making it such a wonderful trip for us!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475423883~“Service that one may seek HERE!”~Its so nice to see that service is not just a word but a way of life at the Hyatt Regency.

review_474504125~“Not as good as it used to be”~Stayed here previously when it was the Four Points and it has been renovated but the rooms haven't changed much, except the restaurant wasn't as good. Flushing the toilet is still difficult without dropping the lid, walls are still thin and you can still hear people talking in the corridor. We were fortunate to get an upgrade to a harbour view room which is better than the view of a multi story carpark. The king beds are extremely comfortable and give a good nights sleep.  Dont think it is as good as it was previously so will probably look elsewhere in Sydney next time. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474449203~“Work Stop Over”~Work had recently held a function in Sydney, itinerary came through that we were staying at Hyatt Regency, thought this will be fancy, unfortunately I was underwhelmed. The entrance was via a coach drop off in the bellows of the underground, which was not their fault but not a nice entry, check in was very swift although as booked as a group could not claim my Hyatt Points. Room was ok, small & basic though, not a very pleasant city view. Worst was still to come as needed to share with a co-worker so single beds which were hard. Breakfast & lunch were fantastic & all the staff were very helpful & pleasant, which probably made the stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_474393643~“Good but I wouldn't stay here on personal travel”~Stayed on business, this hotel is used by our company. Room was nice and clean, bed was comfortable. Location is excellent for getting to Darling Harbour. The hotel has very expensive food/drink options though including a single bottle of Peroni beer setting me back $13 whoops don't order that without looking at the menu! Overall a great stay for business but looking at the room prices I wouldn't stay here on personal travel, not a luxury hotel IMHO and average value for money.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

review_474378275~“Nice hotel in a good location, but some disappointing elements”~We stayed at the Hyatt Regency as it is close to the Sydney Convention Centre in Darling Harbour. Its location and outlook are great. We had a spacious, comfortable room overlooking Darling Harbour. We were disappointed with a number of basic elements, however. We couldn't manage to maintain a comfortable room temperature as despite altering the thermostat, the room remained cold. We awoke early on the Sunday morning (as we were to attend the 3rd day of our conference) to find that the shower was cold for both of us. When we mentioned this at reception, the response was that they had problems that morning. We notice other reviews have mentioned similar problems and we consider hotels of this calibre ought to readily solve these types of inconveniences.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474357888~“Give this place a big Miss”~From the time I arrived I knew I was in for a new Ozzie slack experience. It was an effort for them to help with my bags - Check in was plain rude and then the room was 4 miles from the lift. The dinner was like going to a disco as the music was crazy loud. Then the roof top bar - more attitude from the bar staff. It was an effort to do anything ! We had an evening drink down in the lobby bar and they ran out of a particular spirit after 1 drink . So we all left and walked up the street . Next night still no replacement mmmmm???? Only to be told by the barman that he only goes to the cellar Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays ???? So 5 of us got up and left. Then to top it off we arranged and paid 400 bucks for an early check in and upon arrival it wasn't ready and had to wait . Upon check out nobody cared and the front desk manager was going to get back to me . Still waiting ! The only good thing is the coffee shop next door were the staff are wonderful and helpful .  Total disgrace Hyatt and never again will our company use your services !!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474149227~“All about the location”~The hotel is all about the location. The location just steps from the Darling harborside is amazing. The hotel is newly re branded from Four Points from Sheraton, but the service has not 'upgraded' likewise. It's totally worth the money to upgrade to a harbor view room. The sunset views on the Darling harbor side are worth the extra bucks. The restaurants and the new rooftop bar are good, but the service doesnt justify the high $$$$. The rooftop bar is again, all about the view. My room was on the old block and felt a little underwhelming. Overall, its all about the location and the views..~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_473966097~“Underwhelming.....”~It was a lackluster stay with long queues to check in and check out (both times the staff needed help from the manager) and the room while it had a great view was very small. The whole stay left me with a feeling of being "blah" - just not a personal service. I stayed at the Hilton Sydney years ago and it was just so personable, professional and friendly so would recommend the Hilton over the Hyatt.  Also make sure you check your credit card - I was charged for Mini Bar items that I had never used. I was really annoyed they never advised me and just automatically charged me, they fixed it up quickly which was a positive - still a hassle I didn't need!~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan

review_473321775~“Terrible service in disappointing hotel.”~Our experience at this hotel went from bad to extremely poor, mostly due to the lazy, uncaring and rude staff of the hotel. On arrival from interstate on a Monday at 11am, we were told we could not check in until 3pm.We approached concierge for a map and dire tons to somewhere nearby to shop and have some lunch. He threw a map at us while muttering and promptly walked off. After asking guests for directions we left the hotel and returned at 3:15. Only to be rudely told by reception that "We could not check in until after 3. This was only the beginning. As we were here for a business function in the hotel, a number of us had clearly marked bags delivered to wrong rooms, and once again, no apologies although there appeared to be staff standing blankly around the hotel foyer as if they were waiting for someone else to do their jobs. Not good enough. The rooms were grimy and city views meant looking onto a multi storey carport with lights shining throughout the night. For a city that usually excites, This hotel lets Sydney down and we would never return here.~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~1~nan

I liked to clock radio which also pairs as a blue tooth speaker and iphone/android charger. I recommend spending the extra on a club room, the Regency Club is exceptional. Comprehensive breakfast and evening canopy's and drinks were great, and the view is amazing which made up for not having a harbour view room. Zephyr Bar is another great spot located on the roof, the views are great, the drinks are expensive but its a must to visit.

Found the room very cramped , asked for a twin room , assumed the beds would have been king singles or doubles at the least not basic singles . We paid $359 for one night , so expensive , not even breakfast for that price ( Wanted $38 per head for that ) Basin in the bathroom was blocked , no bathrobes as quoted either  Had dinner in The Sailmaker Rest as we wanted an earlier meal . My daughter ordered fish & was asked whether she wanted it Rare Medium or Well Done , SERIOUSLY !!!!  My pasta was not cooked & half was cold , no excuse as we were the first guests in the Rest .

I was disappointed with the size of the room and the bathroom. Compared to other hotels of a similar price, I find this very small. I also had to call housekeeping for extra towels as we were two girls who both needed to wash our hair and were only provided with two towels. Other than this it is a beautiful hotel with a great bar upstairs. The location is good but I don't know if I will be rushing back. I would maybe spend a bit more to get a better room next time I guess.~4~2~5~4~3~4~5~nan
review_471978697~“Not the Hyatt Brand”~Rooms are small and old. Service is very average and you will not receive typical Hyatt brand standard. You are guaranteed to receive a wake up call at 8-830am as the housekeeping will ensure to make as much noise as possible. Also great benefit with watching TV as you will also be able to listen to the TV next door. The bellman will watch you grab your own luggage from the taxi. The morning of check out, there was no hot water. Called Guest Service and was advised that a engineer will come and have a look. 1 hour later and Im still waiting right now.  Definitely not a 5 star hotel and don't expect the typical Hyatt service standard.~2~nan~4~nan~2~nan~1~nan

review_471756360~“Expensive doesnt equal Luxury”~This is an expensive hotel masquerading as a luxury hotel. The rooms are small, the bed is uncomfortable and the towels are wafer thin as you would expect to find in a cheap country motel.  Your view options are city or harbour, and if you get a city view, your view is nothing but an opposing building. The room service menu is expensive (paid $26 for a burger) and upon delivery was slugged an extra $8 as a surcharge for in room dining. That's a crappy $32 burger with about half a dozen chips.  I had a martini at the rooftop bar and the view is pretty good without being spectacular over Darling Harbour looking west. I expected the $21 hotel cocktail charge - but I didn't expect a disgusting attempt at a martini in a small wine glass. Disappointing again.  It gets 2 stars for the location, but I unfortunately cant give it any more.~2~1~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_470924206~“Not worth the price you pay.”~The service reflects a that of a hotel rated at perhaps a 3 star.  With the brand Hyatt Regency, you would expect good service as a minimum but it was absolutely terrible. The Room service/ Guest services NEVER answer the phone. At one point I had to get changed, leave my laptop to go to reception and ask to order food as nobody wanted to answer the phones only to be told "maybe they are busy" laughable.  The breakfast through room service was absolutely awful.  The rooms are small and basic; but clean and comfortable beds.  If it wasn't for the service and food, I wouldn't have felt the need to give a bad review.~1~1~5~5~3~5~1~nan
review_470857745~“Good choice if you're looking for a business hotel close to the CBD”~My experience of Sydney hotels hasn't been great but this seems to be a good option if you're travelling on business and need somewhere close to the CBD. I upped my rating after I received a quick reply from the hotel manager responding to some points I raised in a guest survey. Positives: close to the CBD; close to several restaurants in Darling Harbour; close to ferry terminal; close to Chinatown; newly refurbished property; comfy beds; great rooftop bar; excellent breakfast; friendly staff; taxis always available outside Negatives: slow internet; expensive laundry; bring earplugs, you can hear everything in the hallways including slamming doors and people walking by; access to the rooftop bar is via the 12th floor so avoid bedrooms on that floor; this is a large conference hotel so it always feels busy but the hotel seems to cope well with the volume of people; dinner menu not very interesting but plenty of other options nearby.~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471558269~“Harbor View”~This hotel is very convenient to Darling Harbor and attractions. In particular the harbor view rooms offer outstanding views. The hotel is convenient to the boardwalk and general downtown area. Service is very good and efficient.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_470783384~“Very poor service”~The rooms were OK, nothing special and not worth the very high rates. The concierge service was awful, just not enough staff. I was promised that my invoice would be mailed to me - it did not arrive. Breakfast just OK, again slow service.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~5~1~nan
review_470750919~“Poor Service - Shouldn't Be Affiliated With Hyatt”~Decided to check out this Hyatt for the second time now that the Regency Club is open. Again the elite check in desk downstairs was not manned and key packets and registration forms hadn't been prepared in advance. Spent 30 seconds in the lounge in the evening and left when I saw the hot item. If I want meatballs, I'll go to IKEA. The room layout (1102) was just terrible. Workdesk thrown in the corner. Who designs these? Got a call at 1PM inquiring if I need help with my bags. Well. I had confirmed 4PM checkout as a Diamond member. These crappy hotels are wearing me down. How come it is so difficult to provide good service in Australia? This is hospitality business after all.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470725920~“Above average business hotel”~This is a better than average hotel for business travelers. It's conveniently located on the harbor near the Convention Center and within walking distance of George Street, Circular Quay and the Opera House. It's been recently refurbished in a clean if bland style and has all the standard business class amenities. That said, it's a little sloppy around the edges, with some litter in the halls and not-impeccable housekeeping. The staff was courteous and friendly, but seemed stretched thin by the crowds of customers.~3~2~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_470156596~“Good location, staff a little overrun”~Spent 4 nights at this newly rebranded Hyatt, having often stayed at its previous incarnation as a Four Points Sheraton. The hotel has had an extensive refurbishment including relocation of the check-in desks and the opening of a new rooftop bar. On a work-sponsored trip I was in the lowest cost standard room, but fittings were refreshed and consistent with expectations of the Hyatt brand. This hotel is overwhelmingly used for corporate business, especially for the nearby newly rebuilt and reopened conference centre. The location is outstanding for accessing the CBD and was a 5 minute walk for me to my George Street office. Check-in and checkout were excellent with the young but professional staff. I arrived at 11 am and there was no issue with getting an early check-in. My only disappointment was when retrieving my bag at the end of the working Friday - this was a very long wait (over 20 minutes) which would have been fatal if I was running for a flight out. The staff at front desk seemed overwhelmed and could not retrieve bags fast enough for the mob of guests heading out the door. This needs to be sorted out by proper staffing for what should be a predictable surge. Photos show (1) room (2) view from a low cost 'city view' standard room - of the parking garage opposite - these rooms are not for tourists, they're for working visits.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469975697~“Disappointing first visit to Sydney”~for the price paid the rooms were small, poorly equipped, staff in the restaurant didn't seem to know what they were doing half of the time, the food was okay, whilst front of house were pleasant enough.~1~1~3~3~2~2~2~nan
review_469966817~“Great location, but overpriced and slow service”~Ok, so the location is simply very good as it is just one road crossing away from Darling Harbour, the city's main place to go for food and dancing on friday and saturday, the aquarium, cruises, etc. But at a rate of nearly $400 a night it is rediculously overpriced. They have an old and new part, have stayed in both. The new part is a long walk, so if you have much or heavy luggage let them bring it (they dont offer that though). The new rooms are mediocre in size, its not small, but a family with 1 kid would find it difficult to fit in. Bathroom is small and has no bath, toilet seats are annoying as they fall shut, so you either have to sit against it or perform some acrobatics to keep the thing up. The old rooms are similar, but show wear and tear everywhere and are quite smelly. The $400 was actually for one of these old once without view on the harbour. That would be another $60 dollar night. The breakfast is ok, but service very slow, takes 15 min to bring a coffee. Service in general is lousy, took 20 min to check in and when we went back to get our luggage, the guy, Xavier, took almost 30 min to get our luggage, really not helpful if you have to be somewhere else. No excuses, just an arrogant look and sigh and he walked away. You get better service in a hostel. If your breakfast is not included, highly recommended to go out for food. During weekdays there is a healthy eatery around the corner (main exit, go left, first right, then 15 meters, called Marthas). During weekends the restaurants in darling harbour are generally open early. Pancakes on the rocks or Cristinis are recommended. For lunch, you could go to the office building next door (main exit, go right, cross once, go into the big office building and walk through it inside behind the garden), really great sushi and mexican. Dont try the last place, Paddocks or something like that, it wont make you happy.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469672669~“Beautiful renovation”~I had stayed at this hotel when it was a Four Points years ago. Made reservations months ago through the Starwood system, and Hyatt gets 6*s for honoring that reservation even though ownership had changed. Hyatt did a great job of modernizing the public rooms. Our guest room was very nice, with no problems. This is not a luxury hotel, but the staff was great, the lobby and lounge areas very nice, and you just cannot beat the location at this price. Walked around the Darling Harbor area every night for endless choices of restaurants, bars, shopping, people watching, etc. Right on the hop on, hop off route as well. Brought three other couples with us on this trip. Highly recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469670850~“Good hotel”~Hyatt regency has been completely refurbished. The hotel is very large and therefore lacks a bit of atmosphere. Rooms are good. Location in darling harbour is excellent. All in all a good choice as business or tourist hotel~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469661903~“The hotel where the client is worth nothing”~The position is great, and the good news stop here. This hotel can hardly be considered a 5 stars hotel. The rooms are very, very small. Breakfast is served in a massive area which looks quite standard and dispersive. Nothing too bad, but certainly not a luxury hotel. What is serious, though, is that I was at the Hyatt Regency for 4 days and three nights and all along my stay I had huge problems with my wi-fi connection: I was basically not able to work from my room and ended up using my phone line to connect to the internet. Having a working wifi network in all rooms should be as obvious, for a 5 stars hotel in this century, as having a minibar in all rooms. I raised the issue with all the staff members I could - front desk, concierge, I even spoke with their internet engineers, I asked to see the hotel manager and talked with him directly - and nobody ever came back to me with a solution, an apology, nothing. I ended up leaving the hotel as the unhappiest client ever. I genuinely cannot remember of a worse customer experience in my whole life.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~4~1~nan
review_469659425~“Great location and good food!”~I stayed here for two nights at the end of a business trip. I paid extra to upgrade to a harbor view room which was lovely. The sunset views are especially beautiful! The room itself was very clean and nice although a bit smaller than other Hyatt Regency rooms I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet in the morning is excellent and expansive. I also ate in the lobby bar and had a light dinner with some really excellent soup. My coworker ordered the fried rice and said it was excellent as well. I did run into a few maintenance issues during my stay. The phone in my room did not work at all which I discovered when I tried to order room service one evening. I walked down the hallway to use the house phone to report the issue, and the house phone didn't work either! I was forced to go down to the lobby (in my pajamas) and order room service directly at the front desk. They were very apologetic and offered to have someone come repair the phone immediately, but as I was checking-out in the morning I asked them to wait until after I left given it was already 9pm and I was, as previously mentioned, already in my pajamas. All in all, a good stay at a very nice hotel with a wonderful location. I would return again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469589276~“Lovely staff cannot redeem the problems”~The staff here were lovely, extremely helpful and willing to accomodate requests. However no matter how helpful the staff are, nothing redeems a smoke alarm with 2 flashing red lights (every 2 seconds) over the bed; it was investigated but found to be the normal setting... Also there was constant noise in the walls from the nearby service lift. These were the things that just were... Further, no robes or slippers were in the room, or toothbrush. (Quickly fixed) Overall though, inspite the convenient location, at this price point one expects a quiet, dark room. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469505350~“Would probably stay elsewhere in Sydney”~Its not usual for me to say this, but I am not sure that I would stay at the Hyatt Regency again. The common spaces are beautiful however the room was a little sparse, the TV was rather old and the bathroom was tiny with terrible water pressure. The air conditioning in the room didn't work all that well even when turned down to the lowest setting, which given the humidity made for a very unpleasant sleep.  There was a balcony off our room which was lovely, however there was no furniture on the balcony so I am not sure what I was supposed to do out there, other than stand for a minute or two and look at the Maritime Museum. Two chairs and a small table would have been perfect. I understand there may be security issues however there are ways to secure furniture to outdoor spaces so they can not be thrown off.  Check in was rather disappointing, when we walked in only my husband was greeted by reception and they continued to speak to him rather than me. Also, despite offering online checkout, there is no visible place in reception to put the key even when you have checked out online, which means waiting in a queue or pushing into a queue to simply return a key. The bar on level 12 was lovely though and the cocktails were very good, the G&T's particularly. Service was good until there were two large groups who showed up and then we had to wait almost 30 minutes for a cocktail, which was a little frustrating, given that we had ordered beforehand, we were also eating food and had been there for longer. Had the cocktails come sooner we would have likely stayed at the venue for longer as it was very pleasant sitting overlooking the water watching the sunset. It was a Saturday afternoon so we did expect it to be a little busy but then we would have expected the staff to be prepared for a busier time.  The lobby bar was lovely and we did have a last cocktail there before heading to bed. It was nice that it was open late so that we could do that .~3~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469469329~“Excellent & well located, with great amenities”~I'm a loyal Hyatt customer, and the HR Sydney was comfortable and most enjoyable during two visits there in February. One day, the weather was so hot it was not really safe to be outdoors for long periods, so I rested well in a quiet room, worked out in the well equipped fitness center, and enjoyed the bar and restaurant in the hotel. Hyatts rarely disappoint, and this was no exception. Proximity to public transport, beaches, and Darling Harbor make this hotel a prime spot. Its one of the largest in the city, but very efficient getting in and out.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_469356642~“A mixed experience.”~We travelled to Aus for a friend's wedding and stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Great location, nice lobby and the breakfast offer was really great. First we encountered an impatient valet parking staff at the time of check in, where he obviously pulled a face because he wasn't pleased by the fact that I gave him the wrong name and that he had to write on a new parking card (I gave him my boyfriend's name but I later on realised I should've given mine because the room booking was under my name). Then we went into the room and realised there were no amenities - slippers, tooth brush and so on - well it's fine because we could call and ask for them.  But the most hilarious yet ridiculous thing was that throughout our stay, we got phone calls in the middle of the night (sometimes at 4, sometimes at 6) to ask for iron or other requests that were supposed to go to the reception. We realised there could be some technical problem in linking the telephone lines, so we talked to the reception upon check out and they said they will try to investigate... Unfriendly concierge, phone call in the middle of the night and impatient valet parking staff... we should've done some research before making a booking!~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~2~nan

review_432871978~“Worth every penny - a luxurious stay”~Service - very welcoming and professional. Hotel is spotless. Bar is appealing and looks very relaxing. King, Standard room with view across Darling Harbour just ideal. Air con a little noisy but not to the extreme but air was pleasant to sleep in, can be adjusted. Bed very comfortable, great night sleep. TV easy to use. If light sleeper use ear plugs. no paper to write on but pen, not drastic to have but would be ideal. Tissues in bathroom. nice touch was a toothbrush with toothpaste for each person and other toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and bath gel. Ironing table in cupboard which lights on when you open the door. electric kettle with various coffees and teas. small refrigerator with items to purchase. slippers in cupboard if you need them, in plastic wrapper. Bathroom was absolutely spotless. Lemon soap available to use. Shower very easy to use. mirror on wall, ideal for a woman. I found the bathroom a little dark to put makeup on but thats only because i require glasses. No welcome tourist book, tried to find information about the hotel on the office table but nothing there which i always like to read. Buffet breakfast was AMAZING. Four different areas to choose from. hot food, ie scrambled eggs, bacon well done/and not as well done, hash brown, sausage etc. other table, slices of meats, salmon, various breads for toasting, with fruits on the other side. other buffet table, juices and smoothies and other danishes, smallish fancy donuts and croissants. Enjoyed this stay thoroughly and will use again. Recommend for a stay in Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_478719193~“Wonderful weekend”~The Hyatt in Sydney is a lovely modern hotel overlooking Darling Harbour. The Hyatt Club is well worth it with great breakfasts and drinks/snacks throughout the day. The bar on the top floor is open air, classy, and has brilliant views - great place for a cocktail in the evening before heading off for dinner. The location means you can take a sunny stroll around Darling Harbour in the morning, go to the excellent Sydney shopping only five minutes walk away (including the iconic QVB), or wander along the waterfront to the new restaurants and cafes that have sprung up in Bangaroo (?). Get a corner suite and leave the blinds open for a sparkling vista as you go to bed and a glorious sunny morning to wake up to.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476664001~“Okay Stay”~Stayed 5 nights at the start of April. Had a harbour view room at the end of the hall so I think it is in the new part. The hotel room was very small. I kept tripping over the legs of the luggage stand that was in the way when you got out of bed t go to the bathroom. The other case was put on the top of the bar area as there was nowhere else to put the case. Bathroom was reasonable although there was only 2 towels. As a female with long hair I use 2 towels and that leaves my husband using a wet towel. The shower was very hot but there was not much water pressure. I didn't like the shower as it didn't have a door and it was quite cold once the water was turned off. The soap supplied smelt lovely but the conditioner didn't leave my hair nice and soft. It just felt like it had been shampooed. One ting I did find difficult was the flush buttons to the toilet were behind the seat and very low down. It was really difficult to press them. If someone was old and a little bit feeble they might have trouble pressing it. The view from the room was great. Room service was prompt and there was no ridiculous extra charges for someone to walk 2 minutes down the hall and deliver it to me at 10 pm at night. Staff on check in were very friendly as too were the housekeeping staff. Every time we saw them in the hallway they said hello and wished you a good day. We asked desk staff for a couple of directions to various events and we were given the wrong directions. We were told to catch a train to one event that doesn't have a train station anywhere near it.  All in all the stay was ok but I wouldn't say it is a 5 star hotel. Would I go back? Possibly if the price is right but I wouldn't run back there due to the fabulous room. Best thing is the location. Above us must of been a bar or restaurant as at 3 am to 4 am we could hear furniture being moved across the floor then at approx. midnight another night I could hear it again.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_476051103~“Comfortable stay”~Hyatt was a great hotel to stay for 3 nights for business. Rooms were clean, the bed was big and comfortable to sleep in. Not close to many restaurants, buffet breakfast downstairs is awesome but is pricey. In peak periods I would definitely recommend checking the prices for Hyatt because they were actually cheaper than the Novotel & Ibis which are directly across the water from this hotel. Has a great roof top bar upstairs, make sure you get a room not close to this bar as it can get very noisy as patrons leave the bar.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474504125~“Not as good as it used to be”~Stayed here previously when it was the Four Points and it has been renovated but the rooms haven't changed much, except the restaurant wasn't as good. Flushing the toilet is still difficult without dropping the lid, walls are still thin and you can still hear people talking in the corridor. We were fortunate to get an upgrade to a harbour view room which is better than the view of a multi story carpark. The king beds are extremely comfortable and give a good nights sleep.  Dont think it is as good as it was previously so will probably look elsewhere in Sydney next time. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474449203~“Work Stop Over”~Work had recently held a function in Sydney, itinerary came through that we were staying at Hyatt Regency, thought this will be fancy, unfortunately I was underwhelmed. The entrance was via a coach drop off in the bellows of the underground, which was not their fault but not a nice entry, check in was very swift although as booked as a group could not claim my Hyatt Points. Room was ok, small & basic though, not a very pleasant city view. Worst was still to come as needed to share with a co-worker so single beds which were hard. Breakfast & lunch were fantastic & all the staff were very helpful & pleasant, which probably made the stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan

review_474378275~“Nice hotel in a good location, but some disappointing elements”~We stayed at the Hyatt Regency as it is close to the Sydney Convention Centre in Darling Harbour. Its location and outlook are great. We had a spacious, comfortable room overlooking Darling Harbour. We were disappointed with a number of basic elements, however. We couldn't manage to maintain a comfortable room temperature as despite altering the thermostat, the room remained cold. We awoke early on the Sunday morning (as we were to attend the 3rd day of our conference) to find that the shower was cold for both of us. When we mentioned this at reception, the response was that they had problems that morning. We notice other reviews have mentioned similar problems and we consider hotels of this calibre ought to readily solve these types of inconveniences.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474357888~“Give this place a big Miss”~From the time I arrived I knew I was in for a new Ozzie slack experience. It was an effort for them to help with my bags - Check in was plain rude and then the room was 4 miles from the lift. The dinner was like going to a disco as the music was crazy loud. Then the roof top bar - more attitude from the bar staff. It was an effort to do anything ! We had an evening drink down in the lobby bar and they ran out of a particular spirit after 1 drink . So we all left and walked up the street . Next night still no replacement mmmmm???? Only to be told by the barman that he only goes to the cellar Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays ???? So 5 of us got up and left. Then to top it off we arranged and paid 400 bucks for an early check in and upon arrival it wasn't ready and had to wait .

review_474287851~“Review”~Stay was good. I was only there for 4 hours to sleep. It's a very big place and suited the purpose I was there for. Staff were pleasant. I find the staff could be a little bit more informed to what's going on as I was there to attend an event and were unsure when asked a question~3~4~4~5~4~4~3~nan

review_474149227~“All about the location”~The hotel is all about the location. The location just steps from the Darling harborside is amazing. The hotel is newly re branded from Four Points from Sheraton, but the service has not 'upgraded' likewise. It's totally worth the money to upgrade to a harbor view room. The sunset views on the Darling harbor side are worth the extra bucks. The restaurants and the new rooftop bar are good, but the service doesnt justify the high $$$$. The rooftop bar is again, all about the view. My room was on the old block and felt a little underwhelming. Overall, its all about the location and the views..~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_474462293~“An amazing stay in a reat hotel”~The room was modern and clean. Bathroom was clean as well but with not good pressure.

review_473966097~“Underwhelming.....”~It was a lackluster stay with long queues to check in and check out (both times the staff needed help from the manager) and the room while it had a great view was very small. The whole stay left me with a feeling of being "blah" - just not a personal service. I stayed at the Hilton Sydney years ago and it was just so personable, professional and friendly so would recommend the Hilton over the Hyatt.  Also make sure you check your credit card - I was charged for Mini Bar items that I had never used. I was really annoyed they never advised me and just automatically charged me, they fixed it up quickly which was a positive - still a hassle I didn't need!~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan

review_473575381~“Good hotel”~I stayed in the Tower room which has been upgraded. The room was new and very comfortable. Great view of darling harbour as well. The bathroom, while, modern is quite small, but functional. Room size is adequate but only good for one or two persons.

review_473321775~“Terrible service in disappointing hotel.”~Our experience at this hotel went from bad to extremely poor, mostly due to the lazy, uncaring and rude staff of the hotel. On arrival from interstate on a Monday at 11am, we were told we could not check in until 3pm.We approached concierge for a map and dire tons to somewhere nearby to shop and have some lunch. He threw a map at us while muttering and promptly walked off. After asking guests for directions we left the hotel and returned at 3:15. Only to be rudely told by reception that "We could not check in until after 3. This was only the beginning. As we were here for a business function in the hotel, a number of us had clearly marked bags delivered to wrong rooms, and once again, no apologies although there appeared to be staff standing blankly around the hotel foyer as if they were waiting for someone else to do their jobs. Not good enough. The rooms were grimy and city views meant looking onto a multi storey carport with lights shining throughout the night. For a city that usually excites, This hotel lets Sydney down and we would never return here.~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~1~nan
review_478983725~“Special weekend away!!”~Fantastic location overlooking beautiful Darling Harbour with amazing views!! Great restaurant with exceptional service which made us feel special!

review_432871978~“Worth every penny - a luxurious stay”~Service - very welcoming and professional. Hotel is spotless. Bar is appealing and looks very relaxing. King, Standard room with view across Darling Harbour just ideal. Air con a little noisy but not to the extreme but air was pleasant to sleep in, can be adjusted. Bed very comfortable, great night sleep. TV easy to use. If light sleeper use ear plugs. no paper to write on but pen, not drastic to have but would be ideal. Tissues in bathroom. nice touch was a toothbrush with toothpaste for each person and other toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and bath gel. Ironing table in cupboard which lights on when you open the door. electric kettle with various coffees and teas. small refrigerator with items to purchase. slippers in cupboard if you need them, in plastic wrapper. Bathroom was absolutely spotless. Lemon soap available to use. Shower very easy to use. mirror on wall, ideal for a woman. I found the bathroom a little dark to put makeup on but thats only because i require glasses. No welcome tourist book, tried to find information about the hotel on the office table but nothing there which i always like to read. Buffet breakfast was AMAZING. Four different areas to choose from. hot food, ie scrambled eggs, bacon well done/and not as well done, hash brown, sausage etc. other table, slices of meats, salmon, various breads for toasting, with fruits on the other side. other buffet table, juices and smoothies and other danishes, smallish fancy donuts and croissants. Enjoyed this stay thoroughly and will use again. Recommend for a stay in Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478753984~“Overnight stay”~I found the service at the Hyatt Excellent. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious and had the normal amenties needed in a hotel room. The bathroom was clean and spacious but no bath. (Not that I minded)  I would not hesitate in staying at the Hyatt again. Reasonable priced, close to all parts of the city.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_478719227~“Excellent Location and Hotel”~I was lucky enough to stay here for business. The location of this hotel is excellent, it is walking distance to some excellent restaurants and bars. You could also walk to some of the attraction like the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, although it is a good walk and not just next door. The hotel rooms are very comfortable, the bed, the pillows all good quality that ensure a good nights sleep. The staff are also very helpful, all in all a great hotel in a great location.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477253545~“Vacation prior to cruise”~We were promised an early check in after our 17 hour flight and arrival at 6:00am however we had to wait until after noon to get to our room. Guests arriving after us waited much less time. Hotel had very poor lighting in the room. Room was very clean and bathroom well stocked with needs. Location is great and within reasonable walking distance to restaurants and attractions. Food over priced. Concierge (Gary Chan) was very good to work with. Very noisy hallways~2~1~5~2~3~4~2~nan
review_476946025~“Sydney in Easter”~Average ranking among the Hyatt Regency hotels I have stayed in before. Rooms were not well clean, somecservicing was missing, particularly Concierge service which was badly needed and glaringly missing, housekeeping service was poor, toilet had no water for flushing once and when the technician came the water suddenly returned and he did not believe there was a problem. He was also very unfriendly and thought we called for help frivolously. Toiletries not well supplied. Food was good. View was good from room into Darling Harbour. Receptionists were good. Cafe was good. Gym was small and ventilation should be improved. No swimming pool though!~3~2~5~4~4~3~2~nan
review_476748872~“Hyatt Regency Sydney”~Great experience, the staff were exceptional and extremely helpful. The hotel was beautiful and is in a great location. Room lovely and had everything needed. Would recommend hotel to anyone visiting Sydney.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_476713843~“Terrible”~We were given the room next to the nightclub. As a platinum member this is unacceptable. Drunk people were overly boisterous and rowdy all night with many hitting our door as they passed by. We will reconsider our loyalty from now on.~1~1~4~1~4~4~1~nan
review_476664001~“Okay Stay”~Stayed 5 nights at the start of April. Had a harbour view room at the end of the hall so I think it is in the new part. The hotel room was very small. I kept tripping over the legs of the luggage stand that was in the way when you got out of bed t go to the bathroom. The other case was put on the top of the bar area as there was nowhere else to put the case. Bathroom was reasonable although there was only 2 towels. As a female with long hair I use 2 towels and that leaves my husband using a wet towel. The shower was very hot but there was not much water pressure. I didn't like the shower as it didn't have a door and it was quite cold once the water was turned off. The soap supplied smelt lovely but the conditioner didn't leave my hair nice and soft. It just felt like it had been shampooed. One ting I did find difficult was the flush buttons to the toilet were behind the seat and very low down. It was really difficult to press them. If someone was old and a little bit feeble they might have trouble pressing it. The view from the room was great. Room service was prompt and there was no ridiculous extra charges for someone to walk 2 minutes down the hall and deliver it to me at 10 pm at night. Staff on check in were very friendly as too were the housekeeping staff. Every time we saw them in the hallway they said hello and wished you a good day. We asked desk staff for a couple of directions to various events and we were given the wrong directions. We were told to catch a train to one event that doesn't have a train station anywhere near it.  All in all the stay was ok but I wouldn't say it is a 5 star hotel. Would I go back? Possibly if the price is right but I wouldn't run back there due to the fabulous room. Best thing is the location. Above us must of been a bar or restaurant as at 3 am to 4 am we could hear furniture being moved across the floor then at approx. midnight another night I could hear it again.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_476051103~“Comfortable stay”~Hyatt was a great hotel to stay for 3 nights for business. Rooms were clean, the bed was big and comfortable to sleep in. Not close to many restaurants, buffet breakfast downstairs is awesome but is pricey. In peak periods I would definitely recommend checking the prices for Hyatt because they were actually cheaper than the Novotel & Ibis which are directly across the water from this hotel. Has a great roof top bar upstairs, make sure you get a room not close to this bar as it can get very noisy as patrons leave the bar.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474504125~“Not as good as it used to be”~Stayed here previously when it was the Four Points and it has been renovated but the rooms haven't changed much, except the restaurant wasn't as good. Flushing the toilet is still difficult without dropping the lid, walls are still thin and you can still hear people talking in the corridor. We were fortunate to get an upgrade to a harbour view room which is better than the view of a multi story carpark. The king beds are extremely comfortable and give a good nights sleep.  Dont think it is as good as it was previously so will probably look elsewhere in Sydney next time. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474449203~“Work Stop Over”~Work had recently held a function in Sydney, itinerary came through that we were staying at Hyatt Regency, thought this will be fancy, unfortunately I was underwhelmed. The entrance was via a coach drop off in the bellows of the underground, which was not their fault but not a nice entry, check in was very swift although as booked as a group could not claim my Hyatt Points. Room was ok, small & basic though, not a very pleasant city view. Worst was still to come as needed to share with a co-worker so single beds which were hard. Breakfast & lunch were fantastic & all the staff were very helpful & pleasant, which probably made the stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_474393643~“Good but I wouldn't stay here on personal travel”~Stayed on business, this hotel is used by our company. Room was nice and clean, bed was comfortable. Location is excellent for getting to Darling Harbour. The hotel has very expensive food/drink options though including a single bottle of Peroni beer setting me back $13 whoops don't order that without looking at the menu! Overall a great stay for business but looking at the room prices I wouldn't stay here on personal travel, not a luxury hotel IMHO and average value for money.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_474380074~“A nice refurbishment”~After a long wait the refurbishment is complete. Very handy to Darling Harbour etc too. Well priced and nice facilities, with a lovely roof top bar which overlooks the harbour. Nice clean rooms, with modern decor and bathrooms.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_474378275~“Nice hotel in a good location, but some disappointing elements”~We stayed at the Hyatt Regency as it is close to the Sydney Convention Centre in Darling Harbour. Its location and outlook are great. We had a spacious, comfortable room overlooking Darling Harbour. We were disappointed with a number of basic elements, however. We couldn't manage to maintain a comfortable room temperature as despite altering the thermostat, the room remained cold. We awoke early on the Sunday morning (as we were to attend the 3rd day of our conference) to find that the shower was cold for both of us. When we mentioned this at reception, the response was that they had problems that morning. We notice other reviews have mentioned similar problems and we consider hotels of this calibre ought to readily solve these types of inconveniences.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474357888~“Give this place a big Miss”~From the time I arrived I knew I was in for a new Ozzie slack experience. It was an effort for them to help with my bags - Check in was plain rude and then the room was 4 miles from the lift. The dinner was like going to a disco as the music was crazy loud. Then the roof top bar - more attitude from the bar staff. It was an effort to do anything ! We had an evening drink down in the lobby bar and they ran out of a particular spirit after 1 drink . So we all left and walked up the street . Next night still no replacement mmmmm???? Only to be told by the barman that he only goes to the cellar Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays ???? So 5 of us got up and left. Then to top it off we arranged and paid 400 bucks for an early check in and upon arrival it wasn't ready and had to wait . Upon check out nobody cared and the front desk manager was going to get back to me . Still waiting ! The only good thing is the coffee shop next door were the staff are wonderful and helpful .
