review_475966187~“A great hotel very close to all major Sydney attractions”~My first visit and would certainly go back again. Rooms very clean, great sized bed and certainly enjoyed having the little table and chairs in the room to sit at for a snack. Room quiet very little street noise.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_446345548~“Good Choice for Sydney”~The Stellar is fairly centrally located. The rooms were very well-appointed, having a fridge, microwave, and facilities for making coffee and even cooking a meal, dishes, etc. provided. The room was comfortable, clean, and large, with a sofa to relax on, though TV reception was a bit spotty. Internet was good. We were especially impressed with the service orientation of the staff. We arrived before 11 and the lobby was quite crowded. We were greeted and someone came out from behind the counter to get us registered and into our room. So much appreciated. Staff helped us with reservations, directions, cabs, airport transportation - anything we needed. Really high marks for their service attitude.  The only issue we had was that there really wasn't much nearby in the way of decent restaurants. Still, we managed and we'd stay here again.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_473955283~“The stay was perfect”~I have no complaints at all with this hotel. We stayed for 6 days and it was very pleasant. Everything clean, nice staff and the food in the cafe was very tasty. I will honestly miss that coffee every morning. If I ever come back I will definitely stay here again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471738603~“Very comfortable bed, three star property, nice bathrooms and kitchenettes”~This is not quite a four star hotel. The kitchenete and bathroom have been renovated and were lovely. The comfort of the bed was outstanding. The hallways are depressing and the whole tone of the property will be raised if they are refreshed and made brighter. TV in my room was small. This is clearly a property that tries to please however. Older gentleman with possibly German or mid-European accent was wonderful. One annoying thing was that on the morning I left, the one and only lift was not working- 8 am! I had to carry my suitcase down the steep stair well. When I reached reception I found it was because the lift door was propped open for a delivery. At such a busy time for check out, I found this terrible.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_471503166~“Hotel Stellar Great People”~Our room was spacious and clean, the hotel has an excellent coffee shop. The staff is so friendly and very helpful. Over our 3 days we interacted with several staff, in particular front desk staff, they always helped, if they didn't know the answer they found out. All in all a good experience, I would happily come again and recommend it to a friend~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470758624~“Holiday stay”~Stayed at this hotel. On arrival place looked dated. Small take away cafe next to reception. Booking in was easy. We were early so they looked after our bags while we went for a walk. On return we went to our room which surprised me it was spotless. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it.. only criticism reception was dated. Otherwise brill~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470706683~“Good location ”~I stayed at the hotel for 5 days and I should say is a very good position to explore the city.

review_470632028~“Small hotel, with a good location.”~I was expecting a bit more from this hotel as far as the room goes. It was a good sized room, with an nice sized bathroom. There was a small kitchenette with a microwave and fridge. We were only here for two nights, so we didn't really use these amenities. The room was clean. There was quite a bit of noise from the alley outside of our room, though. (We were in room 106.) However, I will say the location was excellent for touring the city. There are numerous venues nearby, and even the Sydney Opera House, although not close, is within walking distance.  Probably the only negative to its location is that there are not a lot of restaurants open in the evening in this area. Down near Circular Quay, there are a lot more restaurants open for dinner, which is a quick cab ride away. And for breakfast, go no farther than the restaurant's Bar Stellar. Great coffee and food at a reasonable price. Overall, I was satisfied, and would stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_469506822~“Handy location and great cafe”~We stayed at the Stellar for 3 nights recently following a cruise and really enjoyed the cafe for breakfast and a morning coffee. The rooms were clean and tidy and quite modern in decor. We ordered a couple of room service dinners - the barramundi was particularly delicious. The Oxford St shops nearby offer most services for travelers. And there is a good bus service as well as a handy train station. One problem we had was at departure, when we had trouble with the EFTPOS machine would not accept several cards, which had been used recently. We ended up having to pay cash.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467994514~“Pre & Post Cruise”~Stayed here before & after our cruise from the overseas cruise terminal at Circular Quay. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Museum train station which is 2 stops from Circular Quay and 4/5 stops from the airport. It is also convenient for most parts of Central Sydney. The staff are very helpful and there is a cafe attached for breakfast/lunch. Lots of shops locally on Oxford Street too. Rooms we had were modern, roomy and had kitchenette. Nice showers. We were able to extend checkout only to 11am but they have a luggage room if needed. We would stay again if the price was right. PS they charge for your room bill on arrival!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467124744~“Sydney Visit”~We enjoyed staying at this Best Western in Sydney for the few days we were there. It is close to Hyde Park and we walked to the Harbour area and through the Botanical Garden from our hotel. An excellent Italian restaurant was close by and other fast food places were around the corner. It is also close to the train.~5~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_466408592~“Great value in central location”~We stayed in late January and booked this hotel through tripadvisor. Reviews we relied on were spot on. Central location opposite Hyde Park. Easy to walk to everything we required. Rooms were clean and bed comfortable. Even though close to main road, road noise did not keep us awake. Coffee shop attached to hotel is excellent for a cheap breakfast. Will stay again. One complaint was that the bathroom door had an automatic close hinge on it -my husband caught his foot on it when it decided to close on him.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461996116~“Not as good as some BW”~A strange set up with a small entrance lobby and a lift to landings with various apartment rooms off. There was a strange smell in our landing area. The room itself was clean and had a kitchenette and it was serviced, but it lacked character and was noisy at night as there seemed to be rubbish collections or bin activity.  At first I was disappointed with the location as it's a good walk into Sydney, and doesn't have any good eateries nearby. The area seems a little run down. It does have a metro stop within a few minutes walk and it is within 15 mins walk of the station. It's also not too far to a Hop on Hop off bus stop. Handily there is a chemist nearby and a shop that sells the metro cards.  A good café attached for breakfast which is not included and there's a limited room service menu, but nowhere to eat in the evening so bring in food or eat out before returning.  Reception staff were very helpful and pleasant. Laundry facilities on site.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_461182481~“GREAT LOCATION”~The location to the city was GREAT! The room was clean and will kept. The coffee shop was excellent and staff very friendly. The overall experience was better then expected. We would stay here again if we come back.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_459205269~“weekend break”~Room was clean and tidy. Staff helpful and polite, with the café adjoining the hotel serving good breakfasts at a reasonable price with friendly staff. Elevator is very slow and a bit a squeeze. No fancy frills, but close to lots of things.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_456996692~“Great hotel, easy access to all Sydney.”~Hotel location is great with access to train, Hyde Park, ANZAC Memorial, close to Market, downtown area, stores and markets. Affordable hotel with all features of a North American hotel. Walk to harbour, Opera House, Museums, all downtown. Too far to walk to cruise ship terminal with luggage ($13 cab ride instead). Room had good kitchenette and markets are very close. Staff are friendly and helpful.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_454638092~“Exceptional service!!”~I arrived very early from a transcontinental flight. They checked me in early , stored my luggage and even provided me with a large umbrella since it was raining heavily. When I returned early, my room was ready for me. Hotel is near the park and ANZAC memorial. About a 20 minute walk straight down College Street to the harbor. Thanks much!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454405412~“Good stay but bad service from Manager!”~Hotel was small but rooms were clean and spacious. Bad thing: They hold an AUS100 from our Visa Debit card upon check in and after 4 working days has not been refunded yet. We are now in 2017 and it seems their system is still so backdated. They have not contacted our bank to release the hold until we phoned them. The manager who I spoke to was so rude that he even told me I cannot question things like this? And that I rang too early asking about the money, which was already 4 days after we checked out. Manager wasn't apologetic and understanding. I would have thought that the moment you check out and cleared they should send authorization to the bank straight away to release the money, but NO they didn't.  Usually when you are asked for deposits in all hotel you get back the money the moment you check out. With them their process is a bit odd. I suggest you give cash to them to save you from all these hassles.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_451936921~“Great Find!”~We chose this facility based on Trip Advisor and, once again, we were not disappointed. Once we got off at the Museum train station from the airport, it was just a short walk to the hotel. The "Best Western" part of the signage was very small so look for Hotel Stellar instead. The outside of the building is brick which has been painted dark grey so we were sceptical when entering. The lobby is very small but the staff made us feel very welcomed when we arrived. The elevator is small and slow but the rooms make up for these little deficiencies. The room was bright, airy and well appointed. The shower has great pressure, linens are good and the toiletries are very nice. The hotel is central to most of the tourist attractions and right next to the beautiful Hyde Park. Try this place. It's great!~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_451622101~“Surprising space”~We selected this hotel for its good reviews, location and for its very competitive price in early January during the Sydney Festival. We were given a double room on the first level. It was light and airy, spacious, with high ceilings and efficient air-con, which was necessary given the heat-wave conditions outside. Double-glazing kept all but the most raucous sirens at bay so the room was surprisingly quiet. The bed was very comfortable and we slept like tops. The bathroom was small but efficient. The shower was wonderful: great pressure, easy to adjust temperature. Non-perfumed toiletries and thick towels -- excellent. Breakfasted in the little coffee shop/ cafe. Good choices, very acceptable coffee and good people-watching as it's also used by local workers. The whole place is definitely quirky and some things like the minute foyer area could irritate some but the staff make up for any small short-comings, indeed they fix them, pronto. They are, without exception, excellent. Helpful, efficient, and personable. Especially commend Michael, who took multi-tasking to a new level and actively worked towards making us even happier customers. Close to Museum Station, so a quick direct trip to/ from the airport and Circular Quay and on buses to Bondi and across town to various suburban restaurants and points of interest. Our new favorite place to stay in Sydney, I think!~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_450654649~“Comfortable and Convenient ”~I had an enjoyable stay here. The location is very good: it's just around the corner from the Oxford St nightlife (the gay strip) and also an easy walk to all kinds of other places in the central city. The room was stylish, with air con, flat screen TV, unlimited wireless and other much appreciated creature comforts. Staff were friendly and were happy to store luggage on check out day too. There's a hotel bar/cafe downstairs but I didn't get time to check that out. Convenience store is just a couple of doors down. Only a couple of minuses: fairly noticeable drainage noises under my bathroom floor coming from next door (think the bathroom pipes are joined so when the neighbour used water I could hear it) After initially thinking 'what the hell?' I mostly tuned it out. Also, there's only one elevator. It's slow to arrive then waits a painfully long time once it stops on a floor before the door opens. These things weren't majors for me: it is an old building after all -you can see that from the exterior - but the rooms have been very nicely modernised. I think you'll find the interior a pleasant surprise, so I do recommend it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_450104782~“Nice property, friendly staff”~Stayed at the hotel for three nights. This was part of a group tour. We found the rooms spacious and well appointed. We were very comfortable for the time we were here. The bathrooms were lovely.  We did find the Internet service a bit quirky. Even paying the premium for the 10 Mb Internet service was unpredictable. The elevator security key was spotty. Included breakfast was good, but unremarkable. Television service was also spotty. A number of channels were only partially in focus. As we were over the Christmas holidays number of the restaurants in amenities were closed for the season. Proximity to the opera house was between AU$12 and AU$20 cab ride. You could walk it in about 20 to 30 minutes as it was only about a 1.5 miles. There are some lovely parks to walk through, if you are into that sort of thing. A number of attractions are within walking distance. There's a small convenient grocery store across the street.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448907886~“Very friendly hotel”~Stayed here for 9 nights at the start of our visit to Australia. We arrived at 7.30am not expecting to get into room until the afternoon, but lady on reception greeted us and told us they would get room ready in 2 hours which was great. They took our luggage & we went for a walk. The room was large with plenty of drawers etc. it had a fridge, microwave, kettle and toasted sandwich maker. Tea/coffee provided but maids kept forgetting to leave more milk sachets, so had to go to reception to get some.Had biscuit on first day only. We found the bed very hard and room was noisy from traffic outside. Towels left on floor in bathroom were often taken but not replaced, despite sign telling you to do this.Downstairs there is a cafe where you can get a good breakfast if required, it is busy because local office workers use it. Bar has happy hour where drinks are 1/2 price and normal prices are good.Reception staff are very efficient and friendly. Situated right by Hyde Park and It is only up to a 30 minute walk to any of the main sights in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~5~nan
review_448190218~“New year stay”~We stayed here over new year mainly because of the price / location we were able to easily walk to the fireworks and back afterwards. The hotel is small however the rooms are perfectly functional for what we needed. It was clean and comfortable for a couple of nights. The shower is not exactly powerful and the air con blows out over one side of the bed. However it is a good location to everything we needed and to the station which took us back to the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445445771~“Great Option”~This hotel is very centrally located by Hyde Park and at the foot of Oxford St. It is just a minute walk from Museum Station which has direct trains from the airport. The reception is small and there is a busy café behind open to the public, but the rooms are large, clean and well equipped, mine had 2 double beds. Staff are very friendly. Breakfast is not included but there are many options closeby. For those wanting to visit the harbour it is a very pleasant 30-40 min walk through the park and via the botanic gardens. For anybody interested in exploring the gay scene the bar area is a 5 to 10 minute walk away.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444925215~“Enjoyed our stay ”~We recently stayed in the hotel for a week. We were happy with our room which was a spacious King studio room. It was a corner room with a large bathroom and kitchenette. Being on a corner we enjoyed a partial view looking down the street to Hyde Park. The room was very bright with about 3 large windows and full block out curtains. The bed was firm but comfortable and a very large King. The bathroom was very big with a very big shower enclosure. The water pressure was brilliant too. The towels were changed daily and were large and fluffy. The linen was changed after three nights and the room and bathroom cleaned . Plenty of drawer and cupboard space for a week or more stays. The location was good as close to museum staton and bus stops. The IGA was just around the corner as was a pharmacy. The kitchenette only had a microwave and sink and small fridge but sufficient for making our breakfast etc. great coffee shop in the building next door. Can't recall the name but in the large office block right on the corner. Never had any reason to talk to reception but check in was ok. We would stay here again whilst in Sydney as we thought it was good value .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443957721~“Weekend break”~Arrived at 8 am to drop of luggage. Retuned after 1 pm as instructed had to wait 24 mins as the receptionist was also the porter,car valet, an looked after the reception.not a great start the room was large v clean an comfortable but noisy as we could here the neighbors an traffic from the road. Coffee shop is v good for breakfast good coffee. It's also a good location not far from anywhere. Well priced. But to top it all off when we arrived we asked Pavol who was the receptionist had a car company contacted the hotel to take us to the airport in a few days as arranged by our travel agent, he replied no. So we arranged through our travel agent to have a car ready, great no problem. On the day of our departure we had to vacate the room by 10 am ( a bit early I thought )we did as we were asked an went on a trip around Sydney so much to see. We arrived back at the hotel with time to spare so we could have a wash an change of cloths. We could not wait in reception as clients were coming and going an there was not much space so we waited on the bar next to reception. 1/2 hour before the car was to arrive I asked Pavol for a key to the changing room so we could wash as requested, Pavol very kindly gave me a key to my surprise there was no soap,towel,or even toilet paper in the changing room. Michal very kindly got our luggage an we were ready to leave. All of a sudden Pavol said to my surprise oh you are here I just told the car company that you weren't here. Their was no way we could contact the company as it was booked in the U.K. An the office was now closed. So here we are ready to leave but the car has not arrived thanks to Pavol. When I mentioned this to him he told me it was my fault for not waiting by the desk ( he gave me the keys to the changing room 10 mins earlier naughty me. He was quite abrupt an almost rude. I told him to call a taxi an the hotel should pay as the car had already been paid for. After 10 mins of arguing I told him get me the manager. We spoke an as a act of good faith, after negotiation he agreed for me to pay for the taxi a send him the bill which he has paid. All this could have been avoided ( stress) had Pavol been competent. I'm sorry to say in my opinion he isn't . I would never return to the hotel it left a bitter taste. In my memory of the stay there.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Oxford Street is around the corner, the metro is about 2 blocks away, Hyde Park across the intersection and it's an easy walk to the museums, opera house and Darling Harbor. I stayed in a single room, very large with kitchenette and all were very clean. There was lots of room in the bath also. The hotel has on-site laundry and it's inexpensive. There is also an attached restaurant serving great coffees and breakfast. And I must give a shout to the incredible staff who were very helpful with tours and directions.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

The rooms are clean and comfortable. I had a twin room and the aircon was blowing directly at one of the beds. Luckily the 2 beds are queen size and I was able to sleep on the other side away from the aircon. Other than that, I was quite happy with the hotel.

review_439816585~“Post Party Sleep”~It was an eventful evening. My body sore from the twisting and turning of the dance floor. Legs in pain and agony, ready to collapse at any moment.  All this anguish was relieved by the softness of their sheets matched by the cushion of the bed. The pillows as they reached out and cupped my head reassuringly "it's okay mate, I've got you". The following morning, the towels jumped at me, screaming "HEY WE'RE SOFT TOO" and right they were. As I gently fondled the towel around me, my hands confused, only with the use of my eyes was I certain I didn't use the clouds of delight to dry myself. Only in the evenings preparation, was parking a little difficulty.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_435487827~“BEST WESTERN PLUS Hotel Stellar”~The first hotel we stayed at in Sydney, a little disappointed at first I think because we'd just stayed at at 5 star in UAE. After the first impression we realised it wasn't so bad after all large rooms, big bathroom and decent size kitchen area and very clean. The staff were all friendly and helpfu. The location is excellent, the bus stop is 200 yards away and central rallway station is 5 minutes walk. You can have a lovely walk through Hyde Park down to Circular Quays or Darling harbour takes about 15-20 mins. Some nice bars and restaurants close by although Sydney is quite expensive now with the exchange rate~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_434813181~“Convenient, affordable hotel with friendly staff!”~While staying in Sydney for four nights at the beginning of our trip in Australia, we were looking for an affordable hotel room with a convenient location. The Hotel Stellar fit exactly what we needed! We arrived from our international flight very early on Sunday morning and after being admitted through customs, boarded the train to get to Central Sydney. The line goes right from the airport terminal to the Museum station, which is just a few minutes walk to the hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an extremely helpful and pleasant front desk staff member. Although check-in was not until later in the day, the clerk stored our luggage and offered to call or email if our room was ready earlier than expected. The clerk also provided us a map of Sydney and helped to get us oriented and provided fantastic suggestions of how to spend the next few hours. We ended up taking the Sydney Explorer tour bus and grabbing lunch, at which point we received an email that our room was ready (around noon). This was so nice because at this point we were quite tired and in need of a refresh. We were very happy with the rest of our stay. The train line from Museum station was very helpful to get around the city, but mostly we walked everywhere. The Opera House and Circular Quay were only a 20 minute walk away, as were most of our dinners. Even though our room was on the first floor, next to the elevator and facing the street, it was very quiet and we were able to get a good night's rest almost every night. Having the coffee shop right next door and connected to the lobby was also quite nice. We ate breakfast there two times during our stay and the food was delicious.  My only warning is that as these rooms are suites with small kitchenettes where people can cook, the smoke alarms are an issue. There are signs in every room about procedures that occur when the smoke alarm goes off, so it must happen fairly often. Unfortunately, on our last night everyone had to evacuate the building around midnight due to the smoke alarms (burnt toast, I believe). In fact, the Sydney fire department came out and had to inspect before we were allowed back in. This did not result in a good night's sleep, so if this is of a concern to you, you may want to pick a different hotel without kitchenettes.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

The room is clean and quite big for 2-3 people, newly renovated with small kitchenette, which we found very convenient. The best part is all staff in the hotel have been very helpful since the time we checked in, especially Joval - thanks a lot!

Only thing I would say might need a bit of bleach it bathrooms to get some l mould off in shower but other than that very clean. receptionist was happy to help in anyway were happy to print of some paperwork for me with no charge .

review_428270322~“A SIlk Purse Inside A Sow's Ear: A Stellar Performance”~Let's get things in perspective first ... appearances can be deceiving. On first glance from the outside this 19th Century hotel painted completely in dark olive green seemed to confirm my worst fears, that the 8.6 rating on Trip Advisor was totally wrong, and I was spending the weekend in a run down over-priced dive. Stepping into the foyer changed that and the room itself removed all concerns. First recommendation to owners: REPAINT the outside! This is a very successful recent renovation of a old hotel into a modern property with kitchen facilities enabling you to do some basic food preparation if necessary, excellent bathroom and a comfortable bed in a well-presented room. Very clean room with everything you require including overhead heating lamps in the bathroom. Shower had quickly presented hot water with great pressure (fantastic after a long flight needing a refresher shower). Only negative on the layout of the room was that the cupboard and drawers for clothes was right near the door as far as possible from the bed. Located within several hundred metres of Museum Station on the direct rail line from the airport that runs into central Sydney it is convenient and in easy distance of downtown. Room rates were excellent compared to its nearby big name competitors and, having stayed in many hotels over the past few years in Sydney, overshadows many of them. Wifi was free and reliable. A refreshing change from many other hotels I've stayed in and this alone recommends the Stellar.  I would recommend to Management, though, that charging $4.50 each for the bottles of water in the room is a rip-off and unnecessary. There's a reasonable coffee lounge on the ground floor. The lift reminders you of the age of the hotel (its movement is hardly perceptible and gives you all the time in the world to reflect upon life in general and how to solve humanity's problems). All rooms on each floor front a small central lobby (once again an old time feature) and movements in and out of other rooms easily heard. I had a road fronting room so traffic noise and rowdy behaviour of people on the street below intruded particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. However, the hotel is located in one of Sydney's prime nightlife areas so the convenience of location to access the nightlife has to be accepted. Generally it wasn't that intrusive. This hotel was a surprise package and definitely worth recommending. BE WARNED: If you are a Best Western Rewards member and book this property through an online app such as Trip Advisor you will NOT receive points. This is not mentioned when you book online which I believe Best Western should clearly point out.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_427746972~“Great Location, Good value”~when booking in the dark you are never sure as what you are going to get and with this hotel we were pleasantly surprised. Yes it did not have all the bells and whistles but it had everything we wanted and proved to be excellent value for money, especially when compared to other options presented at time of booking. Check in staff were most helpful, informative and pleasant. The room was quite big, especially when compared with other hotel rooms we have stayed in and importantly the bathroom was a decent size with a good sized shower. Bed was comfortable and the café in the building provided a damn good breakfast and some of the better coffees we have had in Australia. Best of all was the location, we could walk to everything we wanted and if we needed to go further the train station was just so close that getting around Sydney from here was a breeze. Would stay again if we return~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_427074299~“A reasonable compromise.”~Great location in the city. 300 meters (0.2 miles) walk from Museum station train. Easy access from Sydney airport by train (5 stops). Close to city center (less than a 800 meters walk, 0.5 mile). Close access to buses going to Bondi Beach. Cold service from front desk even if they smile. Arrival time to Sydney airport may happen at dawn and one has no place to go following the hectic flight. Even if there are cleaned rooms available before check in time, they do not try to accommodate. Unlike our B.W. Helsinki (Finland) excellent experience, this hotel staff members do not go out of their way to assist you, guests are not the focal point. Very slow elevator. Lobby is tiny. Floor corridor is compact and barely lit. Shower was spacious, hot water during most of the day. US power receptacle in bathroom. Lighting options were fine.  Coffee maker in the room. House keeping staff don't clean the cups. Some make a perfect sheet replacement, some don't. Adjacent coffee bar offers breakfast for a fee. Good service in the coffee shop.  In Australia one should not expect to receive a check (bill) at the end, one has to pay at the cashier. They do not do tips, sales tax is included in the price. Free WiFi.  Upon check in, your credit card is charged for a significant amount of incidentals, however the good thing is that it remains at a "pending" status, and when no actual charge is followed, the pending charge is automatically removed after 7 days. If you are new to Sydney, we recommend to consider the Free Walking Tour from Town Hall at 2:30 PM (one is expected to tip at the end).~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_426125236~“Not what we expected”~We were expecting a much more modern Hotel, but it was still very good. We chose the location to be central to Darling Harbour, China Town and Sydney Opera House which it was but a little too far to walk.~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_423892976~“Excellent Hotel”~Great hotel. Nice, big, clean rooms. Shower was bigger and better than mine at home. Kitchenette was very useful, and there is a grocery store just down the street. Staff was exceptionally helpful and kind. Location is within a block of train station and bus stops for connections to anywhere in the city. You can also walk to most downtown and Harbor attractions from here. We had a great stay!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_423726100~“Nice & centrally located”~The Hotel Stellar provides quality accommodations in a central location. The price is right, and the staff is friendly.

review_423723672~“Wonderful property in Sydney's CBD”~We spent five nights at the Stellar Hotel. The hotel is ideally situated for exploring Sydney’s CBD. It’s located on Wentworth Street just below Oxford Street - almost opposite Hyde Park. We used a hotel shuttle service (AirBus) to reach the hotel from Sydney Airport. It provided door-to-door service. Once at Hotel Stellar, we were able to walk to all the key sites including the Opera House. From Circular Quay (near the Opera House), you can easily catch a ferry to other parts of Sydney. Near the hotel are the St. James and Town Hall metros which can also take you to other parts of the city.  The hotel is also located very close to Romeo’s IGA (on Oxford Street) – a 5 minute walk at most. Romeo’s carries just about anything you’ll need on its two-levels. The produce is top notch. Then, there’s a BWS Liquor Store just beyond the intersection of Wentworth & Oxford (you can’t miss it). The guys who worked there really know their Australian wines. Look for some of their specials. So, once again, an ideal setting! The hotel itself is in a stand-alone building with newly refurbished apartments. We enjoyed a studio apartment that was brightly lit and included a queen bed, a table and two chairs as well as a desk with a chair. The kitchenette featured a mini-bar, microwave oven, water boiler and a panini press. It had all cutlery and glasses but no cooking dishes or pots. However, it worked well enough for us to enjoy salads and to make a few dishes using the microwave. Coffee/tea and milk are replenished daily and there is daily room service. Staff members at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. We enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend the Hotel Stellar to others! We hope to rebook at Hotel Stellar when we return to Sydney.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_421967135~“Nice quiet hotel ”~Stayed in the Wentworth King Studio. The room has a kitchenette. Room is quite comfortable. Worth the price. Although it's located in a quiet area, it's no problem walking around and getting to the shopping areas.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421596589~“Great Little Hotel”~I loved the Best Western Stellar in Sydney! It is close to everything...train stations, buses, stores, restaurants, pharmacies...It is not fancy at all, but the staff was very friendly and gave us some great tips on things to do. We stayed there after a cruise and they even stored our luggage for us because we got there before check-in time. I would definitely stay there again!~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_421346285~“Great value”~Don't let the ugly building put you off. The location is great close to many things, 2 blocks to the train (Museum station), near busses to everywhere. Rooms are spacious with the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in, The kitchenette is very convenient. Shower is spacious and has great water pressure. Wish there was more storage space around the sink. Nice coffee shop in lobby. Friendly and helpful front desk. A real bargain in high priced Sydney,~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_420347559~“Old hotel, average value”~We just stayed in the hotel for 1 night. The hotel was old and the room was a little bit cold. I think you would be able to find other hotel of better value than this. I booked a room with 2 queen beds that fits 4 people through Hotels.com. When we arrived there, they said my booking was only for 2 people, and made me pay additional 80 AUD for additional 2 people. I've never heard of that in the States, especially the room specifically said it fits 4 people. Anyways, I stayed in Radisson for another 4 nights in Sydney which was much more satisfying, better service, better location, and for similar price range.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~2~nan
review_420027150~“Good stay in Sydney”~Very good stay in Sydney. Friendly staff (provide the nearby interested places and map, ideal location, close to Hyde Park, walking distance to Chinatown, Central Station, Darling Harbour, etc....Room cleanliness can be improved. Provide guest laundry, but a bit pricey ($4 for wash & $4 for dry).~4~4~5~5~5~3~4~nan
review_418968650~“Nice but noisy”~Hotel is nice in that the rooms are quite large, comfortable beds, nice staff, and good on-site cafe, as well as a great location. However we were on the second floor facing the street and it was very noisy. We only were there a few days so we put up with it, but I'd highly recommend requesting a quieter room.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_411752050~“Great location, helpful staff”~Initial impression: older, smaller and exterior is a grim colored dark gray. Lift is very slow, but there's only 6 floors. Coming from a newer, larger hotel in Melbourne (Citadines on Bourke) it was not the "wow" experience. Room was nice sized with kitchenette, but sadly no sofa though it had a small dining table.  However, location on corner of Hyde Park can't be beat. Grocery store next door and another close to intersection with Oxford. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Staff was helpful, friendly.  Very surprisingly, the dinner room service was both delicious and affordable. The lamb curry was spectacular! Breakfast at the hotel cafe was also wonderful, beats having to walk to breakfast nearby that appeared fancy / trendy.  Would return again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_409722686~“Hotel Stellar was GREAT”~What a fantastic hotel - well situated; staff on the front desk really happy to help you get to the closest supermarket, bus stop etc; and really comfortable beds. Mini kitchen was so handy as we were travelling with kids, and the microwave plus sandwich press were perfect. You could also borrow a hotplate from reception (if available) but we didn't worry about that. Really appreciated the two laundry rooms for guests to use ($4 per wash or dryer cycle, washing powder available from reception for $2). Didn't eat at the café but it smelt really good. Would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Sydney. [NB - kids stay for free up to a certain age, so check the fine print on the Hotel Stellar website as this wasn't obvious on Agoda etc]~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_404189088~“Great Location Close to Hyde Park”~We stayed at this hotel in March this year for four nights. coming in by taxi from the airport took about 25 minutes and the cost was reasonable. Though not a modern hotel we were very comfortable , our kitchen dinning area was adequate and it allowed us to breakfast and have snack meals in the room.

review_398841085~“Stay away from this hotel”~My wife was certified not fit to travel by our Gynae (shes 5 month pregnant). Stellar refused to give us refund initially, and in the end offered 50%.  Compassion goes a long way in the hospitality industry. Greed never helps. Forget about terms and conditions or cancellation policies. Ur dealing with someone with difficult pregnancy now who had no choice but to cancel the trip. Our airline was very gracious, giving us the refund immediately upon us furnishing medical cert. I would strongly advise anyone who wants to book with them to go elsewhere. They don't give a hoot about customers. Compassion, care, and going the extra Mile ain't in their dictionary. Is that the kind of hotel you want to stay in?~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_393407095~“Good place to stay”~My wife daughter and I stayed here for 7 nights in late June early July on a family holiday. We quite liked the room we had which was the Hyde Park King Studio room which had a view of Hyde Park . It was quite comfortable and quiet. The double glazed windows reduced the traffic noise quite a lot. It's very close to everything so that was great for sightseeing and just generally getting around. Having a kitchenette allowed us the flexibility to eat in if we chose so that was great. We'd stay here again.~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan~nan

If I ever return to Sydney I would definitely return to this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386911909~“Fantastic”~We just finished a three night stay in the three bedroom apartment. There were four adults and three children. The apartment was very clean and immaculate and very spacious for everyone. The hotel was booked out but not once did i hear anyone from another room or see anyone hardly at all. This place is worth the money and so close to everything if you don't mind walking, there is a bus stop around the corner on Oxford street that takes you to circular Quay. The staff were very helpful and also let us check in earlier than the usual 2pm check in time and also they stored our bags for the day on checking out. Would definitely recommend this place especially for a large group or anyone staying for a few days or more.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386898674~“Excellent small hotel”~Recently stayed for 2 nights whilst in Sydney on business. Great small 'european' style hotel, lovely presented room, good size bathroom with excellent towels. Comfortable bed. Helpful front-of-house staff. Whilst no mini-bar in room you can order from a range of options. Great location close to city and inner city restaurants and cafes. Would stay at this hotel for a short break not just only business. Will do again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_386109098~“Great choice”~Don't be fooled by the outside which doesn't look great, the rooms are large and the showers great. The reception area was having work done when I was there but they kept disruption to a minimum. Hotel is in a good location with museum metro close by (though no lift) Central metro approx. 10-15 minutes away.

review_380098655~“Good Place close to CBD”~Stayed twice in May. Right at Hyde Park. Great museum near by. Don't use the train from the airport to the Museum station with luggage-NO ELEVATOR AT THE STATION AND 3 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO GO UP.  The hotel rooms are clean but smaller than USA rooms, still good though. The new front lobby was being opened when we left. Food market (IGA) near by, quicky market next door. Back side rooms on alley will get the trash man dumping barrels on Wed mornings at 6AM. Keeping bathroom door closed cuts down on noise considerably. Downtown location with some city noise but only objectionable if you live out in the boonies where its quiet as a graveyard. Actually, considering the other hotel prices in the area this is a great place to stay. Go to Bill and Toni's Italian restaurant 2 blocks north and 2 east for great food at real good prices. Try the Oso Bucco. Get there early (opens 6:30PM) as it sells out every night. Most other restaurants in the area are good but pricey.  Hop on/ Hop off bus tour around Sydney works out great with the map they give you. Take all day and enjoy the city tour.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_379482473~“Excellent Hotel (Spacious Rooms), Staff, Amenities & Near Many Sydney Attractions/Sites!!”~My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel, for 2 weeks, in May 2016. This was our first visit to Australia. May is considered autumn, in Sydney, but the weather was perfect (75 to 80 degrees during the day and around 50 to 55 degrees in the evening). I discovered the hotel when I did extensive searches to locate those near downtown Sydney which were very nice and reasonably priced. The Best Western PLUS Hotel Stellar provided this and was a wonderful choice!! The hotel is located in a much quieter area versus being in the middle of downtown where it’s much busier with traffic, people, etc. The scenic Hyde Park is right across the street from the Hotel Stellar. The hotel is conveniently located near/walking distance to many downtown Sydney attractions, restaurants (with reasonably priced & delicious lunch options in particular), grocery stores, currency exchange companies and public transportation (buses and subway). There are only around 5 or 6 rooms, on each floor, which is great because it was super quiet. We requested a room on one of the top floors to further decrease noise and the accommodating assistant manager (TOBY) informed us the windows are double pane which helps a lot with noise reduction from outside traffic, etc. There are no vendor machines or ice machines which further eliminated noise. There is only one elevator but it's quiet and since there are so few rooms, the elevator was never held up long. The door leading to the stairway was also super quiet (we were in a room next to it). The room was so spacious with tall ceilings (which is a plus). We had a room with one large comfortable bed, nice size comfortable sofa & full kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, waffle iron, sink, glasses, cups/saucers, dishes, coffee press, coffee pot, utensils, decent cabinet, drawers & counter top space and a nice selection of teas, coffees and biscuit cookies inside a wooden box. Liquid dish cleaner and kitchen towels (for cleaning and for drying dishes) were in the cabinet underneath the sink. The kitchenette was modern with stainless steel appliances. There is a kitchen table with chairs to dine at. There is also a separate work desk & chair if guests need to use their laptop, etc. The room decor (colors of the bed headboard, bed linens, curtains/drapes, sofa & pillows, wall portraits) were superb!! The iron was the very best one I have ever used at any hotel. The closet had space for hanging clothes plus extra blankets, pillows & linens for convenience if guests needed them. There was ample lighting in the room with various options to choose from. There are plenty of plugs, as well (remember to bring your own converter to plug in for use with electrical items from the U.S.). The heater/air conditioner unit has a remote control for use when changing the room temperature and the small, quiet & effective unit is located in the ceiling where sofa and TV were. The flat screen TV was large size and had a clear picture. Their satellite offered a good selection of channels to select from. There is a separate box in the room, by the TV, if guests want to request pay- per-view movies. The TV is placed on a long dresser drawer which was very nice and had extra space for clothes, etc. The hotel hairdryer is also in one of the dresser drawers for guest use. There is a radio in the room however, there were only a couple of stations which had good reception. The radio later started making a loud beeping noise though we pressed several buttons to stop it. We then simply gently pulled the connector cord from the back of the radio to disconnect it and connected it back before we checked out of our room our final day. You are better off listening to music via the internet (the hotel offers free internet) or via your own downloads, etc. The bathroom was modern and a decent size in terms of the shower, etc. The bathroom door is a little heavy but the bathroom is quieter when other guests are using it because the door is a little heavy. When my boyfriend was using his electric shaver, I hardly heard anything with the bathroom door closed. The hotel soap, shampoo, conditioners& body cream were great quality and smelled pleasant and the towels were soft and thick enough. There are 2 floors which have clothes washers & dryers. This is a major plus because guests do not have go outside the hotel to locate laundromats. The machines only take Australian coin and the front desk can exchange Australian dollar bills for coin. My boyfriend went to a Western Union very close by to exchange U.S. dollars for Australian money in order to use the washer & dryer. I think the cost was something like $4.00 to wash then another $4.00 to dry. I believe clothes detergent and fabric softener can also be purchased via the hotel (we brought our own Tide Pods from home to use instead). We arrived very early in the morning and our room was not ready yet for check in. However, the assistant manager (TOBY) graciously offered to hold our luggage in a secure area and showed us where the lounge was where we could relax on the sofas and chairs and watch TV while we waited. This was great because we endured an extra-long flight (20 hours) before arriving. At around 10:00 am, Toby informed us our room was ready and we were glad to check in this early to get some rest & relaxation. There is a desktop printer in the lounge for guest use and a small fee to use the printer (Front Desk has the pricing). The Front Desk Staff and Housekeeping Staff were very courteous & accommodating and friendly. The rooms were always cleaned to perfection and if we needed any extra items, they were sent up immediately. We took a cab, from the airport, the day we arrived. The Museum subway stop is within walking distance to the hotel however, as of May 2016, there was no elevator or escalator thus, guests have to walk up many stairs with their baggage. Since we had several bags, we were glad we opted to get a cab after such a long airplane flight. When we departed, we did take the subway to the airport because we were going down the stairs, at the Museum stop, which is a lot easier than dragging your bags up the stairs. The subway fare is approximately $16.00 one way to the airport (you can pay with a major credit card) and fare cards can be purchased, via a customer service rep, at the airport subway stop or the Central Station stop which is a few blocks from the hotel. They are also at the Museum stop but only via a fare card machine and you must have your credit card ATM passcode to enter into the machine to pay for fare cards. The Front Desk can make arrangements for an Airport Super Shuttle (check the Front Desk for pricing and method of payment required) to transport guests to the airport upon their departure if they would like. The hotel has a free cold water dispenser with disposable cups near the lounge area. There is bottled water in the hotel room but there is cost if guest use that (the price is on a tag on the bottles). There is also a small restaurant with a coffee bar inside the hotel which serves breakfast. The front desk can inform you as to whether or not they serve lunch or dinner. My boyfriend said the hotel coffee bar had the most delicious coffee he drank while we were in Australia. I am extremely glad I discovered the Best Western PLUS Hotel Stellar because it added to our enjoyment of our first trip to Australia!!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_378893795~“Spacious room”~Stayed 4 nights here during my most recent trip to Sydney. I loved the location of this hotel. Lotsa cafe that is within walking distance. Room was spacious and we can open our suitcase without worrying that it'll block our way. WIFI connection was amazing too. I just realised that I got upgraded without knowing it. I booked the Queen Studio but got the Hyde Park King Studio instead.  If I have to name one thing that I'm dissatisfied with, it could be the cleanliness of the bathroom. I don't think they clean it on daily basis during our stay. Because there were hair on the floor. I think they only made our bed and changed our towels.Other than this, I have nothing to complain about. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, if I revisit Sydney in the future.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~4~nan
review_378829572~“Perfect”~Conveniently located, a block away from heavy pedestrian traffic, therefore nice and quiet. We had the Queen studio which was spacious. Both the room and the bathroom were a good size for a couple. Everything was perfect. I think there are around 6 rooms to a floor and with not much of a hallway, you can easily hear people come and go. However, there was absolutely no disturbance from the neighbours. Arrived at the hotel much earlier than the check-in time and was initially told we could leave our bags in a secure area and come back later, but a room became available and we were immediately checked in. The staff were great, responsive, and very helpful. I inquired where I might purchase a local Simm card for my phone, and I was handed a startup kit worth $2, at no charge. Nice touch. Later, I inquired about good restaurants in the area and I was given a referral card to the "Canopy" restaurant which is a 5 minute walk across the street. That was worth a 10% discount, or a free glass of wine (not advertised). The place was packed on a Friday. The coffee place near the lobby is a good place to start your day. Basic breakfast fare, very reasonably priced and the coffee was excellent. A walk to the opera house will take you around 20 minutes, 15 to darling harbour, and most places of interest are in the area. Museum station is a 5 minute walk and if you don't mind lugging your bags up a few flight of stairs, I believe you can take the train from the airport. The hotel does arrange a coach service to and from the airport so you could inquire about that when you book your stay. I think the rate is lower than if you did it yourself. This is not a resort, it is basic, functional, clean, and safe with free wi-fi. This should check most boxes on your list. It did for us. All in all a very pleasant experience at the Stellar, and a memorable visit to Sydney.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_377699918~“2.5 stars: bathroom needed more thorough cleaning”~This was my first time in a Best Western in a while. I appreciated that this was cheaper than most other branded hotels in downtown Sydney, but the quality was also a cut below the alternatives like Adina and Meriton. My bathroom had lots of long hair swirling around the floor, and didn't appear to have been thoroughly washed and swept out.  Soon after departing the hotel, I developed a case of conjunctivitis (pink eye) which was most annoying on a 15.5 hour flight. It could have been a coincidence, but I wonder???~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_377178697~“Good location and nice room”~The room was a nice size and the kitchenette was well equipped. They washed some dishes for us and then left them on the counter. Were they clean or not? I assume that clean dishes get put away. The staff could have been friendlier and more informative about what amenities the hotel provided. Like what the cafe and bar hours were. Overall, it was a great place to stay.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_376271434~“Budget”~We had 2 nights in this hotel. The hotel is in a good location close to Hyde Park and Museum station. Check in was easy, although I've never paid for my accommodation in full at check in. Yes I have provided a credit card on check in but I have always paid for my room nights on check out. The hotel also charged my credit card $100 for any incidentals. This will be refunded in 7 days (?). Not sure what the $100 would cover? The mini bar of 2 bottles of water in our room with a total value of $5? There was quite a bit of traffic noise but understandable given location in the city. Negatives: Bed wasn't made properly and wasn't very comfortable. Room was very poorly lit. No towel rail in bathroom, limited counter space and only 1 power point. Our coffee cups were not cleaned when room was serviced. The TV is too small for the size of the room. No chain lock on inside of door. As a female traveller, this is a must. Very slow lift. The positives: The shower was hot and strong. Windows that open for fresh air. Free WIFI.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_375285350~“Stellar is Stable in Quality”~This is my 3rd stay at Best Western Stellar and it remains a favourite, go to, place to stay. Reliably clean and tidy, spacious with a kitchenette and a dock to charge my phone, it's these simple things that matter. Fantastic for convenience, shopping, dining and various public transport modes are all easily accessible. This time around I exercised at Cook Phillip Pool, attended a conference at Lunar Park, relaxed at Opera Bar, partied at Oxford St and ventured to Glebe Markets. I used the car parking this time, very very tight squeeze but I was assisted wonderfully by the Desk Manager. I'll definitely be back to The Stellar.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_375253786~“Great Location ”~For a Best Western Plus I was a little disappointed. The location was great and the building is still under construction. I found the room to be a little a little awkward and it appeared to be put together fast and cheap. No plugs by the bed at all and don't touch the water or it will cost you $4 Definitely overpriced for what you get.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374841014~“Well place hotel for the city”~The room was clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room and was very good for my 3 week stay. The room service was reasonably price. A short walk to Hyde Park and the Ansac memorial and 20 minutes would get you to most places in the city.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_374720943~“Sydney CBD stay for 2 nights”~As once a year travellers to Sydney we stayed at the Hotel Stellar for the first time. We would definitely stay again as the hotel room was very good with lots of facilities close by. Car parking, while a tight parking spot, was available and we certainly enjoyed being able to drive to visit relatives and friends. Our stay in Sydney was for a total of 4 nights, with 2 other nights with friends on the North of Sydney. The hotel provided closeness to the Maritime Museum (we walked) and to QV Building - both of which we enjoy. Bus and train was very close and choice of restaurants within easy walking distance.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_373870632~“Decent, under renovations”~We had a room overlooking the street and never found it noisy. Almost kitty corner to Hyde park. Great staff. Once the renos are finished it will be a great hotel. There was no problems for us, and we enjoyed having breakfast in the restaurant onsite, as their own breakfast room was being remodelled. The kitchenette in the rooms are great. Would definitely stay again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_373230464~“Great location”~We stayed here for three nights and the hotel was great in that it was close to the train and walking distance to lots of restaurants.  The rooms are really quite nice and spacious. It is nice having a kitchenette so you can have breakfast in your room before starting your day.  Our safe wasn't working when we checked in. We notified the front desk and they told us they would have it fixed by the time we got back. They did, and they also gave us complimentary toast and coffee which was nice.  The staff are friendly and courteous.  Will stay here again if I am in the Sydney area.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_372296544~“Better inside than it looks!”~We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel room...as the outside looks rather old. Very nice apartment style room with kitchenette made our 4 day stay so much easier when we could eat in sometimes. Comfortable beds, nice bath area and overall roomy feel.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_372140750~“Good base in Sydney”~We stayed here at the end of March for two nights having stayed here in 2013 and am pleased to say it was still as good. The rooms are very well appointed and decorated and clean. We had a room at the back so didn't experience much noise, but it did overlook a rather grubby alley, but we weren't there for the views! The lobby area was being renovated when we were there so hopefully this will improve the amenities. We had breakfast in the café one morning and it was well priced and very nice. All the staff are great. Would recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced stay in Sydney. Don't be put off by the exterior.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_371147073~“Amazing Apartment”~This hotel was wonderful. It was clean, the staff was friendly and it was within walking distance of most necessities. There were 7 of us and we stayed in an apartment which accommodated all of us having our own bed. We did end up having to take a lot of cabs to different locations, but it was worth it for the stay here!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369607722~“Wonderful hotel - great location”~My partner and I stayed here for a few days prior to boarding a cruise. We could not have been more pleased. Although it really doesn't look like much from the outside, the room was wonderful - clean and modern with a great view of the park. The location was prefect for exploring central Sydney. Special praise for Alice and Veronica on the front desk. Friendly and very helpful - they provided a wonderful welcome to a glorious city.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
