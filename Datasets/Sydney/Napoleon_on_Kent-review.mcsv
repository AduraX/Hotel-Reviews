review_475432023~“Great location 15 mins each way to Darling Harbour or Circular Quay”~Caught the train from the airport to Wynyward train station - make sure you take the Barangaroo exit 4 and you will come out facing the apartments. Booked the 1 bedroom unit thinking there were two double beds but on was a sofa bed - very uncomfortable!. But rest of the apartment was roomy and clean.  A little noisey with road works going on but ok if you have ear plugs.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_474560478~“For short stay and a wedding”~This apartment was neat and clean, in great close proximity the Wynyard station and to restaurants along Barangaroo Wharf and all the ones along the way to Pyrmont Bridge, which then takes you to the Darling Harbour restaurants. It was a fantastic location to the wedding reception venue, the Rocks.It was peaceful and quiet even though it's situated under a freeway.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_473053193~“Convenient location to tour Sydney within budget”~We stayed at this hotel in September 2016. It was not fancy, but it was centrally located near the harbor and there was a train station across the way. The room was comfortable and clean! It was in the heart of the business district.~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_470196892~“Not much service for a serviced apartment”~Two stars might be a little harsh but I didn't think NOK deserved three.  The location was good in that it is close to many restaurants, shopping, a train station and two harbours, however the building itself is literally right under a motorway so it leaves some to be desired (I.e. Not a lot of natural light). Given this, it was surprisingly not that loud except for the sirens.  The staff were friendly enough but didn't offer very much information unless asked.  The apartment was just okay. The lighting made it look a little dingy and the walls could use a fresh coat of paint. The floors were a little dirty which made me not want to walk around in bare feet or even socks.  There is no room service unless you're staying for at least a week. That was fine, but it was the extra charge for towels that bothered me since they only gave us two small towels to start with. They also ask you to wash all the dishes (they only gave one small pouch of dish soap which had to last us 6 days) and take all of your garbage with you when you leave. Again, fine, but then don't charge your clients $200 a night.  All in all, it was okay, but it wasn't worth the money. I was really looking forward to visiting Sydney for the first time and while we didn't spend every hour in the apartment, I definitely think it had a negative impact on my overall experience to the city. I would not recommend NOK - not even as a budget-friendly place since I just don't think it was worth what we spent.~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_468128955~“Great value, excellent location”~Our apartment here provided everything for a self catering 3 night stop. The location is excellent being right near Darling Harbour and very close to Circular Quay. Although the picture of the apartment block looks a little unattractive being under a motorway we had no problem from traffic noise and the view from our apartment (411) was better than expected. The apartment was spacious, comfortable bed, lounge well furnished and kitchen fully equiped. The two girls on reception are a real bonus, they are so, so helpful. They will store you luggage for a while too before or after your stay. We will certainly stay here again.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467741133~“Good value”~For this location it was good value. Didn't notice the expressway as we were on the Sussex Street frontage. Clean, all you need for meal preparation. Fantastic proximity to Barangaroo, Darling Harbour, CBD, The Rocks, Wynyard railway station easy 4 minute walk. One negative though, don't recommend using the sofa bed. Mattress totally past it's yes by date, just springs and no padding. Need to be replaced.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_467099045~“Serviced Apartments ????”~Serviced apartments - only every 4 days and then there is a fee to pay If you wanted fresh towels each day they were $4 each Stayed twice over a period of 3 weeks - booked prior to a cruise - before and after stay The beds were wonderful if you like ROLL TOGETHER beds. There was no support in them at all There are no views at all from anywhere in the apartments Some road noise as it is situated right under an overpass Book well in advance and you will get a good rate, BUT book close to your visit and the cost will double. . On the plus side, it is very central to the city, Circular Key and the numerous restaurants at Darling Harbour.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~2~nan
review_465140715~“Good deal for 100 USD the night”~Very big apartments with kitchen. It was a little humid but we opened the windows and things changed rapidly. Our room was on the thrid floor so it was quiet. I would have felt more safe if the main door was closed since the reception closes at 8pm on weedays, but it was open to anyone during 24 hours a day.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~3~nan
review_461914597~“Great location with reasonable price”~Stayed at the hotel this month and it is in a good location close to transport, Darling Harbour, the City and the Rocks. The room was a good size and clean. The staff were friendly. Although situated under an expressway there was not much noise from traffic. There was however excessive noise from roadworks that commenced every morning of our stay at 7.00 am which was unfortunate. Would go back again but would be more selective of the location of the room selected.~3~4~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_461541382~“Great location but dissappointed”~This is the second time we have stayed there. One bedroom apartment was roomy, clean and had facilities for cooking. Apartment was quiet even with building work being carried out around the complex. Staff were helpful and friendly. Location was very close to Wynyard Station, pedestrian tunnels, shopping complexes including supermarkets and wine stores. Darling Harbour restaurants were in walking distance through the Barangaroo development.  The disappointments were:  Advised by reception  The apartment was serviced weekly.  Charged for additional towels.  Sign in room instructing the removal and disposal of all rubbish in the apartment The height of the bath to access the shower was very high and the bath surface was very slippery. Overall would still consider Napoleon on Kent for future stays.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_460515944~“Pay for an Upgrade”~If you just want a place to put your head down in between business appointments, then this is NOT IT Go somewhere else to get a quiet night, some hotels can deal with being on a main road, they do not That is all I can say~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459035562~“Great location, value for money!”~Booked here when myself and my partner stayed here for 7 days. The staff were lovely, they made our stay super easy and painless. Have no complaints. It was great as we can cook our own meals if we didn't want to eat out and the facilities were up to scratch and perfect if you want somewhere in a central location and are out all day and need somewhere to lay your head. At first, we were nervous because the apartment was under the freeway... but this was not an issue at all! Couldn't hear any noise from the traffic at night, only heard it when we had the sliding door open in the day but nothing overwhelming. Totally recommend.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458812906~“Surprisingly Good”~Had looked at staying here several times as we like to have an apartment or at least a separate bedroom. We arrived via the Barangaroo/Wynyard Station walk, very handy as we were in torrential rain. It was around 11.30am & the lovely girls on reception checked & our room was several minutes away from being ready. check in was quick & took lift to apartment. Was very large with a lovely cool air conditioner. A little tired but overall was better than we expected. Comfortable bed & living room furniture. Handy to have kitchen area too. Although very close to restaurants. Bath/Shower could be tricky to get in & out of if you weren't agile. Didn't notice motorway noise, neighbours a little noisy but not too disturbing. Large Balcony where you could watch the bats in the evening & we had a slight water view from kitchen & bedroom window. Girls were always welcoming with lovely smiles each time we arrived at the apartment. Would recommend to others & may well stay again ourselves.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_457440118~“Value for Money but don't be precious”~We stayed for three nights and booked last minute. This was the cheapest hotel that we could find that was inner city Sydney. By comparison to other hotels rooms available however this was the best value for money. Instead of just a room with a bed it had a separate bedroom (with a very comfy bed), a kitchenette (with microwave, fridge and cooktop), lounge/sofa bed, a small table, and it was all very spacious. And a brilliant location. BUT the glass sliding door was a massive effort to open and close, the extractor fan over the cooktop was dodgy, the sofa bed was horribly uncomfortable, and the kitchen equipment had not been washed properly. I would definitely stay again because value and position are more important to me than luxury but be warned.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455103848~“Great location”~Our family of 4 stayed in a one bedroom apartment while our friends stayed in a studio apartment. Both rooms were clean and tidy with a basic kitchenette containing all the essentials. We parked the car below for $35 per night. The true strength if this place is it's location... A few minutes walk from Barangaroo, 10-15 minutes from Darling Harbour, 10-15 minutes from Circular Quay and The Rocks, and 3 minutes from Wynyard station via a new underground walkway. We were concerned about potential traffic noise, but we needn't have worried. The rooms are sufficiently sounds proof to block out all but the noisiest traffic. Recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451112772~“Just as needed.”~We arrived to a very friendly and helpful receptionist (Rosey) and were allowed to access accommodation early. The room had a comfortable bed, lovely shower and was within an easy stroll of Darling Harbour. Although a little tired and dated, this accommodation was ideal for a three night stopover. The location alone is worth what we paid, Darling Harbour has every food and social activity anyone could require, and the rest of Sydney is also within easy walking distance.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_448192831~“Excellent ”~I've stayed here a few times and have never been disappointed. We had a 1 bedroom apartment with plenty of room and facilities. Close to everything including Darling Harbour, The Rocks, Wynyard, QVB, Barangaroo, Crows supermarket.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_442964973~“Close to everything!”~We stayed at this hotel for 4 days after a long cruise from the US. Because of the shape of the building, the rooms are different sizes. There was lots of construction going on around the area. Not really a problem, since we were sightseeing during the day.  There is a supermarket 2 blocks away inside the subway station. Walking to the ferry building is a 15 minute walk through the heart of the Central Business District. It's less than 15 minute walk to Darling Harbor and all the attractions.  There is a washing machine and dryer in the hotel. Each room has a kitchenette, refrigerator, and plates and everything to make a meal except for an oven.  I considered this hotel a bit pricey.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440753599~“Conveniently Located”~We arrived early evening at this hotel to be told that our booking, made several months ago, had been cancelled because of a problem charging my debit card. An e-mail had been sent to that effect in the last 2 days, but I hadn’t been able to check my e-mails while travelling. Fortunately there was one last empty room and we took it, using without any problem, the debit card that had previously been rejected. Cash was not acceptable as payment. Our room was small, basic and had a Queen Bed that proved inadequate for 3 of us. Fortunately in the morning we were moved to a bigger room with 2 beds. Much better, and all the necessary facilities were there. And a good laundry in the basement. Napoleon On Kent is a quirky hotel, wedged beneath an overpass. Fortunately there was no annoying traffic noise, but there was a construction site close by, but they only worked during the day.  Be aware that guest parking is available at a cost and should be reserved in advance. Internet is available in hotel rooms, but charged. And a 200 AUD$ security deposit is required on arrival. Normal room service is weekly but daily room service can be provided at extra cost.. There is no restaurant but there are several decent cafes and restaurants nearby.  This hotel in Sydney CBD is conveniently located within walking distance of the Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and the Opera House.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan

review_435405135~“Good budget option”~I stayed here with my adult son for 4 nights. The staff were great and made up the sofa bed for us so we had separate sleeping areas. Facilities good and had all we needed. It's a bit dated but clean and comfortable. For what we paid we were extremely happy and staff very helpful. Location is great for Darling Harbour and if you do not want to walk to the other sites Wynward station is next door so so easy to get around and to and from the airport. Our only criticism would be the wifi which we paid for and then went down and reception away so could not fix. That makes it difficult if have work to do and also to check in for flights but that is the only down side we found.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_432868396~“Close to the City”~We booked the Napoleon on Kent by price and after checking reviews, some good some bad. We were greeted by two lovely young ladies at reception and we were in our room no dramas. The room was clean and tidy and being situated under the road bridge to the Harbour Bridge the noise was minimal, not noticeable as we slept well. We had a studio apartment that has cooking facilities but were not used as we ate out. This is not luxury accommodation, if you want that go to the Radison ect. this is affordable good accommodation within walking distance of the Rocks and city. The only negative is no soap holder in the shower and the air-conditioning filters desperately need washing hence we did not use the AC as it was not needed while we were there.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431120318~“Decent apartment at a decent price.”~These units are a little shabby but perfect for a long weekend.

I'd stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430439311~“Not for family's ”~We stayed here one night before our cruise . Very very disappointed in the room. We ask for 4 beds due to having kids well all they have was a queen bed and sofa bed . We ask for rollaway but they were all taken. We did tell them on booking that we had 3 children in each group. They found one rollaway. The room were not clean at all had holes in walls mould in shower there was ladies Products left in the cupboard. Blood stains on the sheets . Receptionist was not helpful at all.  We had to come and stay another night after we got back from our cruise I try to look for another hotel but sadly everything was book out .  But on our arrived back we were given different rooms they still had holes in walls but at least we were given more beds and no bloods on sheets this time.  I would never stay here again.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_426025935~“Adequate, but good location.”~I chose this place as it was close to The Rocks (about 5-10min walk) and close to the shops. The building is sandwiched under the main road leading to harbour bridge, so i assume could be noisy in the day, however we were out in the day. It was about 15-20 min to Darling Harbour on foot. Arrival after hours required a tannoy to contact someone remotely who lets you in and tells you the code for the safe to get your room key. The room was spacious but felt cool, possibly due to the laminate floor. The furnishings were basic but functional. The wardrobes needed updating as the doors didn't slide easily. The ironing board was wonky. Beds were comfortable, but the main room had a circular window with a paper doily to keep light out and therefore we woke at sunrise! The worst aspect was having to pay for very poor quality wifi...barely enough strength to get an email. With two teenage kids wanting to SnapChat etc you can imagine the frustration! The microwave and cooker worked and the utensils were perfectly adequate and we only ate in twice.  The bathroom did not have enough shelf space for 3 people's toiletries and drawers in there were in need of updating as the veneer or coating was peeling. The shower was a good temp, but as with many hotels the flow was not the best. If you need a base for exploring Sydney then this place serves a purpose. There is a pay for guest laundry which was efficient though you need plenty of coins for the wash, powder and then dryer. Reception staff were very polite, and informative. Note - when we stayed there was a lot of street work going on (not the hotel's fault) and waking to drills etc at 7am wasn't great.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~2~nan
review_425482073~“Great Location”~We had an apartment with kitchenette. It was very spacious and clean. It's very handy, being about half way between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour and Wynyard station very close by for groceries and trains.  Being directly under the freeway onto the bridge you can hear the traffic, but it's better than being beside or above it and it wasn't a problem.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423681104~“Like the naopleon on kent”~Likes are convenience to Rocks, Wynard station, Darlinghurst harbour etc (all walking distance), staff attentive, room was clean and kitchen had crockery and cooking utensils to allow you to knock up a feed, beds were comfortable. Our room was on floor 4 Napoleon street side (slept well). Internet was a bit slow according to children but when I used it last night after getting home late I found it okay. For those who like watching Tv in bed there is no tv in bedroom but surely you didn't come to Sydney to watch your tv.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_423678237~“Overnight ”~Had requested a car park when booking on line, checked day before and confirmed car park would be provided Arrived early and while room was not yet available no issues with parking, check in went well. Room clean and everything in good condition, general hotel, hallways etc felt a little tired  Location great, for the cost, if only staying a few nights highly recommend hotel  Perhaps some additional info on car park entry ( which street to approach for entry ) on website would be helpful~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422312515~“Erk!”~This place is by far one of the filthiest places I've stayed.  Management really need to invest some time and money on training their "cleaning staff".

review_422288897~“Large room but noisy”~I found the reception staff friendly and welcoming with always a smile. My room was 201 and when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the size. It was clean as was the bathroom fitted out for a disabled person. The big drawback was the fact it was right on Kent Street so the traffic noise was constant so not suitable for light sleepers ! I felt that for the price I paid I had to expect some problem. Other than the noise level I was very satisfied with my two night stay although I did not use any of the kitchen facilities~3~nan~nan~2~4~nan~5~nan
review_416626323~“Noisy, Dank & Dirty but friendly and helpful staff”~We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found that it was rather dank and dirty. The lower level that we stayed on seemed to have been flooded in the past, as the walls were showing water damage and the carpet had that musty smell. The room was well appointed and appeared generally clean, however it was under the bed that was a shocker. We moved the bed to look for a dropped pair of glasses and the garbage, filth and dust under there made us sick, fortunately it was our last night or we would have checked out. On the plus side, they held our bags for us on checkout the staff were very friendly at reception.  Note: this hotel is built under the Western Distributor Highway, so if noise is an issue don't stay here.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416393049~“Mystery Deal”~I bought this as a mystery hotel deal i was very worried after if read the reviews.It was great though. The room was huge for the price i paid. There was cooking facilities and a table with four chairs and a couch. Marks on the walls where a painting had been hung and minor scratches on the walls where the only things that detracted from the room. Near the train station was a bonus and a short walk to the water front for those who want to go for a stroll.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415932464~“Would not recommend ”~We are a family of 4 and stayed here for 2 nights. The customer service was fine and pleasant but from the moment we walked into the room we felt dirty. I had to call reception to come and clean the toilet area as there was a brown stain running down the side of the shower next to the toilet. This was only cleaned with a wet cloth so we went and bought domestos and did it ourselves. I also complained about the balcony as it was filthy with something spilt all over it. I was told this was cleaned once a month by contractors so they could not do anything. The blankets had hairs all through them and the iron had wires hanging out of it. Reception did replace the iron asap. The cleanliness of this hotel was below average and both myself and my family felt extremely dirty staying here. It is a shame as the staff are very friendly and helpful.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_406574125~“JUST OK, NOTHING MORE OR LESS”~Location decent enough, in the CBD close to Wynyard station although exact location can be easily missed given it's located below an overpass.

Microwave black on the inside, curtains do not cover the ranch slider which faces a busy street. Noisy due to major area works – jack hammers operating overnight. Apartments have an extensive list of prohibitive instructions, and additional charges. Left luggage is at reception which at times creates a maze of bags right by the front door.  Location is Napoleon on Kent’s best feature.~2~nan~nan~2~2~nan~2~nan

review_392351251~“Not bad, not great - average for the price”~Pros: reasonably priced, good sized room (I think it is a disabled room, hence more room than normal), good kitchen facilities, convenient to city CBD, staff are very helpful Room is clean but dated - that's what you expect at this price. Concierge is only during the day - don't lose your key or lock yourself out at night because it will cost you! Cons: noisy (right on the street - the windows cannot open and the view out is of the taxi rank), shower is a dribble (yeah: I know, we live in a period of water conservation, but you would get a more satisfying shower if you stood outside in the rain), no internet (OK - you can pay a small fortune per day to get internet, but you should have it for free), the "business centre" is a small room (again: without internet) Would I stay here again: probably. There's not a lot in Sydney CBD at this price and with a kitchen.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_392308363~“Disappointing for such a great location”~Upon arriving at the apartments you find that directly above the hotel is an entry ramp for the bridge.  The parking underneath is easy. The reception staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are dated and in need of a paint. The door through to the apartments on level 2 had band aids stuck to it to hold parts in place. Though I am sure they were clean when they went on, over the course of time they have become mucky. The windows do let through the road noise. There is also building work going on at the moment overnight. There is an air conditioner heater in the lounge but unfortunately it's being it does not reach through to the bedroom. Even though it is the middle of winter the bedroom was uncomfortably warm until the early morning. This is rated a four star but I do not see it as better then a lot of 3 stars on the market.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_392303513~“Great Affordable Accommodation in the heart of Sydney ”~Given the close proximity to Wynyard Station ( we bought an Opal Card - really economical way to get around ) the Rocks, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour & all things fabulously Sydney, these apartments are really well priced. $500 for 4 nights in a studio apartment and we were able to walk everywhere. Reception staff were exceptionally pleasant & helpful and I rate them highly. I was wondering about the noise factor given the roadway over the top of the hotel & the busy road outside, however our 1st floor apartment was quiet & comfortable. There is no views from those rooms, but my hubby & I aren't people to sit around in our room, would rather be out & about.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389988778~“Good location terrible bed”~Went here for a 2 night stay with partner. Fairly clean and close to darling harbour. Cozy although a bit old and tattered in parts. Pillows were nice but bed was very old and bouncy, very bad back the next day. Blankets were in 3 parts instead of one doona. Under bed was very dusty and had rubbish from previous person. Could smell cooking from other apartments. Could hear other guests doors slamming and a LOT of construction noise. Room was very bright and I woke up at night thinking it was morning. One blind was broken and wouldn't open. Staff were really friendly. Hallway was dirty and we were told to clean all dishes and remove all rubbish before leaving, very odd. Wouldn't stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_387353563~“We thought we got a good deal”~We found this hotel on Groupon and thought that it was a great deal -- three nights for two adults and two children for $500+, and right in the CBD too. And when we called to say that we'd be late checking in, we were given instructions on how to check in and get our key cards. So far so good, we thought. But when we arrived at the carpark gate and called to ask how we would get in, we were told that we weren't given a parking space. We were advised, rather unhelpfully, to park on the street. During Vivid? Good luck with that! When we finally made it to our rooms (and thankfully, found parking not too far away), we were a bit let down. The rooms seemed tired and in need of a spruce up. The bedroom and the lounge room, with the sofa bed already set up, were nice enough. But the furniture and fixtures were dated, the kitchen equipment and utensils mismatched, and bathroom drawers dirty. There were even some marks and dirt on the walls. And the clincher was that in the cutlery drawer there was a spoon that had smears of chocolate (Nutella, maybe?) on it. Do they not bother to check whether previous occupants had in fact cleaned up after themselves? In the morning, we realised that there was none of the city view that was advertised -- our room faced a construction site. Maybe the other side had a city view? Possibly, but on that side there's a tall building. Hmm. Then before we left, while checking to make sure we didn't leave anything behind, we found a piece of chocolate on the floor beside the sofa. Definitely not ours, so I wonder how long it had been there and why it hadn't been cleaned up. Again, hmm. The room itself was nice enough, and being so close to everything was great, and having a kitchen was fantastic. And when we asked reception for parking space, they were able to give us one. But we were let down by how Napoleon on Kent wrote itself up as being worth twice what we paid for it. Based on what we saw, the telling little details made us wonder if that is the case.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_383542055~“Good location”~Having your own apartment in the heart of the city, close to Darling Harbour, The Rocks and CBD is so cool, the prices are comparatively cheap. We were surprised how clean and spacious our apartment was Only problem is the infrastructure works being undertaken in this part of the city. 7:00am sharp they start "working", which didnt worry us too much as we were up and out. Being close to lots of cafes and restaurants has its advantages. Not 5 star, but very good value.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
