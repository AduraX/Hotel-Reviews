review_479039655~“Beautiful hotel”~I was there for 5 nights and starting from front to room service everything was fantastic. Room was big and bathroom was well decorated . I had the best view of the sydney city . The busy Elizabeth street station , the sydney university . Hotel also has a swimming pool and a garage if you want to park your car. I will definitely go back doesn't matter how much it cost . Thanks Rydges.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478960466~“Pleasant hotel in central location”~This hotel is a pleasant hotel with good and spacious rooms. It is in a central location, being only a few hundred meters from the Central Railway Station. There are restaurants close by. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The free wifi is very, very slow - I found it much quicker and reliable to use the 4G network on my phone. Breakfast is very expensive (around $26) but there are plenty of alternatives in the area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478375984~“Great location, easy to access and good size parking ”~Our first stay here but we will certainly return. Initially I had to shop around for a decent deal as I needed three rooms. Staff were helpful and I got the best deal by calling direct. The motel was easy to find and off road parking whilst you check in. Parking was underneath and has decent size parking spots which is hard to find in Sydney! Staff were very helpful and friendly. Rooms were modern, clean and good size. Pool, spa and sauna were also good. We didn't eat here. It is so well located, you can walk to central station, Capitol theatre, darling harbour etc. we did have noise early from rubbish trucks and drunk guests but this is no fault of motel. Staff happily stored our luggage for the day also.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477901253~“Amazing!! From the moment we walked in!!”~Checked in by Bruce (hope I remembered his name correctly?) who was so helpful and friendly. My kids thought he was awesome and shared there easter eggs with him! I immediately knew we had chosen the right hotel for our first trip to Sydney by our first impressions. The bed was the best mattress we have ever slept on. Staff were great. Kids loved the pool. We chose a package that included a Merlin pass. Great value. Dined in the adjoining restaurant twice! Walking distance to everywhere. Couldnt fault this hotel one bit. Thanks so much!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477857952~“Central Comfort”~Being in Surry Hills and about 5 minutes from Central Station, this hotel is walking distance or at most a short train ride to all the major sights in Sydney. It has its own nice mid range priced restaurant and bar, as well as a guest lounge. The room was large and spacious and comfortable. We had a few problems with the air con not working very well, particularly in the middle of the night. The tech staff were helpful but couldn't do anything about it. Otherwise the place was clean and staff very helpful and obliged with a late check out. Discounts on food and drinks were available to guests as well as bag storage. I would go back but suggest they review the air con.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_477567037~“A room with a view! ”~Allocated a newly refurbished room we enjoyed a large space, couch and big TV and big bed and an industrial view. As an artist I love looking for patterns and shapes and this view provided an array of interest for me. But we do have one complaint. The new very large TV had a white, bright, 'stand by' light that was like a light beam shining into our head. So bright we had to try and drape a towel over it. It lit the way to the bathroom and making a coffee in the dark!! Why do manufacturers have such a fault in there electronics.  The staff were extremely pleasant at check in and prompt when we left.  The foyer had a confusing decoration on glass over water with Caro swimming aimlessly next to a black grand piano. A little weird but interior designers just try to hard sometimes!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477363368~“Was good at a reduced price but expected better”~We booked this hotel as it was massively reduced in price from £600ish pound a night to £96 so we thought it was worth trying out as we travelled through Sydney. On first impressions the hotel was great! The reception was lovely and the fish made it feel like a relaxing place to wait. The room itself at first seemed luxurious but after settling in it left a lot to be desired.  Good points are that the room is spacious and light.  Bad points are that it didn't seem clean, the bathroom had no window which meant the room couldn't breath and given that it's a hot country and the bathroom steamed up regularly with showers there was a foisty damp smell in there constantly (even before we used it)  On top of all this the hotel was undergoing some renovations of some sort which we didn't know about until arrival (this probably explains the reduced price) Reception stated that work would start from 9am and continue to 5pm so we should expect construction noise during this time. However, after a very long flight we were hoping for a lie in and to catch up on our sleep - this unfortunately did not happen as the construction work could be heard from as early as 8am.  As well as this the room we had was quite close to a main road which meant we heard traffic all the time. Hopefully, after the construction is finished the hotel will be in a much better state, if you want a budget hotel this is perfect but if you're expecting luxury I'd advise you to try elsewhere.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476353003~“1 night April 2017”~Stayed for one night. Excellent location, could walk to darling harbour, kings cross, plenty of places. Had a room with a balcony, looked onto the brick walls of other buildings so no great view.. but I liked it. Super fast check in and check out. Parking under building for extra $40. In the middle of renovations so a little noise and construction going on but only in business hours. Pool is awesome, indoor & heated with a spa. 24hr convenience store 100m away. Super market and bottle shop within a couple of blocks. Kettle, cups and glasses suppled. No toasted or microwave or bowls.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476238953~“Disappointed ”~I had accidentally booked this motel a night in advance on Wotif instead of the night we had travelled up there, so I rang up and booked the night I was supposed to book through the motel.  Only to be told I hadn't paid for either of the nights and checked my emails to find two receipts to say I had paid and after a heated discussion with the checkin man and showing receipts it was finally resolved.  We got to the room and it looked alright, but then I noticed there was plastic and other things that hadn't been picked up by the pervious guests, there was mould in the tiles everywhere in the bathroom. We asked for a room with a view and to our surprise they were renovating so there was scaffolding everywhere you looked out the window.  But I was in a convenient spot with Woolworths and cafes just a few minutes walk and central at your finger tips. Overall it was disappointing, I have stayed at many Rydges motels but I think the Rydges sadly won't be our go to motel anymore :(~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475948495~“So central, we walked everywhere”~We got an amazing deal, so had little else to go on before arrival. We caught the train from the airport and walked, with luggage!, down to the hotel from Central which was pretty easy. Check in was easy, the room was a really decent size and the bed was comfy. Breakfast was included, it was ample without being exciting. The bar/restaurant downstairs was fantastic, we ate/drank there several times during our stay, however there are so many fantastic eateries nearby, so you will be spoilt for choice.  This place was so central and quiet that we're staying again in September, which is amazing for us, as Sydney has so much to offer, we usually stay at a different place each time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475946408~“Noisy in early morning”~After requesting a quiet room we were woken at 5.30am each morning by rubbish trucks in the back lane way. A complaint to management offered free breakfast or parking, neither of which we required. A request to reduce the room rate was not forthcoming as I had already paid and it was too difficult for them to figure out a credit.  The king bed was weird as it was two mattresses which meant when our daughter needed a cuddle after being scared of the early morning noise it was not comfortable. The bed sheets also did not fit any of he beds meaning we got tangled it the sheets just trying to sleep.  Overall this was not a relaxing stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475765885~“Centrally located to Entertainment & Eateries”~The room sizes are okay with a modern decor, the views from level 9 aren't special, and the staff are attentive to your needs. There is car parking available. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and near the Capital Theatre and Central Railway Station.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474827638~“Stay away if you want Breakfast”~Rated this Motel poorly due to the Breakfast experience. This Motel caters for the Tourist Bus hordes, on both mornings of our stay there was no available tables in the Breakfast restaurant. Other than that the Motel was fine with nice rooms and location handy to Central Railway Station~2~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_474626524~“Great staff let down by hotel”~We had one night at this hotel which was part of a cruise package deal. Firstly, the staff on reception were extremely helpful, courteous and friendly. I recently rang them, a month after staying there, to find out if a piece of jewellery had been left there. Although the answer was no, the staff were again friendly and efficient and came back with a very quick answer. Well done everyone. However, the staff were badly let down by the hotel. The room we were allocated was dirty, the carpet was dirty and badly marked and needed throwing out, and the furniture was really dog-eared. Had we been there more than one night, it would have been straight down to reception and demanded another cleaner, pleasanter room. On the other hand, the bedding was clean and of good quality and the bathroom was fine. The location could be better in that the hotel is amongst the back-packing area and I'm not so sure that we would have liked to wander about too late at night there. In spite of the wonderful staff, we will not be going back there again.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~2~5~nan
review_474456427~“Best hotel that is close to Central station”~I always stay at Rydges Centre when visiting Sydney because of it's location .

review_474019377~“poor handling by staff of issues spoilt visit”~Stayed in the hotel for a conference. On booking in, the wrong room number was written on the key card requiring a journey up, down and up again from the tenth floor after the embarrassment of trying to get into someone else's room.  Furthermore, an alarm went off at 3 am, accompanied by a reverberating loud noise, akin to a fire alarm. I went and spoke to reception, having left my room in case it was a true fire alarm. I had to badger the night staff to investigate against their reassurance that it was just the "air conditioning." This alarm and noise was stopped thirty minutes later. It restarted again at 8am. At this stage it was promptly investigated by the morning staff. Other small issues such as stained duvet covers, missing towels and dirty cups made put a further tarnish on my visit. In addition, the hotel is undergoing renovation currently. There is a supposed curfew in place which wasn't being followed.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~2~2~nan
review_472295019~“Excellent”~This was our second visit to Sydney and staying in this hotel and once again had a great time. Beds were comfortable and the pool was great to relax in after walking around the city all day. Close to the train station and Chinatown and if you have the energy it is a pleasant walk to Circular Quay. My only complaint would be the coffee machine at breakfast time as it never worked properly once so I just had instant coffee.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472254139~“not too bad”~Not a classy joint by any stretch of the imagination but a totally adequate hotel. Perfectly located near Central Station. We got the train from the airport and wandered a couple of minutes up to the hotel. Brilliant. The place is very neat and tidy, but the BIG winner here are the bathrooms. I assume they've been renovated. They are exactly what most hotels are lacking. Simple, nice, CLEAN, modern and without a bath. Who uses a bath these days? Everything else was exactly as you might expect. A great place for a romantic stay in town as well as for a business stop over.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_472168224~“Excellent location”~We stayed in this hotel for five nights at the end of Jan and three nights in the middle of Feb. The location is great; right next to the train station and easy walking distance into the city. The staff were all really helpful and keen to make us feel at home. The rooms were large and comfortable though the first room we stayed in was an accessible room which had a really low shower making it difficult to use. The second time we were upgraded to a suite which was nicer! We had breakfast a couple of times in the hotel which was nice enough though not particularly inspiring. The room it is served in has seen better days and the furniture is in need of an upgrade. We ventured out for breakfast most days; there are loads of really nice places serving breakfast nearby which are cheaper and nicer. If you do want to get breakfast in the hotel, sign up for their loyalty scheme and get a voucher for breakfast from reception which makes it cheaper - you also get a free drink in the bar!! There was a lot of renovation work going on over the time we we there though thankfully most of the noise was during the day while we were out. One annoying thing was housekeeping who came quite late in the afternoon, often just when we were getting back from a day out and wanting to get ready for the evening. All in all a really conveniently-situated hotel which we'd definitely consider returning to next time we're in Sydney!~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_471332877~“Fantastic place to stay in Sydney”~I stayed the night at Rydges Sydney Central on a night out with friends. It is very well located a 5 minute walk from Central station, so it is very well located for tourists and business travellers alike. It is also next door to an excellent burger restaurant ;-)  The staff are welcoming and friendly, the check in and out process very quick and easy. The rooms are clean, spacious and have recently been renovated.  It is very reasonably priced and the perfect place to stay in Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_470507296~“Exceeded expectations ”~I stayed here for one night as a birthday treat and break from 17months of sleep deprivation from my baby boy! I requested a standard, quiet room away from any construction and on a high level.  I was pleasantly surprised (after reading some quite negative reviews on trip advisor). PROS Helpful and polite staff on desk Clean spacious room (despite being their most basic room) Comfortable king size bed Lovely pool and jacuzzi  Birthday gift of strawberries and bottle of bubbles was a lovely surprise :)  CONS  There was evidence of construction (paint chips on the floor etc) around the hotel but I noticed this most around the 4th floor - but didn't bother me in the slightest. One small negative in the room was a strange high-pitched humming sound in my room that wasn't really noticeable during the day but at night became quite obvious. I thought I might be coming from the fridge but it wasn't, it was hard to locate the source of the sound. I had earplugs but could still hear it, so ended up putting the aircon on (sorry!) and that covered up the noise. So recommend trying that if you have the same problem. Bring ear plugs too just incase. Hairdryer buttons were broken so only blew on a low setting, again, a very small thing. No robe. Bring your own if you want to lounge or walk down to pool without having to get changed. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470374441~“Great stay”~I had two weeks on a business trip to the Rydges Sydney Central and can not fault it. from my warm welcome from Poppi as I checked in through to my friendly check out from Grace two weeks later. The staff could not have been more helpful. My room was large, spacious and felt home from home for two weeks. The hotel restaurant and bar were excellent and a pleasant area to relax after a hard day. The gym was sufficient for my needs, and I simply didnt have time for the pool. Location wise it cant be faulted, a five minute walk to central station, a 5 minute walk to Surrey Hills and a 30 minute walk to Sydney Harbour.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470192100~“Hotel within easy walking distance of Central Station”~We had an enjoyable overnight stay in mid March at Rydges Sydney Central. The hotel is a very easy 3 minute walk from Central Station. Our room was large, well appointed and the bathroom of a good size. Reception staff were efficient and friendly. The overall experience was good but we were a little disappointed that at time of booking we were unaware that construction/ renovation work was being undertaken. The work did not really bother us, apart from the entry door on level 5 being located adjacent to our room. We had had a late night and were woken just before 7:00 am by incessant knocking of worker who wished to gain access to the site. It was a blessing in a way as once awoken we decided to have a much earlier than hoped for start to the day!~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470128629~“Exceeded my expectations ”~A hotel in a great location at a very affordable price, reading some of the negative reviews I thought I must have been at a different place.

review_470071507~“Close to the city”~Not what you would expect for the price you pay, the rooms were freshly renovated but still had all the dust from it all over, the concierge desk didn't even acknowledge us when we walked in we actually had to go up to them. The rooms are very spacious though~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470017504~“Large Room, Budget Hotel Feel, Centrally Located ”~We stayed for 3 nights in the most basic room they had here. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to Central Station and the Light rail. The room itself is very large and the shower was big with good water pressure. The tv had about 15 channels, but our remote was old and the buttons needed to be absolutely crushed to work. The linens were nice on the bed, and the bed was ok to sleep on, although we could hear all the springs inside. The room itself was tidy, but there were small areas that make you feel like the cleaning staff are doing the bare minimum. Eg. Dirty corners in bathroom, mould on grout in tiles.  PROS:  250m to Central Station & Light Rail Centrally located with cheap fares to darling harbour and The Star Good wifi Handicap Friendly, bathroom and space inside room could easily accomodate a wheelchair  CONS: Hotel needs a general refurb and face lift  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469556905~“Worst stay in hotel”~Stayed here for one night, and was possibly worst nights stay I've ever had in a hotel. The hotel needs some serious upgrading in terms of sound proofing rooms. Every time the lift door opened, I could hear it. And the room next to me, you might as well not have a wall, could hear every conversation and every song they listened to. I finally had enough at 2am, went down to reception to demand a another room or a refund so I can find an alternate hotel, was told no rooms available~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468176815~“Great Stay”~Stayed a week for business. Loved the pool and gym facilities. Room service menu could be of a bit more variety, but still very nice food.

review_467427354~“A little disappointed... avoid buffet at all costs”~I booked the Rydges through Trivago as I wanted something central with a swimming pool at a reasonable price. The location is very good - close to Central Station which makes an easy commute from the airport and other central points within central Sydney.  A mixed experience with staff - some were super friendly and helpful. Others offered the minimum in service and barely made eye contact. I’m noticely pregnant and was travelling alone with a four-year old - and despite their being four staff members at reception, not one of them offered to help with my luggage when we checked in.  In terms of appearances - the reception area seems to be in a permanent state of darkness. Maybe their saving money by not turning the lights on? Or trying to hide the tired reception area and decor. There was also a very strong smell of airspray which you could smell as you approached the hotel.  We arrived at our room which on first appearances was as expected. However I noticed the shower had not been cleaned and the air-conditioning was the noisiest I’ve ever experienced in a hotel. We had to turn it off it was that noisey and there was no hope of leaving it on while we slept so it made for a sticky night’s sleep. On the last morning of our stay I decided to try the buffet breakfast in order to save time. The buffet is well advertised throughout the hotel, featuring tantalising photos of smoothies, juices and healthy looking breakfast. Do not be fooled. This is by far the worst buffet breakfast I have ever experienced and only felt comfortable with my son eating the toast and even that was mediocre as they only offered butter, margine, vegemite and jam (in packets) to go with it. Everything had been sitting out for some time and so called ‘ resh' pancakes were produced by some kind of vending machine that spat out circlular shaped glue pancakes. For AUS$35 you’d be better off eating McDonalds. There are renovations going on at the hotel currently which they do let specify when making your booking so be wary. Hopefully the renovations provide this tired hotel with a much needed facelift.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_466621855~“Very disappointed”~Room is nice, modern however I found staff rather rude. One piece of advice, don't go to the breakfast buffet, it's mediocre at best, we spent $100 and was left very, very disappointed. The quality of the food is less then a McDolands.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465468344~“Little disappointed”~No one to unload baggage from taxi.

review_464955026~“They make it right for their customers ”~My husband and I checked in to Rydges hotel after a tour group so obviously that took a while. Then we had trouble with our keys several times. The front desk staff were focused on customer satisfaction and upgraded us and gave us a bottle of wine.  We travel a lot and it's possible to overcome imperfections but employing the right staff goes a long way.  This hotel is three blocks from the central train and light rail station which can get you everywhere. We would turn left out of the hotel to the immediate corner Mary street cross Albion and with in one block find breakfast and lunch little businesses. Go to the little place just before the barber Coffee Dozo mean eggs bacon toast and coffee. At end of Mary street just one block is Metro Woolworth to pick up snacks and cross Elizabeth street there to train station. On Sundays transportation is only $3 on an Opal card going anywhere including ferries from circular quay. You can get the card at the information desk at the station.

review_460495558~“An exhausted hotel”~Hotels have all kinds of descriptions, and when one needs a refurbishment it's described as 'tired'. Well, Rydges Sydney Central is utterly exhausted, like a marathoner crawling to the tape. The foyer and reception is something of a deception. It looks pretty good and the staff are friendly and proud, as if the hotel is good, even though it decidedly is not... The carpet is old, thin and faded. Part of the hotel is a construction site. The corridors are a warren of poor design. The doors to my wardrobe did not slide, I had to lift them to move them. My bar fridge came on and off every 20 minutes with the frenzy of a woodpecker attacking metal. The clock was out by 9 hours. Every time I went in or out I saw at least 1 piece of rubbish somewhere in a hall. The bed was a surprising mix of soft and hard. One pillow was thin as a pancake, the other plump as an opera singer. But the worst thing was the shower. Apart from the 80s retirement village feel with hand rails everywhere, it was the shower head that failed, and almost completely. The head was attached to the hose... with electrical tape, and electrical tape is not able to create a seal for water. So for every drop that made it to the head, another squirted out through the tape. Tape also means it's all a bit soft and so can't sit right in the bracket, so it either pointed so far down it was straight into the wall, or so high it went straight into the wall behind me.  The credit card surcharges are gouging in their scale, something I saw another guest think as he realised his stay was about to cost a decent lunch more if he used his Amex. To be fair, the overall rate is low, and you probably get what you (don't really) pay for. And perhaps I've been spoiled in the past and have unrealistic expectations but I can only judge on what I see. Unless I have no choice and have to be, I won't be back.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

I lost my phone the day of the wedding and they promised to keep calling it until someone answered. When I got the phone back later that evening I could see by the missed call log that they had called a number of times. Will book here next time I need a room in Sydney which is every couple of months.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459481689~“Great for business meetings”~This hotel was easily accessible from the airport and a really quick walk from Central Station. My room was clean and practical. Loved the pool and the meals were excellent. We held a three day business meeting on site and received excellent service (i.e. fresh water, clean room each day and meals served at scheduled times). Free wi-fi was fast and efficient. Happy to stay here again~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458840320~“Decent stay”~Brooke checked us into our hotel room efficiently after helping me out with a minor problem - very helpful and friendly lady, she's a credit to your hotel. Very comfortable bed, beautiful shower and overall a great room. The only minor point I would like to make is that the swimming pool is very chilly as is the Jacuzzi! Thanks for a great stay, we will use you again next time we visit the city~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
