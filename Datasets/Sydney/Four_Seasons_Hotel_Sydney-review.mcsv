review_478596815~“Great location and property”~Major attractions in The Rocks (Opera House, Sydney Bridge, etc.) within 15 minutes. Lots of restaurants and shops in the immediate area. Staff is very attentive to your needs and friendly. Room was spacious with extremely comfortable bed and pillows.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478392936~“Don't worry about this place!”~I read some bad reviews of this hotel before we came to stay for vacation. We've not booked a 4 Seasons before, but the Hyatt Regency in Honolulu cannot be beat, nor can the Fairmount San Jose CA.  And here's the thing: are you going to stay in your room all day long and look out at Sydney Harbor? Because if you're not, a) why pay extra for a harbor view and b) why visit a place just to sit in a hotel room? Sydney is a very walkable city, made richer by interacting with the locals. Who are amazing folks, every one we met. Okay, there are some inconveniences - George St. indeed is being ripped up to accommodate a new rail system. So go to the 3rd floor instead of the 1st and use Harrington. Big deal. The hotel as well is slowly undergoing renovations. This is a good thing! We have not been the least bit inconvenienced in a six-day stay here, either during the week or on weekends. The staff here is beyond gracious, above and beyond. I know the 4 Seasons is likely known for this, but really - they are just fabulous, from the desk clerk to the valets to -and perhaps most importantly - the housekeeping staff who go out of their way to provide anything you might wish for in your spotlessly clean room.  What's to complain about? For us, nothing. 4 stars due to renovations. 5 stars for the staff. No, make the six ;)~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_478218385~“Decent Hotel but dated”~The location is the best you can possibly have in Sydney. However, the hotel is old and dated. It's ok for a couple of nights for business. Rooms were clean though on the small sise. Gym is really good with different machines so above average for a hotel.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_478181590~“Sydney Harbor-view hotel”~We stayed at this hotel for 4 days as we toured Sydney before flying to New Zealand. The hotel is convenient, within walking distance for many major attractions - The Rocks & Circular Quay, Opera House, and tours around the harbor via Hop-on-hop-off boats or water taxis. The hotel was fine, not a fine as others we've visited, and the rooms were very small, but that was balanced by the outstanding view from our harbor view room!~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_478119452~“Excellent location and views, disrupted by construction inside and out”~Our taxi followed its GPS only to be unable to drop us off at the George Street address, forcing us to make a ten minutes tour in order to reach the hotel from the back. The construction on George Street has apparently been going on for three years and will take another three. The hotel itself is also rebuilding its ground floor restaurant.  We had decided to pay twice the basic rate available on the internet in order to have a larger room on a high floor, yet were assigned a room on the 9th floor. When I complained to the receptionist, she responded that my reservation was not for a high floor. When I produced the written confirmation from American Express, she mumbled that she would try to change us to a room on a higher floor. We were eventually moved to an excellent room for our second and third night.  The concierge team, friendly and helpful, produced reservations in two restaurants difficult to get into.  The breakfast buffet is outstanding. Overall I felt that our experience was not on par with our experiences at many other Four Seasons around the world. Most of that will correct itself when the construction ends, but a receptionist daring me to prove that my reservation was for a high floor was a new experience for me. The building itself is part of the problem, though, it has too much solid wall and not enough glass.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478033152~“Lacks the typical ambiance of other Four Seasons hotels”~I stayed here one night since the Park Hyatt was booked. It is a high rise with over 30 floors. There is a lot of construction right outside the property. I’ve been told this has been going on for over 2 years as they are installing some sort of rail or trolley. At least one taxi driver thinks the construction will continue for another 2 years.  Although the front desk declined a request for an upgrade, I was quite happy with the actual size of the room, which was much larger than I expected and included a sofa and a large coffee table. Looking at the map on my door, my room was one of 4 larger corner rooms with the other rooms being much smaller, and this fact helped overcome at some of the letdown I felt being at this hotel.  The hotel is dated as are the rooms. My room had several old pocket doors, but they sliding action was not all that smooth. The mattress was softer than expected though I still slept well. The bathroom had a single sink.  The gym was spacious and had lots of nautilus equipment as well as a Smith machine and free weights, though the equipment itself looked quite old. There are 5 treadmills, 3 bikes, and 3 elliptical machines.  The pool and jacuzzi were small and located on the 3rd floor. There is visible traffic with nose from roads located above (unlike the roof pool at the Park Hyatt which is isolated and much quieter).  The restaurant is a temporary one located on the 2nd floor with average quality food.  Overall, if you have stayed at multiple Four Seasons, you will be quite disappointed. A sign in the lobby mentions that renovations will be completed later in the year, but I don’t know if that refers to just the lobby and common spaces or whether it will include the rooms as well.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477852595~“Never coming back”~We check in around noon and since our partial Harbour view suite was not ready they nicely offer a regular room to change after our 14 hrs flight. It was our 15 year wedding anniversary and we decided to celebrate it at this hotel because we had celebrated our first year anniversary and loved it. Our suite was not ready till 3.40 pm. When we walked into our room it was disappointing to see that the partial harbour view suite had a City view and a pick of of the water ( back harbour). I contacted the front desk and was told that was the last one available. After going back and forward we were offered to downgrade to a premier room with a partial harbour view, this time the room was smaller but did have a Sydney Harbour View/Opera House, and were promised the same view Suite the next day which is what we booked 1 month in advance. We were ask if we were celebrating any occasion 3 times during our booking, our check in the first time and when we switched rooms, I think it was out of curiosity because they did not have any special gestures at any point. The next day we moved into the suite we originally booked, it had a nice view, unfortunately I woke up to bite marks all over my ankles and my back. I saw jump out of my arm something that to me look like a flea. The front desk ordered a deep cleaning of our room that day and we were told at check out they were having someone coming to handle the situation after our departure. Did not offered anything other than an apology. Never coming back or recommending this place to anyone. Not a 5 start hotel anymore, it doesn't stand up to any other Four Seasons we had ever stayed at. Disappointed all around!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477585450~“Great location but the Club lounge was a bit of a disappointment”~We stayed at the Club Deluxe City View room. The room was clean and well appointed. The bed was big and super comfortable. We had lovely views of the city and hourbour. We had a lovely coffee machine with quality Italian coffee pods in the room. The selection of tea was also nice. The bathroom was also clean and comfortable but the shower was insanely loud! I don't know why but the shower cabin was so loud you felt like you needed ear plugs every time you had a shower! That was really bizarre. I have stayed at many hotels but this was new to me. The water pressure was also strange and the plumbing would drum unless you had it open full blast.  The room service was amazing- we had a steak and fish and both dishes were 5 star dinning quality!  Unfortunately the Club lounge left us very disappointed... The food was less than average. The daily breakfast was boring, they served the same thing every day (bacon, eggs, tomatoes and mushroom) and the only thing that saved us was that we could ask to have our eggs cooked differently every day. The bacon was dry and often cold. The fruit was nice. After 5 rounds of the same I couldn't wait to get home to have something else for breakfast for a change. The evening canapés were also terrible- tasted like frozen kids party snacks you get from a supermarket! Dry spring rolls and pasties.  The only positive was a good selection of alcohol but it would have been nice to be able to enjoy some quality chef cooked canapés with the drinks. Most of the food they served was almost inedible. Only the sweets were nice. Almost like the sweets were made by a different chef, which I suspect were not made on the premises but rather delivered from a patisserie and that's why they actually tasted nice. The service was good though and staff were very polite and attentive. There is quite a bit of roadworks going on around the hotel but it wasn't an issue at all. It will be fantastic when the light rail is finished!  Overall we had a lovely stay but I wouldn't pay extra for the Club lounge or breakfast. There are so many fantastic restaurants and cafes in the area, it's better to go out for meals and actually enjoy some tasty food.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan

review_477410595~“Not really a four seasons ”~I wouldn't really consider this a four seasons hotel. We entered into a dirty room and when I called to let reception know, the receptionist said she'd call me straight back to fix the problem, 20mins later, still no call. Had to call 2 times just to get the room sorted. The next day when we came back to our room at 4pm the room hadn't even been cleaned! The building is old and out dated. No body comes to clean the pool area. Positives - the bed was really comfy and the location is great!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477326059~“Fantastic Experience - Our First Visit to Australia!”~Overall, we had a fantastic experience at the Four Seasons hotel. The service was just outstanding, specifically the Concierge (Rebecca) and Lounge 32 (Dion & John). This was our first visit to Australia on a family vacation. I would highly recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_477326053~“Beautiful”~We love this hotel for its position near The Rocks in Sydney, the staff are friendly, helpful and absolutely lovely. All amenities, including the Spa are above average and we will be going back. Also our nephew had his wedding reception there and the food and staff were a 10/10. Thank you Four Seasons~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477046411~“ Excellent....with a few caveats”~The staff at this hotel are wonderful and deliver the he bespoke first class customer service you would expect from a Four Seasons Hotel. From arrival you are welcomed every time you walk in by the great doormen and concierge staff, reception check in was a dream, the staff are super efficient, helpful and cheery. The rooms are a little dated and on the small side but the beds are extremely comfy, good power shower, nice toiletries and a good supply of fluffy towels and bath robes. Housekeeping seem to be in and out of the room several times a day for cleaning and turn down service (shame that for four days they missed the fact a previous guest had left a condom under the bed!)  The lobby is being refurbished (as it appears is everything else in Sydney at the moment!) so the restaurant has moved up to the 2nd floor and is now effectively in what looks like it was once a meeting room. I have to say I walked out after tasting my overpriced and flavourless food on the only evening I tried the in house restaurant (in my opinion not worth the money to eat in a meeting room, be served by wait staff in jeans and trainers and for the food not to be top notch).  The roadworks all round the hotel to create the new rail line are really difficult to navigate around, lots of unnecessary diversions and no go areas. However in my room on the 27th floor I haven't been able to hear a thing.  The location is this hotels biggest selling point and was the main reason I chose it, I wasn't wrong, roadworks aside it is a stones throw away from circular quay, the opera house, the botanical gardens and the outdoor opera.  The pool area is a little low rent given the status of the hotel and looks like it needs a revamp, also the pool was not heated during my time there, too cold to swim in and the jacuzzi was very small.  The roadworks outside are through no fault of the hotel but the other minor pinged above would need to be rectified in my opinion to give it the glowing 5 stars I would like to.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476999973~“Highly Recommend”~I stayed for 3 nights over the Easter long weekend and can't fault it! I found the location to be very central to all the areas I was wanting to see, caught the train to Circular Quay station from the airport and it was only a short walk from there to the hotel. I found check in and check out to be seamless and hassle free. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. I booked a deluxe full harbour view room and although it was small, it had everything I needed! The bed was super comfortable and the view was amazing. I was on the 12th floor and the only downside was the building opposite kind of blocked the view of the Harbour Bridge, could only see the top section, but the view to the Opera House was excellent! Ask for a high floor to avoid any buildings obscuring the view. Due to the amazing view, I opted to have room service delivered each night. The food was delivered hot and was delicious! The staff were super friendly and set up my table by the window so I could enjoy the view. It was like a restaurant in the comfort of your own room, with 5* quality food! I have read some of the reviews that say that the room is in need of an upgrade and they aren't to the same standards of Four Seasons in other countries. Yes the rooms aren't modern, but they have an "old world" luxury about them, and I found that very appealing, not everything has to be shiny and new to be lux! Also reading comments about the construction work that is going on out the front of the hotel, this did not impact my stay in any way. This construction was not just centred around the hotel, went up George Street quite a long way, so is out of the hotels control, but I didn't even notice it to be honest. I was also lucky to be there when fireworks went off, so I had a great view of the fireworks display over the Opera House! Was just magical and made my stay even more special! All in all I had a very enjoyable stay and will definitely return to this hotel when I'm next in Sydney!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476983510~“Disgusting after stay billing”~Our Honeymoon - NO ADVICE OR MENTION of dreadful access to front of Hotel. We hired a limo for our Honeymoon to drive us. It could only stop 500 metres down the road in the Rocks - we had to haul all our suitcases 500 metres to Hotel. Small Room for tariff. Worst was yet to come. We fully paid when checking out - but pending charges stayed in our Bank account for almost 2 weeks. The angst of emails trying to explain that we had fully paid - while on our Honeymoon - was disgusting. Daniel in Front Office - no help at all!!! We will NEVER stay in a Four Seasons Hotel again.~1~1~1~3~2~3~1~nan

Very handy to everything. We were going on a cruise the next day and the hotel was just across the road from the cruise terminal so took the stress of arriving the day of the cruise and trying to get to the terminal,~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477108108~“Service vs Look”~Very friendly staff, excellent breakfast and large rooms. However, the hotel is a little old fashioned. The lobby has only a few places to sit down and I missed a bar with a view for a hotel on such a fantastic location.~3~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476851363~“Good location, long wait at reception to check out,”~Location good. Rooms are ok. Unbelievable long wait for an inefficient check out process. Used the best price guarantee that wasn't honored despite being set up - had to check and follow up during my stay to get that fixed again. Half hour wait with my room key and cash in hand to leave. Then 15 mins to take my $ and give receipt. Construction on road at hotel front was a pain.~3~3~5~4~3~4~2~nan
review_476837836~“Acceptable Stay but Not 5 Star”~Our stay was perfectly acceptable but I would not consider it 5 Star. The room was worn and in need of renovation and a lot of the small luxuries that you would normally find at a 5 star hotel were missing. Additionally, and no fault of the hotel, at the time we visited there was construction of transport system in the streets around the hotel making access very difficult and unpleasant.~2~2~4~4~2~3~3~nan
review_476696708~“Honeymoon”~Stay was wonderful and the staff even remembered it was our honeymoon and congratulated us. Stayed in a king room with a harbour view as booked. View was amazing!

review_476687846~“Fabulous if you book the right room”~Be careful if you book a city view room as you may be looking at and listening to a freeway. Otherwise the hotel is beautiful, super convenient, fabulous outdoor pool (in the middle of the city), great service and lovely comfortable beds.~4~4~5~5~3~4~5~nan
review_476677623~“no frills, no thrills”~Respond to minimal expectations you can have within a Four Seasons property, from far not the best I have visited. don't get me wrong, service and amenities where there, but the room, (it was a corner junior suite), the view was absolutely breathtaking, but the interior was showing his age, comfort was fantastic, but old-fashioned and clearly showing his age. Bed and mattress was too-notch, bathroom, same comments old-fashioned and in serious need of redecoration. Breakfast was very disappointing compare to other FS I had opportunity to visit. In other hand location is really a very good point.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476674861~“Construction”~The location of this hotel is excellent, however there is major construction going on outside. Our room has a beautiful view of the Opera House and harbor, however the room was small, and the bathroom very small, with major need of update. No turndown service. Excellent breakfast, and worth it if included in amenities.  Although we had hope for an upgrade through AMEX, the only choice given us for our four night stay was a lovely room overlooking the construction ! So, we chose to stay in the smaller room.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_476651215~“Great stopover!”~We stayed overnight at Four Seasons - there are a lot of roadworks happening in the area - but the hotel is so very quiet. We had an upgrade to an KS harbour view room. Great view of Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The room was great, good bathroom facilities, extra comfy beds and pillows. And very quiet.

review_476593175~“Great hotel”~Furnishing in rooms are slightly outdated but it also is the appeal. Fantastic view if you choose the Harbour view. Wasn't too keen on the smell of the bathroom products - smelt very masculine. The club lounge was fantastic. Great view also. Fantastic breakfast.

review_476499705~“Honeymoon Stay”~Stayed here for 2 weeks on our honeymoon. Arrived at 7am in the morning after a long journey from Scotland and the reception desk was helpful and welcoming even though we were very early to check in. Took our luggage and took out number to text when room was ready. Room was ready within an hour so excellent start. Room overlooked harbour as booked and view was stunning. Room was not particularly big but bed was large and comfy and TV large. TV was very slow in terms of finding channels etc.and needs upgraded. Bathroom was small but shower good and toiletries nice. Decor is perhaps nearing needing a refresh and not sure if this is 5 star anymore.  Found a great place for coffee and muffins nearby called PIe Face which had amazingly friendly service and ended up becoming a daily breakfast stop.  Apart from the decor my other concern was the lack of attention from the staff, after they figured out we weren't high rollers as we didn't show up in a Lamborghini at the front door the attention went down hill. Not sure if us coming in with our Mcdonalds or Pie Face take away was what they wanted. The fact that we were staying for 2 weeks I would have expected a higher level of attention. Hotel is in great location and was very comfortable but didn't quite meet expectations of a Four Seasons brand. Overall I would give this 3.5/5.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~nan~2~nan
review_476673308~“Four Seasons Sydney”~Everything you would expect from a high end hotel. The staff was attentive, room was clean and up to date. There was road work on going into the evening hours that continued into the evening but that isn't anything the hotel can control.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan

The Hotel was clean and customer service good but access due to roadworks was a nightmare getting in and out of the Hotel. At the Park Royal Sydney Corporate customers are treated as VIP's however no such treatment at the Four Seasons as the focus seemed to centered on retired travelling international guests, not Corporate Client friendly very disappointing given the brand.~3~3~4~3~3~4~4~nan

review_476103978~“Bad traffic around tbe hotel”~Because of the construction of Sydney's light rail system, most of George Street is blocked off for car traffic which includes a section in front of the hotel. This has always been my favorite hotel in Sydney. However you need to make some adjustments to the transportation arrangements. Dropping off and picking up in front of the hotel is still possible. However, the best way to be dropped off is the back entrance on Harrington St. If you go to places within walking distance of the hotel, there is no issue.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476008029~“Just Loved It, Great Location!”~My family and I just returned home from Sydney and we stayed 4 days in the Four Seasons. It was wonderful. We ended a raise early on a morning and went to the hotel where we dropped off our luggage. The were so cordial and helpful. We checked in and they told us the rooms were not yet ready (it was about 9 am). We did not expect it to be ready but what really surprised us was that we received a call less than 2 hours later telling us that our room were ready. We decided to go out and see the city, we received great directions and everyone was so helpful.  When we arrived back to our rooms our luggage were already in the rooms and I was thirsty went looking for the ice machine. Don't bother, you will not find it, call and ice will be brought to you quickly! I love this. The rooms were very comfortable, the beds heavenly and the view from the 27 floor is awesome.  We we disembarked from the Cruise we took a cab to the hotel not knowing. If we had walked (yes it is that close) we would have beat the cab due to the road work (light rail is going in out front but it did not hamper us in any way. We walked to the Circular Quay daily and it only took a few minutes to get to the Ferry or to the Train. Of course the bus is even closer. If you want to see Sydney on the Hop On /Hop Off bus it is just out the door to the left, cross the street and the bus stops there. Less than 2 minutes. It is so convenient to everything we were doing and just 10 minute stroll to the Sydney Opera House. We were so close my wife had us visit it every day because she loved it so much.  I will stay here every time I am in Sydney! I just need to plan another trip.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475992255~“Four seasons needs work”~Plenty of work needed to bring this hotel back to 5 star quality.

review_475376383~“It was good, be aware of refurbishments. ”~First, you cannot fault the staff. They are friendly, professional and eager to please. When I arrived I was unaware that the hotel was undergoing a refurb this month so the lobby had constant building work and was largely closed. This coupled with the light rail refurbishments in Sydney gave it a loud feeling. The room was good but some of the fittings are a little shabby and my cupboard fell apart slightly but the staff were quick to fix it all which made it better. I will stay here again but will probably upgrade the room on my next visit. Breakfast was awesome!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475164649~“Great location”~This hotel is located close to all transport and right next to Sydney Harbour. You can't beat the location. My husband and I stayed in a deluxe room with full harbour view. The view was spectacular! The hotel is clean, staff are very attentive but the room is a little small considering the price you pay. There's a nice outdoor pool and indoor fitness centre in the hotel.~4~3~5~4~3~4~4~nan
review_475181090~“Room with a View”~Room 3407 Massive room city and harbour views Amazing! Double shower ,circular bath overlooking the harbour felt very indulgent. Four Season never disappoints and the team members from the time your car door is opened, reception,Dining and room service the team a here to please.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475181088~“Room leaked - service non-existent”~Reported roof of the room was leaking as soon as I checked in and saw it - including water falling through the light fittings. Engineer couldn't fix it, so I was told by the front desk that I'd be shifted to another room. No problem: packed up, went out to dinner. On return (at 11pm), was told there was no longer a different room for me. No time to go to a real hotel, so I had to sleep in a wet and leaking room. Am amazed it would even be legal to do that to a guest.~1~1~4~1~1~3~1~nan
review_474810659~“Great location”~This Hotel is in an ideal location, it is close to the Opera house, the ferry terminal (2min) and is adjacent to The Rock. We like walking and it was nice to be close to everything. As with most Four Seasons the service is outstanding, and everything is very comfortable.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474609493~“Lovely on some parts, but good rooms are questionable”~Having been a fan of Four Seasons hotels for years, this is one of those which should not be in the group, as the rooms are not as good as most around the world. Part of the problem is that as they inherited the hotel and then rebranded many years ago from a Regent Hotel to Four Seasons, which in Four Seasons terms this is a product in a very central location, near Circular Quay. However some of the rooms look over the flyover and I know that they do their best to house people in the best ones over the harbour, you only have so many of them.  having said that the lobby, function rooms and staff are as Four seasons as they come, and as they cant do much about the rooms over the flyover its a trade-off between location, facilities service over View. In Sydney you can get views anywhere so I wouldn't worry about looking out of a hotel room, as how many people stand there and want to be there for ever looking out of the window. My advise is take the room, don't worry about the flyover and enjoy the central location near the Quay.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474535882~“Great Bar! Great Staff! Great View!”~We were staying in Sydney for 4 nights, and spent our last night here. My boyfriend had been to the city before but I hadn't, so we picked this location to be close to the harbor and the opera house. We went out all day and wandered around the opera house and bars, the rocks district, and did the Sydney Harbor Bridge Climb (which I've also reviewed, and was amazing) when we got back to the hotel, the room was lovely, with a partial view of the harbor, which was wonderful. It was all very romantic and we could have spent hours sat at the window watching the boats come in and out of the ports. We went out for dinner and on the way back to our room we stopped at the hotel bar and made friends with Taylor, who was one of the bartenders, who was absolutely amazing! We had a great conversation with him, he made amazing cocktails, and he was really professional and knew exactly what he was doing. We even became Facebook friends at the end of the night! The hotel reception is beautiful on its own, and the whole place just oozes sophistication, would 100% stay here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474528056~“Great View of Sydney Horbour”~Said for 4 nights in March after a 30 day tour of Australia, Great location 2 minutes walk from the harbour, the bridge, 10 minutes from the botanical gardens and right in the shopping district and loads of restaurants and bars and 5 minutes walk from China town. Lovely hotel, what you would expect from The Four Seasons Group. Small room but we were only in it to sleep.Btreakfast a bit hectic and service a bit more laid back that I would like, but thats how we found all Australian Hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_474383433~“60th Birthday - Family get together”~We booked 4 rooms for a 60th Birthday family event. The hotel is always looking at short term benefits - with limited inclusions for teh price, instead of chasing long term customers. They can get away with this philosophy because they have an undeniable great position. We have been visiting the hotel for nearly 20 years now & the old fashion way of doing business was to treat their customers with extras unconditionally- its now run by tertiary trained front desk text book operators who quote from the book rather than the heart. Over the years we have noticed that the rooms are very tired & need immediate upgrading. We would love to visit again, however we are now for the first time in 20 years looking at other Sydney options.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_474273463~“Not excellent for a Four Seasons. The room was to old.”~The room was old, the shower wasn't great. The Four Seasons is suppost to be one of the besties hotels. But this one in Sydney wasn't great. The breakfast wasn't brilliant. And again the room was No for me.~3~2~5~5~2~4~5~nan
review_474457097~“Fantastic hotel, stay here every time in Sydney”~The staff are very friendly and completely accommodating of myself and my children. We got an earlier check in, a cot set up, toiletries specifically for the kids... Just a great hotel. It is in a great location right on the harbour, and I had an awesome view of the bridge and opera house from my room. I can highly recommend this hotel for both business and personal travel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_474457075~“Excellent Hotel”~Loved the hotel, great location. Would highly recommend to any business or pleasure traveler. The club level was well appointed.

review_473891205~“Excellent service made this a winning stay ”~Frequent Sydney visitor who made his first stay at The Four Seasons. The hotel was surrounded by construction from the creating of a new train line. It makes maneuvering around outside at times challenging. Good thing being in the hotel is so pleasurable.  With rare exception, the staff I encountered were phenomenal. This is why you chose to stay here and many were among the best I have ever encountered. The room is so comfortable. Roomy, great bathroom and amazing bed. In fact, I am in the process of purchasing some Four Seasons bedding. The restaurant, pool, gym & spa are top notch. I was told I was upgraded to a "Partial Harbour View" room. The partial view I had though was not of the part of the Harbour we are all familiar with. No worries, but if you are going to pay for that type of view, make sure you clarify the view. The hotel's public area are in good condition, but clearly dated. Surprising for a Four Seasons. I would recommend this property because of the staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473710730~“Service = **** / Property = ***”~The service is as expected. The property is closer to Sheraton than Westin. Notice that "Four Seasons" doesn't even enter the comparison. Room as very very tired. Hallways and room smell old. Lobby is OK. Location is good (once they finish construction). If you are a princess like me, stay elsewhere.~3~2~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan

review_473239528~“Lovely views”~The views of Sydney opera house and Sydney bridge were amazing, especially at night when the harbour was lit up. No need for curtains as you did not want to shut out the view. Lovely breakfast and service.~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_473063967~“Cocktails in the bar ”~We didn't stay at the hotel as we were at the shangri-la. However we love the four seasons chain and like to partake in a cocktail wherever we find one. Unfortunately this visit did not live up to expectations. The bar is gloomy and almost hidden under the hotel looking at a busy traffic intersection. The cocktails themselves were not brilliant, the ambience non-existent and it was an altogether disappointing visit. Top tip - avoid the bar and go somewhere else.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473005141~“Fantastic hotel, highly recommended”~we could not find any faults during our stay in this hotel. All the staff were extremely courteous and professional at all times.

review_473071045~“mould”~there was black mould on the inside lining of the curtains, informed reception. all they told me thankyou for letting them know but it should not be the customer letting them know the cleaning staff should have sorted it out in the first place because it was very noticable for anyone to see some thing you dont expect when paying over $500 for the night.~4~4~5~5~4~3~4~nan

review_472848748~“Sydney getaway”~Thank you for our overnight stay. Great position to launch from to the Harbor. Great access to the icons being the Bridge and Opera House.

review_472812057~“Beautiful View of Opera House and Sydney Bridge”~High floor, the view is simply amazing and beautiful. I would definitely return to this hotel should I visit Sydney again in the future The bed is too soft and not suitable for people with back ache. I found out too late (past 12 midnight) or I would request to change room.~4~4~4~2~4~4~4~nan
review_472808198~“Great location, superb hotel”~I stayed at FS recently when travelling for business. Check in was a breeze and I was up in my room within minutes after entering the property. The room itself was great - Deluxe City View I think. The massive King bed was perfectly comfy, good lighting, a nice city view and a fabulous bathroom made my stay a very peaceful one. My view was up George St which is currently under construction and I didn't hear any road or construction noise. Each room is temperature controlled and the fit out logical and spacious. Room service each night was hot, quick and exactly as ordered. Breakfast each morning at the buffet was standard hotel fare and I cannot see how they justify charging $47 for a hot breakfast. It really isn't any better than anywhere else I've been. Service was excellent and the staff all friendly. To summarise, I cannot fault the FS other than to say it needs a refurb, which they are doing and like all hotels they need to revisit their breakfast pricing. Highly recommend.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_472531545~“Currently under construction. Requires wholesale renovation. Understaffed. Under-resourced.”~After 2 weeks traveling around Australia, my daughter and I spent the last two nights before flying back to NYC at the Four Seasons. I could have booked any hotel, but chose the Four Seasons because I have always found them comfortable, with ample room to relax, appropriate luxuries, great window shopping, and amazing food, especially brunch. I did not ask for a high floor room, nor ask to see another room. I was tired and kind of thought at this price point all the rooms would be lovely. We had a low floor, with a partial harbor view. The view of the Opera House was lovely, but the room was small, dated, furniture chipped, and no art on the walls. The layout was awkward, with too many large pieces of furniture to make it comfortable. Remarkably, there was nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. No turn down service the first night, although two Maids' carts, piled high with soaps, shampoos, and a disjointed mishmash of discarded paper fliers remained parked outside our door in the hall throughout the three days we were there. The pool was adjacent to a highway, but what was most striking was the mess; a hamper, piled high with used towels, empty bottles and cups everywhere, no attendant in sight, apparently no one for days. The restaurant in the lobby was under construction, which meant no space within the hotel to relax. The restaurant had been moved to the 2nd floor, but the staff had not bothered to re-label the elevators. They still proudly indicated the restaurant was on the first floor. Many of the restaurant tables were in the hallway around the atrium. This is a nice thought, but it needs to be accompanied by attentive service and attention to the sound level in the atrium. For some reason, the cleaning staff were using the vacuum at 8am during a crowded breakfast service. Why not complete the cleaning before the service ? No way to make a reservation for a table near the window the day before, "It's first come, first served." The staff informed me. When my daughter ordered the Buffet and I ordered à la carte, the waitress suggested I order from the Buffet so my coffee would be included. On the one hand, I'm not particularly cost conscious about breakfast -- I did book a luxury hotel, after all -- but my order à la carte was $20, the Buffet would have been $42. I can live without the $22, but really, up-selling my Breakfast order ? Yes, there is construction outside. But there is also construction inside. Moreover, there is a conspicuous absence of attention to detail throughout the execution of their experience, including the exterior construction. Most cabs will avoid the front entrance because of the construction, but there is no doorman at the other entrance. This caused confusion upon our arrival from the airport. In the end, I felt I had been misled. The hotel is basically a Best Western or any of a number of roadside Express hotels we see in the USA. I regretted not booking at the Intercontinental, the Langham, or Swissotel, all of which are close by and cheaper, some by 50%.  In the reviews from the past 4 months, there is the comment that there was nothing about the Four Seasons Sydney that merits inclusion in the Four Seasons branding. I agree with that and would add that it is not really a 5 star hotel. Other reviewers have been quite happy with their stay. However, these vacationers booked suites on high floors and may have had access to the "Club" floors, which I did not realize existed. Perhaps a larger group would find a nice suite if you book for a larger group. For just the two of us, I was expecting a decent room and fabulous amenities. You will not, however, enjoy any special amenities at this hotel; they are under construction, badly in need of construction, or have no staff doing the work.~1~nan~nan~4~nan~2~1~nan
review_472526120~“Four seasons hotel in Sydney”~The hotel has a good location for the view. But it is hard to find due to the current road work situation. The bathroom product was good, but the rest bathroom facilities needs to be replace imiditely because the shower head and the tower holder was really loose.~2~1~1~3~1~3~3~nan
review_472558575~“Never Again”~Extremely poor service. I don't know what happened in just four short moths from my last visit. I will never stay in this hotel again. After repeatedly trying to place an order at the bar for my colleagues and myself we finally gave up. We had to ask for a menu of which they gave us one for the four of us to share. They never came back to take our order and we waited over 20 minutes.~1~2~5~4~5~4~1~nan
review_472558573~“A disappointing Sydney hotel experience”~My wife and I are frequent domestic and international travelers and typically stay at four or five star hotels. The Four Seasons Sydney had been highly rated and was the headquarters for our meeting group. Our overall experience was no better than two stars. Our room had air conditioning problems and never got cool enough during the heat of the day in spite of three attempts by engineers to fix it. Housekeeping was spotty and there was construction noise both in the lobby and outside the hotel's main entrance. Elevator service was inconsistent on our last two days (I think two were out of commission). Concierge and bell stand staff were attentive and far more professional than most of the other staff. The assistant manager was very nice and apologetic and did comp our breakfast on our last day. Due to the very long travel distances involved, this will be our first and only trip to Australia and it was very disappointing to have this kind of hotel experience on the last leg of our trip.~2~2~4~3~2~4~3~nan
review_472245812~“Nice location”~Great location, especially if you get a room with view , probably this is the best in this hotel, i travel a lot and use Four Seasons, I founded it not at the level I expected from this hotel , but seams in Sydney most of the hotels have lower rate if you compare same services with the hotel located in big cities in the world.~4~3~5~5~4~5~3~nan
review_472243505~“disapointing”~I just wanted to give you some feed back on out stay on Saturday the 1/4/17. We were disappointed considering the rate and package we purchased. Romance Package. $565 per night. When i booked the room i decided to do it directly with the hotel to ensure we got the service etc, we have always had from the Four Seasons chain. The lady in reservations, Sarah, was helpful, even asking me what the occasion was, when i told her it was my wife's birthday, she said she would make a special note of that. Sarah checked the room availability and informed me we could check in from 2pm onwards and she would arrange a habour view room, also would ensure the complementary sparking wine and chocolates would be in the room on our arrival as it was a suprise for my wife. We live in Sydney and drove into the city but we were not explained upon making the reservation about the road works and difficulty it would cause trying to get to the hotel. We drove around in circles trying to get in, calling the hotel twice to try and get directions. I understand this must be difficult for you operating under these conditions, but some information upon making the reservation and maybe a map emailed with the confirmation would make everyone's life easier. We were very frustrated when we arrived as we had a lunch reservation, and had spent and extra 40 minutes driving around trying to get to the hotel. Upon arrival we checked in,when we got into our room we found it over looking the construction on George st. (NOT THE HABOUR), No sparkling wine or chocolates. I had to phone the front desk to see where it was, they apologized and said it would be sent up. An hour and two phone calls latter it arrived, but we didn't have time to drink or eat as we were going out for lunch and had a reservation. When we checked in we asked about breakfast and we were told to just call in the morning and order what ever we liked off the in room dinning menu, which we did. The food arrived on time but was cold along with the coffee and hot chocolate, it was quite un-enjoyable. My wife ordered a side of avocado. Upon check out at 1.00pm, which was not a busy time, it took over 25 minutes, there was a $25 charge on our bill for the side of avocado. my wife had ordered for breakfast and i questioned it. Eventually the young man serving us removed the charge but seriously it took way way to long, it was like he had no idea what he was doing. This morning when i arrived at work I received my reservation confirmation email ? Not sure why it would be turning up on a Monday morning, when the booking was for the previous Saturday night. I must say over all it was a disappointing stay, I had several other hotels and much cheaper rates to choose from for our stay, but i was happy to spend more money expecting to get the service and quality stay we had paid for, but unfortunately that was not the case. We will not be rushing back.~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_471976262~“Good function venue”~I attended an awards night at this hotel recently and was very impressed with the food, the organisation, the venue itself and its position. This is a big hotel with all the facilities you could want. The huge entrance way boasts a range of bars, meeting spots which I found very handy from a business perspective and was able to hold meetings comfortably in a range of locations with good views across the central atrium and efficient polite service to match. The function I attended was in the lower function room and easily accommodated 400 plus diners. The food was excellent - it arrived hot, the choices were interesting and the ingredients very fresh. The wine was also decent - unlike so many functions - and food arrived in a timely unobtrusive manner with waiters on hand all night to deal with individual requests etc. The hotel was super organised in terms of arranging and managing taxis at the end of the evening so everyone could depart with minimum fuss. An impressive evening and I would definitely recommend the Four Seasons as both a business stay hotel and as a function venue.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_471784145~“Great hotel, roadworks a pain”~This was my first time at the Four Seasons. Really nice hotel, good rooms - no complaints to be honest. The only issue is that there are major infrastructure investments taking place in Sydney right now and they are particularly bad around the hotel. Its tough to get in and out and one side of the road is totally blocked. Aside from that I really have nothing negative to say. I want to single out for praise the breakfast room and the way breakfast runs in the hotel. The guy in charge was so meticulous to ensure that everything was perfect and that guests got exactly as they wanted. I was incredibly impressed. He runs the place perfectly and its impressive to watch!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471781388~“Great service ”~Service was great as always. The way they handle difficult situations is superb.  Unfortunately I was expecting more of the room facilities. Throughout the night we could hear the toilet flashing in the other room. Toilet was outdated and shower pressure could be better.  We are talking about the Four Seasons and excellence is expected. It didn't feel special . It was just another hotel. What is a shame.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471743694~“Pure Excellence”~We have returned to this hotel a number of times over the last 15 years and the standard has never slipped. We lashed out and stayed in a Junior Suite for our anniversary and is was well worth it. The room had a spectacular view of the Harbour including the Opera house and The Bridge.  Being located in the Rocks makes it easy to get around whether it is a short walk to the circular quay ferry terminal or a stroll into the mall for some shopping.  I must make a special note of the beds in this hotel .. they are to die for! Just so comfy, if you can't get a good nights sleep here then it is unlikely you will anywhere.  Be aware that there is currently construction on the light rail right outside the hotel which has caused some minor inconveniences. I would certainly not let that detract from staying at the hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_471529689~“Recent stay at the Four Seasons”~I recently stopped at the Four Seasons in Sydney for a night. The service and facilities were wonderful, despite the significant road works going on in George Street below. I did have a concern when I had to follow up my Invoice multiple times, but this was finally sorted out, and a follow up email was received to ensure all was in order (which I appreciated).  This is a very good place to stay.~4~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan

review_471440578~“Still great location - and a pool in the middle of the city”~Returned to this hotel after a pause of a few years on visiting Australia. FS had not changed much, which is both positive and negative. This hotel is not the fanciest FS globally but its location is great, just next to the business district, Circular Quay, Harbour Bridge, Opera, you name it. Rooms start to feel a bit the age but still comfortable and well equipped (except for the disabled rooms which you should avoid unless you really need that feature - the door cannot be locked and bathroom is a lake after shower). Staff is very friendly everywhere and efficient in the FS style. Breakfast buffet is of great quality.  One of my favourite features here is the outdoor pool. Although not huge (with the central location understandable), it is just great for a quick relaxing moment. My favourite hotel in Sydney definitely.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471352514~“Wonderful staff but with some room concerns”~We stayed at the Four Seasons during our recent trip to Sydney, in a city view room on the 27th floor. The room was great, with all the amenities required for a comfortable, worry free stay (they even provided us with travel adaptors). The breakfast was a standard international buffet spread, but the staff (especially Siva) made the experience even better, making the effort to remember our orders day after day for the duration of our stay, as well as asking us about our travel plans and time in Sydney, making the experience all the warmer and personalised. The room service was also good, with the teleoperator making the effort to enquire about the number of people having the meal (even if it's just one) in order to provide the correct number of cutlery and drinks. The server that brought the food to the room was an immensely jolly fellow that brightened our mood for the day. The only issues we had (small ones) were firstly, the lack of a master switch or console for the lights in the room - which required us to manually switch them on/off individually whenever we left the room or slept. And secondly, the city view room was literally facing two office blocks on one side, and another hotel on the other; both of which allowed us to look into their rooms and vice versa. There were blinds provided, but it meant having to choose between privacy and good views.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_471274602~“Would have been nicer if we had Club Level Access”~It's hard to fault the customer service and the location being close to The Rocks which is particularly helpful on a sunny Saturday afternoon. However as we did not try the hotel breakfast or other facilities (such as Club Level Access which we did not ask for) it's hard to give it the full five star review although our room on the 31st floor was definitely five stars with the full harbour view!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471220050~“Good Location for Harbour and The Rocks Area”~Although a good location The Four Seasons just like any other large hotel. Our room was very quiet but just a view of the back streets. We arrived about 9 a.m. having just left a cruise ship and they did take our luggage for a couple of hours and then we were able to check in which was nice. Good choice at breakfast but this was an extra.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471189830~“Wonderful staff”~We were a group of seven on a business trip but only stayed for one night. Although our stay was brief, the friendly and considerate staff gave us such superior service I would happily return. Two in the group managed rooms with spectacular views and all of us commented on the comfort of the beds. They were actually king beds and not two king singles pushed together.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_471179822~“Lovely, Central Sydney Location”~We had been scheduled to stay in a small hotel near the Sydney Opera House. This is the best area for tourism in Sydney. On reviewing Trip Advisor, we found that recommendations for the Four Seasons were much better, so we switch to the Four Seasons at the last minute. The cost difference was $25 per night. That money was well spent. The Four Seasons is a gorgeous property, a stone throw from the ferry terminal and the opera house. It was at the heart of the downtown activities yet when you went to you room it was quiet and peaceful. We recommend staying at the Four Seasons for any visits to Sydney.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_471059784~“Room with a view”~My husband and I thought we would splurge on an $800 corner suite for the night. The room was very large and the view of the harbour was spectacular. Although beautiful we would think twice before spending money here again, as the room felt a little tired and not subtle, sweet touches to set it apart.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471048176~“does not meet expectations of a four season”~where do I begin. the partial harbor view room was tiny. The bellman and I laughed when he asked me if I wanted my roll aboard bag on a luggage rack -- since there was no room to set one up. the bathroom was also very small. the small # of elevators cannot cope with the volume of guests -- had to wait for multiple elevators to get on. the hotel is in a construction zone (not their fault) but my taxi couldn't find a way to get in. we tried 3 different gps programs (and I know the area since I lived in Sydney before) and we couldn't get there. you have to know to approach the workers ina detour zone to tell them to let you through (I only knew this after I rang the hotel for help) seems like they could have been proactive with that info (cost me an extra $20 going in circles) --  on a positive note -- the housekeeping guy was very polite and helpful; my advice is find another place to stay .~2~1~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
