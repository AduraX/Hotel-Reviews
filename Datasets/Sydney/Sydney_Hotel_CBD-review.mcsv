review_477395860~“Nice 2 night stay at this hotel - but a little noisy.”~We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights after a cruise, it was easy to find and in a pleasant area, easy to get around, lots of places to eat, drink and shop nearby. We arrived early and left our luggage, the front desk staff were always helpful and friendly. Room was an ok size, not huge but enough space for 2 people with a good size bathroom, we were a little paranoid about the sign saying that if the steam from the shower triggered the smoke alarm then there is a charge so tended to stay in the bathroom quite a while after showering. No irons in the room but they are readily available from reception. We had breakfast in the cafe next door which was nice but there are so many choices all around. We did not use public transport as we found it easy to walk all around as the weather was pleasant. Only downside was one night there was some kind of nightclub and it was really loud, not sure if this is a one off or regular occurrence and we did get woken by the rubbish collectors and delivery men about 6am from the pub across the road, also, wifi is not free which in this day and age you tend to take it for granted that its included when it's 10 dollars australian per day. Overall, I would stay here again, location is great, staff great, rooms clean but I would check on the noise levels and maybe ask for a room away from it, but again, this only affected us one out of two nights so no biggie.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~5~nan
review_476651679~“Great location”~Had 1 night here. Great location, close to restaurants and town hall. Double Windows kept noise out. Room small but comfortable. Very clean. Friendly service. Would use this hotel again if price was a little lower.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475749204~“Nice!”~Usually stay at the Radisson next door when in Sydney but decided on this trip to try something different and saved at least half what I would have paid there. Room is somewhat small but new and was comfortable enough for my 2 night stay. Staff is all Chinese and as such speak both English and Chinese. I arrived early so was just planning on dropping my luggage off but the staff was nice enough to assign me a room before normal check-in time. The location is excellent for me near Chinatown. Without hesitation would be happy to stay at this hotel on my next trip to Sydney.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_475413934~“Small room convenient location”~The location of this hotel is among the best in Sydney. It is within walking distance from Chinatown and Darling Harbour. The staff is quite friendly, and upon checking in, we were given 5% of discount and vouchers for free breakfast next door. Breakfast is either Asian style porridge or bacon and eggs, which is good enough for us. The room is very small, but this is understandable for being in the prime area in one of the most expensive real estate cities in the world. A one room apartment along the same street is selling for close to a million AUD.  Facilities are very basic, but for the price, we can't really expect more.  I don't mind staying here again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474392614~“Family rooms are probably perfect for families!”~Excellent location for us - we were attending a conference at the ICC & it was perfect walking distance.  Upon arrival, we were offered a discount for cash and also free daily breakfast...this was a great offer which we snapped up! The breakfast was fantastic, but one morning when they were busy, they just told us to go and have breakfast somewhere else (quite rudely). We went away for 20 minutes and came back. Meanwhile, they had seating reserved for people who hadn't even turned up by the time we returned, were seated, ate our breakfast and left! I'm not 100% certain if the cafe is owned/run by the same people as the Hotel. Room size was not ideal for 4 women with large suitcases. Not really anywhere suitable to put our bags in an already cramped room. Being a family room, it would definitely be more suited to a couple with children. There were night roadworks happening while we were there and we could hear trucks and jack hammering quite clearly from the 4th floor in the middle of the night. The music from the pubs also carried quite well to our room. Overall, we found our stay to be okay. The room was clean, the beds were comfy and the shower was great.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_474369844~“Clean cheap and central”~We stayed for one night and this was the perfect spot right in the middle of the city and close to everything. Although the rooms are very small, it was clean and we only needed it for a bed and shower - perfect - we will be back.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474271521~“Well Located and good prices”~If you are going to stay there just one night, it's OK but two nights is a punishment. The room is extra small and even the washroom has a SLIDING door. The weir design make the washroom extremely big and useless but the room EXTRA small. The good news is the location. You can walk EVERYWHERE. The also work with a shuttle that will charge you (only cash) $18 (AU) p/person to the airport (a taxi would cost you about $60).  Internet is expensive (about $20 for 24 hours) The price of the room includes breakfast but, do not get exited. It's in the chinese restaurant by side and there is NO great selection. Also, what they do NOT tell you is that coffee or tea are EXTRA ! Anyway, for one night it's OK.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473943025~“good value for central position”~We were on the 4th floor. air conditioning worked perfect and the window had double glazing and we heard no road noise. The room was very small but we knew that before arriving. We have stayed in small hotels in Hong Kong and Europe. over there it seems to be the norm. Our bed was clean and comfortable. The pillows were just right. We did have a chair and desk and our bathroom was designed for handicap purposes so was large and modern. The staff were very friendly and we had the complimentary breakfast every day which was a bonus. If you want luxury you pay for it. We prefer to stay budget friendly where it is comfortable and clean and this was so we will return. We have better things to spend our limited income on. We carry our own wifi device. It is much more convenient. Great staff too.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_473488432~“Great location at a fair price...”~Here's the story with the Sydney Hotel CBD - you get what you pay for. On the plus side, the location is absolutely superb and the hotel rate we paid was very reasonable. Staff was very pleasant, free breakfast a nice touch. Downside - Tiny rooms, no frills, wi-fi absolutely terrible. I would recommend if you're out sightseeing all day, staying a night or two and looking to save, not if you'll be spending days and evenings at the hotel. We overall were satisfied with the experience, but going in were not expecting to be in a five-star accommodation.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471816488~“Very clean room ,but small and noisy”~when first arrived we were greeted straight away with very friendly customer service. When we got the room, it was very clean and tidy but cramped and small, had trouble moving around beds once you got your luggage in the door. We stayed on the eigth floor and found the air conditioning unit that serviced the hotel to be very noisy, lucky to get any sleep due to the noise, even when we were offered a soundproof, quiet room. The threat of big fines if steam from the shower set of the fire alarms really put us off even thinking of having a shower there. If the steam lets off the fire alarms, maybe that should look at a better exhaust system. Would recommend if you need a value for money hotel for one night stay. I would possibly stay there again but not on that floor.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_471567352~“Disgusting”~Our room hadn't been cleaned properly in I don't know how long copious amounts of dust really bad mould growing in shower and under the beds looked like a rubbish tip. When approached front reception about the mould they weren't even really interested said oh we may be able to wipe it off...it needs treating not wiping off~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469488838~“Location is in the middle of the city, within walking distance to places a tourist would be interested to see”~Room is clean, no smoking allowed, tidied every day and adequate for 2 people but no chair to seat on. Hotel staff very helpful especially Sarah who even called Expedia for me to talk to and gave me complimentary access to the internet re: my refund problem with early cancellation. Breakfast adequate but voucher given only for one day didn't know that ahead of time, Internet is slow and costly at $10/day. Room is quiet for the most part except for occasional door banging as insensitive people come and go in their rooms. Overall, could be much better if free bkst and free WiFi comes with the $108/night and a chair to seat on instead of the bed.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_468912270~“Great location, friendly helpful staff”~I cannot compliment the staff highly enough. They were very helpful, friendly & so accommodating. From our initial check in to help with printing our boarding passes, they were absolutely a pleasure to deal with. The hotel itself was very well located and within easy reach of the ICC & Darling Harbour itself. We booked a queen room as it was cheapest, but I would have to say there wasn't a lot of room to manoeuvre. Having said that, the room and ensuite were immaculate and it had been our choice. If we were to stay again, I would book a bigger room. Breakfast was in the cafe next door which was included in our price. However, only the main breakfast was included but you did get 50% off everything else on the menu. Again cafe was immaculate & stafff were very nice. All in all, wouldn't hesitate to stay again when visiting Sydney.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_468193954~“Room Was Tiny and with No Furniture”~We were staying in Sydney for two nights in a group of 5 (4 adults & 1 infant). There was one double bed and two single beds. Fair enough we had a wall separating the two groups (one elderly couple + one couple with child) but there was nothing else. Not one chair in the room, no space to leave or unpack luggage apart from laying it on the bed. Interior was also looking old and decrepit. Only thing going for this place was its location, within walking distance of Darling Harbour and Town Hall Train Station.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~3~nan
review_467649889~“Convenient location, but.....”~This hotel is conveniently located near public transportation and CBD but not the nicest area. Room was very small but fine. Bathroom was fine but a bit mildewed along the shower edge. What we didn't appreciate were the extra charges for everything. Wifi was extra (per day). New towels or bed linens cost extra. Breakfast was 'free' next door only for first morning (which was not clear by the booking). 'Free' is in quotes because we had to pay for all drinks, and the breakfast I ordered included spinach, but when I asked the waitress why my plate didn't include spinach the answer was that hotel guests don't get spinach. A small detail, but seems so petty and not very client-friendly. The oddest was the sign hanging in our bathroom (see attached photo). I can't imagine they could actually make this stick...~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466700912~“Great location.....however!!!!!”~This hotel is situated not far from China Town, Darling Harbour and central Sydney. It is close to public transport and a range of eateries of various types and price ranges. The room at first glance was not too bad, it was small, divided into two separate areas, one area for the kids with two single beds and a TV and a separate room with a king bed and TV for the adults, so far so good. The bathroom was also small and was reasonably appointed. The house rule is to change sheets after three days (fair enough) however come day four and no clean sheets, the beds were badly made, cups not washed, general cleaning was quite poor. After a couple of days of poor cleaning we started to look a bit deeper. The room and furniture are quite dusty, the carpets are not really vacuumed properly, the bedding is stained and not the nicest looking and actually made us wonder if the bedding had been changed before we arrived. The king bed was uncomfortable and the doof doof noise coming from the nightclub next door made for really poor sleep. The staff were pleasant enough, but I am afraid we wont be back!~3~nan~nan~2~nan~2~3~nan
review_466191141~“Good location, clean, functional, small room”~This hotel is in a good location, the room was very clean, functional but a very small room, which didn't bother me as I only needed a single room for 1 night. I will stay then again if the price is right.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465488978~“Comfortable and clean”~Just spent 2 nights at this hotel. Room was small but clean and comfortable. Bathroom was very nice. Staff helpful, cafe next door for breakfast very nice. Location very good. Worth booking if your only passing through Sydney.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464976150~“Great Location, amazing service”~Very close to public transportation, nice spotlessly clean room with comfortable bed. Staff is very attentive and helpful, Sarah printed off map and bus route for our trip to Bondi. Kept our luggage and stored isulin in their fridge. Breakfast at cafe next door was delicious. After a very long plane ride, it was a pleasure to find this hotel. Would definitely recommend as a reasonable hotel in an expensive city.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464904968~“Great location”~Very centrally located hotel with a compact room with good appointments but the room wasn't as clean as it should have been plus they wanted to charge for wifi! We've travelled throughout Asia & never been charged!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464649606~“Location, location, location....PLUS! Couldn't ask for more!”~Paying what I did, I didn't expect much, and got a wonderful room, with a window side to side of about 10 ft. and 6 ft. high. on 5th floor, so no noise coming from anywhere. The men manning the main desk could not have been more professional, nice, etc etc. And after getting to know the city, I couldn't have asked for a better location. I would revisit this hotel again, if it wasn't for them raising the room price after this/my report. LOL BTW.... bathroom was a 5star type! AND breakfast served at next door restaurant, included.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463114746~“LOVELY STAY”~I booked the standard queen ages ago with a special request for higher floor and we got level 2. There was barely room to move and hubby felt like climbing the walls. There was a small Harry Potter room to the side with a small bed where we managed to put our suitcases. On this level the smells of Asian cooking wafed through so definitely recommend higher floor.  The room was modern and clean and daily housekeeping were the saving grace.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462395758~“Good Location”~Located in Liverpool St close to Geoge St, a short walk to Town Hall Station, Queen Victoria Building, and all the magnificent shops, restaurants and coffee shops in the array of arcades in the CBD including Pitt St Mall. This hotel is on the edge of China Town with endless restaurants to choose from, a short walk to The Chinese Gardens, Paddy's Markets, Darling Harbour, The Maritime Museum, The Sydney Aquarium and Capitol Theatre. There is so much to do and see in Sydney, this hotel is in an ideal location for travelers. The Hotel appeared to be recently refurbished, it was clean, comfortable, quiet and value for money. I will be telling my friends, give it a try.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_461784290~“Despite being cheap, still poor value for money. Avoid if you're on business.”~The only thing going for this place is its location. Taking into account it's a budget hotel, you'd be better off paying the difference for a slightly more expensive place, as this represents poor value for money for the dollars you will be charged. Downsides - the room was small, the whole of the second floor had an unpleasant odour about it (including the room, but no point asking for a new room as it affected the entire floor). Biggest disappointment was the lack of a window and any form of daylight. If you're trying to do any work on a business trip, be aware the advertised "desk" is tiny and not big enough to have your laptop and A4 folder open on. Internet is charged at an additional AU$10 per day and there's a notice on the bathroom that if you leave the door open and steam sets off the fire alarm, you'll be billed $1280 for the fire brigade fee. No iron and ironing board in the room, you can order one from housekeeping but you'll be expected to go down to reception and fetch it yourself. Add on a 2.5% credit card fee when you pay at reception (over and above any price you've been quoted). The tiny, windowless room suffered from a noisy air conditioning or machinery unit nearby. Fortunately on this trip, we weren't in the room very much. The positives? The bed was comfortable and clean and the rain shower in the bathroom was very nice, with plenty of hot water. Just don't use it too much if you're worried about the steam leaving you with an unplanned $1280 bill caused by a poor fire detection system! Not a good stay and well worth paying a little more for a better hotel nearby. Alternatively pay the same and stay at a quality backpackers in a single room with a window. It's about the same standard in my opinion.~2~nan~nan~nan~1~3~1~nan
review_461581381~“Kinda small but pretty good in all”~If you're claustrophobic, stay right away from this place! The room was really, really small. Quite possibly the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed at.  However, that doesn't detract from its charm, (even though you can't actually walk to the other side of the bed and need to go over the mattress).  The place is really clean and everything in the room works efficiently. A good climate control system, comfy bed, decent TV, a pretty good bathroom are all featured here, nestled nicely away at a prime location in the Sydney CBD area. The hotel is clean, staff are super polite, too. Check-in and checkout were a breeze, with no issues during our stay here.  Wi-fi is not available at this hotel, by the way, so ensure you've got something to keep you connected if you so wish. Location wise, it's within walking distance to both Museum and Town Hall stations, and in close proximity to Chinatown.  The value for money offered here is rather good for the location and will pretty much be the cheapest place you can find that is actually decent to stay in. I wouldn't stay here long term as it's far too cramped for my liking, but for the long weekend? Absolutely. I will be making this my preferred place of stay in Sydney from now on.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460231805~“Great location and good value for the price”~We were in Sydney for 6 nights and this hotel was a good choice for us. The location is wonderful, just a few blocks from Darling Harbor. Breakfast next door was included in our price which was convenient. Staff was very nice overall but Sarah went out her way to be helpful to us whenever we saw her. Housekeeping could be a bit better and laundry on site would have been a plus. Having to wait for the steam in the bath to dissipate before opening the door or set off the fire alarm seemed a bit much. Also the room lighting was a bit dim. AC worked very well.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_460193804~“Good for seeing the city”~Great location right in the centre of the CBD, just off George St near Town Hall station. The free breakfast was OK, but we'd preferred for them to have just taken the money off the cost of the room. Very small room, and poorly translated English on signs and notices around the place. Friendly staff, though they didn't give us an explanation of how to turn on the power in the room. (Put the room key in the slot just inside the door).~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458572185~“Staff negligence”~Rang hotel three days prior to visit to arrange parking and was told address of car park they had a deal with. Typed address into notes on phone.   On arrival booked in to hotel and confirmed car park address then drove car up and parked which was four city blocks away. Come back with ticket to pay for parking, the staff had changed behind counter by then and we where told this was the wrong carpark.   We where then told to go change carparks. We didnt have enough time to do this as we where running late for concert. We told them the car would have to stay there as it was their fault for giving us wrong instructions and we didnt have time to change.   In short next morning management refused to admit liability for their instructions even after they admitted that this had happened before.  Parking cost 80 dollars for one night Staff were rude uncooperative when faced with a problem, some staff cant understand english properly. My recommendation is stay clear of this establishment after this experience~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456629373~“Very central and nice staff, but a bit old”~Super central position, nice and smiling staff. I liked the bathroom, which is brand new, and the bed was very comfortable. The room is actually split in three parts: 1. entrance with wardrobe, desk, minibar; 2. bathroom; 3. bedroom. Lots of space to leave luggage and stuff you buy. On the downside, their fire alarm system is SO OLD that they warn you not to open the bathroom door right after having a shower because the steam would trigger the alarm. Ridiculous. Now on top of this, a leaflet in the bathroom tells you that if the alarm is triggered, you would even have to pay a pretty hefty fine for the false alarm. Needless to say that aside from being careful, I would never pay for any fine as the quality of the alarm system is definitely not my responsibility. Last thing is that the bedroom in itself was pretty small: it's OK, still comfortable, but you can barely open the door.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456612050~“Practical”~Handy location in the heart of the city, not far from Darling Harbour. Nothing flash, but comfortable and clean. Has a brekkie deal with the cafe next door. Staff were helpful, but kept on reminding me that it was a non-smoking hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455770164~“Cute little place ”~We enjoyed our stay here. Super clean and just what we needed, although a bit small. About 15 minute walk to Circular Quay and extremely close to Darling Harbor.

We walked EVERYWHERE. The staff were so friendly, they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The hotel has a deal with the cafe next door who does a great breakfast for you half price. I definitely recommend staying here if you want a budget central hotel~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_453908473~“Well Placed CBD Hotel”~Finding a decent hotel in Sydney's crowded CBD district is no easy task. Sydney Hotel CBD does not do a bad job of satisfying this requirement. This hotel is in a refurbished older building, but the fitout has been well-done and is modern. There are two lifts and a set of stairs to the upper levels. The rooms are quite modern, with ensuite bathroom, but are not what you might call spacious. There is enough room for a bed, a table and that is just about it. Sound-proofing is a problem in this hotel, with voices from the hall and other rooms being apparent. The staff are more then courteous and try to help - we had several changes to check-out times and the staff were amazingly patient, helping as much as they could. The breakfast is an unusual arrangement, with the hotel providing a voucher for food in the cafe next door, but not including coffee. Back in the room, the TV and air-conditioning work a treat, and the bed is firm and the linen clean. The location of this hotel provides easy access to Town Hall Railway station, a taxi rank just around the corner, buses down George Street (not running at the moment due to the new tram line being built), and of course Chinatown/Thai Town. We noticed quite a number of Chinese speaking guests, so I would guess that the staff are fairly proficient in the Chinese language. One of the rather unusual aspects of this hotel is that if you shower with the fan off (light off, actually, since both fan and light switch on together) it will set off the fire alarm and you can be hit with a fire call-out fee of $1,000+. Those of you who like showering without the light or fan on, be warned!! :-) Overall, I will be back.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_451572354~“Perfect location”~We stayed at the Sydney hotel cbd for 5 days. The hotel was in a perfect location for Darling Harbour, train stations and places to visit and eat.  We used Kent House that was next door for our breakfasts, it was excellent value for money we had their full brekki for $7. Breakfast was half price if you stayed at the hotel. Would recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_450848106~“Lucky Dip”~I've stayed here with my girlfriend 3 or 4 times. A newly refurbished building in the heart of the Sydney CBD. We kept coming back because of the great value. The only problem is that it's a total lucky dip as to your quality of stay. The first time we stayed we had an unbelievable room, brilliant bathroom, brilliant views, nothing to complain about.  However, the 2 stays that followed were a little underwhelming. The stay was still great, though the room was completely different. The size of the bathroom and the amenities within were far inferior to our first stay, and our view was of a brick wall with a very obscured vision of the street. Our overall room area was also much smaller. Though the clincher was our most recent stay - 17th - 19th of December 2016. I understand it's Xmas holiday bookings time and there are going to be some issues, but we booked several months in advance. On this occasion our room was absolutely tiny and tucked away in a corner which was clearly not meant to be a hotel room. We arrived and were immediately struck by the fact that we had a view directly onto a sort of shaft, surrounded by brick wall on all sides. There was lots of rubbish everywhere as well as random planks, other materials and big air conditioning units. But then we started getting changed to go out, and two air-con mechanics poked their heads up! They were no more than 2 metres away from us and just sitting around sipping on drinks, having a chat. About 5 minutes later, the hammering starts. This continued for several hours. They eventually stopped around about 9pm from memory. As frustrating as this was - and it being impossible to hear the TV or do pretty much anything else in the room - was not the end of the world. However, at about 6-7am, the banging started again. We had drilling and hammering noises that were so loud and close it sounded like it was coming from our room (worth noting that this wasn't the air-con people, but something else entirely). This continued until about midday. We had an absolutely abysmal nights sleep and woke up feeling like death.  This may have been forgiven if we had been warned prior to our stay. They did not even mention it at check-in. There was a smaller-than-A4 sized piece of paper in the lift saying that there would be building works from specified times. But this is simply unacceptable. It's all well and good to apologise, but using a little sign in a lift after you've already taken our money is just not on. We would've taken our business elsewhere.  To top it off we were charged $10 for Wi-fi, but it was essentially wasted money. We wanted to watch some Netflix in our room but couldn't load more than 5-10 minutes of the show after waiting 2+ hours. The connection speed was worse than just using the internet hotspot on your phone. Oh yeah, you have to specify when you want to check in/ out because they don't always have an attendant. If your flight is delayed or you want to do something else, you could well be left in the lobby for hours.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan

review_449798722~“Great little boutique hotel for those on a budget”~Visiting Sydney during the expensive xmas/new year period can be challenging for those on a budget. This value-for-money hotel ticked all the boxes - comfortable beds, polite and friendly staff, very clean room and a great location (only a 10 min walk to Darling Harbour). The twin room was adequate in size for my friend and I and the double glazing on the windows kept out the traffic noise. Despite the hotel being fully booked, there was no noise from any of the other rooms. Air conditioner worked well and the bathroom was roomy. The staff were happy to assist when required, and we received a box of chocolates from the management as a new year's gift. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for value for money and doesn't mind staying in a room that is on the 'cosy' side.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Requested to change room, but the conditions are even worse! There are stain on the beddings, hair dust dirt under the blanket We end up request for refund and need to change hotel immediately  We are generous enough to pay for the 2 nights we got bitten by fleas, but we hope no one else will get this experience so it is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED to stay in this hotel! 我們訂了5晚住，房間小也算 連行李都只能免強裝下 第一晚被蚤咬 叫他們清潔 可看圖 第二晚被咬得更慘  要求轉房 竟然床被上有污積！床被下滿是頭髮 灰塵 污積！ 最後搞得我們要立即轉酒店！ 我們付了被蚤咬的2晚房錢真的很慷慨了 還搞得我們要東找西找新酒店住！ 希望不會有人再有這樣經驗！所以千萬別入住！~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446544831~“Acceptable - Barely”~Check-in was fine, had to wait for a bit as the receptionist wasn't there (but there was a sign). Got a room on the 7th floor, the amenities included a hair dryer, a water boiler with instant coffee (That alone earns a star from me - I like coffee in my hand ASAP). Soap, Shampoo and towels.  The problem here was the following : Whatever it is next door did not stop banging until late into the night, it was very hard to sleep.  2nd : There was some bug in the hotel that bit me in two places, I ended up itching my way through the day.  Pros : Location was great  I only stayed there for one night, when I needed to get away from the hostel I was staying at to sleep and have some privacy. Unfortunately, I couldn't really sleep, but I did get the privacy.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~5~nan

review_444950862~“Great Location - great Value”~We stayed twice at this hotel in October - 1 night stay each time. We were in town to go to the theatre and this hotel was a perfect location for both trips. First time, the twin room was a good size, nice shower and comfortable. Second time, the 2 bed room suite was on the small size. In hindsight, it would have been more comfortable to get 2 rooms for only about $10 more. Will stay again though.- it is clean and not noisy, (from other guests or road noise) and there is a good cafe for breakfast down stairs. Staff at reception friendly and very helpful~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_444087643~“Short stay for two days in Dec”~Excellent staff at the reception desk. Very cheerful and ready to help. All staff is always smile and welcome you. The family room with 1 double bed and 1 single bed has a private room for parents with a door. Each room has a satelite TV. Not much choice with room with windown view. The room is not that big, will need to stack luggages on top each others. Good air conditioner system. Has a free safe to store your valuables.  Plenty of reataurants you can choose. Short walk or just outside the hotel. China town is about 5 min walk from the hotel. Coles supermarket just at the corner of traffic light opposites the Hotel. 2 mins walk. We were given free vouchers for having breakfast next door. Save $10 or more per person per day. CONS: The only thing that hotel does not have FREE internet. You have to pay $10/day.  If internet is provided free like other hotels in Sydney, the hotel has all good thing. No complain. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442945972~“quick pub food”~We were on the way to the recital hall for an early concert and trying to find some food on a Saturday evening. Not a lot of places were open at 5:15. CBD pub was friendly and welcoming. Streetside sitting, pretty standard menu but nicely cooked, a good glass of prosecco and we are set! We'll probably eat here again when in Sydney.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_442813036~“What a little gem”~My partner and I stayed in the Sydney hotel for two nights on the 20th and 22nd of November. When we first wentry heigh the door I didnt think much of the place, but we registered and awaited our room as we were early. When we went into our room what a lovely surprise, big it was not but the curtains were beautiful quality, the bathroom was very well stocked with things I didn't expect, such as a comb and the usual shampoo then there was show shines moistetiser, a shower mit. In the bedroom was individual wrapped slippers, (which I found so cute) the bed had a stunning Chinese runner across it all tea and coffee making facilities, the only odd thing was that you have to go to the cafe next door for breakfast, (but it was a lovely breakfast) . This little Chinese run hotel is beautiful in its simplictiy but we'll worth a visit all the same with very caring and pleasant staff. I would deffinatlty come here again .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440962745~“Good value for money”~We were pleasantly surprised by this busy little hotel. Welcoming very friendly staff. Small, clean and comfortable room. It was all we needed for an overnight stay in the CBD. An easy walk to Darling Harbour and a few kilometres to Circular Quay from here although it's only 2 blocks to either Town Hall or Museum train Stations. There are many options for great food, China Town is just down around the corner and Darling Harbour has many choices. We found it very convenient. The complimentary breakfast was an added bonus plus not having to pay for the wifi was also appreciated. We used the airport train to travel to and from the airport but for about the same price there is a shuttle that can be organised. We would definitely stay again. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440447064~“We did not like it at all.”~If you do not care about hotel accommodations and only value the location than this hotel is a great option for you. Otherwise, ... We stayed in very small room with pretty much bed and the bathroom (not what you see in hotel website booklet). Completely blinded window with no easy access to. To dress up appropriately we had to step outside in the morning to check a weather conditions. In addition there is a construction activities and substantial noise in the building was going everyday from 8:30AM to 6PM that made our stay in the room during this time practically impossible. It was nothing in hotel ad mentioning any construction work happening there.~2~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_440008461~“Convenient, Comfortable, Clean!”~We stayed here for 3 nights last October, it's a pretty convenient location since we needed one that's close to the consulate from the country I came from and it has to be near a train station so we can go around exploring afterwards. The room was cleaned regularly and it was comfortable to sleep in.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_439806265~“Not ready, not clean, not relaxing, not happy.”~Upon arriving my partner and I were told that our room wasn't ready, this time was 12:30. As tourists, we went around Sydney until late to come back and get comfortable in our room for it to only be the size comfortable to fit one horse.  We were awoken by the noise of drilling of some sort at 8:30 in the morning.  I'm constantly stepping over our bags to get to the door way. Needless to say our view of a brick wall was lovely.  Luckily we're here only for two nights until our cruise. Definitely won't be coming back unless last LAST resort option.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437735719~“Smart classy meeting place”~A cool place on a hot afternoon to meet friends or business contacts. Always vibrant with efficient staff and a happy, fun vibe. This visit was more business than pleasure, though the quality candy did bring back memories of the riotous times on all floors! A great lunchtime restaurant on the first floor is also well worth the visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
