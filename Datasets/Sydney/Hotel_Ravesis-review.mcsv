review_477866209~“Amazing building, but the noise level is annoying”~This is a wonderful iconic building on the amazing Bondi, with excellent location and amazing views. Unfortunately, the hotel also has a pub with a wrap around balcony right below your windows, which negates all that's good about this hotel. The noise is unbearable - loud (and not necessarily good) live music until late, lots of drunk people and the typical annoying pub noise in your room like you'd be in the pub all the time. Closing the windows and the curtains helps a bit, but not much - and what's the point of being at the beach with beautiful views if you need to stay with everything closed? It's a shame, because this could be a an awesome place, but there is nothing relaxing about staying there - you cannot enjoy what it has to offer.~1~1~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_477273829~“Amazing terrace off bedroom overlooking iconic Bondi”~Service at reception was friendly, fast and efficient. Hallways leading up to room could do with an update in appearance.  Our Deluxe Split level Beachfront room was quite large and impressive, but i did not like the bathroom being on the bottom floor, with the bedroom being on the upper floor. The terrace off our bedroom was memorable, very large and had an impressive view of Bondi Beach. The hotel is located in a fantastic location on Bondi Beach close to cafes and restaurants. We ordered a cheese platter for room service and we found the service very slow for a dish that did not need to be cooked (1 hour).~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_476344114~“a crisp art deco dream at an iconic location”~Being stranded at Sydney airport due to bad weather disruptions to Lord Howe, this was a welcome find after two nights at the airport. Grabbed one of the two front facing rooms available, unfortunately only for one night and was welcomed cheerfully just before lunchtime at this art deco landmark. Valet parking is provided for as little as AUD 20. The rooms are fully refurbished respecting the historic character of the building with Juliet balconies and of course the view on the bay and its Norfolk pines. During this weekday there was no noise and one could sleep with open windows. Breakfast is not provided, but you can grab a very nice selection at the nearby coffee shop and take it to your room. This is Australia with high labor costs and this place is value for money indeed. Lost even face when wanting to tip the guy who brought me the car around upon departure: "We are in Australia and I have a very good salary and am happy to work here". Will never ever attempt to tip again in Australia! When there going to the famous rockpool with its crashing waves is a must, but ask the Ravesi for towels, they run out of them quite often at the pool.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_471924338~“Best Bondi Hotel”~My wife and I visited Sydney as part of our 35-year anniversary. Hotel Ravesis had a surprise bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us in our room. We had reserved the top floor room; the one shown in their photos with the sunroom sitting area. The views of Bondi beach were incredible. The downstairs bar had live music every night. The staff was wonderful and made our stay memorable.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_451408887~“Quick Escape”~I am currently in one of the refurbished rooms as I type - what a great little property this is. We have a 'side view' room which you can easily see the beach from two large windows that open out onto small balconies. The refurbished room is well appointed with nice toiletries and a comfortable bed. We ate dinner at the restaurant and it was great, had an awesome seat on the balcony looking out over the beach. The hotel has a relaxed 'Miami' type vibe about it. Staff have been friendly. You cannot beat the location to the beach, cafes and are right in the midst of Bondi at this property. I suspect noise from the street might be an issue tonight, but that's hardly the hotels fault. I highly reccomend this property for a reasonably priced beach get away.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_450344259~“Mixed feelings”~Pros: spacious clean room, very comfortable bed & pillows, and we couldn't hear any noise from our room number 14. Cons: I couldn't believe we were paying $465.00 per night for a executive suite with such an appalling looking balcony with a filthy floor, gross exposed guttering, rusty furniture, dirty sun lounger and ugly looking falling apart fan. And it was no comfort to that the receptionist could only extend an apology on our departure saying they are in the process of renovating the rooms and ours had not yet been done.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_450320159~“Great accommodation”~We stayed one night on Saturday night. 10/10 location. 10/10 room. Was worried about the noise as i read other comments. Yes it is noisy from the music and traffic, but we used ear plugs and didn't hear a thing, had a great sleep. And valet carparking.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450260899~“Great in and out”~We needed a spot for the night while our Sydney home was fumigated for bugs so thought a night at the beach. The rooms are big and modern thought the balconies are a little enclosed but I guess they are doing what they can with the space and it has a slightly Art Deco feel to it. The money shot is the location though and as someone who lives in the inner west it's so nice to be able to get up and jump in the sea. I've always come for drinks here and Ill certainly be coming back for more nights away when I'm staying close to home. One pointer - be careful of traffic wardens. We parked outside while we took our baby inside and the cat was let unattended for 2 minutes only for us to get a $100 fine. They're ruthless... so many great places to eat nearby too....~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446191020~“Great location but noisy”~The hotel is in a great spot relative to the rest of Bondi if that is what you are looking for. Its handy to the beach and restaurants, etc. I stayed there one Saturday night and there was music playing most of the night which was not associated with the hotel but still made it difficult to sleep. This is only an issue on weekends apparently.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_445396507~“Quick Bondi fix”~My Fiancé and I and Bub had an awesome stay in Room 12. RM 12 has the most spectacular and massive enclosed balcony with the best views available in Bondi. Jody (Jodie?) at the front desk was amazingly helpful and literally could not have done more to help us. She is a true gem for he business. Thank you for a most enjoyable night.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437215848~“Amazing Bondi Beach Views in Modern Hotel”~Staff were very friendly and helpful. Lovely room with amazing balcony overlooking Bondi Beach. Valet parking in Bondi for $20 a day! Right in the heart of Bondi close to lots of amazing restaurants, cafes, shops and the famous Bondi Beach! Lovely room with all the creature comforts.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_432551240~“Probably the best in Bondi.”~We stayed for 1x night last Thursday night as a spontaneous trip. Luckily we were able to get the King room with beach views just by walking in. I'd seen a few of the other hotels that day and had almost given up hope of finding something nice until I saw the room at Ravesis. The rooms are not quite 5-star (the carpet is quite old and not one I would be comfortable walking on barefoot, for example) but the best I found in Bondi and the staff are all lovely though and very obliging and provided friendly service - thank you~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_429207941~“In the heart of it all”~We had a wonderful stay in Ravesi's hotel. The rooms are large and modern and the location is perfect, the beach is just across the road and at night you will not find this place boring. There are so many restaurant and bars around Bondi beach you just have to take your pick. We had our infant son with us and they were considerate to put a crib in the room for us. He loved it as the rooms were specious and he had plenty of space to crawl around. We loved it because it was comfortable and close to Messina! Overall, a wonderful stay. If I could keep this place a secret, I would. But they deserve a good review.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_425433099~“Good mid-week experience.”~Spent one night in the premier split level room with views. Very comfortable and the service was warm and friendly. Attention to detail would have resulted in a five star review ( curtain sagging off hooks at one end). The meal in the restaurant was nice, but not mind-blowing....great service again though! The views really make this place~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422256096~“Romantic and surprisingly quiet”~A little Paris romance can be had in this great beachside boutique hotel - comfortable and clean with a mini bar that doesn't rip you off. $6 for antipodes water (have stayed in a 5 star city hotel that charged double that).  French doors open up onto 2 x Juliette balconies - with a view that's far from Paris - would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422239004~“Paris in Bondi”~Gorgeous boutique hotel in Bondi - felt a little like being in a hotel in Paris. Spent a Sunday night here was quite with French doors opening up onto two Juliet balconies - of course the view wasn't anything like a busy Parisian Street! Should have packed my swimmers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419724862~“Let down by all night bar noise”~We just had a lovely anniversary weekend end here. The staff were friendly and went out of their way for us, offered us $20 parking (an absolute bonus in Bondi), which was waivered when there was a problem. We had a lovely spacious room - a great view and location. The decor however, could do with a lift and the bottom of cupboard doors flaking off, not so great paint job and no full length mirror). Otherwise it was very adequate; with local ground coffee and a free beer - which put a smile on hubby's face. The shower is awesome (a must) but the bed not the most comfy. The room and linen were clean with nice toiletries supplied.  The major downfall was the bar downstairs is very loud. The sound of the music and party goers travels though the hotel and one cannot sleep it is so loud. Luckily the noise stopped just after midnight, so we were able to get some sleep. Please take note of this before you book - if you join the club downstairs for the party, you'll have a great stay.~3~nan~5~1~nan~nan~5~nan
review_417906671~“Very Disappointing ”~Made reservation to dine at the restaurant and attended on a Sunday evening only to arrive and notice that not many people were in attendance. Nevertheless we were seated and upon looking at the menu which was very limited and disappointing we thought it best to leave which we did.  Would not recommend if your looking for choice on a menu.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410802937~“Great location, ”~Stayed here recently on a trip to Sydney, is located right on the pulse of Bondi. Room is nice and clean, has free wifi, foxtel (if you care), the balcony area needs a bit of love due to the coastal location, they have valet parking for $20 per night which we took advantage of, overall accommodation was fine.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_406065952~“Best views”~The best views of Bondi beach. It is a great spot to enjoy the views without the elements of the weather. Unfortunately the food was not as great. The pizza was soggy. The dumplings were average. Such a shame the food wasn't better. Have a drink at the bar don't bother about the food. Service was ok.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393529464~“Amazing location, reasonably priced”~We stayed in the one bedroom apartment, which was well equipped and maintained and had a gorgeous view of the beach if you stand on the balcony. Website lacks photos and info. The lady at reception was friendly and professional. Overall a good place to stay but not a luxurious hotel if that's what you're into.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_392445320~“Avoid staying here unless you are partying”~Stayed here hoping for some downtime and to enjoy a reasonably low key Saturday night in Bondi. Unfortunately the music in the bar (which is directly below the rooms) was cranked up from around 9pm until 1am. As it's such an old hotel doors can continually be heard slamming, plus plenty of squealing from pipes and vents in the ceiling. Management weren't too fussed when these issues were raised the next day and so far haven't bothered to get back in touch. If you're there to party, put up with the noise (and on-going major internal renovations of the hotel) and happy to part with $300 for a basic room, this place is for you!  Plenty of other better alternatives in Bondi.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384612444~“Top location in Bondi”~Super location, great vantage point to watch the world go by. Good food and drinks selection. Good facility to sit on high chairs by the windows / open sides of the building. I did not stay in the hotel but used their bar/restaurant facility.  Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_371105077~“Fantastic Stay”~Loved my stay here! EXCELLENT location- right opposite Bondi Beach, plus many restaurants/cafes in the vicinity and right near a bus stop. Room was clean and a good size and all staff were friendly. They offer $20 valet parking which is extremely helpful and very reasonably well priced- definitely eases the pain of trying to find parking in Bondi. Our room was a split suite, meaning the lounge room and bedroom were upstairs and the bathroom was downstairs- this was well planned as you couldn't hear the noise from the restaurant/bar while in bed/watching TV. Free, unlimited internet and foxtel are awesome! Ordered room service for one night- they don't charge a room service charge and it came quickly which was great. Overall, a fantastic hotel and I will defintely be recommending to my friends.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_367174481~“Great views”~We had drinks on the balcony overlooking the beach. Fantastic views and drinks reasonably priced.

review_365006415~“Great views of Bondi and the passing parade of people!”~Pull up a chair at the open front windows (on a warm day) or view from the upstairs balcony, very relaxing. Very clean and upmarket hotel. Very trendy and well run, stylish and good clientele. Soak in the views with reasonably priced drinks.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356170604~“Great location”~This is the perfect location close to the beach, shops and restaurants. The rooms were fine but it does need modernising and the price is a bit high for the room. The main issue is the noise as they have a very popular bar downstairs which closes late.  My suggestion is that if you are looking for a quiet weekend away don't stay here in particular if you are over 40.  Otherwise very comfortable and pleasant~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_349891267~“Great views, delicious food! ”~This place has the best location with fabulous views of Bondi.  We ate upstairs on the balcony overlooking the beach with friends before a wedding.  Being pregnant I can't drink but staff were more than accomodating happy to make any cocktails in an alcohol free version for me.  Expecting a standard pub menu, I was very pleased with a mix of options. The chicken and lime dumplings were amazing. All of us were really happy with our meals, loved it here!  Service was friendly and fun too. Prices were reasonable.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_348321183~“Great Room in Boring Bondi”~If you have to go to Bondi stay here it's very good. We had Hay street facing room it was large and comfortable with a nice Balcony.

review_348315918~“Tattered, Old, Run down!”~The location pretty good & bed firm enough. However, room and bar/restaurant area not updated! Old, and torn carpet. Also, no electricity outlet in bathroom--I had to plug in wall in main room area and no mirror or tabletop close to set anything down i.e.; hairdryer etc. I don't understand how some of the 'reviews' get approved to be on this website!!~2~nan~nan~2~1~nan~3~nan

Very comfy bed, shower excellent.. Views variable depending on what window... beach to the right, construction site opposite. The room would have had a much better ambience but for its dated, dark decor and dull gray/brown paint.Good value ($200) I would stay there again.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_341069829~“Great location but.......”~Hotel is located in a great spot! The bar and restaurant are very nice and modern. The DJ on Sunday was great also!  Our room was clean but desperately needs a renovation. FOXTEL was provided but never worked as no signal -  The toilet is on the lower level so a bit of an inconvenience at night time. The chairs on the balcony were all broken but the view was beautiful -  Bed was comfy to sleep on - and they gave you free WIFI which is a bonus in Australia!!  Location warrants the room price - but the room doesn't warrant he price at all -~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Helpful and welcoming staff on the 24 hour reception desk. Remember that you are staying above a bar so expect to hear music until about midnight on weekends. Free wifi but it didn't work very well. Would definitely stay here again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_313431036~“Great Location. ”~Stayed on a Tuesday night. We were met upon arrival, which was early by a lovely member of staff. They informed us that our room was ready and we could check in. She was professional, friendly and very helpful with questions we had about the area. Room was lovely with a great view. We only had a cocktail in the restaurant but that was great and the view from the veranda was wonderful. The only negative was that it was a little noisy with the band downstairs which carried on until late. Check out was a breeze and once again the staff were very friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

At $275 a nite is pricey BUT location is great. I will come back coz of its location. Beach view, lively atmosphere and mny things todo. Hotel is clean with friendly staff but hotel infrastructure is a bit old~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan~3~nan
review_254204164~“Location, location, location”~The room is less than ideal, let's get that out if the way. And we booked one of the better rooms. But still, I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. We had a great beach-front view. The view was so good, the hotel didn't need anything else to sell itself. The furnishings and bedding were good enough. The restaurant was better than good enough. The staff was as good as it gets, warm, gracious, knowledgable and helpful; they were without exception hospitality pros of the highest caliber, and uniformly attractive and cheerful as well!~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_249229227~“Great location & nice rooms, but pricey and far too noisy”~We spent two nights at this hotel in late December and were generally pleased. It has a perfect location right on Bondi Beach, and is close to everything. Staff were helpful and discreet, and the room was in excellent condition. We stayed in room 5, a beach front room with balcony, which was excellent in terms of facilities and comfort but very noisy. The windows could do with double glazing to diminish street noise, as well as output from the bar directly below. For this price, which is quite high for this level of hotel in Sydney, double glazed windows should really be mandatory because you can't open the windows in the evening and get a good nights sleep. It's direct on the main strip of Bondi and there's noise at all hours of the day, whether its early morning buses, drunks, car alarms, the hotel bar, whatever. So overall we were happy with the location, the staff and the hotel, but felt it wasn't great value because after two days we left absolutely exhausted from a lack of sleep. I wouldn't stay here again if management doesn't address this issue.~4~2~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_241621310~“great location”~We spent our last night in Australia here and even though we had a side room with no view, we had a huge balcony where we had our lunch in the sunshine, the receptionist on check in and out was very friendly and efficient, as was the guy who parked our car. Our room was interesting as the bathroom was as you walked in the door and then you went upstairs to the bedroom! We ate in the restaurant, the food was very good and we enjoyed the view of the beach.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
