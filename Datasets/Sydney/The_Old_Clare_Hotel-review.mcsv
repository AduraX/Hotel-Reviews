review_477626396~“Sydney opera and a gorgeous boutique hotel stay !”~This is a really wonderful hotel which has been transformed still with a great deal of respect for its past life . It is in a perfect position in Sydney we walked everywhere and when we didn't we caught ubers . Close to great Coffie shops and bakeries and the amazing white rabbit gallery! A must in Sydney . The staff are all very helpful and extremely professional. I have recommended this hotel to a great deal of my clients and friends and everyone that has had the opportunity to stay has been extremely happy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477262935~“Recipe for a wonderful weekend!”~From the welcome to check-out, the service & comfort was exceptional. The room was spacious, spotless, and we love the styling.

review_474840140~“Amazing Customer Service”~My stay at the Old Clare was spectacular. The rooms were clean, modern, high ceilings and incredible natural light. I was traveling for business and the location to spice alley and surrounding made it feel more like a vacation. The customer service was incredible. I called down for a yoga matt one morning and after I had an email with local yoga studios in the area. Can not wait to come back.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473355940~“Fantastic Hotel with Superior Service”~My husband and I spent our first wedding anniversary at the Clare Hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel itself is something out of the norm, with lots of great, quirky features. It's in a good location and spotlessly clean. The service was second to none. I'd mentioned in some correspondence that it was our anniversary and on arrival we were congratulated and presented with a drinks voucher for two to help us celebrate. Our room was also upgraded. We will be venturing back there sometime soon :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473324339~“Big. Great neighbourhood. ”~I am always looking for interesting well priced hotels travelling for business and keen to pass on to my clients a "reasonable" hotel bill. In Sydney that can be very hard. But this is a really interesting renovation in a great part of town a 2 km walk to the CBD. Lots of restaurants etc around and very close to train station to the airport. I will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473150395~“Unbelievable Quality”~We stayed at The Old Clare Hotel for one night as a treat following an extensive road trip in a camper van. We had arranged valet parking when we booked the hotel, so contacted the hotel reception to arrange collection of our car once we had arrived to the hotel. The hotel reception were very welcoming and arranged for our bags to be taken up to our room. The hotel is beautifully restored with quirky details and original features. Upon checking in the reception notified us that we had been upgraded from the Connell room to the one of two Show Room Suites! We couldn't believe how lucky we were and how beautiful and spacious it was. It was very much appreciated! Everything about the hotel, facilities and room oozes quality. The hotel was quiet and clean and although positioned further south from the harbour, there are plenty of taxis around and the train station is within walking distance. The roof top pool is perfect to cool off with a good view of the city (no view of the harbour). There is a restaurant down stairs or you have the option to order room service. The food is good quality but pricey.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472544398~“Amazing Hotel and even more amazing service ”~Stayed at the Old Clare Hotel for my boyfriends birthday. After looking at photos online and reading reviews I knew my stay would be amazing, however I wanted a few extras to make the night special. The assistance I received from Alice was above and beyond anything I have ever experienced with any Hotel worldwide. She went above and beyond simply recommending ideas to truly tailoring such a personalised stay- anything I asked was not too much trouble (even getting a Messina cake delivered for our arrival- which was truly a dream come true for the birthday boy)  I could not recommend this Hotel highly enough and compliments to Alice who is truly an invaluable employee.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472243325~“Unique, Designer Hotel, Close to Everything!”~This hotel is definitely unique in its design and presentation, which we loved.  Good: Cool, one of a kind design. Very clean. Beautifully comfortable beds and linen. Great location between CBD, Glebe, Newtown and Surry Hills.  Bad: Lack of privacy regarding the toilet in the room - only frosted glass wall dividing you from the rest of the room. The Bar called last drinks at 11:40pm on a Friday night. Apart from the building itself, the experience didn't really feel "5 star" compared to other hotels we have stayed at, especially given premium prices.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472038700~“Paaartyyyy!!!”~Great place to stay if this is what you want to do. Not appropriate for business travellers. Loud bar in the lobby, on a busy street lined with bars and massage parlours. More like a w  W than a "Luxury Collection" hotel. Disappointing.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471799917~“Great location and stylish rooms”~Really enjoyed our stay at The Old Clare Hotel, we were upgraded to the large boardroom suite. Friendly staff. Gorgeous rooms. Cool bar on street.

review_471492184~“Interesting, luxurious hotel”~If you want to have a weekend away somewhere a bit different, with fantastic restaurants on site, this is the place. The level of detail is brilliant - they make you feel much more than a booking. We went for our anniversary and had a hand written note congratulating us (and offering a couple of free drinks to celebrate). Was a lovely experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471294291~“Great Experience - very Sydney!”~Very cool hotel - I took a tour of all rooms and they are all great and all very different.

review_470443870~“Boutique with everything in the heart of Sydney”~great little hotel where nothing is too much trouble. Great staff and great atmosphere in the front bar.

review_469797748~“Renovation works ongoing during my stay”~During my 5 day stay at the Old Clare, there were renovation works going on. This happened throughout the day (not continuously to be fair) but could be as late as 9.30pm where i still hear drilling noises right above my room.  This was very disruptive to my family as my 4 year old son tends to go to bed early, and my family wanted to stay in the hotel to rest more.  I provided feedback to the hotel after 2 nights stay, in the morning before heading out, and only got a response the next day, with a message left on a cute coaster, suggesting that the hotel could change my room and I could have a chat with a lady called Alice. It was a good suggestion, except that no contact details were left behind, and Alice did not leave her last name nor title. It honestly did not feel sincere. As I was checking out the next day, I did not bother with the room change. This was also not brought up by any of the hotel staff during the period I stayed there and interacted with them.  Found the service disappointing for the amount I paid per night (on average AUD 500 per night). Location of the hotel is good though, and has tonnes of eateries that opens late. Woolsworth supermarket is located only 2 min walk away and opens until midnight, ensuring a lot of convenience.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469676808~“The best hotel in Sydney”~My partner and I live in Sydney and stayed here for his 30th birthday last week. There are endless complements I can give this hotel and it's staff. The hotel itself is beautiful right down to the minor details. We stayed in the Connell room, it was impeccably cleaned, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was modern and romantic. All the staff were so lovely and welcoming. In our room, when we arrived, was a little coaster with a hand written message welcoming us to the hotel along with a donut time donut! Every detail was so personal and unique. The only negative was that we live in Sydney so only stayed one night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, for tourists it's location is fantastic, just outside the CBD but still close enough to walk in and for sydneysiders a great little getaway for a couple. Thank you everyone at the Old Clare Hotel!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469572065~“Regional sales manager”~Fantastic rooms with high quality fit out. Bed was amazing, and staff were fantastic. Really good location near great Asian food alley. Edges modern blend with old character, and nice old school bar. Loved the little surprise when I arrived to the room.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464140023~“Great Location, Quality Accommodation”~Being from Hawaii, I was very impressed by the high ceilings and spaciousness of the room. We definitely felt like we could spread out, and relax. As mentioned by others, great wi-fi and desk and items to work and think. The rooftop pool was gorgeous, and a nice place to look out on the city. The staff was very friendly, and helped us with our various needs. We didn't get to try the Clare Bar, Automata, or Kensington Social, but it was always crowded, even early in the week.  I would say the best thing was the location, as being a short walk from Central Station, we were able to all the train lines. That helped get us to Bondi, Featherdale, Newtown, and Business center easily.  Also, the town of Chippendale is great as Spice Alley had delicious street food (5 min walk), Central Mall had a fun atmosphere and more well-known food such as Din tai Fung, Ippudo, and Sumo Green Label (5 min walk), with many other smaller places around since it is a college town it seems. Thai Town itself is a little north of Central which was delicious too (15 min walk).~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_462611985~“Great hotel, great food”~Stayed at the Old Clare for a recent business trip. Rooms are spacious, great desk for working, excellent wi fi. Bathrooms luxuriously large, with lovely amenities. Bar/ restaurant on ground level is great. Only downside is it's hard to get taxis, and Uber pickups were ok but location is a bit tricky for speedy pick ups. Short walk to great cafes - especially the cute Spice Alley - with lots of affordable food options on offer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462112048~“Outstanding Luxury Boutique Hotel”~As a first time visitor to Sydney, the Old Clare was the PERFECT choice in every way possible.. Location, service, vibe, food, comfort etc.. was beyond my expectations for a boutique property. Also, I must mention that Alice, Georgia, and Martin who seemingly effortless MADE MY vacation incredible!..Thank you for all your help and fantastic referrals to dinner spots, sightseeing, VIP experiences and more...a HUGE WOW to the Trio! I must mention of the reception staff who are all really great and so helpful especially to a solo/first time visitor to Sydney..who has very specific "tastes"...Thank you!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461624103~“Comfortable, interesting, and quite outstanding staff”~This hotel has real character. It's hugely comfortable, it's in an interesting area, the food is good - but most of all, the staff are out of this world. I lost a favourite possession while I was there, and they went way above and beyond the call of duty in helping me to find it. I can hardly express my gratitude...~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460576202~“One of the best boutique experiences”~Easily one of my favorite hotel experiences ever. I booked through my SPG points and it was worth every one! I arrived very early and the check in service was great as they had housekeeping do a rush so I could get into my room early. In the meantime, I ate breakfast at the Kensington Street Social restaurant in the hotel, typical hotel prices but nice quality coffee and food, and went to the pool briefly. The pool is on the rooftop and has a great view of the city and adjoining building. While the pool area isn't huge, since there's not a huge number of guests it wasn't crowded at all. The location was in Chippendale, which is up and coming and conveniently located to Central station, making getting a number of places very easy, and also near Surry Hills, which has tons of restaurants. While it's a bit harder to get to Sydney from New York, definitely hope to stay again at the hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460525934~“Eclectic Hotel in Chippendale”~ Stayed in The Old Clare at the end of January for 6 nights.  The hotel is in an old brewery and architecturally beautiful with a hip/ cool vibe.  ROOMS: We stayed in the O'Connell rooms - 1 with King bed & 1 with 2 twin beds. The rooms are large, well appointed with high ceilings- just as shown on the hotel website. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bedding very nice- extra blankets and pillows in the closet. The air conditioning worked well which is extremely important when visiting Australia in the summer months. Note- the room with the King bed had a bathroom with a shower that was not enclosed. Personally I don't care for this design as the water basically goes everywhere. The room with the two twin beds had a very nice shower enclosure with a rain head. Wifi included in rate and worked well. POOL: One of the reasons we choose the hotel was because of the rooftop pool. The pictures on the website were beautiful but in reality it was disappointing. First off the pool is a tiny lap pool- looks much larger in the pics. Also because of numerous tall buildings that surround the hotel there is NO SUN on the pool / deck. Also there is no bar service on the deck!! There's a bar but it was closed - in the summer? Really disappointing. LOCATION: Hotel is not in Sydney CBD- it is in Chippendale which is a 10-15 minute cab ride from the harbour & CBD. However it is close to the train station - 5 minute walk. The area is very cool- Spice Alley with many Asian type restaurants is a must... however bring a credit card... no cash accepted! Overall, a very nice hotel in a cool location!! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460139417~“Hip Hotel in Up & Coming Hood”~Fun hotel. Great service - the front desk welcomed us by name, left everyone on my team a personalized gift in our rooms. Rooms full of character with great bathroom products. I'd stay there again and I'd highly recommend it. Short cab or uber ride to the downtown and the harbor.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459528383~“Overnight staycation - wonderful!”~High quality & service, bursting with character & personality. Room & amenities were impressively pristine & clean. Very comfortable bed & bedding.  The request for a toddler bed was not only effortlessly arranged but they even left a personalised welcome with some baby/toddler amenities which was an incredibly welcoming & thoughtful gesture.  Rooftop pool was a wonderful experience for our short stay & in the neighbourhood of some fabulous places to dine, shop & explore. Spice Alley being a particular favourite.  Breakfast at Kensington St Social was a great experience also (although the coffee was surprisingly poor).  Fabulous hotel & welcome.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458183823~“Boutque hotel”~This is my fourth stay here at Old Clare. Im really happy with the services of the employees here particularly the reception. My partner and i would like to thank Georgie at the desk and Renato . They are really professional and always willing to help. The only let down was the restaurant . Ut opens very late at 8am.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458035774~“Perfect, unique and comfortable”~We stayed here for two nights in January. In my opinion it's a pricey stay, but we had just been travelling and staying in hostels etc so felt we had earned some luxuary. The room was lovely, really unique. Staff very friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool was cold, but after a day walking about in 35 degrees plus it was very refreshing.  We paid for breakfast one day and it was lovely, but too expensive for both mornings.  Bed super comfortable, shower brilliant.  Only complaint is that the frosting on the toilet door wasn't quite good enough and didn't leave much to the imagination! But if you're married and know when to avert your gaze it's a small issue.  Would definately recommend and return if ever in Sydney again.  Oh and tip: check out spice alley just one street over for delicious asian food at great prices.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_457974767~“Wonderful stay”~A very cool and design-driven boutique hotel. Location is perfect right at the central, near to train stations and there's Asian food street just around the corner! Love it We simply love the bar too.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_456031631~“This is what a boutique hotel ought to be”~If you are looking for a small, unique, eclectic and funky hotel in Sydney, this is the one for you. The staff is world class, especially Georgie. The rooms are relatively spartan, but extremely comfortable and quiet. I especially enjoyed the glass cube shower. The staff truly enjoy their work and exceed all expectations. Not request goes unsatisfied. Want special evening maid service, no problem. Need to mail a post card and have no international stamp, not an issue. Want late check out or early check in, no problem. The staff is exceptionally knowledgeable about the entire Sydney area and can provide fantastic advice. While staying at the Old Clare, be sure to check out the interesting restaurants along the Kensington alley.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455513900~“Nice boutique hotel”~We spent two nights at the Old Clare. The hotel is one of the nicer hotels I've stayed in in Sydney. The rooms are modern and funky. The restaurants are very good and there are shops and other eateries just nearby.  The only downside is that whilst Chippendale is a lot more hip than 30 years ago, the area isn't the safest place to stay in Sydney so I suggest one takes care of their personal safety at night.  Good for a staycation/holiday.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455499992~“Love this property a lot.........”~Just on the hill on the way to the city you will find this fantastic property.......this is my 2nd stay here & I love it a lot.......the rooms are just super, with their high ceilings........great spot for amazing food at your doorstep too, just discovered Hand Picked Wine Cellar this trip & will be there for sure. Shop around for the rates as they can vary a lot, try Trivago. You are soo close to the city & Newtown, great walks too.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_455378789~“Super wow!”~Our first stay and I fell in love with this hotel. From the warm welcome and helpfulness of the front desk staff to the super cool, large room everything was spot on and beyond. The room was spacious without clutter, stylish design led furnishings and a bathtub for a pre-evening out soak. A huge and comfortable bed. The attention to detail in retaining the details of the old building during renovation are amazing and the way these have been incorporated and 'celebrated' by the features to preserve them is superb. The hotel bar was buzzing and equally retained the old charm of its past history as an old city pub. Having a Jason Atherton restaurant in the hotel, Kensington St Social, was an added bonus and a brilliant dining experience. I chose the hotel as it was close to Surry Hills an area I'd heard many great things about as Sydney's latest hipster area. Location was fantastic and a short walk away from Central station for travelling further afield in the city. The Old Clare did not disappoint, well done on creating a wonderful place that's a home from home.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455091631~“Perfect stay-cation”~There are very few hotels that deliver on the kind of experience you get at the Clare. As indicated in my title, this was a stay-cation for myself, husband and baby. And it felt wonderfully luxurious. The bed is truly divine, the styling, the bath products, the rooftop pool, the service - all wonderful. But the little thing that I will remember and that surprised me was that when we requested a cot, it was a truly beautiful cot for a hotel and it was made up with really nice linen and there was even a little 'bath towel' and face cloth folded on top for my baby - and no extra charge. Says a lot about their attention to detail and the welcoming attitude of this hotel.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454339889~“Up-and-coming area, nice room/building, restaurant service slow.”~I spent a week in Sydney and this was my home whilst I was there. The hotel is a renovation of a couple of buildings and it's situated in an area called Chippendale, which is convenient enough for walking downtown, but it's more of a cab ride to the financial district. The hotel  The room (I had 206) was really 'well appointed' and worked well for a single person to use as a base, otherwise I'd say it's a little on the small side for a couple. The shower was a glass enclosure just offset from the centre of the room, which works pretty well for the room aesthetic. There was the usual stuff: an iron, a hair dryer, a safe, a mini-bar and a little carry bag for 'stuff'.  If you are in a rush out in the morning then beware of having breakfast in the hotel: It's expensive and slow (not a great combo!) and that was when there were only a few customers. Options abound around the hotel, we ended up frequenting a nearby place called Mezbah Central for breakfast. The trendy roof top bar and pool were closed for renovation which was disappointing...it wasn't a criterion for us choosing this hotel but it might be for many people so it would be better if that was made known in advance.  I didn't have a lot of reason to interact with the staff, but when I did they were friendly and helpful.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454198414~“Stunning Design Hotel”~Stayed here on the weekend for one night and absolutely loved the hotel and everything about my stay. I booked The Clare Room - was upgraded to a loft room - but had my heart set on the Clare Room so the lovely staff let me switch back. The facilities at the hotel are top notch - fantastic bar - rooftop pool - restaurants as part of the hotel but also many food and cafe options in the side streets surrounding the hotel. Highly recommended. Beautiful hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453063699~“Rehab brings a stylish vibe to an architectural mashup that works !”~Boutiques always have their own feel to them. Sometimes it charm or quaintness, funky or quirky, luxury or authentic but the Old Clare has a vibe - a vibe that is hard to describe but you know it starts from the bar and emanates throughout the property as it weaves together its mix of modern and industrial architecture. It may be a window into a wall, a saved historical item, the attention to decor and details within the room, or just the blending of sight lines from old to new that gives the Old Clare a voice. You can hear her talking to you, inviting you to back to the building's heart - the retro bar where all the energy comes from. Outside the property you're in the Chippendale neighborhood with a very short walk to the main train line and another couple blocks from the high streets of downtown. Plenty of food nearby and with local universities the area has a youthful feel that keeps you moving. If you're a tourist the harbor is a taxi ride away but if you're looking for a new area to explore then the Old Clare is a great choice.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_452565577~“Excellent hotel!”~10 out of 10 for the Old Clare! Great architecture and design and a lovely staff en service. Particulary Alice who gave us a warm welcome after we travelled 36 hours from Europe! The room we had (connell) was spacious with beautiful high ceilings and a very comfortable bed. Also a nice and stylish hotelbar. Have to mention Spice Alley which is next to the hotel and has lots of Asian restaurants which offer delicious food for very reasonable prices.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452512549~“Everything is just perfect!”~I could just say perfect. The staff are extremely nice & helpful. The room is clean, big & well designed.

review_452258023~“Interesting renovated hotel.”~We stayed for one night. The service was good, the room clean and everything worked well. The free WiFi in the room was also good. They have a lap pool on the roof, which is quite nice. The bar was not so great. Their list of cocktails was mediocre and expensive. The hotel is a bit on the expensive side, but, quite a nice place to stay.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_452213684~“Doesn't get much better than this”~Landed at the Old Clare for a few days of work and play. Check-in was friendly but vague. However, that was the only slightly off part of our entire stay. Our rooms were beautiful and we had trouble just getting the teen-ager out of hers (she was showing off the room via Skype to all of her friends back home). Great location near nice cafes and shops as well as a block from Sydney's excellent public transportation system. One of our party needed medical attention and staff could not have been more accommodating to get us the help we needed. We felt like part of the Old Clare family by the time we left and major props to the staff, from front desk to housekeeping for making us feel so at home. Bonus points for excellent Triumph and Disaster bath products. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Sydney.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_451460371~“Style over substance”~There is no doubt that this hotel is stylish and has a great cool bar vibe going on which they seem to be very proud of - actually one of the first things they mentioned when we checked in was that they had been voted Sydney's bar of the year. However, I think they have their priorities wrong - they are a hotel and customer service should be at the forefront of everything they do. We arrived late as our flight was delayed and the room we had paid for was no longer available - they upgraded us to a two storey room which was lovely of them but it meant our son was sleeping on a floor below us and has a habit of sleep walking so I called down and asked if we could have the room we paid for - we couldn't as the hotel was full. As we had arrived so late and showered we also asked is we could use the restaurant, sadly the kitchen closed at 10pm so we couldn't eat there so I asked if there was a room service menu - there was which had 2 types of sandwich and a dessert on it - we asked if we could eat it in the bar but apparently we couldn't do that either - we had to eat it in our room if we wanted a sandwich. I asked what the alternatives were and they said we could walk to the casino or order food online and have it delivered to the hotel - we ended up at Macdonalds which was not quite what we planned for our last night in Sydney. The beds are amazing and bathrooms very well appointed. The staff are all cool and trendy types although we found the staff in the bar miserable. They did let us have a later check out the next day and also refunded the extra amount for my sons bed but I really would have preferred to have just secured the room we paid for and for them to have some empathy around us not being able to find anything to eat due to our flight delay. This was the one hotel of our trip I was really looking forward to and didn't meet our expectations at all.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~2~nan
review_445681369~“Appalling …Billed for Toiletries”~Firstly, This was our favourite hotel in Sydney, have stayed previously. I did enjoy the hotel during our stay again. Francis from reception gave great service. Alice personalised our stay with welcome note and lollie bags for kids. Great, loved it. Abercrombie room with bath tub next to the bed, great. All counts for nothing though. Was billed for using toiletries during our stay. Had we known, we would not have over indulged using the toiletries during our stay.  Billed for,  $90.00 for 1 litre use of body wash. $63.00 for 500ml Shampoo. $59.00 for 500ml Conditioner. $75.00 for 500ml Lotion. We did have to use Laundry bag ($30) for wet swimmers and Tote bag ($35) for dirty clothes, fine. Advised by hotel that house keeping told reception that we had taken toiletries for use after stay. I do not know how they came up with that, as we did leave the used toiletries in the room. Unbelievable. For a hotel to be charging guest for toiletries used during our stay, appalled. We’ve not heard back from the hotel so far stayed on 17th December.~1~nan~3~4~nan~nan~1~nan

This is one of the most exciting, artsy, unusually beautiful, and welcoming places I have stayed around the world ! Everything about the Old Clare is special: the perfect room, the care from the staff, the many eateries in and around....Spice Alley across from the pedestrian street is one of the most magical collections of Asian street foods and other stores!

review_444733809~“Amazing Boutique Hotel - Industrial Ulta Cool Vibe”~Just spent a night in a Clare Room at The Old Clare Hotel. Room was fantastic, 4 meter high ceiling in an industrial retro cool apartment style, and fixtures and finishes were first class in this renovated former brewery that is heritage listed. The bed was also a highlight, huge and very comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. The Hotel has a great bar and two classy atmospheric restaurants, and with a raft of great restaurants and places to eat and drink along Spice Alley, this Hotel is now my new 'go to' for when I stay in the city.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_444569605~“Fantastic”~We arrived on a midnight flight from Perth and went to drop off our luggage at 7am before exploring the city and our room was ready and we were able to check in straight away. Rooms were fantastic and every attention to detail had been looked at. A fantastic position close to the city centre but with so many options for food and drink close by there is no need to venture into the city centre. A great hotel experience that would be hard to beat.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_443421306~“A Great Boutique Hotel”~The location is good, though a full blown tourist may find it a bit out of the way. But the rooms and staff are not "Old School" which is refreshing. The restaurants attached are extremely good by modern dining standards. But if driving a car, get a bit familiar with the location, a bit tough to find the entrance.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_442772748~“Pretty damn good for Sydney”~The staff are clued up, they made my stay. property is still hot, well kept, trendy, love the location as somewhere different for Sydney. Its luxury but the rooms are very varied, I have stayed many times now, prefer the rooms with floorboards rather than the 2 story loft rooms with carpet. Love the bar and restaurant... Fast becoming a Sydney staple property for me.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_441054612~“Something amazing for the discerning traveller”~We recently stayed there the night of my 40th and also had about 6 other rooms booked on behalf of friends. I was able to get a better rate for my guests and also got upgraded to the CUB Board room on the night which is literally the most impressive room Ive ever stayed it. HUGE and perfect for after party fun. Huge 8 seater table and the most wonderful bathroom. The staff were fantastic and really made our stay memorable.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_440471729~“Amazing experience.”~Stunning, central, welcoming place to stay, explore. Very restful, beautifully converted from a pub and Old Brewery. Many of the original features are incorporated in the rooms and lobby areas. Very clean, comfortable bed. Service courteous and efficient.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_440470252~“Absolutely stunning!”~Stayed here just for a night and absolutely loved it! Their rooftop pool was sick as it gives you a good view of the city. The room itself was uhhhhmazing! Staff were great and very accommodating. The bar downstairs was pretty cool, also they have 3 restaurants in the building. Spice Alley is literally 2 steps away if you fancy cheap Asian treats. Central Park and Broadway Shopping Centre are also very close.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_440048509~“Old carrot under our bed!”~We have experienced many issues during our stay, which make it very unlikely for us to come back or to recommend this hotel. I briefly summarise them below:  - check-in was very poor. We could hardly understand what the receptionist was saying, no nice greeting, no help with luggage; - no reference whatsoever to our honeymoon despite me sending a few emails in advance of our stay about it;  - I paid for another room for my friends, when they checked in at 7.30am on a Sunday, we were told that the hotel could not provide coffee!! I find this crazy that we had to go somewhere else for a coffee; - no breakfast before 7.30am/8.30am -- this is unheard of in any decent hotel; - no pool bar despite it being advertised;  - concierge did not seem to be specifically aware of blue mountains offers;  - the hallways are not cleaned regularly -- there were towels and dirty dishes near our room in the hallway which stayed there for many many hours;  - the hotel bar is very expensive (high end prices with cocktails at 18-20 dollars) while not providing any service!!! Crazy to have to pay at the bar for that kind of price or hotel. The bartender did not even accept for us to sign on the room at the table. And then the drinks were average;  - no service in general -- this was felt throughout our stay; - room cleaning seemed ok until the last day except that the glasses were not changed every day and the amenities not always replenished; - room cleaning was actually the worst I have ever seen in my life!!! When I leave a hotel, i always check under the bed to see if I have forgotten anything. See attached the picture of what I saw. To be very honest, I feel outraged and disgusted about this. It was our honeymoon, I spent a lot of money on our friends' room who could not make it to our wedding; I spent all of my SPG points for this stay and the result was that I still remember that I slept for 5 nights above an old carrot and a cover of dust.  On the positive side, the design of the the rooms is lovely and our dinner at Automata was fantastic.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~1~1~nan
review_439205541~“Fantastic Boutique Hotel for a long weekend”~This boutique hotel was the location for a friend's birthday at the co-located Automata restaurant. We took the kids and had interconnedting rooms. The rooms were very clean and funky and worked well for all 4 of us. The beds were amazingly comfy. The location is brilliant; walking distance to Central Station and in a part of town full of amazing eating options. The Old Clare has a bright lounge bar and has two world class restaurants within its walls - Automata and Kengsington St Local. We ate at both and were blown away. Spice Alley is next door. We found it took 5 mins by taxi to get to the Rocks and the CBD shopping (although there is shopping next door and a shopping centre 3 blocks along Broadway). But the real reason this was a fantastic stay was the service. The reception team made everything easy, from check in to organising and chasing up our taxi when we left. They went above and beyond our expectations, including posting us some clothing our kids left in the room the week after we returned to Perth. This is a small luxury hotel that is designed for adults but is happy to accommodate kids (they loved the pool on the roof), is well located, has amazing food and very high quality service. We are grateful to our friends for finding this gem. We will definately go back and highly recommend the stay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_438420807~“Stunning hotel”~This is a beautiful hotel. The design is well considered and interesting and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The building itself is a knock out. Highlights included the in room toiletries, the city guides and the area as a whole. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel - we found it to be good value too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438337585~“Live in a brewery....”~The heritage listed administration building of the old Carlton and United Breweries in downtown Sydney has been stunningly transformed into an eclectic and ultra-luxe boutique hotel - and it's great fun! Each room has a distinctive character - I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a Showroom Suite, which used to be an old bar within the administration offices (the executives of CUB apparently lived quite well...). The room was enormous at 53sqm, and a beautiful mix of the old mahogany walls and bar area with modern and (equally big) bathroom and supremely comfortable bed. The cabinets contained historic artifacts of the old brewery. Not being a purpose-built hotel does present some issues, with some plumbing noises and outside street noise being apparent - although certainly not enough to ruin a great night's sleep. Some expected touches of a 5 star property were also missing - no bottled water, no morning newspaper offered, lack of bedside controller for things like curtains and lighting - but these were minor and insignificant given the quirky luxury of the room. The hotel is located about 5 minutes walk from Central Railway Station, the main train hub of Sydney, in a closed-off pedestrian street which is fast becoming a go-to foodie area, with a mix of casual eateries (including a hawker centre style area, and a dessert bar run by a former Masterchef finalist) and several fine dining establishments (which offer charge back arrangements with the hotel). The rooftop pool area is pleasant and sunny, with ample lounges, although somewhat exposed to the surrounding apartment and office blocks. The rooftop bar is not currently operational. If you are looking for something different from a standard chain hotel room, but still wanting a 5 star experience, put The Old Clare on your list - you won't regret it!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_437028820~“interestingly delightful staff”~We have stayed at the Old Clare a number of times and always enjoy coming back. Staff are consistently helpful, and eclectic, interesting people.  Rooms are very different with art deco furniture and raw exposed textures of the industrial heritage building. Delightfully comfortable. A very good heritage restoration. The restaurant right next door The Kensington Social Club serves some of the best food in Sydney. Best to sit up at the bar and watch the chefs. Alternatively walk the Broadway laneways with Asian street food eateries and hip bars. This is not central CBD. The location advantage is a comfortable downhill walk to Sydney CBD or a stroll to Newtown and its vibrant crowds and zany cheap (but often good) restaurants. And its closer and quicker to the airport.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_435471865~“Rude staff ruined the stay ”~I always leave reviews because I use them when booking places.  My partner booked this hotel for the night of my birthday, being a Friday he was still at work and I had the day off so he suggested I check in early and he will meet me there when he finished work.  I went to check in and instead of politely telling me that I had to get his written confirmation, I was made feel stupid and ignorant in front of other guests that I wasn't allowed to check in without him. I was made to sit by the side for 10 minutes and then I asked if there were any way to check in without him and only then did the lady tell me I had to get him to send a confirmation email to them saying he gave them permission. I have no issue with that for security reasons, but the way the staff handled it was rude and unprofessional.  After that I was sent to my room, which was not the room my partner had booked. He especially booked a room with a bath, and this room had no bath. I called the reception straight away and the same lady sighed and said she would get back to me. So here I was, sitting in a room, with no explanation and not sure what to do as I wasn't in the right room. After 15 minutes of waiting, I decided to call reception again and the same lady (with the same foul attitude) told me I had to wait til 5 (it was now 2:30) until they could move me to the correct room. So I thought, stuff this and I had a shower while I waited. Not at any point did she apologise for the mix up, or offer any explanation.  At 5:30 I was then moved to the correct room, still no explanation, no apology and no acknowledgement from any of the staff that they had made me feel a lot less than welcome.  After that, thankfully I didn't have much to do with the staff again. But this really took away from a stay that should've been nice and relaxing. I felt for my partner who had paid $450 for the night - when paying that much for one night you'd expect to be treated well.  After this stay I wrote to management and they apologised for the incident but I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. I often travel for work and my partner and I stay in hotels often, so I like to leave reviews - unless they have completely re-trained their staff I would never stay at this place again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433534978~“Ridiculously cool”~I have stayed at quite a few design hotels before and while they are obviously all very individual, with unique design features, the Old Clare tops them all! Two buildings, one of them formerly a brewery, connected with a glass atrium, beautifully showcasing the building’s unique architectural features. One of the many highlights - apart from the rooms - are the public spaces, filled with a curated collection of vintage items and furniture. The hotel is an amazing industrial design showcase and thus blends in perfectly with the trendy neighborhood, Chippendale. Complemented by a hip bar, which – judging by its tiled walls – appears to have been some sort of kitchen in the past, the stylish Kensington Street Social restaurant, and cheeky corporate identity this hotel is an insanely cool experience. Location is great, too: it’s only a short walk to Central but what’s amazing is the little alley behind the hotel, filled with bars and restaurants, which is buzzing with locals – don’t miss it, it’s absolutely sensational.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433442148~“Great location to explore this part of Sydney”~Valet parking at the front door, extremely pleasant staff and a beautifully renovated part of Sydney past, greeted our recent visit. Rooms had everything[except good pillows to sleep on despite a asking for replacements] minutes from plenty of restaurants and galleries, nice vibe.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431136817~“Love it, except for being woken by the garbage truck”~The transformation of the historic building into a modern hotel blew me away, even after seeing photos online.  Reception staff were efficient but when I asked if there were bathrooms on the ground floor I was answered with an explanation of the security deposit.  Sadly the noise from the lane below my room came into the room too easily - from noisy people heading home to the early morning garbage truck interrupted my sleep. I tried to turn on the AC to mask some of the noise but it made a breeze across the bed, which wasn't pleasant on a cool night.  The bathroom was beautifully laid out, and lighting was nicely designed.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430571799~“Comfortable stay”~Very interesting hotel. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast in their restaurant was a little alternative and we would have preferred a few standard options on the menu. Not much to do in the immediate area and so be prepared to take a cab into the city. Staff were very engaging and helpful~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_429935899~“Clean, modern and accommodating staff”~As soon as we arrived Alice and her staff went out of their way to accommodate our early need for a temporary room until our's was finished and ready for check in. Once in our room, we were grateful for how clean it was and modern. The Old Clare was close to the central train station, too, for easy trips to the city's attractions.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_428285910~“Old clare stay”~Second time to stay here. I love the hospitable environment of the employees here. The room service is a bit disappointment. No answer without the assistance of the reception. But overall the whole hotel is an excellent place to stay. The high ceiling room and the clean comfortable beds. Thanks to Renaldo for organising my stay.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428076398~“Overpriced, Inadequate Sound Proofing, Disappointing Staff”~Note: I'm a very loyal Starwood PG member, as Starwood usually does a great job of taking of frequent business travelers; the Old Clare seems to be the exception that proves the rule. The check-in staff itself was argumenatative which should have been my first clue. When they asked "How was the trip in; did you find the hotel well?" I replied that neither myself nor the cab driver had been able to find the signs at all. He replied "Well, we have three entrances, I don't see how that was hard."  I had requested early check-in; understandable that it wasn't ready. The irritant there is that I had called earlier in the week and requested it, the staff member at check-in told me "Oh, no one here could have told you it might be possible." Usually, implying that the customer is a liar is a bad business tactic. The room itself say near the stair well, where the sound of the bars goes directly up. Evidently in the reconstruction, they did not go with adequate sound proofing. Noise from the bars comes straight up. Street noise is loud enough to understand conversations - so the motorcyles revving at 1-4 AM is quite loud as well.  Room itself had a dirty floor when we finally checked in to the room. On the upside, curtains really are good black out curtains and the beds are comfortable.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_427810017~“Incredible hotel!”~I am staying at the Old Clare for a business trip and this place is amazing! They have done a great job saving the historical features of the building while modernizing it. The rooms are spacious, the bed is really comfy and the street surrounding the hotel can be a little noisy but nothing that would keep you up at night.  They went out of their way to recommend running routes for me as they heard I liked running!  The hotel is conveniently located nearby Central Station that brings you close to all touristic things to do. Trains take you to Circular Quay and the Opera House in 15 minutes.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426205257~“Awesome new hotel with gorgeous rooms”~After being recommended this hotel by a colleague, The Old Clare did not disappoint. A lovely building nestled in a gentrifying area, the room was huge and funky (bathtub in the center of the room) but still functional and comfortable. The restaurant inside is well known for being one of the best in the area and the bar turns into a fun local hotspot at night. The front desk is incredibly helpful and the rooftop pool and fitness facilities are great as well. I will definitely be back.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_426004923~“Ultra modern industrial styling - highly recommended for people into Int.Design”~Hi, I am 30+yr old female - stayed here for 1 night on a work trip with 14 clients.  The hotel sits on Broadway but has 2 entry points from Kensington or Carlton st with its own bar and restaurant (Kensington Room).  Well located from walking distance to Central station (about 10mins) and many many restaurants to choose from. (We went to LP's Meats 8min walk away) The clients we hosted were of average age -45, male and in the trade sector and loved the industrial design.  Pros:  - Great proximity to central, directly opposite UTS and even ~10mins walk to Paddy's Market - Comfortable King Single beds - firm but soft  - Clean rooms in general including the bathroom  - No noise issues - Lift were good speed  - No real delays with check-in/out - No key issues!!! (tap card) - A great shower with rainfall showerhead and removable head option! (no water pressure or temp issues) - Easy to use coffee pod machine - Kensington Room serves up a good Brioche egg sandwich or the scrambled eggs with blood sausage  Cons:  - I was fortunate enough to have a room with bathroom walls of frosted glass however not complete to the floor. If I was staying with a colleague, I'm not sure I like the idea of no soundproofed walls.  In a nutshell, it’s an interesting hotel with industrial charm. It has more character than a contemporary 5star.  Safe travels~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_425989190~“Beautiful rooms”~We stayed here for 2 nights in a Clare room. The room itself is lovely and spacious. The bed is huge and comfortable, but the pillows are too high and hurt my neck.  On the Sunday morning we called room service 4 times and no answer. Very poor service there and definitely something to improve on.  We went elsewhere for all our meals. Highly recommend Spice Alley for hawker style street food and the Brewery yard markets were another Sunday attraction in the area where you could get coffee, brunch and small hand made crafts - both worth a visit! As there is no information in the room about local attractions in Chippindale or places to eat this was also disappointing for visitors unfamiliar with Sydney. For the price the room was nice, however the service was lacking, not sure we will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425445276~“Perfect for family trip!”~I stayed here with my grandparents for 5 nights and the staffs are really accommodating. We booked the wrong room with stairs inside the room and as my gramps are 70+, I asked if they can change the room for me, and they willingly did so. They always helped me book a maxi taxi too.  As we're staying for 5 nights, we also got the complementary newspaper delivery. The design of the hotel is awesome! (This is the place to check out if you are in Chippendale, as it's featured in Sydney Architecture Festival).  The location is very convenient too, Woolworths (supermarket) is just on the Central Park mall in the opposite, and there are lots of other few restaurants down the block, very convenient.  We really enjoyed our stay here! It's perfect for couples, and even family with gramps like us. :)~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_425202845~“Lovely Hotel & Great Location . ”~I recently stayed here from 1st - 4th October ( Syd Labour Long Weekend ) First time stayed here for me & its turn out this hotel will be my famous hotel now. Alice ( front staff ) was super friendly & helpful .. The hotel has a great location Spice Alley ( Asian Street Foods ) is walking distance & many choices with the foods.  Our room was upper level 3. It's quite & the bed so comfortable and beautiful decoration.  The rooftop pool on level 4 was super cool & good for me to swim few laps.

review_424939010~“Definitely worth a visit...”~Very tasteful hotel, a perfect balance of modern and heritage. Great industrial style furnishing and great beds. Service was good but not amazing, staff could definitely be a bit more attentive. Also found it quite noisy at night, from the outside that is. I forget the name, but the restaurant downstairs was amazing - delicious food and friendly staff. Overall very comfortable and whenever you find yourself in SYD.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_423693272~“like staying in an interior design magazine”~This was my second stay in The Old Clare Hotel. Since then the restaurants in the front building have all been completed. Along the alley by the hotel have sprouted several posh restaurants, and there is some noise until after midnight, if your room faces the alley. However one does do have to travel far to dine. I don't remember the name of the room I stayed in, but it had a bathtub by the wall, and a searchlight made into a lamp in the corner lounge area. The space was huge. As I mentioned above, it was like staying in an interior design magazine. Wifi was free, which is a great advantage. The hotel is just behind Central Station, and Chinatown is a few minutes walk away.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_423005534~“Wonderful place to stay...”~The Old Clare in Sydney is a fantastic and quirky place to stay. The renovations are out of this world, they have not forgotten, but rather honored the buildings past.  It is very easy to navigate around Sydney from the hotel. Central station is 100 meter walk away, and it's only a nice stroll into Sydney CBD via the Botanical Gardens and down to the beautiful harbour.  Our room was very spacious, it had a very comfortable king size bed, well stocked mini bar, great wardrobe to hang our clothes in and one of the most luxurious bathrooms I have ever used (with great amenities). I would highly recommend the Old Clare to friends and acquaintances.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422979166~“My New Sydney Hotel”~I stayed here in May for a few nights for business and to be honest had never heard of this hotel. Well I'm very glad I did stay here. I don't believe that the hotel had been opened very long at all when I stayed, but every thing about this hotel I liked. The bar downstairs, the staff, the restaurant were fantastic. The rooftop pool looked great but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to use it, next time. I love absolutely love how they have not only kept all the original features of the building (which I believe was an old brewery office) but to also incorporate it all into a modern hotel. Top marks to the owner and the design team it must have cost a heap but the results are brilliant. Definitely my new hotel to stay in Sydney. Looking forward to staying here again. Highly Recommend~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_422737792~“Old Clare, Old Friend?”~My husband and I stayed over the weekend arriving Friday evening and leaving Sunday. I'd been looking forward to this mini break to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary. It was easy to locate Old Clare and we took the train from the airport and it was all very easy including the short walk from Central Station. Although we did take a few minutes to figure out the best exit to take. Chippendale is bustling area; enough to explore and has a student feel and also reminded us of the Hoxton area of London including the long covered walk in the station with the shops and barbers. But enough about the supporting cast, let's talk about Old Clare. First impressions were good. We were greeted warmly and immediately at Reception.A few vintagey / retro features dotted around to add character - old vaults and an optician's chair. Check in was easy and we were shown to our room. Service was personable and friendly with a bit of cheery chat thrown in. I'd pre ordered some Champagne and as we had arrived a little earlier than planned, the staff saw that it came quickly.  We stayed in one of the Clare Rooms (105) and it was roomy and bright with some really attractive quirky features. The freestanding lamp was beautiful. Loved the high ceilings and the light streaming in through all the windows as well as the exposed brick. All very open plan so best for couples than friends as there's not much room to change unless you use the toilet cubicle. The bath has not door to it. I took advantage of the lovely bath tub, fragrant toiletries and the Champagne before dressing for dinner. Whilst on the subject of bathing, the water pressure in the shower is good with bit a rainhead and a hand held. Found the bed very soft and I usually prefer a firmer mattress but although it was soft it was still very supportive and I felt cocooned amongst pillows and sheets and throws providing a good night's sleep. The dressing gowns provided in the wardrobe were also very snuggly. We ordered room service breakfast and that came quickly and was delicious. I couldn't get through to place my order when I called them though so I called Reception instead and they organised it for me. So why after so many positive comments is it not 5/5? Here are my minor gripes. Outside noise is disturbing particularly the loud drunken conversations and shouts from revellers at 2am.  We would have liked to have had a drink at the pool bar and the room directory seemed to indicate it would be open but we ventured up on the sunny Saturday afternoon and whilst the pool was open, the bar was definitely out of action. Perhaps some clearer information should be provided. I also think providing fresh milk for tea and coffee should be the norm or at least offer it especially when the quality of tea and coffee is good. I actually asked for it on the second day and it arrived promptly but it would have been nice to have had it on the first night.I would have loved some more English Breakfast tea rather than the two bags on offer. I'm sure if I'd asked it would have arrived but I was just too lazy and it would have been better if they'd just been there! Yes, I'm being picky but I love it when service is about anticipating the need before the need arises. And Old Clare manages to do that on the most part. The gentlemen at the reception desk checked in with us to confirm our dinner reservation as the notes on the system and the actual reservation in the restaurant system didn't match so he wanted to pre-empt any potential issue so I really appreciated that foresight. I'd be happy to return to see Old Clare and enjoy her hospitality. We enjoyed her welcome, her bar, her room and her food! We dined at both Kensington St Social and Automata and controversially felt underwhelmed by Automata but Kensington St Social exceeded expectations.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_421905101~“Nice rooms but too noisy”~I love the way they have retained the heritage of the building. However when you are located in chippendale you should put some effort into soundproofing. The noise from someone running a bath at midnight on the floor above made sleep impossible.  Lots of loud street noise. Staff at reception were indifferent and didnt even enquire as to our stay. Definitely not a five or even four star experience.  Given the high priced rooms i expected more. Standards have dropped since or previous stay and we are unlikely to return. A shame as some improvements and focus on a customer service ethic could make this place great.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421866489~“Love it, fantastic BUT!”~This is an awesome hotel in every way, character building, so stylish, so chic and young. WOW love it in every way BUT the beautiful room I had I could never stay in with my wife. Open plan ensuite shower/vanity no problem, but the toilet clearly visible from the bed with a thin bit of frosted glass still see through as the only visual barrier. Sorry but NO. I asked around and it seems I'm not unusual toilets need to be out of sight and out of 'hearing'. So no matter how wonderful this place is and it is. Unless I could be confirmed a different style of room I will never stay here again. Maybe it is not all rooms? If you can get a private toilet, then it is 5 out of 5 all the way!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419956642~“Nicely designed hotel”~In August, I stayed in a Chippendale loft. The room was comfortable, quiet, and spacious. Bar staff are great. Location is definitely up and coming. Pay with cash if possible as there is a surcharge for paying with a card.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_419637086~“Beautifully designed and restored hotel”~A wonderful statement of design - every room seems to unique and distinctive, beautifully coordinated with amazing space perspective and functionality and completed with quirky pieces of art. Wonderful restaurants and bars with a great rooftop pool and bar and next door to a great shopping complex (Central Park) and Spice Alley which is great for street food. Let down by ordinary service - forgot to bring my car up on time and nearly missed a theatre event - and didn't adequately advise restaurants of my wife's allergies.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_418393333~“Legitimately bespoke, a touch fancy.. and oh just so cool!”~So yeah.. bespoke / original heritage restorations are massively in right now. The Old Clare does it all and does it all right, but it's just so refreshing to see that they are still able to maintain their own individual charm in a market where trying to be different is "the new black", It's got the cool factor of the QT, but with more homage to the originality of the Carlton United Brewery building it is based off.. There's just something magestic about walking down the freshly restored but original corridors and seeing the photos of what the building was during it's original recreation stages.. We were booked into a Connell Room (advertised as the "impeccable standard") and by gosh they were right (refer to photos).. Just amazing.. the photos speak for themselves.. This hotel has single-handedly started somewhat of a cultural revolution in the Chippendale area as all of the laneways around the building are Melbourning-up into fashionable little spots. Between enjoying the room and enjoying the surrounds, there's a plenty to do just in the precinct for a short trip and Central Station is just a stone-throw away too. Service is a delight with the staff seemingly hand-picked from the cotton fields.. they are all super well-presented, knowledgable, friendly and down-to-earth.. just like what you'd expect from a classy bar or something.. They will treat you how you should be treated.. and i guess that would be different depending on who you are XD Loved spending time with them all, from Georgina the all-star to Martin the super-concierge to Alice the commander-on-duty, to the glorious hiccup girl who literally hicced her way all through my check-out, luggage, valet etc. with a big smile =] Loved my stay and will definitely be back next time i'm around this area.

Our stay was very pleasant - staff were friendly and helpful, room was very comfortable, and the restaurant - the Kensington Street Social - was delicious. We rated 4 out of 5 due to early morning noise in the alley next to the hotel - garbage trucks, delivery trucks, etc. Bring your earplugs unless you plan to be up by 6 am.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
