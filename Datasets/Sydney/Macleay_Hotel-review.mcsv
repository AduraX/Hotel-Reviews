review_476959905~“Excellent Apartments!!!”~Macleay Hotel is an excellent Choice for your stay right in the City of Sydney. The room is nice, clean, excellent space; it also includes a kitchenette which is handy. The metro station is like 10 minutes walking distance; there is a Woolworths Store in front of the hotel. In addition, there is a variety of close restaurants and places to eat and shop. The staff is kind, friendly and helpful!! I stayed there for 30 days and it was worth it!! I highly recommend it!!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476872261~“Great hotel, clean and comfortable, Close to Kings Cross station”~Lovely helpful staff. Our room was on 1st floor. Pleasant surprise when we opened our patio window onto a lovely eating area with 2 bbqs which could be booked for use. Nice pool, although little cold due to inconsistent weather and not being heated. Room had nice small cooking/kitchen facilities. Ideally situated for short walk through botanic gardens to Opera House and circular quay or train ride from Kings Cross station. Would definitely recommend~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_474056297~“Great location, small but comfortable rooms, friendly staff”~-located in Potts Point/Woolloomooloo, a 10 min walk to the nearest metro station and a nice run to the Royal Botanic Gardens/Opera House area -apartment-style rooms with small kitchen - a little crowded for two people and parts had noticeable wear-and-tear but clean and comfortable overall -staff were accommodating with special requests and sightseeing tips, especially Wendy -small swimming pool on-site, access to gym 5 mins away (but no one answered the door when we went in the evening) -across the street from a large grocery store, and many cafes, bakeries and restaurants nearby (Coffee, Tea & Me, and Farm Wholefoods are highly recommended) -decent value for money, as 4-star hotels in Australia tend to be very pricey~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_473825474~“Beautiful room to rest and relax ”~Convenient location - walking distance to many of Sydney's main attractions, beautiful room with all the necessities of home, and an amazing staff!

review_473385277~“Fabulous staff and beautiful view made our stay”~We booked a harbour view twin room for 4 nights and the view was incredible. This is a lovely hotel and the staff can't do enough to help you. Comfy beds and the best selection of complimentary drinks from a variety of herbal teas to decent coffee started our mornings off well too!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473348508~“Good enough area and easy walk to Opera house”~Can't really fault the hotel other than it is expensive but not more so than the rest of Sydney - nice room, nice view and about a mile and a half walk through the lovely botanic gardens to get to the Opera house. Has a small pool which we didn't use. Bed was comfy enough and there is a Woolies and some good eateries very close by~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_471837930~“Great location with a view, but a bit time-worn”~Spent five days in the Macleay Hotel where we book a room in the 9th floor with a view of the harbour and the Opera. Fantastic view that you don't want to miss. While the room was appropriate and convenient, we struggled a bit where to place the three suitscases and where to eat our breakfast in the morning, as the room is quite small and the table has only two chairs... The bathroom looks a bit outworn and needs a refurbishment, but the overall impression is good. Good value for money, as you can buy your breakfast in the adjacent Woolworth and there are quite a few good restaurants close by in Challis Ave (i.e. the Fish Shop and Fratelli Paradiso) as well as Thai Terrific in Hughes Street. Take a walk through the Botanic Garden to the Opera and the Harbor Bridge - great views and very relaxing. Negatives are the slow internet and the less than soundproof windows.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan

review_471092662~“Wonderful relaxing start in Sydney”~We recently stayed in Sydney for 5 days at the Macleay Hotel in the neighborhood of Pott's Point , a small suburb of the actual city. Booked it because it had a little kitchenette and the picture showed a view of the opera house and the bridge from the window. After a grueling flight (27 hours from Toronto to Hong Kong to Sydney) and rental of a car & then driving to the hotel for the first time on the left hand side of the road we arrived to a quaint little hotel with a simple but functional lobby and wonderfully welcoming staff. When we got to our room I was a bit disappointed with the view as it was a different part of the harbor and was much small er than the view the picture had shown. The room itself was quite small ( queen bed, 2 night tables a, a small round dining table and 2 dining chairs, a small desk , wardrobe, small kitchenette with a bar sized fridge, dishes for 2 and other kitchen supplies. There was also a small flat screen TV . The bathroom was newly renovated with a rain shower head shower nice vanity and other amenities. Laundry machines were around the corner in the hall. While the rooms etc are a bit dated they served the purpose and although the view was not what was expected it was still pretty.Also watch out for the "Sydney Flying Foxes" at dusk there that fly right over the hotel. Bats the size of cats but they are harmless and look very much like crows except for the telltale scalloping of their wings. The hotel was located on a nice street with mature trees ,shops, coffee bars, bistros and was right across from a major grocery store ( Woolworths). great for picking up groceries every day!Liq store just down the street and wine stores all around too. A wonderful little hotel within walking distance to parks, food, etc as well as a few sights. Bus stops right outside the door to get into the city or to take tours. It was a nice relaxing place to come home to after a day out seeing the sights. A/C was also a big help as the humidity when we were there was very high. Small pool outside as well as a large deck and BBQ but we didn't get to use as there was a lot of rain when we visited. We will definitely go back..~3~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_469270462~“Great location ”~Friendly staff , hotel very well located. I enjoyed lots of walks and it is a 10 minute walk to St Lukes Hospital. Easy walk to explore the beautiful Botanical Gardens. Good food and coffee, grocery stores, gym, yoga studio ,laundromat etc within 5 minutes walk.The. Rooms are dated, our bed & pillows were hard but the little kitchenette was handy and we loved the very ordinary little outdoor area which our room opened onto. Parking is $30 extra per night & a bit tight but OK~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467492238~“The staff were awesome!”~They were able to accommodate an extended stay for me with little notice. I really appreciate all they have done. The location is great- lots to do around the hotel. The mini kitchen was very useful for light cooking. This property is close to a grocery store, liquor store and post office. The bars and restaurants will keep you occupied in the area after taking a break from touring around the city.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467412274~“OK Place to Stay”~Greeting on check-in was friendly, but glad we double-checked the room rate - because they had added on an extra $80, saying it was because I had requested a room with a view. When I had made the initial booking I emailed the MacLeay Hotel asking how much extra for a room with a view and got an email back saying $20. I replied asking if that was $20 per person, or $20 per night, or a one-off charge of $20 and received an email back stating it was a one-off charge. I then booked a room with a view, paid a deposit and asked for confirmation of the amount due, which was duly emailed back. Unfortunately I didn't take the email correspondence with me, but I did have the emailed advice of amount owing which I produced, so they accepted that and said they would delete the $80 "just for me"?! We had arrived half an hour early and the room wasn't ready so they let us put our bags in storage. The room we had was on the 7th floor and had a great view of Rushcutter Bay from one end of the window and a tiny glimpse of the Sydney Harbour Bridge from the other. The beds were really comfortable, air conditioning, couldn't open the windows as they were locked - not sure where the key was. Shower was OK, nice fluffy towels. WIFI wouldn't work so rang reception but they couldn't hear us - faulty phone. Lady at reception came up and fixed our phone and told us the access code for WIFI had changed which was why we couldn't access it. Good having Woolworths across the road for supplies. The swimming pool outside is small but lovely, except there were leaves and stuff at the bottom of the pool which were in the exact same place each day so don't think the pool gets much attention. When we checked out 4 nights later, the lady at reception never smiled once, she looked completely bored. I would have thought it good customer service to at least thank us for staying with them, or ask us if we enjoyed our stay - but she said nothing except how much we owed. When we asked if we could store our bags until the Sydney Shuttle arrived she again didn't say anything, just took us to a storage room and waved her finger at the door. Think she needs a holiday as well. On the whole the hotel is in a good location and is comfortable, but staff need to remember that their manner reflects on future bookings.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_466290772~“Great place to stay. Friendly, helpful staff. Room with everything you need.”~From the moment we arrived the staff could not have been more helpful. Getting us into our room as soon as possible. Recommending a place they knew for coffee and a snack. Felt really at home. Room with small kitchenette area which was very well equipped. Nice little touches like some milk and a tea towel. Bathroom was well stocked with shampoos, shower caps, soap etc. Often find hotels are a bit mean with these and Macleay Hotel made sure we always had enough of everything. Really enjoyed our stay here and if we get the chance will definitely come back. Location great too. Potts Point is by big city standards relatively quiet but with enough bars and restaurants to make it interesting. Short walk up to Kings Cross and a different, but again interesting area altogether. We also loved the walk down into Wooloomooloo and then up to the botanic garden on the way to Circular Quay and the opera house. Came to know and love this quite well in our 5 day stay. Recommend it and the fantastic hotel Macleay.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_465918237~“The Macleay Hotel - What More Do You Need?”~The Macleay has been well reviewed, and our experience was similar to many others. We had a room with a water view, which was excellent. There are no balconies, but the windows run the length of the wall, and do open (no screens). While our bath was in need of an update, the rest of the room was just fine. Macleay Street has pretty much everything you might require. There are restaurants, a chemist, and public transportation access within easy walking distance. A Woolies grocery, directly across the street from the hotel, is an added bonus. It’s about a mile and a half walk to the Circular Quay. Cut through the lovely Royal Botanic Garden and follow the signs to the Opera House Gate. The people who worked at the Macleay were friendly and helpful with transportation and other tourist information. We stayed there at the end of January. The AC kept the room cool, and the mini fridge kept the beer cold. What more do you need?~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465711836~“Great location”~I spent one night at this hotel. Great central location. Near Kings Cross. Good restaurants and cafes surrounding it. Close to airport. Rooms were clean.

review_465440913~“Great location, fantastic value”~Hotel is located along Macleay street that has plenty of places to eat/drink bot during the day and evening. Its located almost opposite a supermarket and off licence if you want to eat/drink on a lower budget. Its located about a 5/10 walk up to the Kingscross area thats much better these days and worth a visit. You can also walk to the busy circular key/opera house area through the botanical gardens. this walk does take about 25/30 mins and has a BIG set to steps on the way back, or simple ride the bus. Very helpful and friendly staff. The wifi is free but a nit of a pain to connect to easy time, but hay its free~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464930082~“Fab hotel”~Me and my sister stayed here for four nights .....Perfect location. Nearby kings cross station to get to bondi beach and airport. Walking distance to Sydney harbour about 20 -25 mins but through lovely park area. Nice area felt very safe with trendy restaurants nearby and a supermarket across the road. Def stay here and not by kings cross as that's for more back packers and was Def more lively and loud there.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464228579~“Value and location”~A better stay than previously, the wifi worked and that made a difference. It is not a modern and fashionable hotel but it has the basics you need and is in an excellent location providing you don't need to spend all your time in the CBD - it is though only a few minutes by train to the city. Great though if you like good restaurants with several like Billy Kwong, Apollo, Monopole, Yellow and Macleay Street Bistro only metres away. Had a great view though from the 9th floor which showed the best of the harbour, city, bridge and the heads - on lower floors, you run a risk of looking at other buildings.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_463117175~“Good budget hotel, great location.”~Had three nights last week. We're on fourth floor facing CBD, with reasonable view. Room was clean and had all necessary accessories including A/C, bar fridge, crockery, glasses, tea and coffee etc; although it is getting on a bit, it was a good sized room and very comfortable (and my bride is a little fussy).  It is only a short walk (5 mins) to the well-serviced Kings Cross metro station. Vast number of good restaurants and bars within close proximity (walk). Woolworths is directly across the street, including liquor outlet. There is parking under hotel but not sure of cost. We would definitely recommend the Macleay to our friends and TA readers, and would definitely stay again. TIP: We asked if we could go up on top of the building (tenth floor) to take in the view. Reception personnel happy to allow and we were amazed at how spectacular it was when we went up. I imagine there would be views from the sixth to ninth floor, although the rate for those rooms is higher I believe.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460785268~“Ok”~Rooms were comfortable but very stuffy. Staff at the front desk were very rude when I called to enquire about my booking & even more rude when I went to check in.  Great location though. Close to everything.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459826982~“Great place to stay ”~Lucky enough to have harbour views. Room has everything we need - fridge for wine and breakfast / packed lunch bits.

review_459643296~“Good location but a little tired inside.”~I stayed here at the end of last year for a few nights at the end of a trip to Australia. First off, the location is really good, only about a 20 minute walk to the Opera House and Harbour area and the walk through the Botanic Gardens is lovely. Watch out though for the closing time of the gardens... I got caught out on my first night and had a mini meltdown fearing I would never get back to the hotel! But back to The Macleay....  When I walked into the reception area I thought 'wow'! The place looks lovely and modern and very clean so I had high hopes for my room. When I got to the room though I was disappointed - it looked tired and dated and wasn't very cheerful at all. The room was generally clean though, apart from the odd mark and scuff on the walls but overall clean. The kitchen area was small but had all the neccecities - again though it looked tired and needed up dated. The fridge is quite small so don't buy too many things and the freezer section didn't work in mine. The bathroom though was the room I was least happy with - it was really old looking and definitely needs upgrading.  The shower was tiny but the water pressure was good. It had a shower curtain though which I hate - feel they are not very hygienic, especially in a hotel. Again it was generally clean but felt a bit dingy.  I also had problems with the wifi - it basically didn't work in my room which as a solo traveller was quite annoying. The reception staff were helpful though and tried to sort it, my room just seemed to be a black spot though - outside the bedroom door it worked but inside - no luck! Overall I would say I was disappointed in this hotel, as my expectations had been higher after looking at online pictures and the reception.  I think some of the rooms have been upgraded and I'm sure they would be great - might just be worth asking about an upgraded room if booking. Again though, the location was great and the staff were very helpful and friendly. There's also a supermarket right across the street so very handy.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459592936~“Welcoming Staff Excellent”~Clean and very comfortable I had a glorious view of the harbour bridge and the opera house I felt very at home and wished that I could stay longer Great cafe over the road was a bonus Recommend All staff happy to help and friendly~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_458981967~“Well positioned budget Sydney hotel with a view”~We understood that the rooms in this 3 star hotel are relatively small but this did not bother us unduly as we had planned to spend most of our time in the city seeing the sights. Otherwise we found the bed very comfortable and the furnishings adequate for our needs. Position is reasonably good, being opposite a supermarket and a 10 minute walk from the nearest train station yet far enough away from the nightlife of Kings Cross such that there was no noise or other nuisance. The icing on the cake however was the view. You have to pay extra for it but the top floors have superb views of the harbour and/or the opera House and bridge.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458612831~“Overall Good”~The hotel is at a convenient location to the King's Cross Station (@10-15" walk). The Hop On Hop Off bus stop is on Macleay Rd. (5-10"" walk). There's a Woolworth's grocery store directly across the street as well as a wonderful deli called Bottega del Vino. We arrived early and the hotel staff was kind enough to allow us to check into our room. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. I forgot to ask for a room with a view so be sure to request a room on the 8th or 9th floor facing the Sydney Harbour (opera house & bridge). Or you can ask for the roof top key and view/take photos from there- breathtaking! It was very nice having the kitchen area. A generous selection of teas and coffee, milk creamer, hot water pot, portable stove top, microwave, dishes and utensils. The bathroom is clean, good water pressure in the shower and I liked their toiletries. The neighborhood is "interesting": some tourists, lots of locals, backpackers, a few down and out looking folks. There is a shuttle available to and from the airport for $14pp. We took a cab to the hotel in torrential rain and the slow traffic cost us AUD $104. The return trip was AUD $28 (for 2). Therefore, when you arrive to the Sydney airport, go outside to arrange a hotel shuttle to the Macleay Hotel.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_458386670~“Comfortable, clean & friendly - Good value for money”~Just stayed 3 nights here. Staff were very helpful & friendly. Nice clean room (newly refurbished). Plenty of drawer & hanging space, little kitchenette, clean bathroom/ shower, TV, iron & ironing board.  View of Sydney Opera House & the Bridge (if a little distant).  Potts Point - lots of shops & restaurants. Kings Cross Station - 5 minutes walk. Opel Card for trains so cheap & easy to get around. Explore the district - it's 'interesting'.  The ONLY down point was having to keep logging into Wifi every time you switched a device off. Except for that I can highly recommend this little boutique hotel and definitely give it a 4.9 out of 5~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458102935~“Good location”~Stayed over NYE for 10 nights 3 of us in a triple studio. The room was a bit small with not a lot of storage we had to stack a couple of stools on top of a table to be able to move around our cases, Kept very clean and quiet on a night The transport links around Potts Point make this a great hotel for sightseeing and getting around Sydney. Staff were excellent with all dealings we had with them, very friendly and efficient .

review_457111375~“Very good hotel and location”~I stayed for a week in Macleay Hotel with my family. We had a great stay. We had a double and a triple room on 6 th floor. I had booked city views as we didn't expect to spend much time in the room, but actually the double had views of rushcutters bay and a small harbour view as well. The city view was nice as well.  We enjoyed the location in PottsPoint/Kings Cross. Lively neighbourhood with lots of bars and restaurants. Supermarket just across the street and more around. The area is a suburb but still very close to CBD. Great opportunities for a morning run to Mrs Maquaries point, the opera house or Rushcutters Bay. Walking distance to CBD. The service at the hotel is very good. Many things are not advertised, you have to ask. Among these are: public bathroom in the basement to use after check out, roof top with great views, ice machine in the basement, laundry machines on each floor (3 dollars), free computers. The pool is very nice as well. It only has three sun loungers, but we were lucky on the few occasion when we had time to use it. A few bad points: our triple room was the same size as a double which gives little space for three persons, and the temperature in the fridge in the double room couldn't be regulated. But otherwise a perfect stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457029487~“Very well positioned budget hotel”~Well positioned for Kings Cross facilities and railway station yet far enough away to avoid any nuisance this budget aparthotel is perfect for a city break. Add spectacular views of the harbour from upper rooms (at a modest extra cost) and you don't feel as though you have missed out if you cannot find the time to visit the bridge or tower viewing galleries. A Woolworths supermarket opposite and numerous takeaway food outlets within easy walking distance make for easy self-catering for the budget conscious traveller. Rooms are on the small side and the lighting in ours could have been better but these are minor criticisms. Room was very clean and reception staff very friendly.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456142079~“Knock out views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge”~A clean and well appointed aparthotel block right in Potts Point a stone´s throw from Kings cross. Get a room up high and you´ll enjoy stunning views of the harbour, opera house, and coming and going of yachts and cruise liners. The salt water small pool is perfect for a couple of hours chilling and you can use a great local gym just 5 mins walk away. There´s a Woolworths across the road and bottle shop for all the bits you need in the apartment and plenty of reasonably priced restaurants nearby.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan

review_453244999~“Good location!”~We read the reviews prior to booking so knew the rooms would be small, but for the price we thought it was worth the risk. Glad we did! Room and bathroom small but we didn't hang out in the room rather out sightseeing so for us was not an issue. View from out room was spectacular! Kids swam in the pool and were happy with it, too cold for me in there.  Great tourist information available in the foyer and in the room a great folder of information for eating out locally. With a Woolworths across the road and a great variety of restaurants and cafes this place is a gem!! The staff were friendly and very helpful. Billy Kwong restaurant is right next door and is a must try for food lovers! Thanks for making our stay comfortable.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_452923474~“Great location”~A lovely hotel in a great location. Rooms and bathrooms are very small but for the bargain price, was to be expected. Staff are really friendly and helpful.

review_452564323~“A welcome return”~I have stayed here a few times. After an absence of four or five years, I arrived and was apparently recognised by a member of staff, which made me feel welcome.  This is a quirky hotel, with an old fashioned feel, which I liked. Staff were polite, helpful and businesslike. Housekeeping was excellent. There's also a laundry area for clients. I always felt that it was good value for money. I have stayed in other places in the city centre, such as a couple of Oaks properties, which I thought were grimy and tired, with an annoying attitude from the management. Although this place is not in the centre, it is only one train stop from Central Station and a couple of stops from Town Hall. I booked a room with a view of Elizabeth Bay and it was lovely. There are also rooms with views of the local district and also some with views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which, from memory, can be a little restricted, but still interesting. There's an iron and ironing board provided. My room was not huge, but a reasonable size, with a pleasant, functional bathroom and a tiny kitchen nook, which is useful for reheating food and making very basic meals. The bed was comfy, but the pillows were a bit of a challenge. There is aircon, which was efficient, but not adjustable. Wifi was free and I used it for a smartphone and a laptop, but needed to log in fairly regularly. The little swimming pool was very welcome on a couple of warm, humid days.  The location is great. Potts Point is very pretty and only 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross station. There's a bus stop opposite the hotel, with a half hourly bus to the city centre and The Rocks. Woolworths operates a supermarket over the road for about 18 hours per day. Cafes and bars abound nearby and the Hayes Theatre is just 5 minutes away. I stayed for 5 days and was happy with my visit. I look forward to staying here again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_451706049~“Great View of Sydney Harbour Bridge”~3 Night stay in September, Paid for harbour view and requested a room on a high floor, we were not disappointed, fantastic view of Bridge, Opera House and Elizabeth Bay. Room was big enough for us two for a short stay, very clean and comfortable bed. Hotel staff very helpful and Woolies just across the road. We walked every where as mobility wasn't a problem (lots of steps), lovely walk though the botanic gardens to Circular Quay but the gardens are closed at night and google walking maps didn't know this. It then tried to take us thought the underpass which is only for vehicles! You need to walk around the gardens, cross over to Hospital Rd then walk through the park towards the Art Gallery to get to the steps which go down to Cowper Wharf Rd.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_451568861~“Quite Disappointing”~We booked this hotel at the beginning of March 2016 to secure it for New Years Eve. We needed to book a mandatory 3 nights minimum.  We secured a Harbour View Studio. After waiting almost ten months and being quite excited, we were most disappointed after we checked in a have a view of Elizabeth Bay. When you pay $$$$s for a view - you kind of expect it. We were told we would be invited up to the rooftop to view the fireworks for New Years - which we attended. They had champagne there for people who wanted it which was a nice touch. We were told we couldn't bring guests yet the very vocal group next to us were having a laugh that they didn't even pay to stay at the hotel and still managed to get up there (at least they were considerate and bought their own esky).  The room has seen better days. The bed was comfortable enough, the iPod docking station would have suited about eight years ago but hasn't been updated to the latest technology.  The little fridge and kitchenette were handy, with Woolworths open across the road until midnight.  The bathroom didn't look clean, there was someone else's razor on top of the shower when we arrived (and when we left). The shower head was loose and kept hitting the wall half way through the shower. The toilet seat was broken. Staff were friendly enough on check in and check out. The hotel was so noisy too - although that's more to do with the guests. I thought there was an elephant in the room above us at times - either that or someone was practicing jump rope. Funnily enough, the quietest night was New Years! Overall, we didn't get the bang for our buck we were expecting. Should have just watched the fireworks on the TV.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~4~nan

review_450976909~“Best views to a reasonable price”~I booked one of the studios with bridge view and I wasn't disappointed. The view was amazing, specially during night times. The roomsize was acceptable. The old bathroom was clean but needs maintainance. The small poolarea was refreshing after a day of sightseeing. I liked the suburb very much.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_450668571~“Small...”~The rooms are extremely small for families with a camp bed being laid across the foot of the other beds. This camp bed is a fold up Spring mattress with I found so uncomfortable to lay on that I had to lie pillows down to lie on. I imagine the room would be good for 2 or even 3 but they are not big enough to fit a family of 4. The kitchen facilities are very basic and old. Other than the size the rooms were up to the standard expected when booking although the kitchen and table and chairs were crammed into the entrance doorway. P.s don't get caught out by the rip off mini bar.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449349430~“Great hotel, great location”~This hotel is located in the the Potts Point area of Sydney which is a upscale area with a number of shops and restaurants. We had a nice room on the seventh floor that had a picture perfect view of the harbor. Although not very large, the room had a small kitchenette that allowed us to have some meals in our room with the food purchased for the store across the street.  The hotel staff could not have been any more friendly and accommodating. Altogethe, an very good experience.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_448778272~“Location and service 4 out of 5, accommodation 2 out of 5”~We stayed here over NYE and the experience was lovely, in terms of the party on the roof to see the fireworks, and the staff throughout our stay were great. But to be honest, without the fabulous view from our room (I cannot call it a suite) and there are only a few rooms on each floor with a view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, and if it wasn't NYE, this would have not been a good choice. You can't make a meal - toast is possible, the shower door opens over the toilet and if someone was infirm they'd really struggle to get in and out safely. The wifi is frustrating, the bed is small. The ironing board cover didn't fit - it was a weird old thing - and quite a lot of the room was dated and scuffed. The staff do their very best to make this place work, and I thank them, but I just felt uncomfortable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446218596~“Excellent location, basic accommodation”~The location of this hotel is it's major asset. It's central, pleasant and vibrant neighbourhood which will cater to most needs of the urban traveller - whether on a business or family trip.  However the hotel i quite basic but clean. It unfortunately oversells itself a bit by the photos on the website. Staff is very friendly and helpful with regards to sites to visit and information on good ways to travel, shortcuts on the map ect.  Having travelled for several weeks when we got to Sydney and this hotel it was convenient that the hotel offers a tiny kitchen. But don't expect this to be an option to cook - but you can make your own breakfast and assemble a basic meal.  The bed in our room, which was called a double bed, was the smallest bed I ever encountered in a hotelroom meant for two persons. It's not even queen size. This was a major inconvenience and again a point of overselling the hotel.  Wi-fi was show and it was very inconvenient to have to go through a major log-in process whenever you put down a device and picked it up again 10 minutes later to move on.  So overall the hotel in terms of Sydney prices and the very excellent location is good. But don't get your hope up to high browsing through the photos on the website.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_446197980~“Attentive staff”~We stayed in a triple occupancy with kitchenette room. The decor was a little tired but the cleanliness and availability of every little thing from nice towels to washing up liquid was provided. Loved the restaurant recommendations list compiled by the staff...really helpful. Highly recommended base from which to explore Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446197842~“Fantastic service and location!”~We had a great stay at The Macleay and all the staff were so accommodating. Our view was spectacular and everything was very neat and clean. The kitchenette was a little bit tight for counter top space but it served our purpose. The location is excellent as it's a lovely part of Sydney and so close to great cafes, shops and woolworths supermarket is diagonally opposite. They offer a great airport shuttle service that is much better value than the train or taxi. Train station is very close for getting to the CBD etc.  We will definitely stay here again!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_445528409~“Wonderful View”~We stayed here as a three night excursion whilst visiting family in the Sunshine Coast.  Sydney is somewhere you just have to visit on your first trip to Australia and the city duly delivered as everything we expected it to be. The hotel, whilst not right on the doorstep of the harbour area is close enough to be easily walkable. The first thing that hits you when entering the room is the stunning panoramic view of the Opera House, Bridge and the skyscrapers of the business district. It is simply the most breathtaking view I've ever had from a hotel room. This adds enormously to your perceptions of the room/hotel. The room itself was clean with a very useful kitchen area. There was a Woolworths opposite selling all you'd need, food wise. The hotel was in an excellent area for eating, if you wanted restaurants and ranged from Celebrity Chefs (Kylie Kwong) next door to fast food outlets around the corner in King's Cross, with everything in between. There were hotels closer to the harbour etc but as Sydney is extremely expensive to eat, at least this apartment hotel offers value for money and an alternative to taking all your meals in the city's restaurants. Once again, I have to go back to that view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444965044~“Good hotel, convenient location”~Spent 6 nights here. The hotel is in a good location, close to supermarket, cafes, restaurant., local transport etc. The WiFi worked. The room was basic, but we did use the fridge, kettle and toaster. A portable hot plate was provided in the room, but there was no real space to cook. One of the ladies on reception was very good and gave us lots of useful advise and directions. I forgot her name, but thank you. Unfortunately we did have 1 cockroach decide to join us in bed and the hotel staff simply said they are common here. So overall for our budget (and Sydney prices) the hotel was good in terms of location.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~4~nan
review_444760241~“Best view ever!”~We stayed for four nights at the Macleay Hotel and we were very pleased with our stay. The location in Potts Point is excellent. There are lots of nice restaurants and cafes in the area and also lots of take away places. Right across from the hotel is also a Woolworths which is very convenient.  We had booked a room with a harbour view and we were certainly not disappointed! From our room we had a wonderful view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Couldn't have asked for a better view. The room itself was rather small for a family of four, but we managed. Should I mention one negative thing then that would have be the walk through Kings Cross, which not really a great place to bring kids. Felt safe but would avoided this area if I could have. Long story short...would recommend this hotel and would be happy to come back.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_444751984~“GEORGEOUS”~First i want to start by praising the staff at macleay. Anytime i had a question they were quick to answer or find an answer. Everything from where is the closest grocery store to waving down a comparable taxi when maxi-taxi never showed. Second i want to say how beautiful of a view we had. Macleay is in a convenient place for great sights of the harbour (top floor is best) And third, the room had everything we needed and more. I didn't expect to use the stove or ironing board but i happened to need both and it was so helpful to have those amenities right there!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_444731826~“Worth the View?”~I have to preface this review by saying we stayed at a hotel/apartment in Brisbane for quite a lot less money, but with more luxurious amenites and a larger space with an ample balcony. With that in mind, when we entered our room we were sorely disappointed here. The room we occupied was 611. I could describe the room as a typical small hotel room with an even smaller kitchenette. If you're planning to make meals, your best bet is to buy something microwavable from the Woolies across the street. They do have a warming plaque, but we didn't see how we can make a proper meal with what we had and the lack of space the kitchenette provided. For breakfast we just had toast. As a plus though, the hotel did provide a small French press--we bought ground coffee at the Farm Wholefoods across the street. Be careful entering the bathroom as there is a small step, just short enough to trip you if you didn't know it was there. Apart from that, the bathroom was actually pretty good. We didn't see how the room we got merited the money we paid. Perhaps it was the view? Yes we had a view of the buildings in the CBD, the tops of the Sydney Opera House as well as the Coat Hanger, but we were just at the same level as the tree tops and we had no balcony. Then again the hotel is located in what seems to be a ritzy part of town. I don't know. I can't answer that here, but be aware of what you're getting into and, perhaps, ask the hotel what the square meter is of the hotel room you're planning to book. Despite our disappointment, the hotel was a good base for us: Woolworth's was across the street and Kings Cross station was a short walk from the hotel. The hotel does provide an airport shuttle for $14 per person. We bought them in preparation to go back home, thinking that they'd drop us off right at the door of the departures, but we had to walk from the parking garage all the way into the terminal. You may want to consider using the train instead, especially if you have some money left over on your Opal card. The service at the hotel was friendly and they are very informative about the area and sights to see--you get a map of the city on your arrival. If you're coming here from the airport, take the train going into the city: look for Central along the list of stops. Once you get to Central, you'll have to change platforms inorder to take the blue T4 line heading towards Bondi Junction. Once you get onto the correct platform just look for the sign that says, "To Townhall". It's the next station and it will be in the right direction since the stop after that is Martin Place, then Kings Cross. At Kings Cross, take the Darlinghurt exit up the escalator. Turn left at the top of the exit and continue all the way down until you see the Woolworth's on your left. Cross the street and the door to your left will be hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443137143~“Great clean, affordable hotel in Potts Point ”~We stayed for five nights here. It has easy access to all the sites by train from Kings Cross or bus #311 right out front of the hotel. Buy an opal card to use train or bus. The staff at desk was very helpful. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is that the air conditioning was a fixed temp & often too hot in room & no screen on window so moth can get into room. Otherwise it was great. Having the kitchenette was wonderful & there is a Woolworths across the street for groceries etc. This hotel is in a lovely safe part of Potts Point with fantastic cafes and restaurants all around. We ate breakfast at Gypsy Espresso one block away every day & it was delicious. The wifi worked well in the room also. We would stay again. Cheers~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442426591~“Fantastic Location”~My husband and I stayed 6 nights in a Harbour view apartment which had a spectacular view. Our room had been recently refurbished and had all the amenities we needed. The kitchenette, with kettle, toaster, microwave, hot plate, knives, forks etc was an added bonus. The location is fantastic, with a but stop over the road, a station a ten minute walk, and the city Centre an easy 20 minute stroll. There is a grocery shop across the roads, and lots of trendy restaurants and cafes in the immediate vicinity. Every floor has laundry facilities and we found the staff very helpful. We have decided that next time we stay we will try a room overlooking Elizabeth Bay because it will be slightly quieter. We like to sleep with our windows open instead of having the air conditioner on, but Macleay Steet is a busy road, so it can be quite noisy. All in all we found the hotel excellent value for money and had a great stay and will definitely return~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_441788272~“Motel or garage conversion type room at 5 Star Prices”~Potts point is one of our favorite places to stay in Sydney, and we have lived there for five years previously and know the area well. We have stayed in many of the Points Point hotels and this by far was the most expensive and disappointing,  It is in a great location, and walking distance to Darlinghurst, Woolloomooloo, the botanical gardens and even the Opera House. We booked a room with a view of the harbor or bridge. Unfortunately, our room 701 looked straight into the building next door, but if you stood at the window and looked to the right you could see beautiful Elizabeth Bay and to the left half of the bridge(no water). We were only staying one night as my partner was graduating, I had requested an early check in, which I mentioned when I got to the reception and before I had finished the sentence I was shut down with "we do not guarantee early check-ins".  A great start, if the guy had just said it in a more polite way it would have been ok. The room, this was the biggest disappointment, if felt more like a garage conversion. Very unfinished, no styling, cheap nasty finishes and very dated. It was clean, but for that kind of money, we will not be staying again. This could be a great hotel if they just invested in the rooms,~1~1~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_441638317~“First visit to Sydney”~Prior to our arrival we requested a room with a harborview and were delighted with our ninth floor view. We were treated to Saturday night fireworks. Our room was recently remodeled making it very comfortable. When I found the pillows a little flat they found fluffier ones for me. We had a slight problem with the shower door that was immediately repaired. We ran across the street to Woolies for breakfast foods and were able to eat in the room most mornings of a 6 night stay. The neighborhood was delightful with nice restaurants (Fei Jai, Maggie Chow's) We had all our expectations met or exceeded.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_441246033~“Great Views and position”~A good value hotel in Potts Point. We paid a bit extra for Sydney Harbor and Bridge views. Good room and staff although WI FI on the 8th floor didn't work. A shuttle to the airport is available for $14 or catch the train if you prefer. The station is not far down the road. Plenty of Cafes and restaurants nearby as well as the Botanical Gardens with the NSW Art Gallery close by and Circular Key is walkable.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_441242762~“Great view, convenient location, tired room”~Pros: Great view of the harbor (we had a harbor view room); location is quite convenient to public transportation; lots of food options in the neighborhood; supermarket across the street is a great thing to have; bathroom is updated and quite nice; kitchenette was very useful  Cons: Room was rather dated; parts of bathroom not properly cleaned when we first checked in (hair on the floor and door); wifi is extremely slow requiring constant re-logging in; bed was surprisingly a Murphy bed; there was a leak in the room resulting in a wet spot on the carpet when we first arrived (though it was fixed quickly) Overall, we would recommend the hotel; it was a good stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440750745~“Astounding value Potts Point”~If you want to be close to good cafes, the harbour and the city but not pay CBD prices, this hotel wins hands down.

review_440478401~“They lost my booking I had no room to stay in.”~I booked this room on check out from my previous stay, this was witnessed by my colleague who has a corporate rate with the hotel. The staff were kind of apologetic but never took responsibility. They said try up the road, I was not successful up the road in getting a room. The staff did not make the effort to help me get a room that night. I will never stay there again. I would phone the day before you stay confirming your room and noting there name down. I think they sold my room to get a higher rate. Poor form from The Macleay Hotel.~1~nan~nan~nan~3~3~1~nan
review_439628026~“Only if you don't need wi-fi”~Lots of pluses - well located in better part of Potts Point, close to wonderful restaurants like Billy Kwong, Macleay Street Bistro, Monopole, Yellow etc, , Woolworth's nearby BUT WiFi was a deal breaker, kept stopping and starting for my whole 2 day visit - this was enough to overcome any benefits. Views of harbour don't compensate for anyone on a business trip. Rooms are small, garbage bin was placed by bed as insufficient room and you could easily fall over it when you walked around.~2~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_439112865~“Good value for money, great neighborhood, not for business traveler”~The Macleay is good value for money - it's about 25 minute walk from Circular Quay, 10 minutes from King's Cross station, right next to Billy Kwong and countless other wonderful cafes and restaurants, a cozy bookstore and the Elizabeth Bay House less than 5 minutes away. The rooms are clean, some with great views of the Bay and Harbor, but more utilitarian than luxurious. The bed is quite comfortable and I loved sleeping with the windows open, listening to the birds and enjoying the cool breezes coming off the bay. That said, this was a partial business trip and the hotel is not quite set-up with international business travelers. The WiFi is spotty and weak, and the room set-up isn't conducive to work in the room.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_438681846~“Great value and good location”~Great for what we wanted - basic but clean and comfy beds, air con etc. In a fun location with lots of nice restaurants and cafes nearby.

We would recommend this to anyone for a short weekend in Sydney.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436921198~“A Fabulous Layover Between Tours”~The room and amenities were awesome, the staff was spectacular and the beds were ever so comfy! Across the street were a grocery store and a liquor store. We had 4 days between our Australian 2 week tour and our 2 week cruise around New Zealand. This was the ideal place to relax, do our laundry, walk the interesting streets around Potts Point, and enjoy the local area restaurants. There were a lot of students living in the area who were helpful with information.

review_435625541~“Great stay at this hotel”~Just had a 6 night stay at the Macleay Hotel at Potts Point. On arrival spoke to Paolo who gave us maps and good advice for getting about the city. Our room (903) had a fantastic view over the bay. Well equipped room with everything we needed with washing machine and dryer on each floor which was very useful. Woolies just across the street which was handy for any odds and ends needed. Although a wee bit out of town there is a bus runs past the hotel to the city and Kings Cross train station, just a 5 minute walk away takes you to city. Well worth buying an Opal Card to get you about. You can use it on bus, train or ferries. However about 20 minute walk via Botanic Gardens to the Opera House is lovely if you're up to it. Lots of places to eat nearby. All in all a great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435152994~“Great location ”~Hotel is in a brilliant location, close to shops and bars and restaurants. We booked a triple studio with harbour view and I'm so glad we paid the extra as the view compensated for some of the short comings...the room was smaller than it appeared in the photos, and it was definitely a challenge to fit in an extra bed which we needed for two of the five nights we stayed. The "kitchen"ette and bathroom were slightly tired looking but completely serviceable and clean and this wouldn't put me off staying again.  Reception were super helpful, allowing one of our party to check in before me as the main booker. I'd recommend this hotel for location, and the handy pool. It's not super modern but great all the same~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434074445~“Locatio, amenities, it's got it all”~Rather than stay in the hectic CBD, this hotel in Potts Point is situated in an upscale, trendy area with easy access to the whole of the city. The underground at Kings Cross is a ten minute walk away. There's a nice Thai restaurant across the street and a Greek one about 2 blocks south on Macleay St. Shopped at the Woolworths (not a 5 & 10 cent store!) for breakfast items and ate in every morning. Service was very good. Fresh toiletries and towels every day. My 4-day stay was a very pleasant one in a district that feels like a NYC neighborhood...the Upper West Side.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433809843~“Convenient to both Kings Cross and St Vincent's Hospital”~Surgery in Sydney required me and my husband to find a reasonable hotel, with parking, within a reasonable walking distance of St Vincent's Private Hospital in Darlinghurst. I looked at a few options, and then chose the Macleay Hotel. We had a room on level 5 with a view of the district (Harbour views are available, and cost more), and we had everything we needed for a four night stay. Just across the road from Woolworths (Potts Point), and plenty of restaurants and cafes. Parking needs to be pre-booked (only limited spaces available) and there's a 1.8 metre high limit to access the parking. I'm looking forward to returning to the Macleay Hotel in the future just as a tourist! The staff were lovely, the room was clean and well kept, and the location is perfect.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_433418942~“Handy location and a very easy stay”~I stayed here with my family for two nights. We shared a room on level 3 and although smallish, it was clean and had all the amenities including bar fridge, stove top, microwave, sink, toaster, kettle, iron and ironing board. The location is perfect if you're not interested in staying in the thick of it. We certainly didn't find it noisy either. Easy walk to train station (2 stops to town hall shopping), cafes, restaurants, botanical gardens, St Luke's hospital, Rushcutters Bay and more. A Woolworth literally across the road and chemists as well. It's such a great location which makes it such an easy pleasant stay. Much more relaxed than staying In the CBD of Sydney I would say. There is a small pool too as well as deck chairs if you feel the need. I found the staff very professional and pleasant. Staff quietly got on with their job and left you alone. Underground parking is available for $30 per night which makes things easy as well. Although not a flashy hotel and it certainly doesn't claim to be, its tasteful, very clean, is in a great location and I would highly recommend it as a place to stay. Oh and if you're lucky you'll have a nice view too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_433390005~“Mid priced, budget quality hotel in nice neighbourhood”~As long as your expectations are set correctly you'll have a good stay. Have to say I was extremely disappointed, we paid extra for a triple studio with harbor view on the 8th floor. Tiny room with patched up plasterboard panels. Nice view but split with large tower block in the middle and unless you sat on the bed you really can't appreciate it. Moved to a room on 6th floor, losing view of opera house but gained an extra 2 feet at end of bed. Cheap flat pack furniture and thin walls, but clean and the staff were very receptive. Couldn't sleep first night due to dodgy motor on fridge kicking in every 5 mins - the fridge was replaced immediately.  Nice neighbourhood but Kings Cross a lot more sketchy than anticipated.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433153887~“4 day break”~We were on 9th floor with lovely views across the bay. The room was an adequate size with a small kitchenette. It had a microwave, kettle, toaster fridge and a double hotplate and a sink. A frying pan included so although there was limited space a fry up was possible. There was also a laundry room on our floor which we didn't use. The hotel was just a 5 min walk to Kings Cross tube station. But if you prefer to walk it was a pleasent walk into the main tourist areas. Walking through Botanical Gardens. About 20-25mins to Opera House. Maybe less if you didn't stop to admire the scenery. A good Base. We got shuttle bus back to airport but in hindsight would probably have been quicker and cheaper to catch the tube to central and then train to airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

There is a launderette, supermarket and Zinc café opposite, and the hotel will arrange the laundry. Breakfasts at Zinc were really good value, and the hotel will arrange delivery of food if required (altho it's only 20 yards from the hotel entrance)! A really pleasant walk to Circular Quay through Botanic Gardens takes 20 mins (via Potts Point and stunning views of Opera House and Harbour Bridge adds 10 mins).

review_431088370~“Kings Cross Sydney Australia ”~Located minutes walk from Kings Cross, $14 by airport shuttle from Sydney international and domestic airport, walking distance to all of Sydney attractions, Opera House, Harbour, city CBD, theaters, China Town, and Kings Cross... Hotel is comfortable service apartment style, rooms are adequate, some rooms overlook Harbour Bridge....but you pay more... We booked directly with hotel and they bettered any online booking, if driving, hotel has parking available under hotel... parking is tight but well worth the $30 per day....as being in the Kings Cross district....there is very limited access to parking anywhere, and if you do find some it'll cost you an arm and a leg... Staff check-in friendly, room clean, 24 hour front desk, and free Wi-Fi in rooms... Can't find much better in Sydney....there is a Woolworths supermarket across the road, if you want to eat in your apartment, eating out can be expensive in Sydney...~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430916279~“Unexpected gem”~Stayed with my wife and daughter for 3 nights in mid October. Great hotel and nice and clean . A good 20 minute walk to the harbour but an enjoyable walk at the same time . The roof top pool is actually on top of the car park and wasn't heated which was a shame as it's still spring time and made the water cold .booked a district view but had to stand on the bed and look way over to the right to see anything . This didn't really matter as we were out and about most of the time..staff were very helpful too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430786408~“Stay at the Macleay”~The staff were informative and excellent. I had a nice view over the eastern aspect of Sydney Harbour. The hotel is in an excellent location for what I needed. The bathroom is small but modern and convenient.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428039892~“A Great Find - A Real Gem”~This hotel was a great find. I over-nighted twice this trip, and was delighted I chose this one. All the staff was so polite, helpful and friendly. Both times I had a very comfortable room, with a wonderful view of the harbour and opera house. I could not believe the standard of the room for the price..$157.00 per night...but this of course would depend on time of year and bookings. The position was smack bang in the centre of everything at Potts Point, and all sorts of restaurants and cafes. Included was an in-room kitchenette with tea, coffee and cutlery. Room service was also available..I had breakfast; eggs, bacon,toast and coffee. Plenty of ATM`s around, and a supermarket just across the road. The entrance foyer was very pleasant, with a welcoming feeling. I could not recommend this hotel more.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_427497727~“Good quiet place to stay within easy walk of many facilities”~We had a room next to the lift and we did not hear any noise from it at all. Views are great. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Room is well appointed. Market down the road towards kings Cross station is worth a visit on Saturday morning, they had some lovely food healthy food there.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_427156423~“Handy to restaurants and cafes”~It's overall a good hotel,but it is dated ,the bathroom has old 2 tap operated shower and was very hard to get the temperature right the whole bathroom was 70s /80s style,we thought the staff were excellent apart from one lady who seemed moody all the time~3~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_426669822~“Simply The Best - Macleay Hotel. No regrets.”~At the end of my 6 days escape in Sydney, I am so so glad that I have selected Macleay Hotel as my home away from home from 27 Sep to 03 Oct. Looking back I could not have made a better selection than this. Potts Point is definitely the area/region to stay and its just so happen that Macleay Hotel is located right smack at where it should be. Usually, the plus point for a Hotel is either location or its surrounding. For The Macleays it is both. It is within walking distance from Sydney Opera House and just about everywhere else like the hip neighbour Surry Hill (gotta go there). For The Macleays - some of the popular eating places are just to the right, to the left or across the Hotel. What more could a visitor ask for - right ? To the left, there's Billy Kwong. Across the narrow street, its Cho Cho San. And the breakfast place Zinc etc...  It helps that I like to walk - leisurely especially when on holiday. The cool weather helps to make walking/strolling that much easier and relaxed. At this point, I have to (before I forget) mention that having a resourceful, friendly and down to earth - front desk friendly face helps to a very very large extent. It is The Macleays fortune to have Paolo. His resourcefulness and pin point accurate recommendations provided us with a lot of options to choose from and "spoilt" us momentarily. He also taught us to take the local bus service 311 - not found or listed on the Sydney Map given out. This is a "big secret" that is so important to guests staying at The Macleay. Unsure if its Paolo - but our Room 703 has the "best" view that overlook Sydney waters.... During check-in, Paolo mentioned that I have requested for early check-in, room away from the elevator, higher floors - everything except a room with a view. I laughed too because having travelled for a while - a View is something to wish for but to request - hmmm.... never knew I could.  So having been alloted Room 703 was a very pleasant start in the right direction.. There is also Woolsworth supermarket just diagonally across the street and a few bistros stone throw away from The Macleays. It is just so liveable.... Whoever is heading to Sydney for a getaway, you really have to stay here.... You will be very glad that you did at the end of the trip. What else is there to say... Lets see. The room is quite spacious; not sprawling but with walking space to pace to and fro... Ha ha. The room comes fully equipped with microwave oven, two hotplate, cutlery with pots and pans. Complimentary freezed dry coffee and various flavours tea bags... The basic amenities are quite substantial. At the end of a day, I always wind down with a cup of Camomile or Peppermint tea - brewed with freshly boiled water from the kettle... Hmmmm.... so relaxing just thinking about it all over again... Bathroom amenities are complete too. The "Soak" brand of toiletries are really quality stuff. I especially like the texture of Hair Conditioner; nourishing and yet not overtly heavy to limp out our long hair... The only grouse is that housekeeping provides only one tube daily. I supposed its sufficient for one long hair guest but for two of us... So we did ask for an additional but on different occasions - we hit the wall. I missed The Macleays already. If ever I visit Australia again and Sydney - I will not hesitate to put up at The Macleays again. No doubt. Hopefully, Paolo would still be there - with his bright, cheery smile and pleasant disposition.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_424274343~“Top spot, excellent staff”~We were very happy with the whole experience at the Macleay. The location was great, with easy access to trains and buses, and a pleasant walk to the Art Gallery of NSW. Staff were efficient, friendly and helpful, and the lifts were quick. The view from our studio apartment was amazing - it's definitely worth paying extra for the harbour view. We had everything we needed in the little kitchenette and the bed was comfortable too. The pillows could do with an upgrade, but everything else was terrific.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_423673077~“Nice and functional...but lacks warmth”~This hotel is functional, practical, clean, nicely furnished, efficient and in a great location. Booking and check in/out was easy. The only problem is, it really lacks warmth, both in decor, layout, interactions with staff. I asked for a quiet room and got one right next to the lift. Although, it's not a huge hotel, so all rooms are still quite close to the lift.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_422668734~“Eleven”~What a great find! Staff are eleven out of ten. So friendly and helpful and never too busy to make sure that we were comfortable. Great area within an easy, but not short stroll into the city, along the bayfront at the Botanical gardens emerging right at the foot of the Opera House steps. We had 2 different rooms during our stay. The first night on the 3rd floor with a lovely view over Rushcutters bay. For the rest of our stay we had a 9th floor room with the most spectacular view of the Opera house and Bridge. Rooms have a well fitted out kitchenette, and there is a late trading major supermarket across the road to get supplies if you wish to make meals. The building is old but we had renovated modern bathrooms in both rooms. One had newer furnishings, not expensive but practical. For the money we paid we thought we got outstanding value. We also enjoyed the area. But by far, the biggest impression was left by the amazing staff. Would return in a heartbeat.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_422665820~“Great location close to St Vincents”~We had to take our daughter for surgery at St Vincents Hospital and the info provided by the staff was very adequate for our needs. The whole area with supermarket, pharmacies, cafes and very good restaurants was excellent. Staff were very friendly and nothing was a problem. Room was clean. beds very comfortable and cooking facilities adequate for our needs. Would definitely stay again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_422664625~“Family visit”~Competitively priced, accommodated 3 comfortable single beds (not on website), in-room kitchenette, fantastic location close to cafes and shops, clean, helpful front desk staff, amazing view from roof 360 degrees of Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422312336~“Amazing Service”~Pretty normal as far as hotels go in that price range, however the location was superb, and the staff went above and beyond in every way to help us on our business trip, from the moment we checked in till the moment we checked out. Thank you~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422196388~“Budget + location good, but we wouldn't stay again”~The hotel staff is incredibly friendly, and the room is adequate - especially considering the budget. This was, however, our least favorite stay on our 3 week vacation. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable, and the walls thin - every time we would fall asleep we would hear a very loud BANG!!! - not sure if it was the laundry room nearby (which would be weird since who's doing laundry at 3a.m.?), or if every room door is made of lead, but it was a very restless night. Neither my husband or I got any sleep at all. The wifi was the absolute WORST we experienced in all of Australia - even compared to many public wifi's. It felt worse than dial-up of 2 decades ago. The location is great in popular Potts Point, and we did have the harbor view we booked, but the hotel was very hard to find - there is no sign on the street - you'd have to be across the street to be able to look up and find the sign on the facade, and there's no sign on the door. The airport shuttle was convenient - only $14 compared to the train which is more. We appreciated all that they offered and it was clean and a good room, but the loudness and uncomfortable pillows and bed means we would not book here again.~2~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_421943641~“Excellent service, great location”~I stayed here for a month, during which I felt right at home! The staff are so friendly and helpful. The wifi is great, the rooms are clean and well looked after. The BBQ area was really handy and they provided paper plates and utensils for us when we used it. There is a supermarket across the road and some nice cafes and it's a short walk to the Kings Cross ferry and also the Botanical gardens. The rooms have sufficient cooking facilities so you can avoid eating out every night. The gym that we could use was really good, although it was a short walk from the hotel it was well equipped and really great.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421205433~“Easy to get around”~From the Macleay it was easy to get to the train station and reach a lot of sights. Upon arriving we walked to botanical gardens which was beautiful. Only bad part was walking up and down the steps by the harbor. Great fresh air in the evening and great view of the harbor. Staff very cooperative. Only thing we missed was a coffee pot and oven. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_421074036~“Convenient, fantastic service”~Great location with all tourist attractions and shopping just short train trips away. Train station is a very short walk and while plent of eateries around don't really cater for families. Bit of a stretch calling rooms apartments as they are extremely small with everything in one room. Not really suited to families as not much room to move. Extremely clean, staff very helpful and was great having our own kitchenette. Better suited for 1-2 people rather than a couple with kids.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
