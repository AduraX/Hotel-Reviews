review_478703141~“good value”~good value , well located , lots of food options close by , nice apartment , would stay again but ask for a quieter room away from the road .  Staff are friendly and helpful; and everything you need is there~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478701891~“Lost items”~Despite good value for money, spacious accommodation and friendly staff at the reception, we have had a big issue with lost items. Firstly, we were expecting important letters to arrive on our names and asked to be notified of their delivery. As letters did not arrive in time, we have called to check on the office whether they were delivered to the address and it stated that they have been, but staff at the hotel told us that it hasn't, so they got lost somehow.. Strange.. Secondly, and most importantly, as we moved out and unpacked, we have noticed that we were missing a sunglasses case, where we placed 3 rings. Called to inquire with the hotel's lost and found - no luck. We thought it may have been left in the taxi, checked with them - also no luck. Thought it's our fault that we misplaced them. But later also noticed that a corkstopper with sentimental value was missing. Definitely could not have been left anywhere but at the Meriton apartments, inquired and again nothing found.. Check everything twice prior to departure from the room as chances are not high that you would be able to recover the items afterwards..~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478624875~“Hidden Gem”~Close to city without the jungle feel. It was very peaceful as we couldn't hear any outside noise from traffic nor any "noise" inside from guests. We felt like we had the whole complex to ourselves.  The apartment is well set out and has everything you require in it. A very relaxing place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478522314~“Awesome Place”~This place was a great find. its a fairly new construction with large units with a living room, kitchen, bedroom, washer and dryer. Very clean and a friendly staff, right next to a shopping mall and a market. Highly recommend it!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478389150~“Nice Stay!”~Everything was wonderful! Sure will recommend to others! Two bedrooms with two bathrooms! Nice balcony! All cooking utensils are available. A dish washer is available for washing up.  A washing machine and a cloth dryer helped us a lot to manage our dirty clothes!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478254955~“Meriton Serviced Apartments Zetland”~10 out of 10. Apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable. We payed a really good rate because we booked over the weekend. We only stayed one night but could have easily stayed a week, enough space and dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer. I also loved the soap, shampoo and conditioner.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477868851~“Outstanding!”~Superb quality apartment, effect for my holiday in Sydney. Had everything I could possibly need including balcony dining area! I just wish I hadn't booked all my accommodation in different places as I would have definitely booked all my stats in meriton properties across Sydney had I known how excellent they were!

review_477756360~“Ok/ good”~Overall, the room and service is OK. the room was not clean completely. E.g I left 2 used cups at the basin and it was not cleaned until the 3rd day. I don't stay long in the room so it was still OK for me.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477613945~“Great location and comfortable accommodation”~The Meriton Zetland apartments are well located with easy access to the airport and CBD. They are only one block from East Village shopping center which hosts restaurants, cafes and supermarket options. Major motorways are also easily accessible from this location. The apartments are clean, comfortable and well appointed. Free Wi-Fi is available. The staff are courteous and helpful. There is secure parking available at extra cost; parking can be tight and spaces difficult to find on occasion. The apartments nearer Defries Avenue can experience more street noise. Sadly there is no coffee maker available (but you can get a rice cooker!). We experienced a problem with the microwave oven where it would cut out after 2 minutes of operation; this problem was reported twice but not resolved. Also one daily service left us short of towels and coffee/tea/sugar replenishment, this situation was eventually rectified. This was our second stay at the Meriton Zetland and it must be said our first experience was much better than this recent stay; the apartment was certainly superior and quiter, located on the east side of the complex.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477575235~“Beautiful”~It was more than my expectation. We really got more than what we paid for. We will definitely book again.  The facility was very tidy and specious. Parking was straight under the building and easy to locate.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477567009~“Meriton Zetland stay”~Comfortable, quiet and well presented. The bed was extremely comfortable, unusual at many apartments. Spacious with excellent views.

review_477287930~“Really good place to stay”~We have stayed here twice now and both times have been excellent. We recently stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and it was excellent, really spacious (over 2 stories) and really clean. Couldn't fault this place at all.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477244725~“Nice apartment, lousy internet”~Just outside Sydney centre these apartments are better value for money even when taking account of the added Uber fares into the city. Mine seemed very new, in good condition, well laid out, lovely bathroom and shower. Well kept and the service was good. Not many utensils so you do have to keep on top of the washing up. Only negative was the internet which kept cutting out. Streaming a movie was impossible.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477099070~“Nice apartment with lots of room”~Nice and spacious apartment, really friendly staff and excellent service. The only little drawback is the noise from the arterial road right at the back of the block I was in, so I could not really enjoy the little balcony that received the light from the rising sun :(~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477061992~“excellent room”~early checkin when rooms are available, cheap daily parking cost compared with other hotels near city, within walking distance to coles. the room is equiped with washing machine and dryer, large living room, kitchen and dinning room, made our stay very comfortable and stress free.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477043188~“Large rooms”~I have stayed at many meriton serviced apartments and I am always happy when i leave. I find the rooms nice with plenty of space and it is very convenient to have the kitchen facilities. It is also nice to come back after a day of exporing to a clean room and a newly made bed. I stayed 2 nights and wished I could stay another night! Staff were friendly and helped us with some walking spots and things to while during our stay. Loved my stay, ill be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476731434~“Excellent Service”~Was welcomed by friendly staff. Room was great, quiet and very clean. Staff at reception were brilliant and very helpful and informative. The free wifi was a great help for my son who had a uni online exam.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476721843~“Very comfortable”~The bed was the most comfortable that I have experienced in a motel before. Very nice suite. About a 45 - 60 minute walk into the city, so not so close to tourist spots if not wanting to drive. Would enjoy staying again if needed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476720566~“Fantastic Modern Serviced Apartment”~We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment over Easter with our two small children. It was great. Close to everything (which is saying something for Sydney) and a great shopping village close by. Fantastic modern apartment with double glazing so you don't even notice the traffic. Opted to pay extra for a car park in the building - also totally worth it not having to hunt for parking on the street. Only complaint is that the dryer in the apartment is unusable because it was just too loud.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476640495~“adam holliday”~Meriton Zetland was great as per normal. The staff are super nice and friendly, and our room requests are always taken care of. The rooms are always super clean and we'll be coming back again. Thanks for another great stay and see you next year.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476556264~“meriton zetland”~apartment was in excellent condition car parking was spacious&easy to use.staff were very helpful & professional.The only problem we had was gaining entry to our building using the swipe cards,however all up ,we had a great time at this property and I would recommend meriton zetland to other visitors.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476335251~“One of the BEST”~Room was well appointed plenty of room and very comfortable. Close to all amenities, shops, public transport and the city. Staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival and the same at check out, could not fault anything.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476268529~“Sporting commitment ”~Outstanding service, convenient location next to south Dowling st and 15 min walk to Green Square railway station. We booked a 2BR unit and were upgraded to 3 bedrooms. Big enough to stay for a month with all facilities. New, clean and comfortable for a family. Fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Great restaurants, cafes, Coles and an impressive bottle ship just 5 min walk away. We will be back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476046037~“Very beautiful and comfortable”~Fully furnished and equipped apartment. Very comfortable. Near to stores and restaurants. Economical as compared to hotels. Well maintained building and services. Nice view. You just need to cook food everything else is provided.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475974499~“Good but ...”~My daughter and I recently stayed for 4 nights and overall the apartment was excellent with very friendly staff but ... the apartment was 'half' cleaned (Eg not vacuumed or dishes not done it put away) with different items missing each day (Eg towels, tea towels or bath mat) plus my key wouldn't provide gym/pool access plus they kept making up the bed as one double instead if 2 singles - we requested separate beds on numerous occasions (splitting the twin king ourselves meant only one of us had a blanket!). I will give Meriton one more try when I go to Sydney again as overall reviews are very good. We were probably just unlucky.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475728542~“Lovely stay”~We stayed the last two nights and it was great value for money and very spacious. Will stay again. Friendly staff. Close to shops and restaurants. Really good to have the facilities of an apartment but come home after a day of exploring to a clean fresh room with our bed made. Even allowed a late checkout-really appreciated- thanks meriton!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475517953~“Very nice place”~It was a wonderful experience to staying at this place. The suite was very clean, appointed and pleasant, the bed was very comfortable, bathroom was top notch... would definitely recommend to others and will stay here again if I have a chance.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475184263~“Meriton Zetland”~I have stayed in this hotel many times. However, my last experience was terrible because of the below two reasons.  Firstly, I tried to use the iron. I turned it on and as soon as I wanted to iron my trouser was burned which was a very expensive suit trouser. And I had so many memories with that.  Second day, I went to my room. The windows were kept open from the housekeeping. I arrived late night. It was freezing in the room. I tired to use the air-con and it didnt have a battery. I tried to call reception, the phone was not working.  I was very disappointed with Meriton's this time.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475172762~“Good with plenty of space”~Did the job well, and had plenty of space and well priced. Staff were very friendly and easy to deal with. Had no issues just little things here and there but, overall would stay again at this place. Good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474842332~“Disappointment”~I left a $200 value small-goods in the refrigerator. I have rang front desk 3 times every time they promised me will ring me back. No phone calls. Then I send an Email, I have a return phone call, however since 5 days now I still don't know what is happened with my staff. This is not the way to handle customer complaints.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474658552~“Great staying”~Everything was good but wifi was weak and limited. Also the best way to get the hotel is taxi ( about40 AUD). Then you can buy opal card for your travel in sydney. Because metro from and to airport has additional fee about 13.8 AUD per person plus train fare.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474502646~“Has it all from A to Zetland!!”~Very impressed with all the finer details and luxuries. Room was fresh, inviting and immaculate. Indoor spa, pool and sauna facilities were a hit for the 4 and 34 year old. Check in super quick and easy, friendly helpful staff and there was no drama and no extra cost extending our check out in the morning to 11am.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474490235~“Zetland - cool digs”~We stayed at Meriton Zetland and it was really cool. Seamless staff. Awesome service. Rooms spotless and functional. Lovely toiletries. Tea and coffee options great. Quiet room ie slept through night. Wonderful eateries near the hotel. 5 minutes from the SCG. Great parking. Only negative was room had no pen... Highly recommend 5 stars ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474471663~“Upgrade...but not”~Really enjoyed my stay. Great place. Great location. I was told I had been 'upgraded' to a 2 bedroom apartment...BUT that they would lock the downstairs bedroom and bathroom. OK so do you mean that you have no more 1 bedroom apartments and now I have to walk upstairs for nothing...? Oh and the gym is really basic.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474461683~“Overrated”~Room had a strange smell Dirty marks on the wall. Bedding configuration was not made up to what we had asked for. Room was not made up until 4pm on the 2nd day. Very expensive for what it was.  Beds were comfortable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474399843~“Amazing rooms, convenient location close to the city and friendly staff”~Myself and my partner stayed here over the Easter Show starting weekend and the location & price were the deciding factor is us choosing Meriton Zetland.  Green Square station is short stroll which connects to Sydney Airport and Central station, from Central you can travel anywhere.  The rooms were very spacious and modern with kitchenette. The beds were comfortable and provided facilities were great. I would highly recommend staying at Meriton Zetland, it 100% won't be my last time~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_474392827~“Amazing hotel. Just outside the city therefore not paying city hotel prices!”~This hotel is very modern and well equip. Not far from shops and easy free street parking. It was easy to catch a taxi into the city and back out. Loved the hotel amenities like the pool within the building. Will definitely recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474368148~“Great Value Accommodation in Sydney”~If you want a great value apartment in Sydney, try the Meriton in Sydney. The location itself is very practical. Close to the Airport and CBD. Despite the fact that Zetland itself is a "self sufficient" suburban destination, it is a really good place to use a base to do business or explore Sydney. The accommodation is excellent! Fully serviced rooms with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms and enough living space to be comfortable as a family or with friends.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473701930~“One night stay.”~The staff were excellent the rooms was just what we were looking for. Clean and quite large. We used the pool and the gym. The price for the room was a perfect deal, we purchased online. Hopefully the rates will stay the same.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473557926~“Very luxurious!”~Stayed for 3 nights/4 days with my young family for a holiday and couldn't be happier. Lovely fresh linen on the comfy beds, services daily and great to have all amenities available for cooking as eating out in Sydney gets rather expensive. Great location near supermarkets and shops. Only downside was the $21 daily charge for parking on top of room rates. Other than that a very pleasent stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473489182~“Great!”~I have never stayed in Zetland before but I was impressed. It says it .8km to Moore Park - which it probably is as the crow flies - but expect a good 30 -40 minute walk at a good speed to SCG. We had a studio room with lounge, kitchenette, bathroom and a wonderfully comfortable bed! The only things I would suggest would be block out curtains or blinds and repositioning of the awkward toilet roll holder plenty of lovely cafes around and parking was $21 per night.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473062551~“Friendly comfortable and clean”~Stayed her to be close to Randwick Hospital. Very friendly professional stall. Lovely apartment for great price. Close to restaurants and bars although a little noisy on a Saturday night but throughly enjoyed our stay~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472865114~“Great location, easy with the kids”~Our stay was like being at home, easy to have the kids with good size apartments, walk to great coffee shops, restaurants and shopping complex. Fabulous staff, wonderful daily servicing and clean premises.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472862807~“Fabulous location and great staff”~Great location nearby to East Village and handy to Crown street restaurants. Taxi rank out front made it easy to travel around, with the car safely in the underground carpark at a fraction of what you pay in central Sydney. Staff are very professional, friendly and helpful. Despite being close to Eastern Distributor the double glazing made it very quiet. Room was very spacious and clean. Overall a great place and we will definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472800933~“Great place to stay”~Modern and well equipped apartment within short distance from the city. We had a very comfortable stay in our 10th floor apartment. Traffic is terrible so better to avoid rush hour when driving into Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472775897~“Jayzatzetland”~We arrived early and as such had to wait for our room. We were offered alternatives but did not want a street suite. We had a one bedroom room which was light and spacious. A nice size terrace. Any problems we had were dealt with swiftly by maintenance. Zetland was within walking distance of Waterloo. Buses and the Green Park station were nearby. East Village shopping centre was just down the road from Meriton and it had Coles, a food market and a variety of places to eat. There was an onsite pool and gym. Staff always polite and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472768995~“Good”~The service was really great. Everything was good except the bed. It was not comfortable at all for both of us. Parking is bit tricky and congested.  The housekeeping service was outstanding and they will only come, when you will not be there.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472762786~“Great great Stay”~Loved the location, friendly Staff and superb Room, highly recommend staying here :) Was handy to Airport and Transport with Shopping Centre and Coles just down the Street. Easy to get to by Uber or Bus with lots of food options close by. Give it a go, won't be disappointed!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472691873~“Nice, but ...”~This hotel has all the nice features of the Meriton properties, in that your room is a big suite. However, this location is not early as good as the one in Brisbane. First off, the location is suboptimal. It's about 1 mile or more from the train station. But if you Taxi to everywhere, there is a taxi station just outside. Location wise, on the plus side, it's just steps from to the East Village shopping center and the Salmon and Bear eatery. There's not much else around as it is in the middle of a "burb". The suite I had really showed wear and tear, with scuff marks on the door, walls, and the clothes dryer didn't work. The milk pods in the fridge for the coffee had spoiled; no telling how long they've been in there. On the whole it's good and functional, and reasonably priced compared to other hotels in Sydney that would have costed the same w/ 1/4 of the space. So I'd still recommend it, but given that I was spoiled by the Meriton in Brisbane, I may be a little to hard on this place by comparison.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472606358~“Home away from home”~I was very pleased with the serviced apartment we stayed in. It was clean, comfortable & staff were polite and attentive. Sauna was a great bonus! Awesome restaurants/cafes & atmosphere in the area. Street parking is great but gets very busy at night. Very happy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472574203~“Amazing apartment and facilities”~Perfect location, amazingly clean and comfortable apartment and facilities. Had everything a home away from home or business could ask for. Great wifi and it was spotless. Pool, gym, sauna and spa was awesome~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472061987~“Good Choice for both short & long stay”~Room is bright, spacious and clean. It feels like home because it's fully equipped and very convenient, and the bed is so comfortble that we often overslept in the morning. We really love it! The only drawback is that it's a liitle far away from bus station (7 mins walk) and train station(15 mins walk), but it's ok for me. Not a big deal.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471823432~“Nice, clean, good staff.”~We stayed here as a last minute booking. We booked through a website which took about half an hour to come through onto the computer systems. When we arrived in our room we found it to be clean and spacious although there was a bit of a smell like there had been a smoker in there.  Nice and close to a small shopping centre, about 2 min walk, and several good places to eat.  Only real complaint I the entry to the Peking which seems backwards as you drive in on the right hand side instead of the left...  would stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471539219~“Spacious and helpful”~Stayed for four nights, used the pool and gym, found the staff helpful and willing to provide all kinds of useful information to help our stay in Sydney. Took advantage of their trip suggestions which enhanced our stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471525079~“Spacious and comfortable.”~If you are looking to stay outside the city centre, this is a very comfortable place to stay. We stayed overnight because we had a 6am flight the next morning. Close to the airport but traffic in and out of the city centre is awful so if you were to stay here and visit the city as a tourist, you need to choose you times in and out. Taxi cost 25 dollars one way. The apartments themselves are very good and I would recommend if this location is for you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471326115~“Fine and convenient”~I had to choose a location near to the airport yet accessible from town and had good food options. This turned out to be a solid choice. Had stayed at their other locations before and they are always trustworthy. Service was good and rooms were clean. Good value for money I would say.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471277733~“Great value apartment hotel”~This hotel in a new area near Moore Park and 20 min drive from Sydney CBD has spacious and comfortable accommodation with full kitchens and laundry. Easy walk to trendy eateries. Situated just off Southern Cross Drive so there is traffic noise.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471264567~“Good old fashioned 'customer service'! Rare these days!”~Having visited and stayed at Meriton Serviced Apartments in Zetland many times now - in their one, two and 3 bedroon units I had to take a moment to acknoweldge their service. I stay for business and hold day time meetings and have people stay over at times etc. My most recent stay was in one of the 3 bedroom units and I emailed them ahead of time with several requests, including early check in and other supplies in the apartment. Everything I requested was willingly, happily and promptly supplied. We had a leak - maintenace came and fixed as suited my schedule not theirs. Other things asked for, needed, last minute requests and extra facilities were again, promptly, willingly and warmly provided. Truly, it has been a while since I experienced such genuine, heartfelt 'service'. Thank you to each member of the front desk, housekeeping and maintenance crew who assisted my guests and myself have such a successful gathering. We all left feeling very 'taken care of'.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471241577~“Simply Awesome”~The rooms are large and clean, the staff are excellent. The Green Square train station is about a 10 minute walk from this hotel, but it only takes one train to get to the Wharf and the Sydney Opera House etc.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471096543~“Staff”~We had a lovely time. Our Room was spacious and comfy. Amenities are available and promptly replenished. Staff at reception are really friendly and helpful. The room was tidied everyday. I surely would recommend staying at Meriton Zetland.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470964850~“Excellent room, even better service.”~I highly suggest staying at the Meriton, I have stayed at a number of Sydney's Meriton serviced apartments including zetland. My stay was luxurious yet cozy and perfect for the 3 days I spent in Sydney. Close to train and bus services making it convenient for travel and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470955455~“A touch of home”~I stay at Meriton Zetland whenever IJtravel to Sydney for work as it is convenient to the places I need to visit (Alexandria and CBD). It has great amentities such as supermarkets, cafes and restaurants nearby - all just a short stroll and the spacious apartments make a work trip a bnit more comfortable (and like home) than a standard hotel room. I like that the complex has its own pool and gym too!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470932206~“Disappointed for that price!!!”~We arrived to a beautiful foyer and thought this would be a lovely hotel. We were given room 601. This hotel has a somewhat weird layout with different buildings and a fair bit of walking between them. Overnight secure parking cost $21 so that wasn't too bad! Check-in was fairly painless but you would expect that for $420 a night! I think most ppl would expect near perfection at $420 overnight considering no complementary breakfast...no food at all in the hotel! If you want dinner etc you will have to use Delivery Hero or go down the road to the cafés or shopping centre! We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with balcony and 2 bathrooms. We arrived to a hot and clammy room just to find out NONE of the 3 aircons were working! They are all interconnected somehow but with separate temperature control settings, but they were all "dead"! We tried to log into the WIFI...that wasn't working either! We opened the fridge and there was a plate of DRY melon slices which actually looked like they were left behind from the previous occupant...somewhat yuck!  We called reception and some guy came up...he had to flick the switch on the power board in the kitchen cupboard for the A/C to get them working again...a bit iffy! I had to do that myself TWICE again when A/C stopped working AGAIN around midnight on the first night! The lamp in the lounge room didn't work! I was promised to get it fixed but they didn't! I told the guy this too when he came up to sort out the WIFI because their normal WIFI was "down" so he signed us in on their Premium WIFI (don't know if that cost us any extra)! Beds were comfy BUT the second bedroom was set up as 2 single beds and NO TV in there which is very inconvenient IF you travel 2 couples. I don't know if they would have come up to reconfigure that second bedroom to a King bed if we had asked because at that point my hubby and I were a tad cranky that things weren't working! Rooms were clean and had all the little extra shampoos etc to get you through about 2 days. Washer and dryer worked well. Apartment had a bathtub and a good sized shower. There was a long hair in the bathtub, the edges around the glass screen had rust and dirt and toilet took forever to flush clean! We didn't use the wardrobe so no comment about that! There was a fair bit of outside noise from other occupants below us until 2am and the fact the hotel is right under the flight path from the airport! It was impossible to sleep with the windows open!  Balcony...now I had a HUGE issue with that if I had brought kids there! We were on the 6th floor and the 4 seater table was standing up against the railing wall...VERY UNSAFE IF YOU BRING CHILDREN THERE...actually I would be too scared to bring children there! Bedroom windows could get opened with wind-up...maybe not much but far enough for a child to climb on bedside table and squeeze out the window :-( Day 2 came...lamp still not fixed...A/C reset on power board a couple of times again when it shut itself down. We went out for lunch just to return and our key card didn't work in the lift or to our room so hubby had to walk all the way down to reception from Building L to get key card activated!  Dishwasher works but no instruction to what program fits what number on the machine. Instructions said "set desired program, close door and it will start"! A bit hard when nowhere was mentioned what 1-7 programs were! NOT IMPRESSED! This stay was really expensive for 2 days and for that amount you expect things to WORK! On check-out the lady asked my hubby if they had offered us a different room...they didn't! It shouldn't be up to us to reset A/C on the power board when it stopped working! A new light bulb in the floor lamp would have been nice but they DID sort out the WIFI!  Furniture in lounge is really uncomfortable...Lounge is so hard I felt like my back was broken after sitting there for about an hour! Would I stay there again? NO...not for that price!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470929808~“Great location and stay!”~Staff were lovely, the room was beautiful and in a very easy location. Shops were close by for supermarket, cafes etc and then it is a quick drive to city or touristy places. Would highly recommend this place.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470836963~“Was ok. Not like meriton used to be”~Dish washer was foul smelling and the sink was blocked. We had to pour 5 kettles of boiled water down the bathroom drain to allo water to flow. Bed was comfy. Everything else standard. Not like meriton used to be. Sheets seemed to smell.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470759367~“two day stay”~TV reception faulty, faulty sink plug, no bath mat, no hand towel, no Foxtel on main tv...otherwise ok.Good views and reception, room was refreshed. Bed was comfortable and plenty of car parking available. Handy to shopping complex.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470759027~“Internet”~Internet connection not very well sometimes， but it always can be solved immediately， lovely location and friendly services which are good for people, highly recommend for family travelling， also avaliable for cooking～~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470757657~“Nice and pleasant stay”~The room was nice and clean and the kitchenette, bathroom and laundry were new and in perfect condition. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly and obliging. Also the pool and spa area was modern and clean.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470199788~“Good Business Service apartment”~Stayed here a few times for business as it is near the office. It is very well appointed and they have a proper reception area with proper guest services. The apartments are very spacious and well appointed. I usually get a one bedroom apartment and it has a TV in both the lounge and bedroom. It also has a washing machine and dryer so you are pretty much self sufficient. There is also a kitchen with all the utensils and pots and pans. It is about a 20 min walk to the nearest train station - Green Square. There are a no of shops including a little shopping centre with a coles/woolworths and plenty of restaurants that you can either dine in or take away. All in all a very nicely appointed apartment with good efficient guest services.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469782754~“Convenient place to stay within 30 mins commute to CBD, though a tad expensive”~The place is well maintained with very good amenities in the property. Within 2 mins walk are a few restaurants, supermarket, shopping mall, etc. Bus stops are 10 mins walk to get to CBD. Getting taxis are also quite easy. The property itself is very good and well maintained. However it was a bit pricey, but that is the kind of prices you pay in Sydney anyway.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469728620~“Great location, good facilities”~Stay was comfortable althought the elevators are terrible. Incredibly slow and unreliable. My car didn't work or was overiden when a member of staff got in on many occasions. Very frustrating! Additionally to this, I made the mistake of leaving once of my bags in the room. I did not realise for two days. But the venue never contacted me upon them finding it, which is terrible and shows a complete lack of simple process. I had to contact them, and when I did they could not tell me if they had my bag or where it would be. I visited the next morning and they couldnt locate it anywhere. It was mentioned that all 'lost property' goes to one room. My bag was not here and there was no note of it being found. But after this I was taken to another room which also contained lost property. Very confusing after being told there was the one place for all lost property. My bag was not here either.  After an hour there, I left with no bag and very frustrated.  A member of my team went in later that morning and waited an additional 30 minutes for them to locate it.  I realise it was my fault for leaving it, but the venue having a simple lost property process would have solved the entire thing and prevented the unnessary leg work.  They need to fix this ASAP. It's not premium service at all!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469584372~“7 days in Sydney”~One of the best place I have stayed. Very clean, love the shower, and it's very roomy for the length of our stay. If you are not from Australia buy your own adapter for the electrical outlet. Location is perfect with a Small Mall that offers good restaurants, cafes, markets and other amenities for the local community. Bus service to the city is walking distance from the apartment. You would feel like a local resident staying at this place. Much better than those high end Hotels in the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469577207~“Best value for money in Sydney”~Wonderful location with easy access to transportation from the airport and to downtown. Grocery stores and other shopping very closeby. Very new and clean with great service at the front desk and housekeeping...highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469561859~“1st class”~Great quality nice staff. Wonderful cafes and restaurants nearby. Room was spotlessly clean and everything worked well as should be expected. Good value parking and loved the pool, spa and gym facilities~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469545605~“The best place to stay in Sydney”~Apartment was new, clean and functional. Bed was extremely comfortable and the surroundings extremely quiet. Close to all amenities and yet so tranquil. Booking in and out easy and staff very helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469544906~“Six day should same service to one day”~I stay here for five night six day and one day the waiter take away three of my tea cup I don't know how to drink tea. And because I stay here for 6 days the service is not as well as one day. The clean time the clean speed and everything is not better than stay here for one day!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469511389~“Great stay.”~The place was very clean with regular room service going to the extent of even putting our dishes through the dishwasher.  Perfect location, quiet streets at night.  Only issue we found was they'd take towels, bath mats and face washers away, and day by day wouldn't return them.  On the last day we were left sharing one towel and using a face washer at the foot of the bath.  But I'm sure we could have had them returned with a call to reception.  Highly recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469237340~“It's been lovely”~The Meriton staff have been very helpful, whether in replacing or fixing anything needed, or accommodating weird invoicing requirements. We've been in a 2 bedroom apartment for 6 weeks so far while our place is being fixed up from the storms... the pool is an added bonus~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469224071~“Fantastic”~We had a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The very helpful,friendly staff, apartment, pool, spa and sauna, views and lovely grounds were very impressive. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment has everything you need.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469214766~“Best of the best Serviced Apartments”~All Meriton Serviced Apartments are perfect for business, families, couples or singles. I've found Zetland to be the most convenient for me with restaurants & supermarket next door. Extremely spacious and clean. I stay here 1-2 nights each fortnight for business with no issues over the past year!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469055687~“Spacious clean quiet and cheap”~Loved it, huge apartment, very comfortable and quiet. No traffic noise at all or noise from other rooms. It is very conveniently located if driving (quick access to main roads). It's about a 10 minute drive to everywhere and quick access over to Randwick Bondi and Sydney cbd. Parking was an extra $20 so we skipped that.. but it's 4 hour free parking on the streets surrounding, unlimited after 6pm and weekends, this suited us fine. It would be very easy to have a long stay in these apartments as they (or at least the one we had) was very spacious. Loved it will stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469025865~“1bedroom apartment stay”~Our room was great as requested away from busy freeway noise. Kitchen was equipped with adequate supplies. Bedroom was a decent size. The only downside was thebath room was slightly dissapointing given there was a chunk of dark hair still around bath plug and the bath needed a good clean.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468621309~“Good Value”~We booked a studio room for the night and had a room on the 17th floor with a balcony which was great. Friendly desk staff and very clean rooms always makes the stay even better. Only a short walk to plenty of good places to eat or walk up to a pub for a few beers!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_468444680~“space”~very large 3 bedroom unit. just disappointed that the parking which i thought was included was $21, the t.v. had no text option and the iron shorted the electricity. allow a bit of time for check out because the lifts are extremely busy. you have to run around in the rain to get to the reception from some buildings~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468437354~“Stopover stay near shops and family”~Meriton Zetland is located in Zetland walking distance to a small shopping complex. It is located within a residential area full of apartment complexes. The Meriton apartment composes of 4 building with a range of apartment types. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment complex in room 429 on level 4 in O building for one night.  The neighbourhood has street ticket parking, free after 10pm? Although by the time we arrived in Sydney on a Saturday night, all the spaces were taken. Meriton has their own parking which is $20 multiple entry/exit per night. Check in was quite swift, it has spacious reception area with revolving entry door. There are pamphlets on the side highlighting Sydney sightseeing as well. The one bedroom apartment is very spacious, consisting of two sets of 2-seater sofa, large TV, small kitchen with all kitchen utensils provided, dishwasher and microwave. Tea set and coffee also available. The bathroom was spacious with bath and shower integration. Cabinets were had anti-fog mirrors and good ventilation. Basic bathroom amenities were provided. Large king bed was in the bedroom with small TV attached. Washing machine and dryer were provided.  The bath/shower switch was broken, however, we were still able to shower quite easily. Pressure was good. The bed itself was firm and comfy with adequate reading light.  Wifi was complimentary in the booking, although it was hard to get adequate connection. Not sure if it was my phone or it just didn't connect very well.  There were also gym, swimming pool and sauna facilities, however, we did not use it. Overall great experience, the tax invoice was sent to me via email with the total amount charged. Would definitely recommend and will most likely return should we visit. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468415839~“Perfect for airport access”~Perfect for its access late at night and just beating the airport curfew - excellent value for a quick stopover and spaciousness.  Zetland is just 8 minutes drive and a very affordable nights sleep in a one bedroom apartment.  Little of any style or design; new is the best thing to say about the decor which was simply unimaginative. But who cares when it's one night and affordable the preference. Fitted the bill. Parking is impossible so paid the $21 instead of driving the streets.  Close to many cafes and restaurants - lots of choices nearby including Danks Street and Three Blue Ducks.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_468394055~“Wonderful”~Such a large, comfortable apartment we had. Fully equipped kitchen. Two TVs. Most comfortable beds. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The train system though is a 15 minute walk away and in inclement weather we had to use taxis. A bit expensive. All in all a most wonderful place.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468018604~“Had a cosy stay”~Great place to stay. Felt very comfortable and not short of amenities. Bed was sooo comfy. Love the laundry. Staff were great and helpful. Lots places near by to eat. Would have liked to stay longer and see the pool and spa. Maybe next time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467997470~“LOCATION, SERVICE, STYLE but only 1 lift!”~This Meriton is great. Perfect location to Sydney CBD (close enough), great access to the airport and then it's got the shopping centre just up the road, manicures, massage, coffee, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fantastic food is located here as are amenities, chemist, Coles etc etc. The Meriton itself is fairly new, the rooms a very clean and modern, everything you need. The reception staff are very friendly and happy to assist The ONLY downfall thus far and I am sure all there will be is that the tower we were in only has one elevator..... a tad annoying at 0730 in the mornings! or 6pm at night.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467921934~“Second time stay was just as good as the first stay!”~Greet and meet was very warm by great staff. All my details were on file. Quick process. Received a lovely well appointed and clean room with a view. Very good under cover safe parking at a fair price of $22 per day. Good shops and restaurants close by. Safe walk around area, vibrant with lots of people around. Will stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467712576~“Excellent!”~My stay at Meriton Zetland was amazing, the room was spacious, modern, clean and offered many more facilities that other hotels did not (i.e a kitchen and laundry) and yet was much cheaper! It is located next to a large shopping centre, lots of cafes and a short walk from the train station. The hotel also has all sorts of other facilities available for guests like a gym and jacuzzi! All of the staff were lovely and very accommodating - all in all a terrific place to stay in Sydney~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_467696217~“Central to Everything”~This is my second stay at Meriton Zetland. Everything was perfect. Great location with direct buses to University of NSW, University of Sydney, the beaches, Sydney CBD and of course the direct train to the Airport. The complex has roomy apartments with great views and all the modern conveniences. The bed is also extra comfy! There is a Woolworths very close by and many takeaway food places and restaurants. Uber from the Sydney domestic Airport was around $20.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
