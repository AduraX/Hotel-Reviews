review_478793044~“Nice stay”~This was our 2nd stay in 5 months. Very child friendly. The bathrooms and common areas are a little worn but King ocean room was more than adequate- what an amazing view! Cute little balcony to sit and watch the surfers catch waves. Good minibar and housekeeping. They've recently upgraded their entertainment system to include movies and an AirPlay function which is great. WIFI system is antiquated and it would be great if they heated the pool. There are a lot of excellent food choices within walking distance. Overall a very relaxing, pleasant stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_478458278~“Another great stay at the Novotel Manly Pacific.”~My wife and I have stayed at the Novotel Manly Pacific on a number of occasions and it is always a terrific stay. Great rooms, great location and on this occasion for the first time we dined at there in house restaurant Zali;s. My wife and I had lunch there and the food and service was so good we ate there for dinner as well. Fantastic food and service. I would recommend if you stay at this hotel pay the extra and get an ocean view room it is worth the extra money. Great views of the beach.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_478117221~“Superior Room or Standard Room - which is better?”~Superior Room or Standard Room - which is better? In the past week we stayed in 3 different rooms at Novotel Pacific in Manly, and I must say that the results were a mixed bag. The "Superior " room had only 2 plus points, a king size bed and a quiet location on the back side of the building. The first "Standard " room had only a queen size bed but many more plus points: Bigger balcony with a view of sorts - much brighter room. Bath tub. Towel rail. Place for our wash bags. Clothes line over the bath tub. Better air conditioning controls. The second "Standard" room was similar to the first one but with 2 queen size beds. However, it lacked the balcony and also hot water. A tepid shower was not a good start to the day. Our son had the same problem in the adjoining room. You can judge if a $45 discount on a bill of $678 for the two rooms was adequate compensation for the lack of hot water in both rooms. Finally, why is it that only the big hotel chains have the nerve to charge for WiFi? None of the 5 small hotels along the Western Australian coast charged us to download our emails. Yes the Novotel system was "high speed" but a $10 charge for 24 hours on a room the costs $339 per night seems a charge too far. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_478025025~“Need to lift”~For a relatively expensive hotel the service and facilities are straining to match said price. Bed quaintly talks to you through popping springs and the pillows must of come off from Captain Cooks last visit. They are like sacks of flour.  Booked in for the first time and wasn't told a thing. Only one staff member booking people in so his job was just to bang the customers through. Expect that from an Ibis not a Novotel. Make sure you ask about beach towels beach equipment etc because you won't be told. Also if in the courtyard ask about access through the gym. You may find out when you access the lift and come out like we did.  Location is spectacular and I assume that is supposed to warrant the price.  Street noise at night is not great so if in doubt yes have the second bottle of red as it served us well as a sleeping pill. The street sweepers and other gear at 5am also reminded us country folk that our city cousins have little peace.  Overall not the best Novotel I have been too and the prices charged anywhere but Australia would have you in a 5 star or more but alas Sydney is Sydney.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

All staff friendly, and ask if you need help (I know they are trained to do this, but none the less). Good restaurant and bar within the hotel, which is great for business events, or smaller groups. Good buffet breakfast as well. $26 for the continental, so not a cheap option, but plenty of places within 5mins walk if you want to get outside. First choice for a stay in Manly.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476425070~“Great location, well presented ”~I can't think of anything negative to say about this motel, it was worth the money to upgrade to an ocean view, we spent a lot of time on the balcony.

All the staff were very friendly and gave us a discount voucher for the restaurant for breakfast (which was wonderful)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We didn't need our room to be made up but the cleaner went out of her way to make sure we didn't need anything, like towels, tissues etc. she was very friendly and looked like she enjoyed working there. The staff seemed to all be very professional and friendly. During the Easter holidays they had regularly activities for the kids which was great.

review_474377159~“A delightful place for a break from city pressures”~We had a lovely time at this resort. The room gave us a wonderful view of the ocean and beach through the mighty Norfolk pines. The room was great with good facilities, and the dining room was also top notch. It is only across the road from the beach with all its activities and just a short stroll from the Concourse and all its shops and eateries. Well worth the stay. Air conditioning is quiet and effective~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_473457169~“Over priced tired convention hotel in a good location.”~Manly on a summer weekend is a popular place to go and there are not a lot of hotel options which is how I ended up at the Novotel. I booked an entry level room on booking dot com for $360 a room and was given a basic room over looking a busy road on the second floor just above the convention rooms. I often think if you book through a third party you get the worst room because the hotel makes less money for your booking. Check in was slow as we had a trainee but over all was ok. The room was clean , dated and basic which is what the hotel is like overall. The best part is the location.~3~nan~nan~1~nan~3~3~nan
review_473158600~“Good location and helpful staff”~Stayed for a few nights last month on my way back home after seeing family in Perth and found the hotel to be well-situated and reasonably priced. The beach is right across the street and the Queenscliff ocean pool is about 10 minute walk down the beach if you aren't brave enough to risk the breakers on Manly Beach. Plenty of pubs, shops and restaurants within minutes walk and the ferry into Circular Quay is only a 5 - 10 minute walk, so very convenient. The hotel itself is fine, with functional, clean rooms - sea view would probably be nice, but I didn't have that. There is a nice restaurant next door that you can sign to your room, which is good and the hotel restaurant itself is ok, although lacking a bit of atmosphere. Aside from the location, the main thing I liked about this place was the staff, who were really helpful and friendly from the moment I checked in - across the reception, concierge and bar/restaurant, which unfortunately is a bit unusual, but makes a big difference. Highly recommended.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_473105965~“Nice car park view”~Stayed here for one night on business. Sensational views over the road of Manly Beach. Shame my room looked out the other way onto a rock garden.

review_473098948~“Very old and outdated rooms, great spot though.”~We stayed here on a Saturday night for over 950.00/night. The only thing the hotel has going for it is the location and the buffet breakfast as it was good. The service were junior with really no clue on service. The old pool on the top floor was poor for the rating they tell people. The rooms were very old and for an apartment was small. Advise to look elsewhere or negotiate a cheap price.~3~nan~nan~2~2~nan~1~nan
review_473029301~“Sensational hotel right on the beach”~I stayed at the Novotel the night before my wedding recently and was extremely happy with it. The staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodating and the room was spacious and perfect for what my bridesmaids and I needed (it was the 2 bedroom suite with ocean view- can't go wrong!). The restaurant downstairs (Daniel San) is loud but fun and the food is delicious. I live in Sydney (not far from Manly) but will definitely book another night at the Novotel Manly Pacific for the experience again, highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_471725472~“Oldie but a goodie”~So, the hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment. It is tired looking and beyond it's best before date, I suggest that this should have happened some time ago; hence the 4/5 stars. However, you are staying at Manly's Millionaire Row; you are located across the road from one of Australia's most popular beaches and in a great place for restaurants, travel experiences and picturesque locations - that is going to cost you. Convenience is a key factor here, the area is well serviced by transport, shopping, activities and atmosphere. Accept that fact, pay the money and enjoy your stay.  Any hotel will do their best to cross sell/market or "nickel and dime" guests, that is a given. I felt very comfortable here. Having said that, front desk staff are good at their job and friendly, although recognition of loyalty program would have earned more praise. The lobby, bar and restaurants well presented and housekeeping was scrupulously clean. Room service was good and requests were met graciously. Beds were comfy, linen good quality and again, clean. The interior decor is bland to the extreme but aside from that, well maintained in spite of it's longevity. Complimentary wifi (good speed, download limits and quality ok) is a bonus with the loyalty program so that earned a tick - if you need more downloads or a faster speed may I suggest you pay for it. Parking is underneath and to the rear of the hotel, $35 per night. It is secure and safe to use, I am happy to pay for that as a female travelling with my daughter. I would use this hotel again for staff, presentation, location and safety - having said that, a refurbishment would be welcome but again, may place this property out of my budget due to its surroundings and the need to cover the cost of its fabulous placement. Well done Novotel Sydney Manly Pacific, a solid 4/5 - your staff are a credit and an asset, your hotel beautifully located and presented and I would very much recommend this hotel for safety, value for money and service. I would recommend joining the loyalty program in order to make the most of your stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471607601~“Weekend getaway”~Very happy overall, Pleasant to stay for 3 nights here. Love free-to-use beach amenities for hotel guests. Very thoughtful a gift of wine & the card for our anniversary. Beautiful view from the swimming pool. Breakfast menu may need to improve/alternate change (despite so many varieties).

review_471317556~“Great location”~After an epic Airbnb fail, we scrambled for last minute accommodation, and although expensive considering its age and stars, it was like an oasis after being in hell!  Rooms are big and clean with 2 queen beds. Perfect for friends sharing or even a family with 2 young kids. It is modern but lacks a little bit of warmth in the decor!  We stayed in the ocean front and with its balcony overlooking manly beach it is definitely worth paying extra to do so! I think that this is really why you would stay at the Novotel! That and its great position close to all the restaurants! Breakfast was ok however I have stayed at many 5 star hotels particularly in Asia and so I think have been spoilt! I was definitely lacking anything innovative but had everything that you needed Would definitely stay again but would only book if there was a deal! Over $400 a night is not worth the money! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469607029~“Manly still wins”~When we are visiting Sydney we consider Manly the place to stay. A beautiful superb with both the harbour and the Pacific, and that wonderful 30 min ferry ride into Circular Quay. The Novotel Manly Pacific has a prime location and is a very good hotel. OK it is a little tired, particularly the bathrooms, but this is mitigated by such excellent and friendly staff. Our stay, even in not so good weather, was thoroughly enjoyed and we would have no hesitation in staying there again. AUD 35 per day for car parking is a negative, although we were told this was competitive for Manly.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469098724~“WELL SITUATED DATED HOTEL OVERLOOKING MANLY BEACH”~We spent two nights at this hotel during the recent Australian Surfing Event. Unfortunately, we were unaware of the busy period when we booked as the bars and restaurants were overflowing with youngsters. The hotel is situated in a prime position overlooking Manly Beach. However, the hotel looks dated and needs a makeover. The bedroom was adequate and bathroom was a good size. The main problem with our visit was that the bedding/pillow cases in our room had NOT been changed and were stained.We invited housekeeping to view these items and they were replaced immediately! I complained at reception in relation to the above and to their credit, we were allowed  free breakfast, a discounted room rate and later a bottle of wine in our room. Free Wifi was allowed as long as you joined Accor Website.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan

Staff very helpful and friendly. If coming from the airport, would suggest arranging a shuttle bus. The hotel will gladly arrange this for you.   The hotel is perfectly situated opposite the beach. A trip to Sydney on the ferry is, of course, a must !~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467738134~“Very comfortable hotel”~I recently stayed at Manly Beach for a conference with my manager. Although comfortable enough, it's obviously been a while since renovations were done and the general feel is that the decor etc is a bit tired. My friend and I shared a room with 2 queen sized beds, bathroom, small kitchenette in the built-in wardrobe and a good sized balcony overlooking the beach. Beds were very comfortable. All food supplied throughout the conference was top-notch, really enjoyed it. Breakfast was buffet style just off the lobby, with a good selection and nice food. The only negative I can think of was that there was no coffee to be had outside of the restaurant. Only instant coffee was supplied in the hotel room, otherwise it was a very nice stay.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_467421187~“Don't get a room near the lift”~I don't think I've stayed in a more noisy room! Unfortunately we were in the first room next to the lifts which meant we heard to-ing and fro-ing all night, as well as all of the early-risers (and their terrorising kids) going backwards and forwards from very early in morning.  There was also some water feature or watering system outside the window which made it sounds like it was pouring with torrential rain! The rest of the hotel is nice enough - we had pleasant experiences with the general services, and the hotel bar, and our room was comfortable and had everything we needed for our one-night stay.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_466421035~“Didnt get what we paid for.”~We booked approx 10 months before for a beach front room, 2 nights and paid the big bucks. What we got was the back of the property, our view was 3 great big concrete walls. We rang reception to inquire what has happened and they said it should have told you at time of booking it wasnt beachfront, but it was thats why we chose it. We were offered an up grade for an extra 100 a night, What an insult, of course we declined. My wife was very upset and we chose to leave the next morning. Getting our money back for the 2nd night was a massive hassle. also parking costs to high as well as the very over priced rooms.~3~1~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_465179873~“3 Star hotel rooms , 4 star service ”~I think it's important for potential overseas visitors to understand the limitations of the hotel. The rooms are 3 star. However in Manly there is not much competition. Basically it is the location & the hotel over charges for this .  The rooms are basic , old and tired.  I must point put though that the service of the staff is excellent. So well done to the team there .  I am guessing overseas visitors who have stayed in 5 star hotels in other locations would feel ripped off by the low standard of the building & presentation of the rooms.  All in all one needs to lower their expectations. It is a 3 1/2 star hotel with lovely casual service that you pay 5 star prices.  For better value around Manly I would be looking at 5 star renovated serviced apartments instead .  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477773233~“MANLY 2017”~A very nice stay at Novotel Sydney Manly Pacific. Only complaint pricing on website was cheaper than actual price. The ocean view room was very nice, with beautiful view of Manly, North Steyne and Queenscliff beach.~4~3~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_477090276~“It's all about the view!”~Stayed here for a week as a base for part of a holiday. Hotel is pleasant. Maybe in need of an update here and there, but it's clean and the staff were very friendly. But the location is superb and the view looking out over Manly beach and the Pacific is just superb.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476988371~“Great short stay”~My wife and I have stayed here many times for short breaks and always find the staff very friendly/helpful. The hotel generally has a good atmosphere and our accommodation was very clean as usual. The location directly across the road from the beach and near the Corso is excellent.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476707666~“Great location. Good for Business or leisure stays”~Third (or 4th) stay at the Manly Novotel and you expect a certain experience and the Manly hotel does not fail to deliver. All staff friendly, and ask if you need help (I know they are trained to do this, but none the less). Good restaurant and bar within the hotel, which is great for business events, or smaller groups. Good buffet breakfast as well. $26 for the continental, so not a cheap option, but plenty of places within 5mins walk if you want to get outside. First choice for a stay in Manly.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475924142~“Great location and ambience”~We stayed here for 5 nights and found it to be very clean and very friendly. We didn't need our room to be made up but the cleaner went out of her way to make sure we didn't need anything, like towels, tissues etc. she was very friendly and looked like she enjoyed working there. The staff seemed to all be very professional and friendly. During the Easter holidays they had regularly activities for the kids which was great. They have a restaurant which provided good dinner meals and a buffet breakfast which was quite extensive. We would definitely book here again...~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_473158600~“Good location and helpful staff”~Stayed for a few nights last month on my way back home after seeing family in Perth and found the hotel to be well-situated and reasonably priced. The beach is right across the street and the Queenscliff ocean pool is about 10 minute walk down the beach if you aren't brave enough to risk the breakers on Manly Beach. Plenty of pubs, shops and restaurants within minutes walk and the ferry into Circular Quay is only a 5 - 10 minute walk, so very convenient. The hotel itself is fine, with functional, clean rooms - sea view would probably be nice, but I didn't have that. There is a nice restaurant next door that you can sign to your room, which is good and the hotel restaurant itself is ok, although lacking a bit of atmosphere. Aside from the location, the main thing I liked about this place was the staff, who were really helpful and friendly from the moment I checked in - across the reception, concierge and bar/restaurant, which unfortunately is a bit unusual, but makes a big difference. Highly recommended.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_473105965~“Nice car park view”~Stayed here for one night on business. Sensational views over the road of Manly Beach. Shame my room looked out the other way onto a rock garden. I asked if I could get another room, not interested in changing me. Shame, I like Manly, but not here.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473098948~“Very old and outdated rooms, great spot though.”~We stayed here on a Saturday night for over 950.00/night. The only thing the hotel has going for it is the location and the buffet breakfast as it was good. The service were junior with really no clue on service. The old pool on the top floor was poor for the rating they tell people. The rooms were very old and for an apartment was small. Advise to look elsewhere or negotiate a cheap price.~3~nan~nan~2~2~nan~1~nan
review_473029301~“Sensational hotel right on the beach”~I stayed at the Novotel the night before my wedding recently and was extremely happy with it. The staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodating and the room was spacious and perfect for what my bridesmaids and I needed (it was the 2 bedroom suite with ocean view- can't go wrong!). The restaurant downstairs (Daniel San) is loud but fun and the food is delicious. I live in Sydney (not far from Manly) but will definitely book another night at the Novotel Manly Pacific for the experience again, highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_471725472~“Oldie but a goodie”~So, the hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment. It is tired looking and beyond it's best before date, I suggest that this should have happened some time ago; hence the 4/5 stars. However, you are staying at Manly's Millionaire Row; you are located across the road from one of Australia's most popular beaches and in a great place for restaurants, travel experiences and picturesque locations - that is going to cost you. Convenience is a key factor here, the area is well serviced by transport, shopping, activities and atmosphere. Accept that fact, pay the money and enjoy your stay.  Any hotel will do their best to cross sell/market or "nickel and dime" guests, that is a given. I felt very comfortable here. Having said that, front desk staff are good at their job and friendly, although recognition of loyalty program would have earned more praise. The lobby, bar and restaurants well presented and housekeeping was scrupulously clean. Room service was good and requests were met graciously. Beds were comfy, linen good quality and again, clean. The interior decor is bland to the extreme but aside from that, well maintained in spite of it's longevity. Complimentary wifi (good speed, download limits and quality ok) is a bonus with the loyalty program so that earned a tick - if you need more downloads or a faster speed may I suggest you pay for it. Parking is underneath and to the rear of the hotel, $35 per night. It is secure and safe to use, I am happy to pay for that as a female travelling with my daughter. I would use this hotel again for staff, presentation, location and safety - having said that, a refurbishment would be welcome but again, may place this property out of my budget due to its surroundings and the need to cover the cost of its fabulous placement. Well done Novotel Sydney Manly Pacific, a solid 4/5 - your staff are a credit and an asset, your hotel beautifully located and presented and I would very much recommend this hotel for safety, value for money and service. I would recommend joining the loyalty program in order to make the most of your stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471607601~“Weekend getaway”~Very happy overall, Pleasant to stay for 3 nights here. Love free-to-use beach amenities for hotel guests. Very thoughtful a gift of wine & the card for our anniversary. Beautiful view from the swimming pool. Breakfast menu may need to improve/alternate change (despite so many varieties). Some asian choices would be nice :) see you next time.~4~4~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_471317556~“Great location”~After an epic Airbnb fail, we scrambled for last minute accommodation, and although expensive considering its age and stars, it was like an oasis after being in hell!  Rooms are big and clean with 2 queen beds. Perfect for friends sharing or even a family with 2 young kids. It is modern but lacks a little bit of warmth in the decor!  We stayed in the ocean front and with its balcony overlooking manly beach it is definitely worth paying extra to do so! I think that this is really why you would stay at the Novotel! That and its great position close to all the restaurants! Breakfast was ok however I have stayed at many 5 star hotels particularly in Asia and so I think have been spoilt! I was definitely lacking anything innovative but had everything that you needed Would definitely stay again but would only book if there was a deal! Over $400 a night is not worth the money! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_470443341~“Nice. ”~Great location. Making the upgrade to a ocean view was definitely worth the price. The rooms are showing some signs of their age and use but are still nice.

review_469607029~“Manly still wins”~When we are visiting Sydney we consider Manly the place to stay. A beautiful superb with both the harbour and the Pacific, and that wonderful 30 min ferry ride into Circular Quay. The Novotel Manly Pacific has a prime location and is a very good hotel. OK it is a little tired, particularly the bathrooms, but this is mitigated by such excellent and friendly staff. Our stay, even in not so good weather, was thoroughly enjoyed and we would have no hesitation in staying there again. AUD 35 per day for car parking is a negative, although we were told this was competitive for Manly.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469098724~“WELL SITUATED DATED HOTEL OVERLOOKING MANLY BEACH”~We spent two nights at this hotel during the recent Australian Surfing Event. Unfortunately, we were unaware of the busy period when we booked as the bars and restaurants were overflowing with youngsters. The hotel is situated in a prime position overlooking Manly Beach. However, the hotel looks dated and needs a makeover. The bedroom was adequate and bathroom was a good size. The main problem with our visit was that the bedding/pillow cases in our room had NOT been changed and were stained.We invited housekeeping to view these items and they were replaced immediately! I complained at reception in relation to the above and to their credit, we were allowed  free breakfast, a discounted room rate and later a bottle of wine in our room. Free Wifi was allowed as long as you joined Accor Website.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_468432940~“Good but over-priced”~Stayed at the Novotel Manly Pacific for 4 nights (having stayed here previously in 2009) Room was good but felt it was over-priced - especially the breakfasts. Staff very helpful and friendly. If coming from the airport, would suggest arranging a shuttle bus. The hotel will gladly arrange this for you.   The hotel is perfectly situated opposite the beach. A trip to Sydney on the ferry is, of course, a must !~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467738134~“Very comfortable hotel”~I recently stayed at Manly Beach for a conference with my manager. Although comfortable enough, it's obviously been a while since renovations were done and the general feel is that the decor etc is a bit tired. My friend and I shared a room with 2 queen sized beds, bathroom, small kitchenette in the built-in wardrobe and a good sized balcony overlooking the beach. Beds were very comfortable. All food supplied throughout the conference was top-notch, really enjoyed it. Breakfast was buffet style just off the lobby, with a good selection and nice food. The only negative I can think of was that there was no coffee to be had outside of the restaurant. Only instant coffee was supplied in the hotel room, otherwise it was a very nice stay.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_467421187~“Don't get a room near the lift”~I don't think I've stayed in a more noisy room! Unfortunately we were in the first room next to the lifts which meant we heard to-ing and fro-ing all night, as well as all of the early-risers (and their terrorising kids) going backwards and forwards from very early in morning.  There was also some water feature or watering system outside the window which made it sounds like it was pouring with torrential rain! The rest of the hotel is nice enough - we had pleasant experiences with the general services, and the hotel bar, and our room was comfortable and had everything we needed for our one-night stay.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_467071720~“Great Venue”~I was part of a Conference delegation staying there for 4 days. It was a busy time and I encountered a few minor hic-ups that were dealt with in a very courteous and professional manner. It was refreshing to see such great staff and their can do attitude. A stand out for me was Milos in the restaurant, and Mitchell on front of house never before have I received such great service. Well Done~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466421035~“Didnt get what we paid for.”~We booked approx 10 months before for a beach front room, 2 nights and paid the big bucks. What we got was the back of the property, our view was 3 great big concrete walls. We rang reception to inquire what has happened and they said it should have told you at time of booking it wasnt beachfront, but it was thats why we chose it. We were offered an up grade for an extra 100 a night, What an insult, of course we declined. My wife was very upset and we chose to leave the next morning. Getting our money back for the 2nd night was a massive hassle. also parking costs to high as well as the very over priced rooms.~3~1~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_466379276~“Wonderful staff and location ”~I booked here for my family and we had a couple of hiccups which the Novotel staff dealt with very quickly and graciously.

review_465830950~“Business trip”~A two day business trip. Manly is busy at the best of times but it has a great vibe and activity is for all ages. The hotel is dated and seriously needs a makeover. Carpets feel dirty but staff are friendly and do their best to make the stay pleasant. Food was average but edible. Would only stay there in the absence of other accomodation.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465179873~“3 Star hotel rooms , 4 star service ”~I think it's important for potential overseas visitors to understand the limitations of the hotel. The rooms are 3 star. However in Manly there is not much competition. Basically it is the location & the hotel over charges for this .  The rooms are basic , old and tired.  I must point put though that the service of the staff is excellent. So well done to the team there .  I am guessing overseas visitors who have stayed in 5 star hotels in other locations would feel ripped off by the low standard of the building & presentation of the rooms.  All in all one needs to lower their expectations. It is a 3 1/2 star hotel with lovely casual service that you pay 5 star prices.  For better value around Manly I would be looking at 5 star renovated serviced apartments instead .  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465169281~“Relaxing and peaceful holiday”~Very relaxing atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, great amenities, nice little touches such as free newspaper, free cool drinks (fruit water & Powerade) on hot days for guests.
