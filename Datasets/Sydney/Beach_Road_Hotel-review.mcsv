review_474490696~“Nice pub in a nice location.”~As I've come to expect from pubs with large bistros such as these, the serves were generous and the service was on point. Naturally, being in a built-up and popular location adds to the overall convenience. ;-)~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459510789~“The music is too loud!”~We visited Beach Rd hotel bistro on a very hot Sunday for a late lunch and a cool drink. The staff were attentive, the food good and the air conditioning and cool drinks wonderful. It was shaping up to be a lovely afternoon, but then the music started. It was impossible to talk. I did speak to a staff member, but nothing changed Why is it necessary to have music that loud?~3~nan~nan~2~nan~4~5~nan
review_451782935~“Bad Bad Bistro”~Having memories of the friendly dining atmosphere, my family and I went here for a easy bite to eat after a long working day. how we wished we went anywhere else.  The music was unbelievably loud we couldn't hear each other speak. we tired moving tables, it didn't help. The food was pretty awful too. The pizza was greasy to the point of soggy. The seafood pasta was pretty bland. burgers was fine. This place has lost its friendly, everyone welcome atmosphere and is now just another characterless bar. :(~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336507664~“Best in Bondi, but that's not saying much”~If you've ever been to the UK then you'll be familiar with a Wetherspoon's establishment. This is basically that but with better food. Big beer garden, pool tables, sport shown on the big screens, dodgy carpets and an even dodgier dance floor on weekends. However, it is something of an institution. This is partly because it does have some good aspects - it's bars are long, it serves a wide variety of half-decent food at reasonable prices, and it has the best atmosphere of anywhere in Bondi at weekends. Keep an eye on the sporting calendar if you're planning on heading here. Events such as major NRL/AFL games or UFC absolutely pack the place out. All in all it's nothing new or different, but if you find yourself in Bondi on a Fri/Sat/Sun night and are looking for some fun then it is the obvious place to go.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_336297388~“Best pub in Bondi by a mile. ”~The worst pubs in Melbourne are better than most of Sydney's pubs but this is by far our favourite so far after being here for over a week. Eaten here 3 times and can't fault. The popcorn lobster and calamari starter is magnificent. The staff are mostly friendly and the beer is cold.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335611498~“Ridiculous”~My friends and I went in for the big Wednesday party. We got in, some of the others went upstairs but my sister and I went to get a drink and stayed downstairs to chat for a bit. 10 minutes after we got in there, the bouncer came over to me and asked for ID. I showed it to him, and he then asked how much I'd had to drink that night. I said I had two drinks before coming there... He said "You seem intoxicated" and I said I wasn't and I was just standing there talking not behaving in any bad way... He said "don't be smart, it's time for you to go home" and kicked me out where another guy was watching me like I was some kind of criminal. My sister was standing on the other side of the glass door just wondering what had happened... I told the guy on the other side that they had kicked me out and humiliated me for no reason, and that I wanted my money back for the drink I just bought and had taken off me. He was also treating me like rubbish and trying to ignore me for a while then went in there without a word and came back with my money. You guys can't just kick out everyone you want for no reason, that's no way to treat a customer just cause your bouncers want to feel macho. I won't be coming back to this horrible place and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, cause your night might be ruined all of a sudden~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335391694~“This place sucks!”~Stopped in for a nightcap at a little before 10pm. Order a glass of Shiraz and the wine was bad as it had turned. The bar maid argued with me and told me it was good and since I took a sip said I had to pay for it. Then they ushered me out 20 minutes later saying they were closing. I understand wines turn some times and my request for her to open another bottle was refused. I have traveled the world for the last 35 years and this is a first. Don't wast ur money and go to Mamasan across the street. Very friendly and good quality cocktails, beer & wine. Cheers!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_332018739~“WHAT IS IN THAT SAUCE!”~The simple'ish menu undersells the amazing food! Well priced kids eats although they could do with some kids activities eg colouring.  Great service, funky and sophisticated atmosphere- felt I could go out with the kids without having to settle for a happy meal and plastic play gym.  The Beach Road sauce is AMAZING and if they sold it in bottles I'd still be sitting here eating it with a spoon. Well done and thank you to all the staff for a great meal!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_331092581~“Rude staff, no atmosphere and terrible reputation”~Huge bar with zero atmosphere. After 10mins of being in here my boyfriend got asked to leave because apparently he was 'showing signs of intoxication' (he had only had 1 drink previously so this was impossible)... Funny how they let us in 10mins prior to that and allowed him to buy a drink at the bar first? As soon as he walked away from the bar they asked him to leave and took the full drink from him. Their attitude was terrible and apparently this bar are renown for letting people in and chucking them out within minutes. If your a man and want a decent night out this is not the one.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_301681365~“Best pub in Bondi”~The Beach Road or Beachy is a great pub/bar that really ticks all the boxes and has something for everyone, from the local boys in the tab after work, to the lazy arvo beer in the garden, even a boogie upstairs on Saturday night! It really is a one stop shop!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_300490025~“Ticks all the Boxes!”~I went to the end of line party held at Beach Road after The City to Surf, This place was absolutely pumping, The staff worked fantastically with the busy conditions, and although there was plenty of people inside, I didn't feel like I was squished in. I ordered a meal and didn't wait long at all. I never had to line up too long for a drink, and the facilities were kept clean throughout the day. I was very impressed with the staffs ability to keep up with such a high demand in a busy situation and do it with a smile on their faces. I will definitely be going back to Beach Road and I recommend you to do too, if you enjoy good vibes, friendly staff and delicious food in a fantastic location.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_299726669~“Rude manager”~On a very pleasant trip to Sydney from Scotland. Found all the Aussies so friendly except here. Sought out this sports bar specifically to watch Australia netball World Cup final match on screen since it is being held in their very own city of Sydney. Asked 2 bar attendants if it was possible to screen it since they had 10 screens showing various sport. We bought drinks and sat and waited. We asked once again 30 minutes later.  Manager came over and told us that "if you get off your seats you would see it is on a screen in another part of the bar but it's not the number one sport here and we are a real bar." It was both what she said and the incredibly aggressively way she spoke to us. We thought it was a nice place. Shame about the attitude of the staff. We left immediately quite stunned by her rudeness. Found another bar where we watched it and were treated with friendly courtesy .~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_287472770~“Good nightlife”~Good nightlife on a wednesday when there are events going on with producers or singers! Recommend going here with a bunch of your friends during night time, however it is hard to find parking or transportation because it is near Bondi Beach.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_278543271~“Best place in Bondi”~the best place in Bondi to hung out on Wednesday. beers are not cheap however the mood is quite nice and really stunning. Is in the heart of the crowded Bondi Beach, best time to go is at 10 pm and you can stay til 1~5~2~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_274173513~“Great steaks”~Great steaks of all varieties. Rib eye on the bone was perfectly cooked and comes with just the right amount of salad and the smokey sauce is the perfect condiment to top it off. Good value at $28. Great with a Pacifico beer and a glass of red...............................~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_255394412~“Ha, really?”~The pub, not club; is as it is. The girls at the bar serve because it's their job, while security wait to be rid of you- will throw you inside and disregard any comment of 'I didnt know' if you step outside Whilst I admit you may hear this often; ingenuity and/or genuine excuse may be well understood in certain circumstance For someone who has never been to this oversized 'pub' I was very disappointed in the service and will not be returning  Oh so sincerely~2~2~3~nan~2~2~2~nan
review_241614345~“holy cool place on earth”~i loved wednesdays. coolest atmosphere. so nice to have some drinks and go out with your friends and meet new people. i also tried the food, and its quite good! for me the best are the parties there though, concerts, etc.~5~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_142921750~“Great Pub - accommodation, dont bother”~I love the Beach Rd Hotel as a pub, but recently a friend of mine booked a room to stay there and it was beyond a joke.  It was filthy, it smelt, and it wasn't even that cheap.  Seriously, if you are thinking of staying here, I would honestly think about crashing on the beach, or on a park bench before staying here. But go to Beach Rd Hotel for food, and a drink as it is one of the coolest places in Bondi!!!!~3~2~4~1~1~1~2~nan
review_142822271~“Great pub and food but rooms are old and very run down”~Stayed here for two nights. As soon as you walk into the rooms you realise why the hotel rates are so cheap. The carpet is dirty and torn in places. The hotel room walls were dirty, the fridge and TV and bedside light didn't work. Also part of the toilet was broken and a large chunk was missing. Lucky we didn't expect much when we booked and simply laughed off how bad the rooms were. On a good note the pub had a great atmosphere with 4 billiard tables and was very lively over the weekend. The courtyard was perfect to sink a few beers in the sunshine and the hotel restaurant food was really enjoyable with a number of choices and large servings. There is a mini-mart across the street and the hotel is also only a few minutes walk to Bondi beach. This hotel would suit those who are after a well located hotel and are not bothered by basic and poorly maintained rooms.~2~2~4~2~2~2~3~nan
review_123386015~“Very dirty and badly run, avoid room 6”~We stayed here for 3 nights recently. We were given room 6. The carpet had not been vacuumed in a long time, the walls dirty and there the bedspreads were dirty and the windows did not open. A guy from the next room walked right into ours because there is an extra door in our room. We asked to change rooms and they gave us another room, which was much better, but still poorly cleaned. The carpets in this hotel are all beer stained and no attempts made to clean them! It would be both cheap and hygienic if they ripped up those carpets and just painted the floors! I wonder if this hotel has ever been inspected because I am sure it would fail on every test there is.. This place is little more than a backpackers place masquerading as a hotel~1~2~4~1~1~1~2~nan
review_103135756~“the rooms are not so good, but great atmosphere at the pub!!”~It's a great hotel if you like to have fun and meet people and you don't care so much about the room. just 200m from famous bondi beach. There is tv and airconditioning but the building is old such as the rooms and to be honest it's not very clean. It's good if you don't want to be in a backpackers or an hostel but need a bit of privacy. The pub at ground flor is very popular and night time it's very busy with a lot of friendly people~2~3~5~2~2~2~2~nan
