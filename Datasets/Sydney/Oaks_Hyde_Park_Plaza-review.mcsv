review_479231123~“Oaks Hyde Park Plaza”~I am a FIFO to Sydney from the Gold Coast to Sydney for business for the past 13 years. I always stay at the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza because Asif and his team provide outstanding service. The team are friendly, helpful and accommodating. Since the upgrade to the hotel and rooms some three years ago, it is a no brainer to stay at the Oaks which is conveniently located to Museum railway station and a short walk to the CBD and the city attractions via Hyde Park.Very convenient for dining in the cafe society precinct at East Sydney and Darlinghurst. I always recommend the Hyde Park Plaza to my associates and friends.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477669417~“Relies on the good location. Needs upgrade.”~Great Location. Walking distance to Opera House and surrounds. On first entrance, place is great. Staff are very friendly and polite. Easy check in with a room available 2 hours before regular check in time. I was on floor 4 so can only comment for what I saw. Corridor needs some major work. big chips, dings and dents throughout all the walling and paneling. Flaking paint on the walls and ceilings. What looked like a blood smear on one wall. Different shades of white painting along entire wall where they have just touched up. Looks tacky.   Room was spacious and clean. Kitchen area was nice. Massive bed looked great until I got on it to find it was two singles pushed together. Disappointing. Ceiling under the aircon unit looks as if its peeling away. Biggest let down is the internet. you get 30 min for free every 24 hours. That is unheard of. I travel a fair bit and even some of the the cheapest hotels around the world have FREE internet. So if you want more than 30 min, you have to pay for it, and its not cheap.  So for me, paying $224 a night for their cheapest room left a lot to be desired.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476639249~“Sydney 2017”~Room was great. Love having a small kitchen to utilise as well as a small balcony with table and chairs. Comfy bed. Bathroom could do with an upgrade but still neat and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474395084~“Three Nights in the City”~Booked a three night stay to catch up with friends from the US. Booked with a little trepidation as some of the reviews were a bit patchy. However we found our studio room 613, absolutely delightful. Quiet, a view and cosy and clean. We will return when we need to stay in the city in the future. Also plenty of parking and close to Museum and St James Stations and a bottle shop. Perfect!~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_469751017~“Great location, great stay ”~Stayed 3 nights in March. The room was spacious and comfortable. Location excellent for business trip and very close to station. Staff helpful and friendly. I'd recommend Oaks for both holiday or business.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469067460~“Second visit a disappointment”~What a disappointing experience. Tired and tatty worn furniture, patched up walls, dirty windows and a seriously unsafe power fitting in the bathroom which would not pass safety standards. We won't be returning~2~1~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_469035333~“Fantastic Location”~We booked using the Entertainment Book website and got a great deal on our accommodation. Older style apartment (as advertised) could do with updating but perfectly adequate. Very central and close to the train (which runs straight from the airport and through to Circular Quay) and main bus routes. Friendly staff. Would happily stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468193427~“Good, bad and indifferent”~We stayed here for Mardi Gras weekend so the hotel was busy. The location of the hotel is great - centrally located for shopping, entertainment, Hyde Park and Oxford Street. Check in was efficient and friendly, the room, on the top floor, was reasonably spacious and had a large verandah/deck and great views. Fixtures and fittings were dated, and maintenance was lacking. The planter boxes on the deck were full of weeds, and there was a damp patch on the wall on the room which caused a fusty smell. The bathroom had everything we needed and was of a reasonable size, but again very dated. Cleaning was good, they let us leave our bags in a secure place on the last day and pick them up later. Check out was efficient and accurate, can't fault them in service but the room was dated, especially for the price we paid. Although bein Mardi Gras weekend it was busy, which would no doubt have pushed up the price. We'd come back if necessary but there are other places in the same part of town we'd more likely use in future.~3~nan~5~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_466677168~“Very good!”~Friendly and helpful staff.  Excellent location When fridge was broken in original room - they moved me to a better room straight away. Good bed and pillows.  Very clean I will be staying here again for sure~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466665154~“Do not stay herr”~We stayed in a privately owned apartment in this complex. I can confidently say it's the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. The reception stank, the rooms looked nothing like what was advertised. It was dirty and I would not wish it on my worst enemy. The pictures I have attached sum it up. The state of the room was absolutely revolting. To make matters worse we complained to inna (the lady responsible for our stay) and found her to be rude and useless!!!  She moved us to a slightly improved room but only after a lot of pushing. She refused to give us the details of her boss or the owner saying he was overseas. She even was texting her friends during our complaint and at one point stopped to answer the phone (RUDE). She refused point blank to give a refund so we could find alternative accommodation! He attitude stank worse then the room, although it was pretty comparable!  The rooftop spa, pool and gym were revolting.. I wouldn't even dip a toe in there for fear of catching a deadly disease!  The only positive was the location but this was far outweighed by the inhumane conditions within the apartment! My advice... if this is the last hotel on earth don't book it~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464424496~“Overpriced ”~The location is great but other than that way overpriced! Rooms could do with some refurbishing, shower is terrible (very little water pressure and hard to manage water temperature), there's a not so nice smell coming from the toilet constantly and to top it off we found a cockroach in our bed one of the nights. Won't be coming back here.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462663722~“Excellent stay”~We always stay in this accommodation when in Sydney and it just gets better each stay. However, I did note a rather unpleasent smell in reception as another guest has mentioned and there is considerable difference in quality between rooms. We always stay in a refurbished studio overlooking Hyde Park and thoroughly enjoy our stay. However, these rooms do experience quite a lot of road noise. But on the good side our bed and pillow were just so comfortable that we slept like the preverbial logs. We are presently staying in a hotel in Singapore at $800 a night and the sleep quality is not up to the Hyde Park Plaza !,~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462200920~“Good location”~Thai owned apartments. Old but good apartment. location is good.is only a 2 min walk to william st. 5mins to kings cross an 3mins to pitt street. staff were helpful, they do have a tourist office but unfortunately they only deal with Thai tourists. That was not good. So we had to go down to book.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_461973417~“Holiday in Sydney”~Nice apartment, clean, good beds, the livingroom and kitchen was big.  We cooked a couple of times and could have used a few more pots and pans. Nice to have the diswasher and good that the hotel supplied the taps. The cleaning ladies did not do our apartment everyday and after one Week I think they should have hoovered the floors at least once.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461282203~“Helpful staff mediocre facilities”~There is a permanent shocking smell of sewage/garbage in the entrance lobby which they seem unable to fix. this is very off-putting and wafts up through the lift well to the lower floors. Rooms spacious and clean but very out of date. We were upgraded to an "executive suite" but the upgrade was minimal, the noise from Oxford street very noticeable, especially at night and the small balcony unusable because of this. The room key and lift fob were clumsy and unreliable. The location was good. We would call it 3 star.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460827222~“Not what we were expecting”~Staff were friendly but facilities were terrible and not worth the money. We were told the room was refurbished but it wasn't and was dirty when we got there. There were bad smells in the lobby and hallways, lifts didn't work and there was a burning smell coming from them. People's apartments air con wasn't working when there was a heatwave. For the $455 we paid for two nights we expected a lot more.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458790632~“Filthy with no air conditioning”~Checked in last night to a room without working ac. Turns out staff well aware of problem. Reported at 0900, still awaiting room change now almost 1300. Sydney also in the middle of a heat wave.  Room - walls dirty, carpet pulled and dirty. Silverfish in bathroom, mould on top of mould also in bathroom. Dirtiest Australian hotel I have ever stayed in. Lifts, one not working the other slow. Encouraged to use service lift which has ripped blue blankets dropped from ceiling with the words 'danger mirror underneath' floors disgusting. Oh, and don't telephone reception as they will never answer. You physically have to go down for attention and maybe they will get back to you...... I am still waiting!~1~nan~nan~3~nan~1~1~nan
review_458017476~“Run down ”~Rooms big but the place is generally run down and obviously maintained at the cheapest possible cost. Thst means a lot of small frustrations 1. TV controller flat batteries 2. TV itself barely working and VERY frustrating slow response with many channels just plain not working 3. Searched the room 3 times for a laundry bag and slip and gave up, couldn’t find it. That’s the whole experience - the place is just hanging together.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456616893~“AVOID AT ALL COSTS”~The pictures are totally misleading. The room has been upgraded with new furniture but thats about it. The whole building is old and infested with cockroaches. All units only have 1 bathroom so our two bedroom unit only had 1 bathroom - this was not advertised and I would not have booked had I known beforehand. The elevators and lobby smell terrible and avoid the rooftop pool. Theres a giant hole in the area that has been closed off next to what was the hot tub. Thats the state of the condition of this hotel, you can fall down to the next level at any time. Oh and forget about sleeping, the large constant beeping sound will keep you up all night.~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
review_456040715~“Iconic location & excellent place to stay. So much to see & do right on your doorstep”~The Oaks Hyde Park Plaza was fantastic. I had stayed there many years ago and I remember the Hyde Park Plaza being run down, loud and unimpressive. This visit was very different. There has clearly been a massive make over!  On this stay, we found our room to be fresh and well appointed with a most scenic outlook over Hyde Park and the city south. With a spacious kitchen, open plan lounge/dining area and large bedroom, we could have happily spent more time relaxing in our room but there is so much to see & do in Sydney and it was right on our doorstep at Oaks Hyde Park. From our balcony we sat and watched the action of the city at night...fabulous. We really appreciated the art works in the room  (historic pictures of Hyde Park and the city) which we could compare with today’s actual streets-cape from our balcony...this is a great and relevant addition to the furnishing of the room which looks over such an iconic location. The room was impeccably clean too. I noticed little street and traffic noise in our room and noted that the bedroom windows were double glazed.  The foyer was spacious and impressive, the corridors clean and well kept and the rooftop pool and gym area are great. I see that the spa is being renovated so, at present, it is not available for use. There is a fantastic view of the city from the rooftop pool.  All the staff were attentive and friendly. Our room was not available for our early check in but the staff offered for our luggage to be securely stored. The check in/ checkout staff were exceptionally helpful. We will certainly stay at Oaks Hyde Park Plaza again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455072045~“Brilliant place to stay”~Where to start, the location was very central, rooms were a very good size. Everything was clean and tidy. The rooms were services everyday. The pool was nice on the rooftop. There was a lack of loungers on the roof but not a big deal. Would highly recommend~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454148436~“Central to everything a great place to sleep.”~Booked this hotel for an overnight trip to watch the cricket. The hotel foyer is updated and modern. The room was nice and clean with a kitchenette and ensuite.  Almost e everything is within waking distance. We walked to the SCG within 30 minutes. Darling harbour is 20 minutes walk and the Star casino is 35 minutes.  There is limited parking onsite and the parking garage is tiny. I would be worried if you had to park a large car such as a toyota prado due to the tight turns and carpark construction.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453543160~“Nice big room, great location”~My first stay at this property and exceeded my expectations. Good staff, well maintained room, nice bathroom. Parking on site - bit expensive but very convenient. Easy walk to city and harbour. Close to buses and train.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453512519~“Consistently great”~We booked at the last minute because our air bnb accommodation was terrible. The oaks were helpful and very accommodating. Would stay here any time. Excellent location, and great service at a really good price.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453233071~“Top location - Great Value”~My Husband and I stayed for 4 nights when we visited Sydney for the Test match. Hotel was very comfortable, room was fully equipment with Kitchen and laundry! Excellent value for money. Clean and tidy - slightly dated but perfect for our needs. Great location walking distance to SCG and Circular Quay. Lovely rooftop pool. Will definitely stay again!~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_453222737~“Excellent access to everything - but rooms need some TLC”~Superb location. Access to subway train station is located approx. 2 minutes from apartment in Hyde Park. From there it is a 5 minute ride to Circular Quay, ferries, Opera House, bridge, etc. Train service was reliable, clean and safe. Easy walk into the CBD. Australian Museum just 2 minutes away; two supermarkets around the corner on Oxford Street.  Rooftop pool has brilliant views over park. Sauna was excellent, gym equipment is Lifefitness brand and in very good condition/working order. Bathroom had a 5ft bath which you stand in when showering but water pressure was good. QS beds were comfortable but 60kg teenage son complained about hard SB mattress. Air cond worked effectively. The main negative was traffic noise, even on the 11th floor. The decor is definitely dated. Kitchen & bathroom cupboards were water-damaged particle board so well past use by date. Door access cards don't like being close to mobiles, so needed to get them reset constantly. Staff were always coutreous & helpful.~3~nan~5~1~nan~nan~4~nan
review_452933082~“Great location”~I stayed here with friends for a birthday weekend. Staff were great, apartment was spacious (there were 7 of us).

Will definitely consider again for a short stay in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452438457~“1 is for the staff andn 1 for the beds but the accommodation no way”~Where do I start, I was going to write 2 reviews seeing we stayed in 2 rooms after checking in after our friends only to find a repair man in the room. Why? The air conditioner in our room was dripping on the floor creating a lovely mess. It appears he fixed it, proceeding to put dirt all over our bed sheets, carpet and the walls and ceiling. We then looked in the bathroom. OMG mould behind the dryer. The shower ceiling was peeling along with the ill repaired cornice. Yes it needs updating but regular maintenance helps these issues. Could only get the calcified overhead shower to work but the hand held shot out water at the same time.Then there was the forever running toilet of which the repair man or was he an electrician could not fix and said he could call the plumber but being Friday probably no luck, seeing we only just caught him as he was leaving.  So the front desk knew about the issues but still checked us in without warning.  Then there was the street noise as our 2 bedroom apartment was on the corner of Oxford Street and College Street. All night and the windows did not help along with the person staying in the room next to our friends bedroom of which they awoke in the middle of the night to what they thought was their TV blaring, someone stiring a cup of something and talking.My friend rang reception and heard the neighbours phone ring and then the TV noise reduced, but talking and stiring still very loud. So the next day they moved us to another room as there was nothing available until 10. We moved, at first the contrast was amazing, until we returned from our day of discovering Sydney. There was this noise outside our bedroom which was located near the bathroom. Every 20 to 30 seconds it would buzz on and off.So we slept without the airconditioner as it seemed to be linked. But was awoken early in the morning to the noise as we discovered the airconditioner was on a timer.  The floor of the apartment we were changed into was vinyl planks compared with the previous dirty carpet. But the cleaners needed to removed the crumbs etc from under the lounge, dining room table etc so we just kept our shoes on.  We thought this apartment was quieter being at the back of the building but when a very late time or early morning time the parties, screaming etc was very loud, Again windows did not close properly and they were all single glass? This was a renovated apartment we thought compared with the previous. But one of the worst things was the smell in the foyer of which the hotel and previous reviewers know of and they are working on it but I would never had checked in had I been the one who booked and was the first to check in. Should not be allowed. Should be stated on their website. As should the real photo's of the room you are booking. So we had 609 and then 1001, because they were 2 bedroom but never again. Staff I feel for you and thank you for trying to understand, great location but that is all. Last time we stayed in an Oaks we swore never again but this time our friends booked it and it was a timely reminder to never book Oaks again.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_450886511~“Easy walk”~Stayed over the New Year period, hotel was busy, staff were great, room on level 4 was clean & tidy. We had a view overlooking Liverpool st which is a busy corner so yes there was a bit of noise but it is the CBD. Easy walk to everything we needed Train, Shops, Supermarket, Coffee, beautiful park just across the road, so overall a good place to stay, Yes we would stay there again.

review_446117793~“Great location on Hyde Park”~Stayed here for a quick weekend visit to Sydney. The location was perfect for public transport and it was a quick walk into Darlinghurst/Paddington and Pitt st Mall.  The hotel is pretty basic but the room we had was large (1 bedroom apt) and clean. The amenities are fairly limited. Our view over the park was stunning.  The staff at reception were really friendly and helpful. Agree with a few other posters on TA regarding the overpowering 'toilet fragrance' smell in the lobby.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_444909695~“Strange smell”~Our room smelt oddly fishy and the smell at reception was overpoweringly bad! We asked to move but not possible as full. Cheap aftershave smell masking something far worse. Windows didn't latch so kept blowing open. Beds comfortable and clean and superb location on Hyde Park. Noisy at night, partially due to non- latchable windows. Bathroom small but kitchen lovely.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_442947839~“Great stay!”~This hotel looks beautiful inside and out, and is in a superb location! It was great to walk right outside into the park. Also the train station is super close. We booked an older style room that has not been renovated (unlike the rest of the hotel) due to the lower price. It definitely didn't look glam like the amazing lobby however it was neat and tidy and had everything we needed! Staff were lovely and helpful and we will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442943597~“not the greatest experience”~I stayed here last month and let me start by saying. The smell in the reception area was disgusting!. Smelled like flooded toilet that was covered with terrible air freshener. I stayed on the 12th floor and that floor had smell of someone smoking with added scent of toilets(trust me not exaggerating). It was just me and my fiancé and they had given us a room with two rooms which was nice. Here comes the best part, the beds were horrible, almost like mattress was poking into my body very uncomfortable. Also, I came from the USA so I needed some wifi while I was inside the room and only 30 minutes of Wifi was free and after that they charge you. I have been in different countries around the world and I even stayed at hotels in Melbourne. Both cities were beautiful but this hotel was definitely below average.~2~2~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_442713784~“Nice comfortable hotel rooms”~We had two rooms as we went with friends. Both rooms were very nice 4star. Beds comfortable but in one room the carpet needed replacement.  Very clean and serviced daily. Lovely roof top pool. Would highly recommend but suggest when booking, you request a room that is fully renovated if you are fussy.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_440269603~“One night in the 3 star room”~We we stayed in a twin room on the 15th level looking towards Hyde Park. Great view of the city and park. But that is about it. Whilst we knew we were in the 3 star room, for what we paid, it could have been better. The curtains didn't match and were too short, a portion above one single bed looked like it would collapse and he air con was noisy. For this room and the ones near it, you had your own little balance, which was great, but we weren't too keen to walk out there as it had some wood falling apart on the deck area. We didn't use the kitchen part, so can't comment. Also didn't try the pool area. The room was clean and it was quiet. Just a shame about the curtains and the part above the single bed. Location wise it was a easy walk through the park to get into the city area.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
