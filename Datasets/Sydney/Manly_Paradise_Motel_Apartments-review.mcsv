review_471792849~“Work”~I stayed in the motel section for 5 nights, the bed was uncomfortable and squeaked everytime i moved the pillows were soft and poor quality. The room was not fulley serviced each day only towels replaced. Milk was not replaced. Very overpriced.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471764600~“Stella sutton”~Place nice and clean and very well located. Would not recomend if you have a vehicle above 2. 1. You can't fit in carpark and even though they give you a pass to park elsewhere in the streets the parking is premium in the area so you drive around forever waiting to jump into a site where you are allowed park. Puts a damper on the experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469771004~“Fantastic view and great location”~We rented 3 bed room apartment. The view of the beach from balcony was spectacular however the furnishings in the apartment were a little tired. The oven door was loose and did not seal properly. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The apartments also have free parking a real bonus~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~5~nan
review_461472760~“Delightful stay”~We stayed in an apartment at the Manly Paradise Motel/Apartments. There were 4 adults: the apartment was spaciously laid out on 3 levels (laundry on one level, kitchen/dining/living on another, and 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms on a third). There was no sound at all from neighboring apartments, view was outstanding (we could watch surfers on the beach), location is amazing (literally across the street from the beach), apartment was well-furnished and comfortable - we will definitely be back and highly recommend it!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460553761~“Delightful cant wait to return. ”~We stayed at this Motel to celebrate my mums 81st Birthday. It was absolutely lovely. The staff were exceptional in every way very friendly and very helpful. The room was compact, comfortable, modern, very clean and well equipted. The sea view was great. It was hard to leave we enjoyed our stay so much!  We really enjoyed the close proximity to the shops, eating places and the beach.  The pool area was good but wasbnot suited to disabled access.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460191149~“COMFORTABLE BUT OVER-PRICED”~I found the Paradise Motel and Apartments in Manly, Sydney to be over-priced in respect of the room (apartment) comfort, motel-amenities and general level of service offered. The split level two-bedroomed apartment which I rented had an excellent and inspirational sea-view and the kitchen was large and well-appointed (also with a sea-view). The balcony (deck) is just large enough to seat four guests at a squeeze but offers a wonderful position for morning coffee and breakfast. The single television-set in the lounge/dining room area is not brand-new but did offer the entire Foxtel bouquet range which is quite pleasant.  What disappointed me is that: the rooms/apartments are not serviced (as suggested by Booking.com and the motel’s website (only towels are changed and kitchen refuse is removed six days a week only), the bedrooms are very, very basic (to the extent that the bedroom lamps are typical of the 1970s) and the bathrooms are incredibly small and uncomfortable, offering only basic (two-star level) toiletries. The carpets in my apartment had recently been cleaned prior to my arrival and were still damp when I checked in. I left the windows open when in residence in order to help dry them but the damp-odour was somewhat annoying at night. There were no cupboards in the second bedroom and guests are expected to place their clothes on a narrow metal shelf-unit. I am sure that this would be annoying to an adult couple using the second bedroom. What I also found below par was the reception staff who are quite officious and unfriendly: I accept that Manly is one of the most sought-after holiday destinations/locations in the world and that the Manly Paradise Motel and Apartments is probably constantly fully-booked but I found the reception staff to be uncaring and blunt as if my being a guest was an annoyance.  Unfortunately, the restaurant on the mezzanine-level (just below the apartments) played very loud music until 3am the following morning on the Saturday night of my stay and, when I raised this with reception the next morning, I received a very uncaring and nonchalant response from reception, as if I was annoying the hotel by raising the matter at all. I would not have minded if the music had stopped at midnight. The lift to the apartments resembles a 1960s appurtenance (jerking as it starts and stops) and there are no restaurant facilities throughout the motel and the apartments (some of which appear to be privately-owned). Basement parking is, however, available. There are a number of rules (about, for example, the times for use of the pool) and I did obtain the impression that I was staying at a 1970s home for the aged. As I say, I found the entire apartment (and building) to be too basic for the price charged but what would have made a positive difference is if the reception staff had been caring, people-orientated, responsive and helpful during my four interactions with them: I may have actually felt welcome.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~2~nan
review_459915873~“Excellent”~We have been here twice now and find it to be well located and CLEAN, with all the facilities we need. It's across the road from the beach, and a 5-10 minute walk to the ferry complex. Lots of restaurants nearby as well as shopping and a supermarket on the way to/from the ferry. Will never drive to Sydney again...train from (downstairs) at the airport to Circular quay, then a ferry ride across to Manly. So easy. Back and forth across the harbour to do whatever you want in Sydney. Truly recommend this motel/apartment complex. Some rooms are a little snug,others larger, but we don't go to Manly to stay in a room!  The Baileys~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459327282~“Nice place on the beach”~Stayed in the apartments and the views from the balcony were outstanding. Close proximity to the beach was great and near the ferry and Corso with the shops, restaurants and people watching. The rooms were good sized but the place was tired. Older carpet, furniture and functional but dated, well used and small kitchen.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459013695~“Perfect spot”~Booked at short notine having been let down by another hotel. very clean, bright room overlooking Manly beach. Perfect location right in the centre of town. Free, safe, undercover parking. AC very welcome in middle of a NSW heatwave. Could only stay one night becaue they were full but would have stayed longer. Very helpful and attentive staff.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_457729705~“great location and spacious but pricy”~We were visiting Manly for a few days, and we splurged on a pricy beachfront property. The view of the beach is wonderful from the living room of our two bedroom apartment. It's more than we really need, but now that the weather has turned rainy it's nice to have some space. Everything seems expensive here in Manly, so I guess the $395/night Australian is to be expected. Still, even with the exchange rate that is $301/night US. Oh well. The place would be perfect for a family with kids~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_457504630~“Small, perfectly functional room with spectacular view”~What a great surprise. We knew we had booked a small room, but it was 100% functional and comfortable. My partner was studying in the afternoon and had a good desk with comfortable chair and free, fast wifi. To top that off the desk looked out a huge window down Manly beach towards Queenscliff. The staff were helpful, as I had a conference call in the morning at 10- check out time- they were OK with me staying until 10:30. The pool and deck on the roof looked like a great spot. Very good value for money, and don't be put off that the room might be small~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452066824~“LOCATION LOCATION”~We stayed in the motel section the staff were friendly and welcoming, our room was small but nicely appointed, clean, no balcony but very nice pool & deck area, however, the best thing was the location, straight across the road from the beach, and very short walk to the Corso and endless selection of restaurants, would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_442334739~“It was ok - 2 bed apartment”~The first 2 bed apt. we were given definitely needed refurbishing, it had an old kitchen, the carpets were fairly clean but uneven in colour and the bathrooms also were old. I asked for a change of room immediately and reception did offer me an alternative apartment which I was grateful for. We moved to 407 which was much improved but to be honest did not blow me away.  Good points; Wonderful ocean view and balcony  Great size open plan lounge and living space Well equipped clean kitchen Duplex layout with bedrooms and 2 bathrooms downstairs on same floor Good laundry facility with washer and dryer Parking spot in secure garage  A lot of sq feet.  Bad points; Didn't reflect the photo on the Manly Paradise website Wasn't spotless - felt it could have been cleaner throughout and some of the grouting was dirty in the bathrooms  Carpeted throughout - again didn't feel or look clean (in the corners, behind the bed etc) Generally the apartment despite a "refurb" felt dated Swimming pool was absolutely freezing and a waste of time We booked online through booking.com....Best advice, if you are looking to book, call ahead and speak with reception at the apartments and let them know your requirements / expectations so you're not disappointed~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442183517~“Very good location”~Had a one night stay in a 2 bed apartment with terrific views of the beach. Apartment was well appointed with comfortable beds and much needed AC in the rooms. Very well equiped and a great location across from the beach and very central for all Manly has to offer. The only drawback is that the wifi signal is not the best in the bedrooms as they are at the back of the property, other than that it was a perfect place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440197004~“close to surf beach”~Stayed in the motel section of this property side view to the beach, found the room very small and the bathroom tiny. So close to the night life that found the noise very over the top we had trouble sleeping on the Friday night. The room was well appointed and very clean.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~5~4~nan
review_437134228~“Right opposite the beach”~Stayed in a two bed apartment for a week or so. Had a great view over the beach and ate our meals on a large terrace from where we could see all the surfers enjoying the waves. The apartment was clean and sitting/dining areas very spacious. Bedrooms and ensuite very cramped. Quite a lot of noise in the morning from lorries, workmen etc at the back of the building. Apartments looking a little tired and could do with some updating. A little on the expensive side but location is priceless!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432758724~“On the Beach - sort of!”~Paradise is an odd shaped hotel fitting on the corner of North Steyne and Raglan Street. The rooms are small but well appointed and reasonably well equipped. Interesting pool and sun terrace overlooking the beach.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430180687~“Lovely accomodation, clean close to shops, restaurants, transport (ferry) and across the road from the beach.”~My queen bed room was lovely and clean, smelt nice and had lots of lovely towels. Tea & coffee & long life milk was ample and a good sized bar fridge. Sink and dishwashing detergent provided if you wanted to bring food back to eat in the room. There was cutlery & crockery for two people. Microwave oven. Iron & ironing board, hairdryer, air conditioning, ceiling fan & opening windows. It was a pleasure staying here and the staff couldn't be more helpful. Coles supermarket is just down the road and lots of lovely shops to browse in when you want to. The walk along the boardwalk was spectacular, went for a couple of kilometers and I actually saw a whale and its baby frolicking in the bay! Totally fabulous accommodation! They have 2 bedroom apartments as well facing the ocean. Next time a family holiday! On the roof there's a lovely pool, umbrella and lots of outdoor furniture with a fabulous view of the area.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_425237945~“School holiday getaway”~This was my third visit to Manly Paradise Motel and Apartments. The last two stays we rented one of the beach front apartments. The first time we had a split level 3 bedroom apartment, which had great views and was nice enough for me to book again. This time we booked a two bedroom apartment, and it was phenomenal. We had room 410 which is a huge apartment with an outrageously long verandah with direct beach views. Every single room in the apartment looked out over the verandah onto the beach. The rooms were furnished really nicely, and although the kitchen and bathrooms are probably original, they are clean and tidy and well maintained.  The location of this property is just perfect, and the room we had (which I was told was the best in the property) was just fantastic.  Highly recommend for a family break.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_423609785~“Great place to settle in! Beachfront!”~We love this place and stay here when in town. The two bedroom apartments are great for our family. We can cook meals and do the laundry. We feel like we are a part of the community when we are settled in. You cannot deny the beauty of beachfront apartment on Manly Beach! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422698738~“Too Small”~This place is in a great location, and some rooms have a great view. But it's far too small. The motel rooms are small, the bathrooms tiny, and vehicle parking terrible to negotiate. Prices are cheaper than the nearby Novotel but not by enough to be worth it. We won't go back there.~2~nan~nan~3~2~nan~3~nan
review_422662689~“compact but good”~This is a small hotel. Its rooms are small but furnished with light colored furniture and mirrors that makes them look larger. I had to get used to the smallness/compactness of everything but once I was used to it , I enjoyed it. It is simple but had what I needed. The bathroom is very small and the floor gets wet when you take a shower. Many places to hang towels!! The kitchen was adequate (fridge, microwave, sink; drawers). Due to its location (near restaurants and beach), the surroundings can be noisy at night but for me that was partially compensated by the constant sound of the surf!!. Its location is ideal (across from the beach; shops/ferry are easily within walking distance) and the staff is the best I've ever experienced: very very helpful and knowledgeable. Housekeeping was good/clean. I walked from the ferry with my suitcases (7 minutes). I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_419936248~“Comfort with unbeatable view!”~Our room was bright and comfortable and everything was spotless. Reception was very welcoming and friendly. The fridge was a good size. We were attending a concert, so it was great having an iron and small ironing board to touch up our clothes.The location is just breathtaking - I loved looking out the window at the ocean - a great view of sunrise - and the side wall mirror reflected the great view too. You can hear the soothing ocean waves, and there are so many beautiful walks around the area. I also loved being able to come and go through the side door without having to leave the key etc. Just a relaxing and beautiful place to stay - and well named in this paradise location.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_405387051~“Good Location”~This is in a great location right opposite the beach in Manly, and walking distance to everything, including the ferry to Sydney. We stayed in the motel side with a queen and a single. It was clean, tidy and adequate for our stay. It had a sideways view of the beach. Friday/Saturday nights can be noisy with party goers outside. The bathroom is tiny with a small basin plus toilet and shower on top of each other. The staff here are very friendly. It has a pool located in the 4th floor with some nice views of Manly Beach. Parking is available at $18/night underneath. Rooms come with a fridge, kettle and microwave. Reasonable choice in Manly for the price.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401006045~“Fantastic location. Quality rooms”~Hi. If you're looking a good location for short term stay for fun and surfing, here is the place!

Efficient rooms.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397052014~“Central and Convenient”~We had booked an apartment for 5 and was pleasantly surprised at the apartment. It was spacious, clean, and very well appoined. We woke to the sun rising over Manly beach which was spectacular. The accommodation was fabulous.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_396490392~“Motel section fine for short stays.”~Very handy position across from the beach. We were in the motel section on the side street. We had a small partial view of the beach but no balcony. The room was nice enough and clean, although on the small side. There was not enough hanging or storage space for the 15 night stay we had. The shower head was enormous, far too big for a small shower with a plastic curtain. The hand towel was hanging over the toilet roll. The wash basin looked like it came out of a doll's house, so tiny and water splashed everywhere. The ironing board came from the same doll's house I think. See photos. The reception and cleaning staff were friendly. There is a night club across the road, on the corner of the side road and main road, opposite our room. It was very noisy at closing time when all the revellers were leaving, particularly at the weekends. People were screaming & fighting outside. I think this motel would be OK for a short stay but not for the 15 nights we had. Apartment section would be better.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_389520054~“Great location! ”~Right in middle of South Steyne opposite Manly beach . We stayed on 1st floor Motel rooms. Bedrooms are large with a Queen & single bed in the room. Rooms have been refurbished and are nicely furnished and include desk & lamp. Rooms are very clean A bit of noise late at night from Manly revellers  Criticism is the smallest bathroom ever .. Single tiny sink , shower and toilet together separated by shower curtain and only room for one person Our friends stayed on 3rd floor and apparently bathrooms are much bigger Other friends stayed in the Apartments next door , managed by Manly Paradise and the two bedroom apartment was amazing , so if we were to stay again we would book the two or three bedroom apartments which are fabulous !  Good placed motel if you are wanting something comfortable but fairly basic and right in the middle of Manly. Surrounded by great restaurants and beautiful beaches !~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381760004~“Excellent choice!”~Four of us stayed in a 2 BR apartment (no. 623) and it was perfect! Beachside location with a fabulous view over the waves, en suite bathroom for each bedroom, crisp white sheets, everything clean, nice kitchen, separate laundry, big living area and roomy balcony with table and chairs for a sunny breakfast. Quiet at night. A late check-out was readily agreed to. That's where we'll stay next time we go to Manly!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_378606991~“Excellent place ”~Stayed here for two nights, only phoned through on the day and the service was fantastic from all the staff, they arranged my room and car park within minutes and then when I needed a late check in, they were very prompt in responding to my request. The room was very clean and tidy and everything looked pretty new. Only thing I didn't like was that the shower and toilet is next to each other which was tough to not get everything wet (it was the budget room) although that room is right on ground floor which made coming in and out a breeze. The information folder prepared by the hotel is exceptional, it provided every detail we needed in a clean and clear way. Definitely recommended~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376912813~“Great accommodation at a reasonable price”~Booked a room over the phone with a very helpful lady. Check in again very friendly gentleman. Rooms all nicely refurbished.

review_375713641~“leave the car and wander”~Reasonable size room with queen bed. Views to the ocean and beach as well as the street. Some noisy moments from revellers in the early hours, but not too bothersome. The queen mattress was visibly sagging without anyone on it, extremely soft. It was the only major disappointment. The shower and toilet area were a little cramped, with fittings (towel rack and toilet paper holder) poorly placed. Ensure any food is in fridge...even fruit, as we had a problem with small brown ants around the supplied sugar and teabag container and other bench tops. The management immediately took steps to remedy this when notified. The reception personnel were great and very helpful with any queries we had, including restaurant locations etc. We paid cash in advance for our 4 night stay, so I was somewhat surprised to be asked for a credit card printout as "security". A sign of the times perhaps? We left the room in a clean and tidy condition. Other than the aforementioned, we enjoyed our visit, and could not fault the location, or the reception personnel.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan

review_373907852~“work just became a holiday”~I moved to the Paradise Motel because i was always on the beach. This friendly smaller motel has a very personalised service. The rooms are beautiful , the bed comfortable and front desk always there to help. I stayed for a month as i was in Sydney for work. The daily 45 min commute was very well worth it.  But you are in Manly , view of the ocean so also the busy times like the weekends. Noisy when the garbage trucks pass at odd hours , but windows closed, fan on and all is okidoki! I would go back in a wimp. Oh and the rooftop pool is just perfect to end the day!~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_367779856~“Gr8 location”~The male receptionist was very professional, friendly and welcoming. Whilst the weather was very poor for our first visit to Manly, the room was cosy n warm.  For us, unfortunately the bed was rather uncomfortable and after sleeping in it for two nights straight, a trip the the chiropractor was in order on our return home. The bathroom was very tiny and the shower head way too big for the space.  For a beach view room, we were disappointed to find our room being at the rear of the building with a side view of the beach. If your precious about your car, beware in the very steep driveway into the undercover car parking in which scraped the bottom of my car. Maybe opt for alternate car parking options.  All in all it was a pleasant experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358586179~“Perfect location”~Ideally situated on the beach in the heart of the action. Our apartment had a massive balcony overlooking the beach which was perfect entertaining before going out. The apartment was a good size overall and has everything you need.

review_351199979~“Hotel close to beach but leaves a lot to be desired”~The rooms are nothing like the imagery in the photographs. You can barely swing a cat in the place and ocean views are out of a dingy side window. Pics lead you to believe that your room faces on the ocean, but the hotel is a narrow strip attached along the side of what looks to be residential Accom that beautifully cascades down to the beach. The rooms are on the corner of two busy streets and sleeping is a challenge. The bathroom only just qualifies as a bathroom with what has to be the world's smallest wash basin. You can't wash your face without living a river below the sink.  The saving grace is that the staff are very accomodating and focussed on pleasing the guests. Can't fault the service I received from them during my visit.  But as for the rooms, they leave a lot to be desired.~2~2~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_350326845~“Would highly recommend!”~My fiance and I stayed in a small, but lovely room with a beautiful view of the beach. The motel is in a great location next to many restaurants, shops, and of course, the beach. We had a/c, heat, a small fridge plus dishes and coffee/tea. The staff was super friendly and accommodating, allowing us to put our luggage in storage while they got the room ready and we went surfing! In addition, there is a rooftop pool! Overall, the motel was a great price, very convenient, clean, and cozy; I would highly recommend it and would absolutely stay again!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_346931190~“Great location”~Stayed for 10 days, on work trip to Sydney. Excellent location right on beach and near all shops and bars. Spacious, clean with everything you could need. Perfect position to explore Manly. 5 minute walk to ferry to get to Sydney harbour. Best two restaurants visited, Hugo's near the ferry and the pantry on the beach. The boathouse is amazing for breakfast on Shelly beach. Take a walk over the hill at Queens cliff to Freshwater beach. More chilled than Manly. Daniel San best bar for music. All in all 100% recommend.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_345975314~“Stunning location with view of the water.”~The apartment was located within easy walking distance of Manly Corso and shops nearby. The beach was across the road and we had great view from our apartment on the second floor. Room was very small for 2 people. Had tea/coffee making equipment and small sink. Bathroom also small - never seen a vanity basin so small before. I guess thats what you get with accomodation in a prime spot. The room was spotlessly clean. No safe to keep valuables in. WIFI in room was great.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_345722159~“CONVENIENT PARADISE”~It was by chance that I found this place. I booked 3 apartments for a book club gathering. Each time I made contact, nothing was a problem. Upon arrival we were lucky enough to be able to park our cars before we had access to our apartments. Reception was very accommodating. Our rooms were clean & tidy & we were all placed in apartments on the same level. All of us were very happy - prices are very reasonable. The locality is perfect - right across the road from the Beach and the main Entertainment area in Manly - The Corso where the majority of shops, pubs and convenient stores are. Manly is a great place to visit! We will definitely be back to this place~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_345335320~“Fair”~Stayed here 5 nights as we always do when in Manly. Must say I'm a little disappointed with this apartment ( 412 ). Showers heads in both bathrooms were in very poor working condition. The kitchen is in desperate need of renovation. Very old oven and a couple of drawers were broken. The location is fantastic and air con worked very well thank god since we had very hot conditions. Over priced for what you get but I guess it's the location your paying for, directly across from the beach and only about 100 meters from the main shopping and the multitude of restaurants and coffee spots. We always stay at this location and we will again but hopefully in a more updated apartment.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343459976~“Great Little Place”~I have tried various options for accommodation in and around Manly over the years and have found them very poor or over priced.

Very close to everything you need and friendly helpful service from the front desk.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_335807348~“Lovely holiday”~Location is second to none. Staff were very pleasant upon check in. Air conditioning in our room wasn't working but we were offered a discount on the room when it wasn't able to be fixed immediately, which we were well satisfied with. In any case, the ceiling fan and open windows provided ample relief from the heat. The room was well presented and clean, only negative observations being the squeaking of the bead and the variability of the shower temperature. All in all, a very pleasant stay~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
