review_473681905~“Great location. Friendly service”~This hotel is centrally located. Don't bring a car, leave it at home or at a train station, because you won't need it here. Even wheelchair users have transport options including trains, buses, taxis, uber & the new tram (in 2018?). There is lots to see and do nearby, so you won't be in your room much.  The rooms are small, but I've stayed in way smaller. The room looks like it was recently renovated, with a lovely bathroom. The bed is comfy and all the amenities are here.  The lift reminds me of those in Paris hotels, which I found a lot of fun.  It is slightly noisy at night (just regular cbd sounds), so if you are sensitive bring ear plugs (I didn't need them & slept soundly).  The receptionist is super lovely and helpful, which made us feel really welcome.  I will definitely come back to stay here whenever I have to be in the CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472650511~“Great location, good basic accommodation”~Right in the heart of the city within walking distance of all the sights, this hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Sydney. Accommodation is basic but clean, with air conditioning, fridge and TV all working fine, but couldn't get the wifi to work on my phone or laptop (MacDonald's over the road provided a solution). The room would benefit from net curtains to give some privacy from the office block opposite without having to close the (single) curtain provided. Friendly and helpful staff, enjoyed the stay and would recommend for the budget traveller who wants to be in the very centre.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456550990~“Pre-Cruise stay”~Loved the hotel room we had very clean & tidy. Only problem was the single bed was a bit springy & squeaky. They even gave us free bottled water but only 2 bottle when there was 3 of us so another bottle would have been handy. The lift is one of those old lifts with the metal door & wooden door but it got us up & down & we thought it was quite quaint. Very close to Town Hall station so was very handy seeing as we had all our cruise luggage. Was able to grab a taxi just outside of hotel in about 5 minutes to White Bay Cruise Terminal only cost $22.50 for the 3 of us. Best part of our stay was Travis the receptionist. he was so helpful, friendly & has a great sense of humour Anyone going a cruise, this is just the place to stay as it only cost us $131.00 for 3 of us.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453518099~“A perfect location”~The Coronation provides a perfect location for regional visitors to see all the city. Access to the city's public transport is just outside the door or you can walk to anywhere worth seeing from there. The rooms are clean and well kept. The staff are very friendly and most helpful. We would stay there again, no problem.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451570488~“Room is tiny and outdated; elevator was really annoying to use”~I stayed here for the week of New Year's so it was marked up by a lot but even on a regular week I wouldn't pay more than $100 AUD a night for this place. The only redeeming quality was the location which was a 15 min walk to the harbor. The rooms are much more like a motel from the 1970's. Outdated furniture and carpet. Very tiny rooms with old linens. It's right next door to a bar and liquor store. The elevator was the absolute worst though...it's one of those old style ones with a gate and door that needs to be shut manually before it'll move up. I dreaded using it every day and with suitcases or if you're holding anything it's even worse to maneuver.  I'd say here one night at the most but only for the location and proximity to Woolworth's down the street if you want to use the minifridge in the room for storing your own food.~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_451325598~“Inexpensive accommodation in a great location in the City Centre”~Stayed in the is hotel for six nights in early January 2017 as a tourist. My second visit. Rates were very reasonable, location is terrific but accommodation is fairly basic. It is essentially an old style hotel with rooms to let upstairs. The room I had was renovated with an on-suite and air conditioner, small but adequate and a very comfortable queen size bed. The entrance foyer is a narrow corridor with the desk, occasionally open. Easy access is available through the bar or direct from the street with a swipecard outside normal office hours, All worked well and single staff member very friendly and helpful. Narrow corridors, stairs and tiny, ancient lift are quaint (read needs upgrading). The bed was comfortable with fridge,and kettle and tv with Foxtel provided. The tv was out of sync with the sound on all channels lagging by about a second. Foxtel was available, complete with advertisements centred around Alice Springs, very strange.. WiFi was available and free in the rooms although difficult to log onto and kept dropping out infrequently. Meals were served at the bar on the ground floor or plenty of nearby local choices. The best attribute is the location, opposite the town hall and subway station, next door to a large Woolworths, everything the city has to offer. Biggest drawback is the noise, with rooms overlooking busy Park Street and with the bars on the floor below operating long hours. Noisy all night and rooms not soundprooofed. It did not bother me but may if your are looking for a quiet location. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely use again. I recommend to singles and couples looking for a small room, comfortable bed to sleep in and that is all. Don't expect resort facilities.  Best value for money in the city.~3~nan~5~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_447341762~“"Mum and daughter and the Coronation...”~Very good value. Room clean and safe. Small but enough for two... Quaint pub feel.

review_444017734~“Old with a charm”~We stayed here for 3 nights, it was the cheapest in Sydney at the time and my mother always stays here. The staff are friendly and always say hello. The rooms, although old and in need of a good renovation, are quiet. The bathroom is clean with good shower pressure. The bed isnt really that comfortable but does the job.  The old lift is daunting at first but it works and thats all that matters. Nothing bad about a bit of time travel.  Overall you get what you pay for and it beats a back packers any day!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_440014251~“SECURITY COMPLAINT”~Hello,  I would like to make a complaint about two of your security guards from this morning at the door who refused me entry due to intoxication between 4 - 5am. I was wearing a white t shirt and black pants if you would like to review the footage.  My first complaint is not due to the fact I was refused but the attitude your security showed when I asked to speak to management they said " i don't need to speak to anyone but them and that it's their choice since they run the venue"  I thought this was ridiculous and told them they work under management and they should call their manager. Once they refused to call management I asked for their name which they refused to provide me! I asked for them to provide their security details which they refused to do. After a few mins of me asking they would flash their license very quickly and walk away claiming that was acceptable.  After some time and frustration the security finally told me their names. One male islander appearance said his name was "Jason" and I'm not sure if this is true or not and the other Caucasian said his name was "Maddison" this was a lie and I heard "Jason" refer to him with another name.  The fact the two security guards refused to give me their name and security number saying I had to call the police to obtain these details is a breach to having their security license and a possible breach to the venue.  The reason for this email and the reason for me asking for management was I finished work at 3:30am at another establishment and after having two drinks I was refused. Their attitude was completely unacceptable and I would appreciate a reply if any action will be take? if they treated myself in this manner I don't know how they are treating the rest of your patrons.  I make no apologise for my actions last night and the "scene" which was created could have been avoided if they had called management or given me their correct name and security license.  I look forward to your prompt reply~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436471882~“Affordable, clean and great service”~We stayed here for 1 night either side of our cruise out of circular. The hotel is very conveniently located on park street just next to woolworths at town hall so easy to travel anywhere in Sydney cbd.  Rooms itself where well kept and basic and had private bathrooms. Travis on reception was fantastic! Will stay here each time I travel to Sydney!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417327781~“Short Sydney stay”~Excellent location in the centre of Sydney. Old Hotel, vibrant bar on ground level, level 1 has a bar/boutique type atmosphere, where you can order some yummy snacks at reasonable prices.

review_414993086~“Disappointed, appalling & not a good practice”~I finished work and I wanted to have a beer. Unfortunately I did not have enough money in my card I only had $5 which I was waiting for my cash to be cleared for expenses hence I had cash of $2, the beers cost $6. I asked them if they can use both card and cash. The bar tender refuse to serve me hence they minimum on a card is $10. I still tried to explain to the bar tender if there is possibility to pay an extra fee to pay both cash and debit card but he declined and said it there policy only minimum $10 on a card. It so disappointing when you work in hospitality for so long and you hear someone in Sydney CBD standing on hotel policy which someone else made those rules to guide in operations when working in this premises. Then I ask him to call his manager because he does not understand where I am coming from. When the manager came in he said the same thing. It is so sad to see the one in charge saying they cannot serve you only if you can spend $10 on a card to be served alcoholic drink/beer. In Australia we are trying to limit people from drinking heavily but with this practice I feel we are promoting. Having a manager not understanding the principle of RSA is sad. I feel they are not practicing it at all. I strongly feel they should get rid of the bartender first and manager so that people should be able to spend less either by card or cash let's drink less & behavior normal than allowing them to drink more with the minimum of $10. I feel like they encouraging heavy drinking coz beers are $6 hence a person has to spend more than $10 to have a beer resulting in those individuals to get two beers every time the buy a beer. This practice should stop, let all help Australia to reduce alcohol intake. It is my view and I won't recommend any one to go at this place for a beer or any alcohol drink. It is so sad and appalling to see this kind of practice is happening within a city pubs/hotels. The intention of this is to make a profit out of the beverage we serve. They should maybe find a better way to get the money out people's pocket not like this. Those who are traveling in Sydney CBD please refrain from this place. I hope the message is loud and clear don't be fooled by the minimum $10 on a card maybe have cash when you want to visit places like this. Let's control our pocket than someone doing it on our behalf. I feel it is not right. Let the individual make those choices stop making it for them.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414754494~“Don't stay here”~Stayed on a Friday and Saturday night. Made to sign a "non-smoking" declaration but rooms/linen stank of smoke once room freshener had worn off. The "foyer" is behind a cupboard door. Website photos are misleading.  Loud music all night - what they advertise as a wine bar on the ground floor would be better described as a night club. Woollies delivery trucks also arrive in the middle of the night (between midnight and 3am) to unload deliveries. Beer barrels get delivered and rolled into the street between 4 and 6 am. The advertising says "a level of noise can be expected" but it is inexcusable to charge money to offer a place to sleep when sleep is impossible. I was moved from the second to the fourth floor for the second night after I complained - showers filthy in both rooms - the manager only agreed with me after I showed him photos. One damaged wall is covered in a sheet, apparently the council is responsible for its repair. The noise can be heard on the fourth floor despite the manager saying he disputes that as he sleeps there - with due respect he must therefore be used to the noise!! The lift couldn't possibly comply with WH&S and is dangerous to use. You have to step down into it then slide 2 doors across "until the buzzing stops".  I asked for a refund but was denied this because I came through a third party site - to be fair after I showed the photos to the manager he offered me his own money (which I didn't take). He said he'd contact me and I said I wouldn't post photos (which I won't) but I haven't heard from him.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413704166~“Better than expected- great location”~I have lunch at this hotel 1-2 times per week- they do a great schnitzel for ten dollars... I need a room for a night due to a late finish and early start and looked for something cheap. You cant expect too much when you pay close to a hundred dollars. The room was small but comfortable and clean. Surprisingly there wasn't that much noise from Park st which is a busy road. The location is fantastic- close to everything neat Town all station. The staff are very friendly. I see that some people complain about the lift- it reminds me of my child hood and I hope it stays- all me nostalgic! If you want a reasonable room at a reasonable price I recommend this place.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_412471716~“Such a shame to waste a pretty building ”~I stayed here with a friend whilst travelling on business across two separate rooms. He found it as it was cost effective for us for the 3 nights we needed to stay. The building itself is very special, cute, old and features a rickety old style cage elevator which I loved. It was close to everywhere we needed to be and would have been a wonderful hotel if it wasn't for a few setbacks. Staff member at desk the day we arrived was monotonous and less than friendly. Hallways are dark and narrow, which isn't a big issue really just a little claustrophobic for the initial atmosphere. Rooms were ok. Not clean not filthy. But my goodness was it a noise few nights. Everything gets in here. Every city noise - sirens, fights, laughter, car horns, you name it... I didn't sleep through it. Facilities were ok.  For the price this is a cost effective CBD option, and probably fine if you are just looking for slightly less than average accommodation and are a good sleeper anywhere. For me I felt it was a shame to see a beautiful building like this one so underdone and under-utilised.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Small rooms, old elevator, But certainly convenient. The person checking us in, Travis , was always VERY helpful and gave us lots of suggestions about where to go, and what to see. And what to avoid. Thank you Travis. You helped us A LOT. WiFi wasn't available outside the lobby, but there were other places close by where you could access it.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan~nan
review_389803985~“Downtown pub accommodation - with location!”~I booked this because it was cheap, for a 3-star in downtown Sydney. Location is all it has! Bedrooms and bathrooms are cramped, though clean. There is no restaurant, although the pub has a so-called restaurant. But, the bar heaves with loud music , even until 6am, when I came down to leave. I would have to say, however, that I was never annoyed by loud music. Rooms have a separate entrance to the bar's. Nothing could induce me to suffer the heavy-metal music.~2~2~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_387226128~“Affordable accommodation in the heart of the city”~To tell the truth I wasn't expecting much of a hotel above a bar so I was pleasantly surprised with our experience. Old but clean, diligently serviced and friendly staff. The lift is for the adventurous be brave - give it a go. Yes it is in a busy part of the city, don't stay here if you are looking for peace and quiet, but we had no problem getting a good nights sleep after a busy day out touristing. Because it was such a tidy room, with en-suite bathroom, in this location and at this price means it will be top of our list for future visits to Sydney. I would recommend this hotel for couples or solo travelers who want to be part of the city action and travelling on a budget.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan

There is a nearby Woolmart, a Mc Do and walking distance to some of the best shopping malls. The place was enough for two who are on a short stay. We never had any issues with elevator as we seldom took the winding poorly lighted steps. Though we only stayed for a day, the noise outside is a little bit an issue. Park street is busy one with a bus stop just outside.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_352794117~“Extremely friendly staff, great location, wonderful value”~Just spent three nights here. Sydney is an expensive city, so finding a central hotel at a good price is at a premium. Don't expect a pool and other luxuries, but if you want a clean triple room, with a good bathroom, great beer and food in the bar, and very helpful, friendly staff; this is the place. If there is better value around in Sydney, it would be difficult to believe.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan

review_350365158~“Short stop only ”~Booked 2 nights here. Stayed in standard room. The hotel looks very old, I think it's for backpackers. It' smells a little bit. The hotel room was ok! Beds were very comfy the shower was good nice and hot, fridge was working not the coldest but it was ok. Tv worked so that's good. The owner/reception man he was lovely, very helpful he's really nice. There is a bar downstairs they sell really good pub meals so that's good.  ONLY FAULT: the elevator is soooo scary, feels like it's gonna break or ur gonna get stuck! It's old school you have to open the cage door ur self hold it open and then slide the wooden door and lock it then press the button. Very bad!! This hotel is ok for a couple of nights for people looking for somewhere cheap in the city. Perfect location in the city,~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_338116675~“Room was all you needed for a short stopover.”~Stayed here maybe longer than I would of. Was the best priced hotel when I was looking and had the amenities I was looking for at the time. Was a little shocked when I arrived the hall of the hotel entry was tiny but the man behind the reception was accommodating and happy to help and answer queries which made up for my initial shock. The location of the hotel was good as it was very close to the train station and walking distance to circular quay. The old lift to take up to the room with our luggage was usable but chose the stairs until we left on the last day to take our luggage back down. The room was good enough but the shower nozzle drove me crazy not being able to adjust the temperature easily. We had two children with us and found out they weren't allowed in the hotel at all and if we wanted to order food from the hotel we would have to have it delivered to the room. The room was okay and the service and location was good enough for the price we paid but if I had more finance I would of tried somewhere else for a bit more comfort.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~5~nan

Reception was closed when we arrived, but the girl working in the bar was excellent at helping us to get settled in. In fact, all staff were friendly and helpful to the max. It is an older hotel with a quirky elevator, but the rooms were spotlessly clean and had everything we needed for a 3-night stay.

review_332946401~“Probably wouldn't repeat this experience.”~The bed was comfortable and the air con worked. It was a shame that the window didn't open as it would have been nice to have fresh air. We couldn't open the wardrobe door fully because the room door was in the way. The shower was hot and worked great. There wasn't much room, but it was nice to have two bars downstairs, neither of which had any noise impact on the room. The front desk was friendly and helpful. The lift is scary but functional, except when it doesn't manage to get all the way to the floor. They assured us it was perfectly safe, but we used the stairs just in case, haha.  We enjoyed the Park Street Bar; the chicken burger and waffle fries were very good. The beer was good, and the mixed drinks were made correctly.  The thing that was quite upsetting was the filthy carpet. I took a shower and walked around the room barefoot while unpacking and the carpet was mildly sticky and turned my feet black. I stopped what I was doing so I could wash them again and stuck to wearing shoes in the room at all times afterwards.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~2~5~nan
review_332609661~“Great stay in cheap hotel”~I had a really great stay at Hotel Coronation. Firstly, the girl working in the reception was just great! We had a room for two and it was very quiet. Not a luxury hotel at all but great if you don't want to pay too much and just want somewhere comfortable to sleep/stay. Clean rooms with a bit too soft beds. TV, clean bathroom.

review_331560008~“Very old and rundown hotel in an excellent location”~I was a little shocked when I entered into the room. I have been to hotels that are rundown but at least they cover the evidence up. The wall had clear cracks and the paint had fallen off. The first night I was worried that there might be bugs or mice running around but luckily none appeared. After the first day's shock passed, the hotel was actually clean enough. The other odd thing is if you check in after 7pm, you have to go to the main bar area to alert the staff. We had our travel luggage and stood with the drinking crowd for a while, waiting to be taken to our room - very awkward. The two reasons I picked this hotel were: cheap price and great location.~2~nan~5~nan~2~nan~3~nan

review_315711886~“I quiet inner city bad”~I haven't actually stayed at the hotel, only been in the bar downstairs (namely because it can be very difficult to actually stay at multiple hotels when travelling to a single city). The bar itself is fairly small, but it is quite nice and relaxed. It's centrally located and very close to Town Hall station, so you can either stop in here for a drink before heading out, or finishing off with a night cap. It hasn't been all that crowded when I've been here, and has always had that relaxing feel about it. They have a small courtyard out the back for the smokers, but if you are looking for a place to sit down and have a beer with your cigarette then you may need to find some place else.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
