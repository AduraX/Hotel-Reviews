The hotel even has a toaster in your room and they leave fresh bread and butter in your room how nice . Just wonderful the location is awesome in fact we will be back here next month x~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472227929~“GREAT VALUE AND LOCATION”~Another great stay at this hotel.The building is old but has heaps of charm.The rooms are comfortable and the bedding is great .Very cheap compared to other hotels nearby.Bar and restaurant modern and the location is only minutes away from China Town and Darling Harbour:))))~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467133873~“Good budget hotel short distance from darling harbour”~Cost of other hotels in the area were considerably higher and, from reading other reviews, involve rooms that barely fit the bed or have shared bathroom facilities. This hotel was excellent value for the money paid. The room was very spacious with a double and a single bed and a desk! Ensuite bathroom, breakfast and wifi all included.  Short walk to darling harbour. Top tip is to cross the road (Thorpe aquatics on your left) and head down to an elevator on the left which drops you straight into the Chinese garden at darling harbour. Breakfast is a "help yourself" fridge, toaster and kettle in the hallway but given the cheap cost of the hotel and no extra charge for breakfast this is more than adequate. Wifi was a little temperamental but, again, was free so can't complain. We were visiting from Sunday to Tuesday so cannot comment on the weekend noise from pub but from our stay we couldn't tell we were above a pub. Rooms are dated and not 5* but, AGAIN, were still great value for money given the location and size of room. Sydney has so much to offer and so much to do and see that the hotel is simply somewhere to lie your head for the night. This hotel was perfect for that.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466152169~“ Centrally located”~5 stars from me for location (walking distance to darling harbour), cleanliness (beds made every day), budget (priced right for those on a budget), friendliness (always very helpful). If you want 5 star accommodation then pay the price! Glasgow Arms Hotel was perfect for my budget and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465106452~“Quick access to CBD”~Very pleasant and helpful staff again. Let in t our room 12 am. Even though it's a 1.30 check in. Close to the city and Darling Harbor's a 5 minute walk over the bridge. Room was adequate and value for money $108.00 for the Mardi Gras weekend, bargain!! Pub below and $8 Uber into CBD. Great!~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_460982324~“Good value, but beware the noise - bands some nights & vehicular traffic”~I found this property using Wotif and looking for a modest priced overnight. I found the Glasgow Arms and its accommodation upstairs (no lift/elevator). I found the staff helpful, the room, including bathroom clean. Beware Saturday and possibly other nights with live bands performing. The lights outside by night were a concern for a light sleeper. I managed to make the best use of the curtains. Noisy traffic was another concern, but I still managed a good night's sleep until around 5-5.30 am when the traffic started to build up. I needed an early start for business meetings anyway. This hotel is a quick trip from Central Railway Station on Light Rail to Exhibition, then take a lift beside Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre. The hotel is diagonally across the corner of ITAC with the Powerhouse Museum on another corner. Its a convenient location with friendly and helpful staff plus modest prices for accommodation in Sydney.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_458771938~“Good enough for a night”~Spent one night here, as my wife and I visited Sydney for a Vivid Cruise. Rooms were above a pub. Rooms looked old as well. Inadequate light along the corridors as we arrived back during the night from our cruise. "Breakfast option" was bread and your choice of cereals from the corridors. I think that we were drunk enough to notice any noise or inconvenience during the night. Served its purpose for our night out, which is basically some place to sleep in Sydney during our Vivid Cruise.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan
review_458604750~“Basic rooms in great location”~Basic rooms above a pub. Rooms are clean if a little dated. I asked to change my room on first day and had no problem with the staff who are very friendly and helpful. 24 hr self serve continental breakfast is excellent. Free wifi available and noise from the music below was not a problem. The hotel is directly opposite The Powerhouse Museum and Public swimming pool. Darling Harbour and Paddys Market is only a 5 min walk and Central Station 10 min walk.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_441824957~“Don't Just Don't”~The sign says "We are not a 24 hour hotel." They could drop the "24 hour" and be accurate. They have a few rooms above a bar. Steep stairs and no elevator. It doesn't open until 11:00 am most days and does not seem to be associated except they hold the keys. The continental breakfast means there is a loaf of bread in the refrigerator. We lucked out and found an open door to the bar. The guy did allow us to bring the bags in. For Americans arriving on early flights, it could be unworkable. They have a "screw you" sign on the side gate of the bar (see the photo). The entrance is an unmarked door. Really bare bones accommodation and certainly not worth the price. Not easy walking distance to anything. There is no management, phone, or assistance.~1~nan~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan
review_429862686~“Adequate ”~I stayed here for 6 nights as a lone female. Perfectly safe & secure place to stay. Other reviews mention the music from the bar below, in all the 6 nights heard it for a couple of hours once! Again, other reviews mention the mad dash for breakfast. It doesn't happen, in 6 days i saw other residents on 2 mornings only. It is open 24/7, so you can help yourself when you want. The staff here are fantastic, very friendly & helpful. It is ideally situated near Darling Harbour & Chinatown. Great location. The hotel does need abit of an update, but clean & perfectly adequate for 6 nights stay. I would recommend this hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429659623~“Relatively cheap and rustic hotel”~Let me start out by stating that this hotel is not for everyone. I stayed here because it was fairly close to the White Bay Cruise Terminal. I had originally planned on unpacking my bike and riding it to the terminal with my luggage but my plans changed. The hotel room we had was quite large, the bed comfortable and the sheets clean. On the downside, the bathroom was small and had dead insects on the ceiling and the amenities few. The hotel does not have dedicated staff, but personnel are around when the bar is opened. Likewise breakfast is constituted of bread/toast and dry cereal, but there is no dedicated place to eat so it is easiest to take it back to the room. In practice such food supplies and drinks are available all day. The reason I ultimately gave this hotel a 4* rating had little to do with the room, which I would give 3* given location and price. Rather it was that we spent an enjoyable evening in the bar. My daughter had a nice pasta primavera and I had a seafood basket while we played a game a trivia with some locals. Ultimately, we won a bottle of Australian whiskey! Also note that there is no on site parking and that offsite parking can be quite onerous.~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_424235048~“Great Local Pub”~The Glasgow Arms is located just outside of the city in Ultimo. It is a great place to go to watch some sport, have a punt and drink some reasonably priced beers with mates. The publican is a top bloke as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423940353~“Good Value Great Location ”~First of all you should know that this is a nice little pub with older style pub rooms upstairs. Definitely not a luxury hotel but the rooms are clean and good value. Some rooms are quite large with a large bathroom and others are very small with a tiny bathroom. The location of the Glasgow Arms Hotel is great if you are visiting Darling Harbour or Chinatown. The pub is open late and also has a good restaurant. Recommended for pub lovers and a great place to stay if you are in the city for a night or weekend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418029913~“Know what you're getting into”~I stayed here with a friend, and while both of us were relatively satisfied with the hotel, it did have some definite issues. First of all, the staff are very friendly and accommodating, and the food in the pub was generally good, for a reasonable price. It's very basic, but pretty good. And the nightly specials are a very good deal. And the location is very convenient. We were able to walk (sometimes it was a long walk, but we could walk) to everything we wanted to see in Sydney. But the hotel is above a pub, and it does get loud at night. If you're interested, it's also seems to be a gambling establishment (we did not partake) with sport betting (I also saw what looked like slot machines or video poker in another part of the building). Our room consisted of two single beds, which were relatively comfortable. Everything was clean, but quite dingy. The building is quite old, and when anyone moves around, you will hear it. The continental breakfast was fine for us, but it consisted mainly of toast and a selection (sometimes; occasionally there was only one choice; you got what the littlest pig got) of cereals. It is a very, very, very basic establishment. At the time we went to Sydney, it was very much the best price, so I figured it worked out. But it has essentially no amenities (we had to go looking for a hair dryer, but the staff was happy to give us one). The TV in our room worked poorly, and the wi-fi was spotty at best. So, before you book, know what you're getting into. If any of this sounds like it would not suit you, look elsewhere.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_410085738~“Nice staff”~Nice staff - very accommodating. Continental breakfast was good - staff should outline breakfast details @ checkin. Liked the location as it was walking distance to the Opera House, Bridge and transportation.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_394165475~“Best Hotel for the Price on this side of Sydney”~Great little hotel with a nice hand ( help yourself breakfast ) Staff where friendly and for the price, I don't think you could find anything in the area close to it. If we are staying in the area again, we will definitely stay here. Superb value~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_391627810~“Location is the only advantage”~Was looking for somewhere to stay at a very last minute as i was turned down by an airbnb. Chosen this because of its location. Stayed in room 1 and it is very spacious but its very very old! Theres a creepy old cupboard and the floor is squeaking! The sink is not working properly and it take an hour for the water to flow away! Resulting in some insects attracted to the toilet. Stayed there 4 nights and only 1 new towel was changed for us. Furthermore, no new shampoo was provided everyday. We only have 2 small body shampoo to survive for 5 days~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_391626953~“The building is too old”~It's quite clean but it's obviously very old. Good stay if you plan to walk outside for the whole day and just for sleep, if you're those type who likes to stay in hotel longer, perhaps you should try to find other better hotels.  The staffs are overall helpful. Airbus services to airport are available, you need to purchase the bus ticket from the reception counter (the counter is in the restaurant, and the hotel is on the 2nd floor).  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_375707959~“Okay pub, not the greatest”~By this time I have visited quite a lot of pubs in the Sydney area, so when I got to this one my first (and only) thought was boring. Okay, staff were nice, and the place was reasonably quiet, but that wasn't anything about it that really thrilled me all that much. Not a place that I would visit again anytime soon (and I only visited the bar, so have no knowledge of what it is like as a hotel).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367748690~“Decent stay, couple of issues”~We spent 4 nights at the Glasgow arms whilst staying in Sydney and had a mixed experience. The staff were friendly, the breakfast was basic but as advertised and the bar downstairs was good. However the room we stayed in was very noisy, with the room shaking every time large lorries drove past, and a large spotlight outside the window on until 2am was a pain.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_366991513~“I warmed up to it ...”~But the Glasgow Arms is not for everyone. Here's what's good. Location is great. Wi-Fi way better than average (at least in room 6) I could stream Netflix which is not usual in the hotels in Australia I visited. Not do good ... Rooms small an dark. I don't like single beds. And for my money, the Cambridge Hotel a mile away is a better deal. Still, their business model seems to work for them. But in the future, I'll have to spend less than $60. Unless they start offering discounts on pints! In fact, discounts on everything would be nice in the bar. One last thing, GAH is really a boarding house with the bar acting as the lobby. Travel well.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_364901518~“Just okay”~Looking at the reviews of this place before I booked I thought it would be perfect for my modest needs. However, other than a clean bed and bathroom, it was a disappointment. Although there is supposed to be a continental breakfast included upstairs, all there is is some small cereal boxes, milk is often non-existent, as is the juice. If you actually want breakfast, you need to bring in your own food, label it as yours, etc. There is a toaster and microwave provided but only peanut butter and jam for any bread. My room was right on the front corner and although I did not find the street noise too bad at night, the noise from the pub downstairs often was quite loud. In addition, there was a bright light that shone on the building right into the window (thin curtains) and there was no way to block it out - the light did not go out until after 1 a.m. each night. In addition, the stairs are steep so hauling up/down luggage can be a challenge especially since the light switches are time length controlled and often go out before you are at the top of bottom.  The free internet does not work -- either ones they claim there are -- and to access another nearby free internet (d-link) it is necessary to go outside on the back staircase. Totally unsatisfactory. Even downstairs in the pub, the internet did not work satisfactorily. The only good thing I can say about this place was that the person in charge of the lodging was friendly when I checked in and even though it was well before the supposed check in time, my room was ready and waiting for me. If you want a good economical place to stay in Sydney - find somewhere else.~3~nan~3~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_361590919~“Avoid!!!”~Where should I begin?!  We started in room 3: extremely noisy! The hotel is on a main road and has thin windows and this room has 3 of them so you can hear everything from the road. It even shakes as large vehicles go past. This room also has bright lights which illuminate the hotel at night and shine directly into the room. The wifi doesn't work in this room.  After one night we asked to change rooms as we could not sleep. The hotel is only manned from 11am until close so we had to wait until the following evening to ask to change. They would not change us until the morning which meant another sleepless night.  The next morning we asked to change and they were more than happy to move us to a back room but we'd have to change to another back room on the last night.  Room 10: we spent 3 nights in here over the weekend. You couldn't hear the road as much but it was extremely loud from the bar downstairs until early hours. Also the room has a door which looks like it opens onto an adjoining room and you can hear everything through this. Time for some more sleepless nights! The Sunday night was quieter in this room so we managed to get some sleep.  The room also had mould around the shower and sour dried up milk all around the fridge cabinet. The wifi works well in this room.  Unfortunately we had to move on our last night as other people were to be in room 10. We were given room 11. After a hot day exploring, as soon as we got into the room we found that the air conditioning wasn't working. So we were then shown rooms 6 and 7. Room 6 and 7 had a loud whirring sound coming from outside but also room 7 had a ticking sound coming from the air conditioning so we took room 6. Again not very clean with mould on the ceiling and dirty rails and shelves in the bathroom. The shower floor also felt slimy. The wifi worked in this room.  Overall, it is noisy, unclean and falling apart! Pay a bit more and choose a different hotel.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358283274~“Close by”~Down for the Easter Show,overall this is a nice central location to sights, transport and food. The pub itself has a great selection of $15 dollar mains,we ate there one night and it was great. Surrounding area is full of things to do and places to go,darling harbour, walks around the old streets,Sydney fish market, powerhouse museum just to name a few. Some thing that management can improve on ,replace the battery in the smoke alarm rm 9, as working smoke alarms save lives! Only one clean towel was resupplied the second day, removal of someone else's wine bottle and cig guy buts from balcony and maybe a new mattress,my wife discovered what looks like a blood stain on her side of the bed the second night. These thing did not warrant calling management during our stay but my wife will bring it to there attention. Having said all that I would stay again. Oh loved the self serve breaky in the room toast cereal fruit juice~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_356913490~“Disappointing”~We had read reviews on this hotel before booking and thought it would be better than what we experienced. We had the room at the front corner so the noise from the traffic was dreadful. We were above a busy intersection (Ian Thorpe summing pool on opposite corner) and so the traffic was constant. And the room was so light - there was a large spotlight outside one of the three windows in the room which was on until about 2am. The curtains were thin and one of them was broken and had been hitched up. The bathroom was tiny. Basically we paid ($55 a night) for what we got. The breakfast bar is a small selection of 4 cereal packs and bread for toast. Milk, juice and tea and coffee provided. On the plus side - the staff were friendly and very helpful and the food at the attached restaurant was really good and reasonably priced. And the location is handy int hat you could easily walk to Darling Harbour and Chinatown.~2~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan
review_356735642~“What's negative? ”~My wife and I stayed in the Glasgow Arms hotel for 8 days in February. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Manager even carried our cases up and down and waited with us until we got a taxi on departure. Room was large, clean and air-conditioned. Beds made up daily and room cleaned. Breakfast was an added bonus. How could you possibly criticise at the price paid. Restaurant food was excellent. 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour. Short taxi ride to Sydney Opera house. Local buses to Bondi beach. Overall very impressed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355389212~“Not the best accomodation”~Room 5 second floor. Shares a wall with the breakfast bar so noisy from first risers. No elevator no Bell hop no front desk no alarm or wake up calls . You must carry your own luggage. This room needs updating. The bedding was clean and the bed comfortable. Air condition is an off on thing so you need to be the regulator. So sometimes too hot and stuffy other times overly cool. Staff most helpful. Close to hop on hop off sightseeing bus stop.~2~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_350405627~“Cold beer”~Great place for a pint. Very energetic atmosphere good place for people watching. There was a guy in a chicken suit in here that apparently was celebrating his last night as a single man,so that was fun to watch the hilarity. We didn't have anything to eat, only a few beers but it was a really good time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_350336134~“Excellent value”~We regularly stay a night in Sydney before taking a cruise from that Port. Over the years we have stayed at the best high end 5 star and mid rate 3 star. These days I am amazed at the exaggerated prices at some of the best named hotels and just would not justify zone of the asking prices for a room without breakfast. Browsing through TA, I was interested to read reviews of The Glasgow Arms and was able to book the last available room for the night required. The look of the place IS quite challenging when you arrive outside but nothing could fault the warmth of our welcome and assistance with our luggage to our room. A small room with two single beds. But it was clean, smelt nice and adequate. Sleep quality is always a challenge when staying away yet our beds had wonderful thick mattresses and were most comfortable. With crisp white sheets and towels. Our shower room had large cubicle with wonderful large shower head. As the evening goes on, it does get noisy and if you in a room at the front, you are flooded with huge lights from outside. However, this is what it is: an inner city bustling pub. It is noisy and busy. Despite that we had a good sleep. The self serve continental breakfast was adequate with cereals, juices, breads and spreads. Our room was comfortable and cool, with good air conditioning. For the realistic price we paid, I could not fault The Glasgow Arms and would happily stay here again~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_345327265~“Air Con could be better but it's cheap!”~We stayed for a week. The aircon was not really good so it was a bit hot and stuffy. However, for the location, it was cheap (we booked on Expedia) and the price included fresh milk, boxed cereal, juice, bread and spreads in the room. It's Sydney, so there are roaches but we only dealt to about six over the week (I ended up buying some bug spray from across the road to sort them!) The location is great it is basically across the road from the light rail. Based on the price if you can handle a hot room, this place is great! It was a safe walk home from Chinatown at night.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342815298~“Close to darling Harbour at a good price”~Me and my girlfriend wanted to get away from home and decided to go to darling Harbour .

review_340061191~“Travelling to the airport from the NSW Central Coast.”~This is a great little pub. We have stayed here before and have found the staff friendly, the food absolutely the best (and great prices) and the rooms very comfortable. It is an ideal spot for a look at the best of Sydney and then not far to the airport. Less than $30 by taxi. We just hail one from out the front as they come back from the casino. No need to pay for booking. We have done this at 3.30 am and today at 4.30 am. Maximum wait was 5 minutes.  The aircon was a little noisy in room 2 but will be fixed with new bearings in the fan motor. The self service breakfast bar was standard with juice, cereal, tea coffee, condiments and crockery and cutlery. Very clean and accessible.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_336517936~“Good location and value for your money”~Stayed here for 4 nights and 5 days. We did mostly the touristy stuff in Sydney so we didn't get to stay in the hotel that much. The airconditioning was "old" but I was surprised that it kept us cool during those warm days! The room was beside the main street so I was worried I wouldn't get much sleep because of the noise but again, I was surprised that it wasn't that noisy at all! Maybe the windows were that thick? When I booked the hotel they said continental brekky was included but actually it was just self-serve cereals and milk along the hallway. I couldn't complain really because we got to stay for $89 per night! So to sum it all up, if you're a budget conscious traveler who only needs a comfortable bed to stay during the night then this is the best choice! Did I say it's also close to the Light Rail Station? :) that's a plus too.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_334124386~“Great in location with reasonable price”~I travel to Sydney before I went over to New Zealand, dropping by this hotel & found that the hotel was very recommendable to people. The room was amazingly clean with a very comfortable bed plus ensuite with a bathroom. There was a bar just next to the hotel where you can get good food with walking distance. The room comes with a balcony where you can just chill anytime with a drink. The staff were absolutely friendly & helpful too. The only thing to improve is that the room might need some slight touching up as it looks like kinda old design & the wifi, there is no wifi in the room which makes its incomplete cause wifi nowadays is so so so important. Overall had a wonderful experience as its very near to some interesting places like the power house museum & the chinese town with just walking distance.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_323486710~“Cosy, quiet and central”~A single room with attached bath is all you need when travelling alone and Galsgow Arms had the place for me. Friendly, welcoming but non-interfering staff, access to food from the bar downstairs and steps from Light Rail transportation that gets you to Central and then everywhere else. Two recommendations: a waste basket would be nice in the room and I actually could not find the TV remote. So I didn't watch any TV and that could be a good thing, right?!!? ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_321563511~“Reasonable price in great location”~The staff were absolutely awesome, the guy who checked me in even carried my bag to my room.

review_319505887~“An absolute gem of a place”~I travel to Sydney weekly for business usually staying 1-2 nights whilst there. I have been looking for a family run hotel where I can not only get a good quality room with ensuite facilities but also a first class meal and somewhere that feels like a home away from home. I finally found all three of those things at The Glasgow Arms Hotel The room was first class, extremely clean, recently renovated and the bed was very comfortable. For dinner downstairs I ordered a rump steak and it was possibly the best value steak that I have had in 20 years. The service was exceptional, the staff friendly and the overall experience was first class. The pleasant chat with the Publican, Steve added to the ambience and what turned out to be an extremely enjoyable stay. I will definitely be back next week and would certainly recommend The Glasgow Arms Hotel to everyone.   Chris Condon Dubbo NSW~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_305665463~“Cheap and cheerful”~If you are looking for a good economical short stay in Sydney, I can recommend the Glasgow Arms Hotel on Harris St Ultimo. It is a fair walk from Central station but directly opposite the Powerhouse Museum and just a stroll to Darling Harbour and even across to the city, if you want. The beds were very comfy and the shower had red hot water (although shower could do with a little bleach to clean the floor tiles and the toilet seat properly) but overall the stay was wonderful. Beds made up every day and place very tidy. The staff in the bar are very friendly and helpful and the added bonus is that breakfast is included (cereal, toast, juice and tea/coffee). Everything you need to make your stay pleasant. The rooms at the rear, although not on busy Harris St, don't have wifi, so keep that in mind if you need wifi. Other rooms have wifi, and it is available in the pub downstairs via a password. Not too many hotels charge 80 bucks a night and offer all that and throw in a city skyline view (rooms 1,2 and 3). Would highly recommend if you're not wanting 5-star everything.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_305652638~“One night - Thursday to Friday”~This hotel had really nice people at the reception, it wasnt too far from the Central station and it really wasnt far to walk to Darling harbour.

review_252172052~“Great value and more”~I stayed in this hotel Feb 2014 for 2 nights. I was quite amazed that price of the hotel and its location. It is located right next to Darling Harbor with walking distance. Yet, I only paid $69 for double room per night and it includes breakfast! The room was a bit small but has everything I needed such as air-conditioner, separate shower and toilet, a small table and 2 chairs, a hanger, two single beds. Underneath guest rooms, there is a pub. When you access to hotel you actually have to go to the pub to get a key. The staff there is really friendly and they have all variety of beers!  Even if we missed the last order at the kitchen at night time but they told me where to get some foods and said it was ok to bring the food to the pub. We brought chicken schnitzel and chips from nearby snack bar and ate with their beer at the pub.  Half of People at the pub are locals and the other half is travelers like us. I think you won't be able to find any hotel like this. Strongly recommend and will go back to this again in the future.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_237892679~“Best value in Sydney”~Stayed here for two nights. We booked three rooms and all were happy. It is your basic accomodation but for the price you cant get any better than this. Check in was downstairs in the pub and the girls were lovely. showed us up to our rooms and showed us where everything was. The breakfast bar in the hallway is a great idea. Cereal, toast, tea and coffee and even juice in the fridge. We ate two meals downstairs in the pub and is was great food and great atmosphere. Nice and clean and our room was even made up the next day with fresh towels supplied. the girl cleaning the rooms was lovely and very helpful with providing us an ironing board. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay here again whilst in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_232463079~“Not flash but great location”~well, its not flash but its clean, quaint and comfortable enough for one night's stay. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The free breakfast bar outside the rooms was really neat & homely. The location however, was fantastic - 6 minutes walk from Darling Harbour.  It was quite an amusing experience staying here.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_231244612~“Good average accommodation.”~Not the classiest place, but good average accommodation at a reasonable price. Check-in is at 2.00pm, and not 1.00pm as advised on the web site. I stayed in room 2 and there is a little noise from the ceiling mounted speakers in the bar downstairs but it all stops at midnight. I was so tired after a day of exploring on foot that I fell asleep anyway. Great location for Darling Harbour and other attractions. Towel rail missing and the soap holder was broken in the bathroom. Traffic noise was surprisingly muted. Don't pay the full rate from their website, but shop around for a cheaper rate as there are many on offer on other sites. Parking is a block away and not cheap so factor that in too. I would rate no more than 3 stars but would stay again as I often think some frills offered elsewhere are unnecessary. WiFi is a bit hit and miss too. The Powerhouse Museum across the road is an absolute gem and not to be missed. Stunning.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_229191087~“Value for money in Central”~I stayed for 3 nights in the twin room on 2 separate occasions and have stayed in room 6 and 7.Room 7 is definitely much better because everything looks newer compared to room 6. Lucy attended to me on the first day and she is very friendly. She let me use the phone to contact my tour company without any charge.The room is basic but clean.It is quite a walk (about 20mins) to the Central Station if you dont mind walking. Darling Harbour is about the same distance as well but Paddy's Market light rail is nearby (you cant use Opal for this one).I arrived early but the check-in is strictly at 2pm but you can leave your luggage.What I really like is the open kitchen,you can go make your breakfast there, they supplied breads,cereals and biscuits with juices and coffee and tea.Wifi is free and strong.Overall,with clean ensuite room in Central,free wifi and breakfast you cant get much better than Glasgow Arms Hotel :)~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_227224976~“Great location and food but a few let-downs.”~Based on the reviews to date we really had higher expectations but encountered a number of disappoints that would question whether we'd stay there again.  CHECK-IN: Starting with check-in...The website states check-in is after 1pm but when we arrived we were told check-in was 2pm? Having travelled since 4am in the morning, and on a cold, miserable day, with luggage, that one hour can make all the difference. Sadly we received no sympathy or access to our room until 2pm. So on arrival we killed time in the bar area for an hour and then received the key from the barman. While he was friendly enough, all we were effectively told was where the room was upstairs and given the key to make our own way. There was insufficient lighting in the hallway upstairs which just so happened to have a step in one of the darkest parts, creating a real hazard for someone who wasn't careful. Disappointingly, we received no other instructions or explanation at all about the hotels facilities and amenities, parking, the bistro, the room itself or checkout?  THE ROOM: The room (#2) was tidy, clean and very quiet for such a location (on the corner of a busy intersection) with exception to one VERY annoying intrusion... The ceiling mounted speakers from the bar below! Ahhhhhhhhh:-( Anyone trying to have rest or an ounce of sleep before ~12am (around the time they turn them off) will need to be prepared to accept the continual ‘ambient’ noise of racing commentary and music emanating from the floor. While initially it didn’t bother us (as we were so tired from travel) after a while it became very irritating. I would liken the noise to someone leaving a reasonably loud radio constantly on in another room or hearing someone constantly talking loud through a wall. Surely we’re not the first guest to comment about this as I checked and confirmed it also echoed through the hallway outside and I expect the other eight guest rooms? BTW, the walls were thin and you could easily hear a cough in the next room as though it was in your room itself. I suspect the same ‘insulation’ exists (or not) in the floor given the amount of noise from the speakers previously mentioned. The windows to the room are sealed and cannot be opened. This is not such an issue when it’s cold anyway but I expect in summer, with an air conditioner that didn’t really work, that could be a real issue for some. The queen bed in the room was clean and reasonably comfortable but unfortunately quite hard and we both had slight back aches the following day. The wall-mounted air conditioner/heater was out of place in the room and appeared to be some kind of device from the 70’s, with a broken knob and a weird way of functioning even after it was turned off?! Perhaps a poltergeist? Lol And it was noisy so we stopped using it. The TV was missing a remote and when we did finally pluck up the courage to ask in the bar downstairs they found one for us after a supposedly unconvincingly claim someone had “nicked it again” from the room. ..To us it seemed insinuating a guest would want to steal a remote from an old Palsonic 32 inch TV? Lol...strange?! We suspect they were just sharing remotes between rooms. The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water, just what the doctor ordered on a cold, wet miserable day! The room had the basics including an iron and ironing board in the cupboard.  While not an issue, we were surprised there was no phone in the room. WIFI: The Wi-Fi (in the room) wasn’t very reliable as it was very sluggish and ‘hung’ a lot. This resulted in us having to revert to using 3G on our phones. Not really ideal when you need to make travel bookings and business plans online. I really think when a business advertises Wi-Fi as a facility then it should provide a more reliable service given people these days are so dependent on it and would prefer not to have to use their 3G instead. In summary though, it was all the little lack of attentiveness and attention to detail that really disappointed us and didn’t make us feel that welcome at all. ENTERTAINMENT: In relation to the accommodation, a saving grace (noise-wise) was that there was no live music for the duration of our stay (Saturday & Sunday nights). Depending on your lifestyle and personality this could either be seen as a pro or a con. They do have a small, segregated suite of poker machines and all the usual pub gambling facilities. Racing, Keno etc... Alternatively you can mingle with the local punters in the bar whom I’m sure appear more than happy to share a few stories over a beer should the opportunity allow it. PARKING: We made the mistake of hiring a rental car when most of our four day stay in Sydney was focussed in Darling Harbour and the city. There is no off-street parking at the hotel itself and you will struggle to find any cheap parking nearby. On weekends there is a small strip across from the hotel with free parking all weekend but otherwise in the area you’re going to have to pay metred parking, ranging from $1.50 per hour on weekends to $3.70 per hour on weekdays. The Aspire Hotel two blocks away does offer secure parking at ~$25/24 Hours. With the disappointing aspects behind us, let’s move on to what was really great about the hotel... LOCATION: For the price the location was fantastic. Right opposite the Powerhouse Museum and only 15 minutes’ walk to Darling Harbour and surrounding attractions. A casual walk to Circular Quay took about 35 minutes (one way). If your stay is entirely local and touristy then you don’t really have a need for a rental car as most everything is in easy walking distance and the remaining attractions can be covered by public transport anyway. WILLY WAGTAIL BISTRO: A great choice on the menus, some of which aren’t published on the website. The staff was fantastic, friendly, helpful and attentive. Our orders were served in a timely manner, even despite the bistro being busy for the small team working in the kitchen. The food was absolutely perfect! As such, despite the huge amount of food choices available in Sydney we dined at the bistro again for our second and final night. We got the feeling the bistro and hotel operated as separate businesses they were so dissimilar. SERVICE: Aside from the previous comments the bar staff were friendly enough but if you required privacy you certainly got it; albeit through lack of attention from staff at the bar in general. The staff of the bistro on the other hand however were really great on all levels. VERDICT: All in all, the jury is out for us as to whether we’d stay there again. Unfortunately the stay wasn’t that memorable for us in a positive way, not due to a single circumstance, but a combination of a few.  In seeking to attract customers I think if they placed more attention on their accommodation guests, and detail on the small things related as I’ve mentioned, rather than their race punters in the bar, then I think the hotel really does has a lot going for it, but until we hear otherwise, for the various reasons mentioned, we’d be cautious recommending it to relatives or friends.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
