review_477631531~“Great Hotel”~Great apartments in a great location for cruisers. Walking distance to the Overseas Passenger Terminal. We stayed in a fully equipped apartment, seperate bedroom, kitchen, big bathroom with a concealed laundry. Glimpses of the harbour from the large balcony. Would stay here again on our next visit to Sydney~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477308509~“Lovely stay”~We had a three bedroom apartment, top floor. It was a lovely apartment. Convenient locations as its walking distance to all the sights. We loved our stay. Apartment was serviced daily and Staff helpful. I would stay again and recommend to others.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_475942888~“Dirty Carpet, What Else Is Not Being Cleaned?”~I know that the York is renovating rooms and that is the excuse given for worn furniture and less-than ideal conditions mentioned in other reviews, but why can't the cleaning staff at least spot clean the carpeting? The furniture and fixtures in our unit looked good - but the carpet told a different story. It was not worn at all, but there were black dirty spots everywhere in traffic areas. To see how much effect a simple spot cleaning would have, I got a light dish soap solution on a rag and tried one - with excellent results. The spot was gone. Now, why haven't housekeeping and housekeeping supervisors noticed the spots and tried a little spot cleaning? When I see such visible lack of basic cleaning, it makes me wonder what else is being overlooked.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475669196~“Very Convenient Location & A Good Value”~There was three of us and we were given a very large suite with sleeping for two in the bedroom and one in the living room. Each room had its own wall-mounted a/c unit. A roomy covered balcony was accessible from both rooms, although the traffic noise was very loud outside, even on the 14th floor, so I doubt one would ever spend much time out there. Views of buildings and roads only. The train passes directly under the building every few minutes, making a percussive sound much like that from somebody's custom automotive sound system with the volume turned way up. While very noticeable, it did not disturb our sleep. The toilet and basin were in one room, while a shower, tub, basin, clothes washing machine and dryer, and a laundry tub were across the hall in another room. The shelf in the shower was sloped downward and at a height making it easy to bump one's head against it. There was a room safe. The room was advertised as unrefurbished, and so it was. The carpet was stained throughout and needed replacement. There was considerable water damage to the carpet and bathroom door jam from a previous shower drain overflow. The bathroom spot lights cast shadows on one's face. Two workers entered our room while we were there during the day after a knock and only a brief wait. They were there to do window maintenance. I asked for ID and they had none, other than the company shirts they were wearing. I had them wait while I called the front desk, and I determined that they could do our room another day, so I sent them away. Reading lights over the bed were not working. The kitchen area was equipped for those wanting to prepare their own meals, and grocery stores were within walking distance. While there were several negatives with our serviced apartment, the convenience to the opera house, Circular Quay, the bridge, the Rocks, CBD, and only a block to Wynard Station made up for it. Not perfect, but priced accordingly. You can request a voucher for breakfast next door at the Travelodge. It costs $20 each that is added to your room bill and you get a good selection of food.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475431741~“Great location for sight seeing”~Great location for sightseeing with most places within easy walking distance. We had two bedroom apartment on 27th floor.Two balconies, but unfortunately only had partial view of harbour as there are several high rise buildings in the vicinity. Rooms was large and light, with enough windows to let in the light 10 mins walk from circular quay, lovely walk through botanical gardens takes you to Opera House. Also short walk to Darling Harbour.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_474535898~“Great Location and Amenities”~Stayed on the 19th floor. Two bedroom, one bathroom, washer and drier, fully equipped kitchen, dining table and tv area. Nice hot spa and a pool, although tooooo cold for me, heated would be better. Nice little gym too. Easy access to the opera house, bridge , circular quay. Also train, buses and loads of eateries and woolies to buy your own food. All in all, it worked well for us and our two kids 6 and 9.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_474399052~“Roomy Accommodation at a Reasonable Price”~The York in Sydney is handy to The Rocks, Circular Quay, The Opera House and the theatre district. We stayed in a Queen Suite with balcony, full kitchen and sizeable living area on a special deal. Only disappointing thing was the age and condition of the bathroom with the shower screen doors especially being loose and hard to keep in their tracks. Other than that a pleasurable stay. Friendly and helpful staff.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473911472~“Lovely”~We had a deluxe studio and it was smashing It was very well thought out Got most thing except oven but it was a studio not apartment Aircon was good Shower and bath was good Cleaned Everyday Washer and tumble dryer in very large bathroom Free wifi Loved this studio felt very comfy Balcony looking out to buildings but you could see the swimming pool We were just 5 minutes down hill to Circular quay walking which was a bonus being so close All the shops were surrounding us Small supermarkets up the main road about 309 yards along The bathroom was lovely but the inky fault was the sink it was lovely to look at but it was like a long very long shallow one and only could have a tiny drop of water in it one and half inches no good for anything but that was the only fault All the furniture was new and matched right down to the headboard I highly recommend this studio l enjoyed staying there in Sydney my 13 th visit from Uk and loved it~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473300692~“Very pleasant surprise”~I booked as friends had also booked. I was a little apprehensive as some reviews weren't complementary. I booked executive one bedroom apartment. It was very clean, full kitchen with enough cooking utensils, etc. The lounge & dining room were Hugh with a balcony off this area. Plenty of comfortable lounge furniture & large dining glass top table. There was small bathroom to second bedroom which was locked. The master bedroom had large ensuite, separate bath to shower. King bed, nice furniture, large wardrobe with mirrors as doors. Bed was extremely comfortable. Separate room for washer & dryer. Air conditioner split system in lounge/dining room & master bedroom. There is a large entry area into the apartment. Staff were pleasant enough. 10 minute walk to harbour area-bridge, ferries, opera house. 10 minutes up George street to shops. Woolworths grocery store about 5 minutes walk up York street. I was on 16th floor, no noise from apartments either side of me. Occasional traffic noise from expressway, definitely manageable. I would certainly stay here again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473277633~“Luxury”~The rooms are large with balconies looking over the city. The hotel was clean with helpful staff. Close to shops and restaurants. Elevator, pool, air-con, cable channels helped make it a relaxing stay.~4~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473244458~“Room with a view”~With friends we shared an apartment on the 28th floor with view of the harbour. Rooms were spacious and decor tasteful. Couldn't fault, beds luxurious, extras like bathrobes all made our stay wonderful.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_473224261~“Homey Hotel”~The view we had from our deck was amazing! The interiors are a little dated- but not necessarily in a bad way. It really felt like I was walking into an apartment that could be my home- spacious and everything we needed for a weekend mini break. Great location near Wynyard, Circular Quay and super close in a taxi to the airport. Would definitely recommend for families - felt safe and the reception staff were warm.~4~2~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472543144~“It’s a decent place for a long stay but is not faultless”~My wife and I have just spent 23 nights (4-26 March 2017) at the York in deluxe studio apartment 1309 (i.e. one on the 13th of 27 floors). This is the third time we have had a long stay at the York and the third time we have been in apartment 1309. On the last two occasions this was by request. So thank you to the York for allocating it to us again on this visit. The York is not perfect but if we were to visit Sydney in the future (and we hope that we can) we would in all probability stay there again. If that tells you enough then you can stop reading now. If you want chapter and verse then read on. We like the York because of its close proximity to public transport (trains from Wynyard and numerous buses from surrounding streets), to supermarkets (Coles and Woolworths) and to most visitor attractions (which you can also easily walk to).  The York has apartments of different standards, sizes, internal layouts and aspects. We can only comment on studio apartment 1309, which we like for its generous size, its logical layout, its copious storage and its primarily city view from its large balcony (it overlooks York Street). I enclose a number of pictures. One shows the apartment plan on the 13th floor. Others show apartment 1309 itself and should give you an idea of the deluxe standard.  It also had virtually everything we need for a long stay – air conditioning, washing machine and tumble dryer, iron and ironing board, dishwasher, walk in shower and separate bath, bathrobes, a large microwave and electric hob, a refrigerator and small freezer, a range of crockery, cutlery and cooking equipment, a large safe, a large TV and various entertainment systems. It even has an emergency lamp. It also has a swimming pool and a gym but we did not use those. The York provides dishwasher detergent, washing up liquid (and dishcloth and drying up cloth), tea and coffee, a carton of milk, good quality towels and flannels, tissues and a range of toiletries. The only things it did not have that we would have found helpful was a pair of scissors and a small sharp knife. It does not provide washing machine detergent but some can be purchased from reception for $2 (not sure how much that gets you). Because we were staying for 23 nights, and knew it was not provided, we brought some with us. On previous visits we got a complimentary copy of the Sydney Morning Herald each day but that seems to have gone by the board now for all guests. Although we like the apartment we did think it looked a little jaded this time and had suffered from some neglect since our last visit. There were items of crockery and cutlery missing (the standard appears to be to have 4 of everything); the coffee table top was heavily stained; there were a number of small stains on the carpet; a picture had been removed leaving just the hooks on the wall; some of the grouting between the tiles in the shower cubicle was discoloured (as was the coving above the tiles); a ceiling light in the apartment entrance had been removed at some time and no one had made good when it was put back; there was a discoloured patch on the ceiling between the lounge area and the kitchen where someone had rather poorly made good. And so on. I mentioned some of this on the "how can we improve your stay" card found in the apartment. Hopefully management will do something about it. We also think the York is pretty good value for money, and particularly when you book early. On this visit we got a reduced rate for a long stay. Our reduced daily rate ranged from $180 to $398 a night and worked out at an average $233 a night. The quid pro quo was that we only got weekly room servicing. They did this on a Tuesday. It involved changing the bedding, the towels and flannels, the dishcloth and tea towel; replenishing the consumable kitchen items (tea, coffee, milk washing up liquid etc) and bathroom items (toilet paper, toiletries, tissues etc); and emptying the bins. There is access to rubbish chute on each floor for doing the latter yourself between weekly services. We were told that when they did the weekly service they would also do cleaning e.g. vacuuming of carpets. We saw no evidence that they did much cleaning at all! Indeed, in the 3 weeks we were there, I don't think the carpet was vacuumed, the tiled floors in the kitchen and bathroom mopped or a single surface dusted. That has always been one of my main criticisms of the York (see previous reviews) and it's a shame to see no real improvement over the years. Also, peculiarly, they did not leave a week’s supply of tea, coffee, shower stuff etc. We got only what someone staying 1 day would get. On occasions we did ask for more, and got it, but you should not have to ask. If daily room servicing is important to you on a long stay then I presume you would just have to pay the full price.  There are two specific aspects potential guests need to be aware of. The first is that the York leaks a huge amount of external noise because the hotel only has single glazing. So although you would expect street noise in a city centre location, it is far worse in this hotel than it would be in a more modern hotel with double or even triple glazing. What made it even worse this time was nearby construction noise from the old Menzies hotel site. This started at 7am, went on for 6 days a week and is likely to continue for some months to come. It may be rooms with a different aspect or on a higher floor would be quieter. Bottom line, if a good night's sleep is important to you then take note. The second aspect is the (free) wifi. It was as poor as any we've experienced anywhere. We did complain. The hotel quickly sent a maintenance man. He took one look at the modem and said we had one of the old type and replaced it. But it made no difference. The problem was that it kept kicking us off on both of our devices. Basically it was totally inconsistent and hence unreliable. If this aspect is important to you then take note. This is something that the York could do something about. After staying there we went on to a 600 bed hotel in Singapore and the (free) wifi there was superb. We also had a few minor irritations during our stay. On checking in we were asked if we wanted to pay the full cost of our stay upfront. We agreed to pay weekly in advance. We paid in cash to avoid an extortionate 2.5% surcharge for payment by credit OR debit card.  We were given 1 room key card. When, later, we asked for a second card they somehow disabled the original one.  When we got into the apartment and checked the mini bar inventory sheet we found one item missing. We reported it as we did not want to be charged for it, only to be told the inventory sheet was incorrect. Note - if you want the mini bar contents removed (and such items in the refrigerator took up nearly half the space) there was a $10 charge. One day a maintenance man appeared at the door with a tumble drier saying he needed to replace ours. It was not clear why as ours was working perfectly satisfactorily. After he had replaced it we found the ‘new’ one was filthy - covered in dust with a full fluff filter. Late one afternoon a light bulb in a bedside light exploded showering glass everywhere. We asked for someone to bring a vacuum cleaner. A man turned up quickly and proceeded to vacuum the floor, but he did not have a nozzle to get into the nooks and crannies. I ended up running my hands over the floor picking up bits of glass he had missed. I also had to ask for the bedding to be changed, which he did, but he would not have done so if I had not asked.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471958038~“Overnight stay before a cruise”~We stayed at the York before going on a cruise to South seas. It was a convenient location. We were able to easily get there from the airport. We did a bit of sightseeing which was within easy walking distance from the hotel. The York does not have a dining room but is conveniently located with restaurants and other eating places close by. The staff at the front counter were friendly & helpful. The cost was reasonable. Only negative was the cost of the breakfast pack which was about $14 and not enough for one person let alone two. I recommended going out for breakfast to one of the excellent eating places near by.  It was a 10 minute easy downhill walk to the wharf at Circular Quay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471510488~“Functional, very noisy, but good beds.”~A functional hotel if you need CBD at the lower end of the hotel scale. The hotel is nothing flash - best described as functional. One very positive point - excellent bed, douvee and pillows. very comfy. One major downside - the street noise is terrible. This hotel should think about investing in double-glazed windows.  For those requiring space - lots of it - very roomy rooms. However, in rooms this size the hotel should have appropriate sized TVs. They're tiny relative to the space.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_471331751~“Great hotel in a fantastic spot”~Great spot for the hotel, apartments are huge and have great views off the balcony, although the staff seem a little intrusive. I stayed with family and friends and we felt as if we were being watched and judged. Lovely facilities but the staff kind of let this place down.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~2~nan
review_471222920~“Great”~In a nutshell I found this Hotel to be exactly what I thought it would be. Great location and studio suite was a great size. Spent 4 nights in total and enjoyed the space of the suite. The room was a dated but I knew that when booking. Perfect spot for catching the train, walking down to the Harbour or The Rocks area. Would definitely recommend to fellow travellers. If I had to have a complaint then it would be the smell and the temperature of the foyer. Very off putting but once you get past that then its fine. I suggest booking in advance as the price did seem to escalate as our trip got closer.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470883289~“Deterioration of standards in a potentially good aparthotel”~We have used these apartments on four occasions over the past 15 years (twice before it was taken over by Swiss-Hotel). The apartments are spacious and well located albeit adjacent to a busy main street howling with traffic noise that carries above to your rooms. Further, the standards of what used to be a good apartment block have fallen considerably even since we last used this apartment 5 years ago.  There is an urgent need for improvement as follows: 1) Cleaning and rubbish removal just once a week is insufficient. However, the use of the minibar is checked on a daily basis. 2) The general cleanliness can be improved all over the premises  3) Moreover, there is no cleaning material within the apartment to allow one to clean on their own (such as a vacuum cleaner, good quality detergent or decent brush and pan) 4) The kitchen is poorly stocked in terms of equipment and the crockery and cutlery minimal making it difficult to fill the dishwasher provided with the apartment. 5) Technical maintenance is needed (e.g. one TV and the oven malfunctioned and the microwave was ancient) 6) Reception staff were inefficient - e.g. booking package included a late check out at 12.30 but we were hounded on telephone at the regular check out time of 10.30 to leave. This has the feel of a disorganised establishment. I am not sure I would use it again.~2~nan~nan~2~nan~2~2~nan
review_470145292~“It it's Day....”~This hotel is just off the Harbour Bridge so it is very convenient to the city. Our apartment was large with great aspects to the harbour, which would have been great in the day it was built, however additional buildings have taken over and blocked most of the views. There was some 'small' print suggesting the $50 parking fee which seemed a shame as we would not have gone to the expense if we were 'clearly' informed. I just don't understand the concept of small print from a customer perspective - doesn't seem transparent to me. After discussion however the management did cancel car parking payment - much discussion. Room cleaning processes are not at the standard and price of the style of this hotel.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_469967063~“Great location and awesome apartmebts”~We stayed for 5 nights and booked a one room apartment but got a three room apartment!!!the location is great, easy walk to Westfield tower or the aquarium and there are many bus stops and the metro station almost in front of the york. The pool is really nice and beautiful, there were just some residents who where to loud and stupid but well nothing to complain about the pool or the cleaness around the pool. Just the price is really hight bit that's Sydney as we figured out~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469255096~“Well located apartment hotel.”~Our one bedroom apartment was well presented. It had the added bonus of a washing machine and a separate dryer. Bed was comfortable and just loved the pillows. The only criticism would have to be that the kitchen had very few cooking utensils and crockery. This could be an issue for people who wanted to cook their own meals. Supermarkets are very close to the apartment block in the Wynyard station. I would stay in this apartment hotel again if holidaying in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_467943915~“mini break in Sydney”~The apartment was spacious, clean would suit 3 couples easily in the two bed apartment as there is a second lounge with a fold out bed, two full bathrooms full laundry and full size fridge, two balconies with out door furniture, only down point was the TV was a bit small for the size of the apartment and were recommended to go next door to the travel lodge for breakfast which I would not recommend to anyone~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_466521918~“Check your bed”~We stayed here for 3 nights. When we got to the room on the first night, we looked under the beds. Wow, totally disgusting. dust bunnies, toe or finger nails, not sure. socks, money, pens, paper. jelly beans on the floor in the kitchen. Grease on the stove fan. Dishes had dried food on them. we complained to the manager, he said he would have this taken care of the next day. We went out the next day and came back to a room that was the same. We complained again the next day. The maintenance person came and a had a look, he was not impressed with the filth. The room was finally cleaned, but not very well. Beds are not comfortable.The hot  tub was not hot. Too pricey for what you get. Do not recommend this hotel.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_465999053~“Great hotel in a fantastic location ”~Stayed here for 5 nights after our arrival in Oz.  The hotel is very well located for all major central sights. The accommodation was pretty good - not the highest but great value for money. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Would definitely recommend for a short stay in this city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465980429~“Good value in a central location”~The location of the hotel is good, it is within walking distance of the major sights and there is also a train station very close by. For the price we paid I think the hotel was good value for money due to the location. We stayed in a room that had not been refurbished yet. The room showed it's age, but everything was fully functional, if a bit dated.The washer/drier in the room was very handy as it allowed me to catch up up laundry. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, as was housekeeping.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_465695566~“BEWARE- unrefurbished rooms 2 stars at most”~My experience was terrible. This was purchased as a 4.5 star on Hotwire. This is only a 2 star at best. The only thing going for it is the size. The room smelled, stains on couch, rips in curtains, peeling dirty wallpaper, carpet stained and bunched up, water stains in ceiling. When I refused to stay in the room(we prepaid) they brought me to s refurbished room which was marginally better. Mould in the shower, streaks on the walls, no decor, and very uncomfortable beds. At best, the refurbished are a 3*. Be forewarned. I have stayed on hostels that are way better. Photos are of both rooms.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465624260~“Excellent location”~We stayed here post-cruise and were able to walk to the hotel from the ship which docked at Darling Harbour. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that we had been upgraded from a one-bedroom apartment to a two-bedroom, two bathroom apartment with full kitchen, dining area with balcony, sitting room with balcony, and washer and dryer. The unit had all that we required and was comfortable. We could walk to Circular Quay, the Sydney Opera House and the shopping district as well as the botanical gardens. We were very satisfied with our short stay at The York and would recommend it. Also the front desk staff were friendly and approachable.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_464235505~“Our son's wedding ”~We were very happy with our accommodation at The York Apartments York St Sydney. We had a 2 room apartment and it was very clean, spacious and very well equipped. I especially enjoyed the crystal clean pool. The reception staff were extremely polite, friendly, professional & helpful. We booked an apartment for 2 nights - the night before our sons wedding & the night of.  The position of this hotel is fantastic for anyone wanting to stay in the city. Close to Wynyard train station & Circular Quay, where you can get s train or ferry.  It certainly is worth looking at if you want to stay in the city of Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462581192~“Great Location but needs work”~We had a 1 night stopover here and the location for central Sydney could hardly be better. A short walk from Wyndham station and then an easy walk to the Rocks, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour and midtown Sydney CBD. Good value for money for the location alone. The hotel itself is getting quite dated. It could be so much better with a coat of paint. We got out of the lift on the 9th floor and thought we were in a 2 star hotel. The walls were badly marked, it was poorly lit, the carpet in poor condition etc. Our room was a good size and the bed was comfortable but again the walls were badly marked and the bathroom was in need of renovation. Ai conditioning and WIFI were good.  For the price and location I would stay here again.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_462149651~“Short Stay ”~Didn't know what to expect as it was booked by someone else, we had a one bedroom apartment furnished to a high standard with cooking facilities great location to either work or stay in Sydney, central to the business areas and tourist attractions, this was a departure from our normal places to stay as no food is available but a range of options are very close to this hotel,very clean,service exceptional pool and other facilities are located in the hotel sauna spa and a small gym~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461286271~“Terrific stay”~We phoned the hotel direct and booked a one bedroom apartment for one night, an easy process. On check-in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a deluxe two bedroom apartment, a delightful surprise. Very spacious apartment, comprising two large bedrooms with comfortable king beds, two bathrooms, large living areas, including separate laundry and kitchen and two balconies. We were on the 22 floor with views towards Darling Harbour and looked over the hotel pool. The hotel is located within a five minute walk to Darling Harbour, the Rocks and across the road from train station. Given that the staff said the hotel was at 100% occupancy and it was a Saturday night, there was very little noise. Staff were very welcoming and responsive to our needs and happily stored our bags after check out. Thank you, we will be back!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

They were very clean and well stocked for the appliances to use. The staff were well informed and very friendly. The Appartments were located in the CBD and close to the Wynyard train station. It only took about 20 minutes from the Airport by train and 30 mins by taxi.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_460061255~“Short stay with family”~Great views, very polite and helpful staff and clean but the bed in the master and the single beds let down appartment 2302 could do with an upgrade. apart from that everything else was great and if it wasn't the beds I'd give it 4 stars but because of the older beds I will give it a 2 hopefully next visit they will have been replaced  The better one is apartment 2202 as it had double glazing and all beds were updated and there was glass covering the dining table as well which the other lacked  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458723815~“Great hotel in a great location”~We stayed in York by Swiss for 3 nights at the end of January. The reception staff were really nice and welcoming. Our room was huge with a kitchen, sitting and dining area. There was also a washing machine and tumble dryer in the bathroom room. The hotel is across the road from Wynyard Station which is one stop from Circular Quay. If I return to Sydney and the price is right I would stay there again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_456821818~“great yet again”~We have stayed at the York many , many times so there are no real surprises.We requested a one bedroom apartment similar to the one we had last year and were pleasantly surprised to get exactly what we requested. We were in room 1304 again one of the larger one bedroom apartments facing the church on Jamison and the bridge so the views were good. As always the apartment was clean, well maintained, serviced every day with plenty of cooking utensils. The pool area again is good, small but adequate with a large jacussi and sauna. Never had a problem getting pool towels and we were at the pool most days except for Australia day. Reception staff as usual friendly and efficient, nothing too much trouble. Guess what - we'll be back in March and then we'll be booking for next Australia day.  The new tunnel from Wynyard station to Barangaroo was also a bonus as it give quick acess to new bars and restaurants and also quicker to get to Darling Harbour.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_454793171~“.”~Very clean room, very friendly desk staff. Impressed with our delux studio apartment with the fit out and cupboard contents. Have to give zero for effort on request for a view. Being a celebration getaway and as one of us is claustrophobic the room allocated is very disappointing. We are here until Saturday ( a 3 night stay)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453311641~“Lovely ”~We really enjoyed our stay. Arrival was slow, only one out of three lifts was operating and it took a very long time to get a lift from the car park to reception then to our room on the 27th floor. The view was lovely. We were disappointed that fitting a third person in the room meant a single bed in the living area but we got over it. The apartment was very spacious and we really loved being there. Central spot and enjoyed dinner next door at the Travelodge.  Stela the housekeeper was fantastic. Friendly, yet professional and just great.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453265469~“Depends on the price”~3 or a 4 depending on the price. I had a good price for this trip which made it reasonable, I have seen prices for other dates >$300 and heading to $400 and at those prices, you would question the value. They are very basic apartment rooms but still have what most people would need - doubt though if the balcony is usable. Location is questionable depending on what you want to do - a fair distance from CBD retail but close to Wynyard which gives you access to many locations - the plus for me was its closeness to Barangaroo which give me a chance to explore a "new" area. A good pool was much appreciated in the recent heatwave. Service iq questionable - took 20 minutes to checkin , only 1 person at normal checkin time and there no towels in the pool in late afternoon, minor issues but important if you wish to be a 4 star hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453202922~“Apartment with a view”~Apartment was on the 28th floor. Was so amazing to be able to be amongst the Sydney skyline and still see the harbour each time we looked out. Location was brilliant. Key sites were walkable or in easy reach of public transport. Hotel was clean and had all the facilities we needed. There were 6 of us in the apartment (3 generations) and this was definitely a very good choice for us. Would definitely return.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_452901573~“Outstanding hotel”~We only stayed one nite, but it was very enjoyable and we highly recommend this hotel. We've stayed in other Swiss Hotels (in China) and like those, this one did not disappoint. The room was a suite, very large with laundary room, two baths, kitchen, living room, and bedroom. Exceptionally clean and tastefully decorated with a great view of the city. The bed was comfy and the room quiet! High priorities for us. Although higher priced than most, it was worth it for us. Great walking location to downtown activities and easy access to trains.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_452509391~“Great Location and Amenities”~Loved this hotel - great location, friendly and helpful staff and very comfortable room. We had a studio apartment with a balcony - the studio was quite large and included a kitchen and lounge area. The room and bathroom were very clean. Beds and pillows were comfortable. The pool area looked very inviting! I wish we could have stayed longer in this great location.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_451631274~“3.5 stars?”~Great location, close to train, supermarket, and lots of city attractions. Quite noisy at times during the night. The room was spacious and had good facilities, but needed some maintenance to the squealing sliding door and water hammer in the pipes. The cleaning and maintenance staff were particularly friendly. Good aircon. Spacious bathroom.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~3~nan
review_451617073~“A fantastic place to stay”~My 88 yrs. old mother and myself were book into the hotel from December 12 to December 15, 2016, prior to boarding a cruise. The accommodation was fantastic, a very large lounge come dining room with two bedroom each with a on suit. The rooms were very clean and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. A great place to stay and we have booked in for December 2017 prior to and returning from another cruise. Can we please have the same rooms.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449531437~“Great location but the room looked tired.”~We had four nights here and booked based upon its location in between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour. We had a one bedroom apartment on floor 8 overlooking an old church which was nice. The room was spacious and came with a washing machine in the batroom. The standard of decor was poor with marks on the carpet and chips out of the walls. - it was just a bit scruffy. Kitchen facilities all worked and there was plenty of crockery and cutlery. Generally speaking the staff were good and were able to help with directions to a supermarket or a bottle shop etc. The thing that sold us though was its great location in Sydney. Another big benefit is that it is only 100 metres from Wynyard Station which is a stop from Sydney International airport.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_449444749~“Mixed bag”~The apartments are really well located and very spacious. We were happy with our 8 night stay overall but felt some improvements could easily be made to lift this establishment into the 4 star bracket. The price we paid for the space, comfort and location was fair and the hotel provided ample towels, bedding, coffee supplies throughout our stay. Our bed was comfortable and our high floor apartment was quiet and had good aircon.  So to improve things here are my suggestions. Fill cracks and holes in walls and doors and repaint. Replace grubby carpets.  Look at improving the cook ware in the kitchen so people have what they need to self cater if they want to. Don't fill the fridge with mini bar food and drink unless it's requested. Throughly clean your toilets, they were not at all clean when you looked carefully at them.  Clean the greasy cooker hood in the kitchen. Remove cobwebs from outside balconies. Train front desk staff to be able to answer simple questions regarding check in and getting about Sydney.  Might return or might try somewhere else next time. Undecided.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_444219523~“Great location”~Although apartments are a bit dated, would definitely recommend the York apartments. Location is ideal- close to The Rocks, Circular Quay, Opera House, bridge etc. Units are clean, spacious and very good for families.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443818848~“Girls Weekend”~Stayed in the 3 bedroom apartment on the 28th floor and were very impressed with the views. Our apartment was clean and spacious. It did smell of smoke a bit - assuming last occupants let smoke whaft inside from balconies. Location really is so central to everything you need - restaurants, shops, tourist destinations... Jeannette from the front desk deserves special mention - she was so helpful and enthusiastic, flagging down taxis for us, helping with bag storage etc.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442464904~“Disappointed”~I was wondering if I was in the same hotel as the previous reviews, perhaps it was just my room. There were broken tiles in the entry of my room, with sharp edges that could easily cut your foot if you were bare foot. The bathroom light would not turn off and the light switch was broken, the washing machine/dryer looked like it had just come from a garage sale with dents in it. There was so much dust in the bathroom I didn't look as though it had ever been dusted clean. The bed was so hard and the bed construction was flimsy. The bed squeaked every time you rolled over. The hall way from the lifts looked like you were walking through a youth hostel. The plus things were location near to circular quay, the rocks and Wynyard station. The room was large and working areas were adequate. The front desk staff were helpful.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442284041~“Great location & Amenities ”~We stayed here as a group of four for five nights. The location is second to none, right next to Wynard station, and a five minute walk to both Circular Quay and Darling Harbour. We also had a lovely view from our 18th floor room.  The pool area is great and also includes a sauna and hot. Great to spend a morning here chilling out and escaping the heat.  Room was clean and serviced daily and the staff at reception were always helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442235537~“Comfortable”~We had a one bedroom apartment on the 8th floor, with a balcony . The apartment was adequate and spacious . The bedroom had air conditioning and Tv. The bed and pillows a little on the hard side. Nice big bathroom with washing machine and dryer and bathtub. We used the car park for The York, good idea to ring and get directions for the car park before arriving, being Sydney there is No Stopping signs everywhere. My negative is the street noise, on the 8th floor facing York Street we could hear all the noises below in the streets into the early hours of the morning, sometimes I thought we had a window open it was loud.~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_442109811~“Great Room Great Location”~We rented (hired) 2 bedroom suite for a week. The room was out of this world. Lots of space, excellent beds, wonder views, and close to everything. It is within walking distance of opera, harbor cruises, and anything you could want to eat.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442102853~“Long weekend”~We stayed three nights. Had a room on the 19th floor small balcony large seperate bedroom, large kitchen and large bathroom.

And they would have received an overall rating of 4/5.The shower, pool area and location made this an enjoyable stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440845199~“Top place to stay”~We stayed for a week in a one bedroom apartment at The York and was very impressed. Friendly and helpful staff and a well appointed and clean apartment. The location is fantastic being so close to the city centre and Circular Quay. We spent a lot of time on the harbour because of the short walk to the quay. Also very close to great pubs & restaurants and a particularly good food hall. Quite a bit of street noise given it was so close to the main road exit from Sydney Harbour bridge but I expect most hotels in Sydney CBD have this problem. Decor was great apart from the scary clown painting hung in the bedroom. Cost is on the higher side but I would highly recommend this as a great place to stay in Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440749883~“Stepping Back into the 70's...”~This hotel is quite old and dowdy. It is in need of a makeover. The yellow bathroom was straight out of the 70's and the room setup was awkward at best. There is also no room service which when travelling on business, is not ideal when you get back to your room at 9.30pm The reception staff were pleasant and the balcony was a welcome addition on what was overall, an average stay.~2~nan~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_440508112~“Stunning apartment”~Four of us stayed for a three day weekend ... I have to say we were all impressed with how nice the two bed/two bath apartment was. We were on the 6th floor with harbour glimpses from the enormous balcony ... even better. I booked a few months in advance direct with the hotel and it paid off in a good rate and a top room. Living area was large with a dining area and basically equiped kitchen. Main bedroom had a king bed, beautifully fitted with a large bathroom inc separate bath and shower. Second bedroom was smallish with it's own smaller bathroom ... laundry included washer and dryer. Location is great, in the business are so quiet in the streets on Saturday and Sunday. I recommend this hotel highly and would have no problem staying here again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_440120501~“Location, facilities and service - all great.”~Best location right near Wynyard Station with access to the airports. Walking distance to the Opera House and Circular Quay.

review_439130460~“Well located and comfortable”~The York is in the prime location for the CBD and the Rocks. Parking is a bit expensive compared to other hotels in this area but is easy to access. Most attractions are a short stroll away and Wynyard station is just a two minute walk. We found the desk service to be excellent, personable and professional. The apartment we had was a two bedroom deluxe with single bathroom on the 17th floor. The apartment was clean, spacious and in fairly good condition but showed a little age with markings on walls, a broken balcony table and with tired bathroom tiles etc but everything expected was there and worked. A nice little kitchen with updated appliances was available for those that choose to eat in. The apartment was serviced well during our stay. Only issue we found was the beds. Reasonably comfortable but all 3 in this apartment were on low wood bases that squeaked and rattled badly whenever someone moved. Perhaps an update of the beds is on the cards. The air con and furnishings were fine and a good TV was provided in the living room and main bedroom. The shower was excellent. Great pressure and temp regulation. This hotel, whilst in a prominent position between the CBD and the Rocks is fairly quiet traffic wise at least on weekends. We were just unfortunate that city council decided to use the quiet weekend to jack hammer up the gutter outside the hotel at 7am on Saturday morning. No fault of the York of course. The hotel co uses the Citrus Grove restaurant in the next door Travelodge for breakfast. We used the buffet and although only $20 each which is cheap compared to most, the quality was very average. Give it a miss and try a nice Cafe down in the Rocks. We stayed at The York several years ago and found it still to be a good choice for family accommodation but I probably wouldn't bother as a couple. We give the TA rating as "very good" but it probably sits just a little bit lower at "good" if it was an option. Prices can be on the expensive side here as with most of Sydney these days.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_438468532~“Back to the 50's”~After checking into the Junior suite I felt like a well to do squatter checking in sometime in the the 1950s The hotel staff are efficient, friendly and professional and the hotel is centrally located. However the rooms are very dated although functional and spacious but needed a major make over about 10 years ago, the carpets in the hallways are in a very poor condition and are only just in the rooms.  One feels somewhat deceived at the price charged for the room given it very dated appearance.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan

review_433814350~“Very comfortable”~We stayed in a Deluxe Studio Suite on the 13th floor which was fully self-contained & very roomy. A well set out kitchen, dining area & lounge with the bed behind a part wall with plenty of room & robes for use in the full-size wardrobe.The bed was extremely comfortable & there was everything you would need. It's a fabulous location not far from The Rocks & Circular Quay & good transport options. Staff were friendly & helpful. The only negative was the curtains wouldn't fully close which allowed some light to come in at night which was a bit annoying.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

review_433458334~“Great Accommodation”~We stayed a couple of nights before a cruise and were upgraded from a Deluxe Suite to a one bedroom apartment. This apartment was well set out and very comfortable. The view from our room was great but the only downside was the noise factor even though we were on the 12th floor. Our room was overlooking the highway, otherwise everything was great. The location was good as were were close to the Rocks area and close to the centre of the city.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_433360588~“Good position, close to transport and city”~We chose this hotel for a one night stay, as it is close to Wynyard train station, ( train from the airport ) and a short walk to the Opera House. The reception was quick and efficient, at noon our room was ready. The room on the tenth floor was a one bedroom apartment, with a full kitchen and separate bedroom, with a balcony, and a view up York Street to the harbour bridge.  I had read reviews here about the loud street noise, but we heard none of that, just the hum of the city. The building was formally the Holiday Inn. Overall a pleasant stay, non eventfull, with a comfortable bed. What more could one want.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_432780018~“Excellent accommodation ”~We traveled to Sydney with friends for a long weekend prior to going on a cruise. We had a two bedroom/2 bathroom apartment on 18th floor with view of the harbour (to the left of the bridge). The apartment was excellent, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The beds very comfortable, bathroom spacious, lounge/dining more than adequate. Cannot fault the property. Good location, a 10/15 minute walk to the rocks. Very good Chinese and Japanese restaurant on the ground floor. Give it a try, shouldn't disappoint.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432038218~“Prime position”~As two couples we took a two-bedroom, two bathroom apartment which suited our needs perfectly. Spacious, comfortable and well equipped we were well positioned for the many CBD shops and restaurants, a short walk to Circular Quay and the Rocks, the Wynyard station close by. Our apartment on the 18th floor had an excellent view. The apartment was serviced daily with fresh sheets and towels. The York is not cheap but no accommodation is in central Sydney and the just over $450 per night we paid, when split between two couples, was as good as you can get in the city for the standard offered. Guests should be aware that the hotel adds 2.5% to the bill when paying with a credit card which is quite unreasonable in this day and age, much more than it costs a hotel to process.  In an endeavour to reduce the surcharge we paid partly by debit card which attracts no surcharge but later found that the full amount had been charged to the credit card including the surcharge. On contacting the hotel they claimed the $1,000 debit card payment had not gone through but fortunately we were able to provide documentary evidence that the funds had been sent to their account; after some days the hotel accepted that the $1,000 had been received and arranged an appropriate refund. In fairness the hotel staff involved handled the dispute well but the time taken on making telephone calls and sending emails left a poor impression. The York aparthotel would certainly be our choice when visiting Sydney but next time I'd take a wad of cash and make sure I got a written receipt.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan

review_430735034~“Very comfortable”~A group of four of us stayed here for one night in a two bedroom apartment.  The apartment was very large, clean with modern bathrooms. Excellent location walking distance to Sydney Harbour and the rocks as well as many restaurants.  The only drawer back would be some traffic noise as the apartment that we stayed in was very close to a car overpass however this did not disrupt our sleep it was only while outside on the balcony.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_428826008~“Great CBD location and helpful staff”~We booked a 1 Bedroom Deluxe suite. This is one of the refurbished rooms and I would definitely recommend doing that because the hotel is a little older. The room was very comfortably furnished and nice and spacious. There was a TV in the lounge and one in the bedroom, plus a DVD player in the lounge also. The staff were great - always very helpful. We were on the 21st floor and the traffic noise really didn't bother me at all as long as the balcony door was closed. We didn't use the balcony much at all because it was too noisy on weekdays - to be expected in the city centre. The best thing about it was the great location. A block from the Wynyard station, a block from the start of The Rocks and a very manageable walk to Darling Harbour.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_428347309~“Perfect if you get the right view”~After a mix up with the room we were upgraded to a twin bedroom suite at no extra charge. Staff were very apologetic and we were much happier for the change with more room and a great balcony view. Reception of course is 24 hours and entry to the foyer via swipe access after 10.30pm.   Some observations; the sound proofing in the Hotel was not the best at least in our apartment with noise from next door, the lift and to a much lesser extent the traffic outside. The Hotel spa was awesome bubbling away for 15minutes once the button was pressed and pool quite deep at 2m but small in length. The gym is poky with six pieces of equipment but as I learned in Sydney you make do with the space you have. Staff were helpful. I lost my access card and it was cancelled and replaced without charge. Luggage can be stored in a room next to reception after checking out which is really handy.   The York’s location has a lot going for it with many attractions within walking distance; Sydney Harbour Bridge 700m away, Circular Quay wharfs 750m, Sydney Opera House 1.4 km, Sydney Tower eye (also known as Center Point) 1 km and Darling Harbour 1.1 km. Restaurants are close by and a Coles Supermarket is 600m away. Sydney Airport to The York is 12.6 km and costs about $40 - $50 by taxi one way.   Overall The York is a good choice if you’re staying in the area.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_426731772~“Noisy!”~The staff at the front desk from check-in to departure were brilliant couldn't have asked for more. We had a two bedroom apartment on the 8th floor (I think). The apartment was clean and average for a city and had all the amenities you require which was great. The location of the apartment was good for walking around Sydney to the many restaurants and shopping. However the noise from the street below was very loud when we were in the apartment. The apartment did not have double glazing and the continuous honking from cars, especially early in the morning, got us annoyed and somewhat spoilt it for us.~4~4~nan~1~nan~nan~5~nan
review_426064631~“Pre Cruise Stay”~Stayed for 3 nights prior to a cruise. Not much to say as the staff and hotel were just so easy, A great location with Wynyard Train Station only 150m away, so getting around Sydney is a breeze. The apartment has full cooking and washing facilities. Noted is the standard of the cutlery and dishes is very good certainly way above the norm of mixed and chipped sets. Although the Rooms furniture and fittings are getting a bit long in the tooth, everything was very clean and well maintained. Recommended~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_420722866~“Ideal hotel on the rocks”~We stayed 5 nights in a studio apartment. Very spacious with an emperor size bed, huge leather settee, lovely fitted kitchen including dishwasher, and bathroom with separate bath and shower. There was also a washer/dryer. The view from our 12th floor balcony was amazing. The staff were very helpful. The hotel is central for both darling harbour and circular quay. Big problem- the fridge in the kitchen area kept me awake with its buzzing. If you are a light sleeper tale some earplugs.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_419029316~“Great Choice”~This is the second time I have stayed here and both times was in an unrefurbished studio. While the hallways are a bit "grim" the actual apartments are great. The carpets curtains etc are a bit past there best, but the apartments are clean, well equipped and well serviced. There is a washer,dryer, full sized oven and fridge-freezer, with more than enough cutlery and crockery. There is also a balcony, which although there is no view as such, it is a real treat in a city centre. The York is in a great spot - next to Wynyard and 10 minutes walk to Circular Quay. It's a superb location and feels very safe even late at night. There is some street/traffic noise but nothing to keep you awake and would be expected in a city centre. I did not hear noise from any other guests.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_418258241~“Great apartment facilities but could do with some renovations”~I stayed here only for one night during a brief weekend trip. Location: It is very close to Wynyard station (about 2 minute walk) so it is convenient on the airport train line. The front entrance is actually on Jamison Street rather than York Street. It was an easy walk to The Rocks (for the Sunday markets and the chocolate festival) and down to Circular Quay and places to eat. Amenities: The fitness centre has cardio equipment but no free weights (disappointing) and there wasn't a huge amount of space on the floor (or a mat) to do any ab work. The outdoor pool and spa looked great - it was nice to have beautiful views of Sydney while enjoying some fresh air. There is free wifi throughout. Hotel: They have a relatively early checkout time of 10.30am. They have a credit card surcharge, and I was also charged a resort fee of $50 on arrival (refundable after the stay if you don't use any of the minibar and other purchasable items). Perhaps I didn't read the T&C of my booking, but I was not aware of the resort fee. Check-in is 1.30pm and my room wasn't ready prior so they were able to store my luggage. Apartment: Very large studio apartment! There was a corridor inside the room leading to the main living area. The corridor has a cupboard with a safe and plenty of shelves for storage. The bathroom contained a washing machine and dryer (you can purchase washing powder), a full BATH as well as a shower! There were also plenty of cupboards for toiletries. The kitchen was fully functional (stove top, microwave, kettle, fridge, cutlery and crockery etc) although I didn't really make use of it. There were also items for purchase (drinks, snacks, brekkie meal in the fridge). There was also a work desk and a sound system on top of a chest of drawers with yet more storage! Curiously the dining table only had 3 chairs. There was also a sofa and coffee table, but the TV faced the dining table and not the sofa. My room also had a balcony (with 2 chairs and a table) with great city skyline views including the Centrepoint tower. The bed was large and comfortable and there was a huge wardrobe with full-length mirrors (see photo). The room was very functional and would be great for a long stay even if I was only there for one night … but the room I stayed in was in serious need of refurbishment – lots of carpet stains, carpet lifting off at the edges eg. entry to bathroom (I tripped over it), the shower door partly broken off track, the kitchen sink handle came off when turning on the water, there was caked sediment in shower door corner etc.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_416355920~“Nice hotel, but many others to choose from.”~Despite being advised we could be given a north facing room looking towards the harbour, we ended up in a room with a view of neighbouring office blocks to the west. The compensatory upgrade to a 2 bedroom apartment was wasted for 2 people anyway. Other than that, the hotel is clean, relatively quiet with efficient staff. The coffee shop over the road proved to be excellent for breakfast every morning, but it's a bit of a walk to restaurants for dinner.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan

review_426064631~“Pre Cruise Stay”~Stayed for 3 nights prior to a cruise. Not much to say as the staff and hotel were just so easy, A great location with Wynyard Train Station only 150m away, so getting around Sydney is a breeze. The apartment has full cooking and washing facilities. Noted is the standard of the cutlery and dishes is very good certainly way above the norm of mixed and chipped sets. Although the Rooms furniture and fittings are getting a bit long in the tooth, everything was very clean and well maintained. Recommended~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_422315567~“Be careful”~Overall a pleasant hotel in a good location with friendly staff. However depending on the type of booking they will immediately take the full amount from your credit card and charge 2.5% on top of the advertised price.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
