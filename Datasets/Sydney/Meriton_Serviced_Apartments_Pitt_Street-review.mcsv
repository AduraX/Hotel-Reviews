review_478664042~“Nice and central”~Friendly staff efficient and helpful - close to Town Hall station and so close to the QVB and Sydney icons Perfect for our 6 overseas guests. 3 Balconies perfect to sit and observe the city...... simple modern reflection~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478386874~“Good location”~Very handy position. We would have no hesitation using this place again only two minor challenges one being an elevator not working and the other being the fact that the gym and the pool are not on the same level.  Staff friendly and very accommodating.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478366531~“Checked out earlier”~I wasn't going to write this review until I got an email asking me to review the hotel and mentioned "superior furnishings" as it appears that management is in denial about the quality of their hotel. The rooms are nothing like pictured, the hotel promotes them as modern but they are anything but modern. First room I was checked into was right next to the construction site and was unbearably loud, the lovely customer service lady moved me straight away to a quiet room. However as soon as I got in I also regretted making that booking as the room was outdated, I wasn't keen on using the appliances as they looked old and dirty, there was dust in the room and hair on the bed so I had my doubts about the room being properly cleaned between each guest. The tissue box was also empty and tossed into the bathroom sink. I found the room too depressing to stay in and ended up arranging a booking elsewhere for the rest of the week as I fly into Sydney each week for work. I ended up checking into the Hyatt for the same price I was paying at Meriton and moved into a much nicer and modern room, one would think such prices reflect quality however this was not the case here. It's more suitable for budget accomodation.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477882290~“Meriton Pitt St studio - nothing like the photos”~Booked a stay in a studio at Meriton Pitt St. On the Meriton site under 'rooms' there are 3 photos shown for the 'studio suite'. Nice pictures. But, if you click on the 'download floorplan' in the same section, you will read "Classic studio ... floor plan depicts the most typical and common layout for this apartment type" and you will see this floor plan is not the same as the photos. In reality, the studio was disappointing - the fit out was tired, the kitchen an arms length from the bed, the bathroom the smallest we've seen. We cancelled our nights and went elsewhere. This room is not awful but it's definitely not 'luxury' ... disappointed.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan~nan
review_477671231~“Perfect location, room space was okay, but the room was only cleaned once or probably only twice a week.”~The location was in the central of CBD Sydney. The room space was okay, the kitchen had enough utensils, not enough towels though. They have to improve on their front desk staff work attitude though. I reserved a shuttle to the airport from the hotel 4'or 5 days before my scheduled departure but on the day of my departure itself around 9:30am, the front desk staff (an Asian lady and another blond haired lady named Pietra) were disinterested with the my inquiry. We came back around 11:40am because our scheduled pick up was 12pm. By 12:10pm, the reserved shuttle still wasn't there so I approached Ms. Pietra whether the van outside was our ride. She told me to ask the driver myself. I told her up front that that was her job since they were hotel front desk staff. She just stood there so I had to go out myself and ask. After 4 minutes or so, Ms. Pietra rushed out and hailed a cab. I don't know if they front desk who I reserved with even reserved the shuttle we requested.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477583661~“Holiday Trip to Sydney”~The apartment hotel is ideally located, walking distance to city sights, public transport and the Main Streets. The staff are friendly, helpful and professional. The bedrooms, kitchen and living area is spacious and clean. The pool, sauna and spa area is typical; it is a pity they do not make use of the views eg an infinity pool. The gym uses the views with a visage from the running machines. The gym is spacious but provides minimal equipment, therefore they should include extra equipment eg a chin up bar, punching bag, skipping ropes etc.....it is just a bit bare for your average "gym goer". This hotel was built in 2004...as stated the rooms are well maintained, however the bathrooms require machine cleaning - the tile grout ages the bathroom, having just cleaned my bathrooms - it makes a difference. The bathroom and kitchen hot water tended to disappear after 10pm - this was unusual (It should be noted that I did not report this to the hotel as it did not bother me and it may be an easy fix). Other small issues that I reported such as acquiring a clothes airer were quickly solved by the staff and the front doorman was always helpful with directions and greeted us politely upon entry. I would be happy to return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477565662~“Great location, great rooms”~Rooms were clean, big and well stocked with kitchen items etc. Location is fantastic. Parking was expensive but available. All the staff were super helpful. We would definately stay there again! Thanks Meriton!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477354442~“Best weekend”~The service was outstanding.there is nothing I wasn't happy with at all.

review_477340662~“Great Front Office staff, great stay”~Could not have asked for a better stay in the Sydney CBD. Great property, close to Town Hall Station, helpful front office staff, housekeeping staff is the only shortcoming here; they never got the room totally right at all in 7 days. Surprising~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477335165~“external noise was to much couldn't sleep”~the apartment was good but could do with some minor maintenance or refurbishment, The external windows and doors need double glazing as the noise from the streets below was excessive, we were on the 44th floor and it was so loud I couldn't sleep without wearing ear plugs. Staff were helpful. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477038083~“Modern luxury”~Modern and luxurious- totally in love with the bed sooo comfortable. Great location in the city so close to main attractions. Parking available isnt on the same street so you just need to clarify with staff but elevator will take you to the lobby. We are definitely coming back again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477015857~“Great location, great service, lacking in some areas”~I had a great 3 night stay at this location. Was met be friendly and very helpful staff, and was an east check in. Convenient to get to many sites and transport hubs. The room was not as modern as I would have hoped for the price paid, and I the limit on wifi was something to be desired... At the end of the day, it was a great stay and would definitely return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476937770~“Sydney Weekend”~Great accommodation, as always with Meriton. we weren't aware of the building demolition across the road, not that Meriton have much control over that. When I did ask about the possibility of a room at the rear, to reduce noise. My request was met with the usual Meriton - sure no problems. Great location in centre of town. First time to this property.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476735537~“Great location in Sydney CBD”~A great hotel in the heart of Sydney which is great when you don't want to hire a car to get around the city. We had a 2 bedroom suit for the four of us and it was worth the extra bit of money for 4 nights as we had the extra space.  The room was very clean and modern with plenty of room for 4 people. The main bathroom was a good size, however the ensuite was a bit small, especially as the have a large basin as you walk in. Also the other issue we found with the ensuite bathroom was that the shower leaked into the bathroom so be careful if you put clothes on the floor. The pool was great for a swim after a long day in Sydney and the kids loved it as it was a good size for several people.  Only a couple of issues that we found. Firstly if you are unlucky you need to wait for lifts for what felt a long time if you want to go between levels. Also there is a large amount of construction going on in Sydney and you will put up with a large amount of construction noise which starts around 7:30 till 5:30 each day. Not the hotels faul, but offputting never the less.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_476706350~“Beautiful couples city getaway”~Had an overall great stay. Excellent city location. Received a free upgrade as soon as we checked in. The room was very big. Bed and pillows were AMAZING! So comfortable. Only negative was the shower head, it kept flinging upwards when on full power, quite annoying. And also no pen :(~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476681556~“Family Friendly hotel at a great location”~My family of 15 stayed at Meriton on Pitt for Easter week. Hotel is in a central location, clean, with excellent service staff. Being right beside the train station meant we can get almost anywhere easily, or just walk towards the shopping district, and tourist spots anytime. Overall, great experience and will definitely stay there again even for business trips.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476154108~“Meriton Pitt Street”~Very comfortable stay in Meriton Apartments Pitt Street Sydney. Efficient, excellent and friendly service from Luke in Reception. Great location in the centre of Sydney. Appreciated the daily service of the Apartment.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475966540~“Great alternative to Hotels”~We stayed in a 2-bedroom unit for 3 nights and in a 3-bedroom unit for 2 nights. From the get go, I was happy with the service we received at reception. The staff was quite friendly and helpful, whether it was in providing directions, recommendations, or printing out documents. The unit was clean and airy. The bedrooms were comfortable. The kitchen was complete with all the possible items you would need for a great vacation. They had a microwave, a convection oven, stove, diswasher, washer dryer, coffee machine, electric pot, etc.. The bathrooms also had your typical amenities of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. If there was something you need which was not in the room, you can always ask reception. It was perfect for us as we were able to prepare meals when we wanted it. It also allowed us to entertain friends which wasn't possible before in a typical hotel room.  Meriton PItt also has a 24-hour gym and an indoor pool! The serviced apartment was also gracious enough to hold our luggage when we left for Melbourne for a few days and returned to the Meriton by the end of the week. Location was also wonderful as both Darling Harbor and Circular Quay were only a few kilometers away and was quite accessible on foot.  I highly recommend this place for group travellers and families! I can't say enough good things about the property.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_475951834~“So convenient”~A great location at the heart of the CBD and close to Town Hall rail station, many bus routes and Hyde Park. Most of the city is within reasonable walking distance. Beautiful apartments with the best of everything you will need. Lots of bars, restaurants and takeaways in the neighbourhood and a big Woolworths supermarket underneath, so all options are available. Highly recommended. Watch out for the parking charges though!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475406255~“girls weekend”~My 4 daughters and I stayed from Thursday to Monday for a long shopping weekend. We booked the 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment on the 44th floor but unfortunately builders were demolishing an adjacent high rise building. The noise of the jackhammer, during the day and for a short time at 4:30 am !!...forced us to ask to be moved. We spoke with Luke Kingston, the duty manager, and he was most helpful. He moved us to another apartment on the other side of the building on the 41st floor. The staff continued to followup with regular phone calls to check that we were happy.........which we were.  all in all a very good experience and would definitely stay there again.... the shopping was great too!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475403864~“Most Comfortable Family Stay”~Booked Meriton Pitt Street in advance and check in was a breeze. They were so gracious to keep our luggages before check in and after check out (late flight out). Stayed in the 48th floor with 3 bedrooms. Rooms are clean and spacious. All our needs for extra amenities were met in a zippy manner (we didn't have to worry if they will come!).  Facilities and utilities we're working as expected. It's the most worry-free stay we've had for a big family group with kids! ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Great pool and sauna area the pool was so warm at all times it was great! The Foxtel had sport which was all we needed so happy with that also!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475240505~“Great location”~Really nice place to stay that is central to everything in Sydney. Good facilities, good pool, spa and sauna. Even has room service if you need it. Plenty of places to eat nearby. Building site opposite could be a problem for holidays and kids as noise starts at 7am sharp.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475166656~“You would be foolish to stay anywhere else”~We could not have chosen a better place to stay. The room was great and reasonably priced. It was clean and well kept. The location was perfect for walking around, if you don't mind walking, or great forgetting a bus. The Hop-On Hop-Off bus picks up around the corner. The staff is wonderful. They are very friendly, courteous, and bent over backwards to help us and make our stay all that we expected it to be. I would definitely recommend this to friends and I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474818572~“A wonderful week”~From the time of our booking, check in, during our entire stay and then check out everything was spot on. Reception was so very friendly and accommodating to anything we enquired about. The room was clean and spacious which made it easy for manoeuvring a wheelchair around. We will be back at this Meriton Apartment complex when we next visit Sydney. Thank you so very much for a wonderful week.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474785076~“Meriton Serviced Apartments”~We thought, like other people, the position was fantastic, close to trains , China Town, everything. There was some noise from development across the street but we were out all day so what's there to complain about? The staff could not do enough for us, we had a great experience, than k you. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474550535~“WONDERFUL”~THE STAFF SPOILED US ROTTEN WITH CHOCOLATES AND FLOWERS, we knew they would do their best for us with the medical issues we had. Very trustful and caring, knowing we were "in their hands" made the difference.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474506103~“Definitely an apartment...”~Walking into our room on Friday night we were quite set back....our bed was in the kitchen. Definitely not the place to go if you want a luxury getaway. Our room looked nothing like the pictures online which was a bit of a let down when you are paying quite a bit per night. In saying that, the location is great and walking distance to all of the cities attractions, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very spacious with all the amenities of a serviced apartment. Highly recommend for a group of friends or family needing the amenities. If you're a couple looking for a cosy get away, splurge the extra bucks and head up the road to the Hilton or Westin. Also, try and request a room away from the construction!!! 7am wake up not what you want on a Saturday morning.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474270773~“Big 2 bedroom apartment ”~Great apartment- large, 2 bathrooms. Perfect for our family of 4 for an overnight getaway. The pool and spa was happily enjoyed by the children. The apartments are very well located on Pitt st and really close to Town Hall station, Pitt St mall and the QVB. Parking is off Bathurst St and easy to find. Check in service was easy and friendly. All round - a great experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473429643~“Great staff, Location Great”~Enjoyed our stay. Staff were all friendly and professional. Balcony very small in the one bedroom apartments, so don't expect to be able to sit out on them and enjoy the view. Standing room only. Kitchen has every thing you need. Although only pod coffee available, no instant. Plenty of tea and sugar, WiFi very fast. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473287030~“Excellent room but Housekeeping woes:(”~My hubby & I stayed 2 nights; We could have easily given u 5 stars had it not been for our "Unretrieved personal items" a 2L bottle newly opened Body Wash (Korean-made) the best in the world after having tried all kinds, we stuck to this for its premium quality. Together was a Lactacyd regular bottle (left in shower room section) & some chips left in the pantry. We reported immediately but were informed they were gone, that was not honest nor efficient of them (housekeeping staff) as things as huge as a 2L bottle certainly a hotel guest would come back to. We just moved to an Airbnb since we're staying 3 mos in Sydney. Therefore, we called Meriton immediately but were told they were gone. Pretty disappointing and lesson learned; never hav a big 'argument' before checking out; u mess up in packing, forgetting things. We've been staying in many 5-star hotels and had never left anything behind. Oh geezzz no proper soap wash these next several weeks...:( sad & sad~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473279480~“Great position”~Four of us stayed in a two bedroomed apartment. The apartment was very nice with two bathrooms, laundry, lounge and kitchen facilities with oven, microwave etc. Each bedroom also had a television as well as the one in the lounge area. The staff were great with information. Not sure if they thought we had complained but did have four staff members knock on our door asking if we were happy. We had no complaints apart from the noise of the demolition next door - fortunately we were then sat and Sun with only Monday being noisy. Free WIFI was good. Our only complaint is the surcharge on using credit cards. This seems very unfair and a bit of a ripoff.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan

review_472780696~“Not so good at first”~1 bedroom apartment a little worn. Beds not made to requested twin arrangement.Then when corrected King size bedding placed on one of the single beds. Toaster not functioning--replaced quickly. On first morning woke up by jack hammers from construction site next door--very noisy. As we were staying another 3 nights, we requested a reduction in price, with ear muffs provided, or a room change. We moved room to a higher level 2 bed apartment on other side of building, and apart from repacking clothes and food, the new apartment was both spacious and good. From then on the holiday became enjoyable. We must than the the staff who were both polite and courteous at all times.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan

review_471175660~“Meriton Serviced apartments”~We stayed two nights and liked the room. Our view was construction of a building next door, but Sydney is a growing city. We were not sure what a "serviced apartment" was, but had to call for them to reservice our supply of coffee and reset our air conditioner, since it was not cooling. They accomplished these items very quickly. We did enjoy being in the heart of the city so we could walk to all the great attractions, which we did and thoroughly loved!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470958752~“An interesting stay”~These serviced apartments are part of a commercial complex and use a separate set of lifts - not pointed out on arrival. Some paperwork is handed to you on registration - it is not emphasized to read this paperwork - the lobby/street level is lift level 11 and the room card has to be used to operate the lift. I saw lots of confusion at the lifts Also when I got to my room eventually there was already an occupant so I had to go back down. I was told I was given a better room but I don't believe I did- and they are demolishing the building next door anyway. I suspect this error occurs frequently and they gave me 9 Ferrero Rocher chocolates and reception kept phoning me to apologize - I would have much preferred they got the job right in the first place. After all they did email me a few days beforehand to check I was arriving and I did email back politely to confirm - and I still got a room allocated to someone else~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Perfect location - walking distance to train station, QVB, Pitt st mall, Woolworths,lots of restaurants and shops nearby. Rooms clean & spacious, good to be able to wash, dry and iron clothes, detergent supplied. Saved by cooking our breakfast in well equipped kitchen. Comfortable bed.

Additionally there is a big construction site next door at the moment, so you will not be able to sleep after 9am! I had the one bedroom Appartement which is big and partly renovated.

From the harbour it is all uphill so no good if you are not fit. We did have a lot of rain which affected our apartments but the hotel manager was first class and had us moved to an upgrade.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

There was no hair straightener there like asked And the cleaner (when I had to call her to come at the end of the day) didn't even change the dirty sheets, and did the bed up horribly..

Unfortunately, we were woken up at 7am after a late night due to construction very close to the hotel. Hotel might benefit from informing people that construction is occurring nearby Otherwise, no complaints and we will stay again in future.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469025870~“Pitt very busy”~Clean as always. Rooms in this Meriton seem tight and dated A bit depressing. Staff lovely but not good follow through with a change of pillow request.

It had everything you needed - fully equipped kitchen, including coffee maker and well stocked coffee pods, milk and tea and even a laundry room, complete with washing detergent! A bonus was the balcony (41st floor!) with a great city view. The reception staff were very attentive and helpful. Even though in the city, you felt very safe - Good Security A great central location, with good access to cabs. Would definitely book again if we return to Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468804460~“LIMITED Serviced Apartment, Poor house keeping”~I reserved with full price for 12 nights but only received limited services. They didn't clean the room every day. They would remove the rubbish in toilet but not the kitchen some days. On a day they only took the rubbish from toilet and left the bag on floor in toilet, what kind of service it is!! On another day, I was rushing back to take sth, there were over 4-5 cleaners in my room, one of them was sitting on sofa. I was shocked of what they are doing here but really no time to investigate it. even if after so many of them "working" in my room, on that night when i back, I didn't see the room was cleaned probably like the first day I CHECK-IN. They didnt clean the floor every day but there is only a long broom but without shovel, and no mop, how can I clean the floor myself? I asked the house keeper, she told me they only clean the floor around every 3-4 days, and clean other things of the room every few days. Gosh! And they didn't wash all dishes even thats the day they supposed to provide dish washing services (they didn't wash dishes every day). The house keepers failed to identified what should be kept for guest, I brought my own toilet roll and hang in the rack, I could not believe they would took it away. They also trash my own brand new spongy for dish washing for few times. There is a balcony in our room but it is very very very dusty, not to say staying there for fresh air, I don't even wanna have a look on it. It's not my 1st time staying in serviced apartment in Sydney and other countries, Meriton does piss me off, I definitely won't come back for sure.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468724071~“AWESOME”~I absolutely love this place! I stayed there in May 2015 and I got a really nice city view from my bedroom! It was like my dream apartment really. Close to everywhere in the city you want to go and I will definitely stay there again.  I booked this place because it was close to my graduation ceremony. It was perfect because I need like a big apartment for my parents and I - so we can call the makeup artist to come and do our make up. The room light was perfect.  We stayed at 2 Bedroom Apartment with 1 Ensuite. I love that room!  There's one time where I just got my first asthma attack - but I didn't know it was the attack until then but it was at 2AM - I asked the receptionist if they have salt so I can vapor my lungs from the hot salt water- the staff gave me loads of salt pack that they can find to make sure I'm okay.  The room also have heater inside - which is good when you got the attack - you don't want any cold temperature.  I think I found my favorite place in Sydney to go stay with.  PS: Their bathroom amenities is really good for your hair and skin. It was by Peter Morrisey. Room Tip: Ask for room with a view. You'll thank me later ! :)~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468390003~“Great location, roomy studio”~I stayed here for work with a couple of extra nights to relax. I booked a studio which was on the 25th floor. It was a bit noisy due to the construction in George St but that isn't the hotel's fault and I'm not sure how long that will last but if you like a bit of a sleep in on a weekday, I wouldn't suggest staying there for now. The hotel was every welcoming on arrival and the person at reception who checked me I answered all of my questions. I wish I had her name as she was great. The studio was roomy and I liked the kitchen facilities. There wasn't a bath in my apartment but that was fine. Perfect area as it is near Town Hall station, not too far to walk to circular quay if you don't mind a walk and great for shopping. I would stay here again and recommend to others. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468225624~“Great accomodation for long stay”~I stayed there for work for three weeks. I was lucky to be placed in a two bedroom apartment in a corner of the building. The room was very quiet and apart from a couple of times hearing the neighbour's smoke alarm in the morning on the way to work, I didn't hear a thing during the week. Unfortunately, on weekends I did get woken up at night by some party revellers but overall this didn't impact my stay. The apartment has a kitchen which has an excellent set of utensils and pans in order to cook should you wish to. As I'm not a great cook, I opted to pick up fresh meals from Woolworths, which is just around the corner, right near the Town Hall train station.  The design of the room also gave the feeling of space with a separate lounge area with tv, and a small dining area, and work desk for when I had to work in the evening. I certainly didn't feel like I was stuck in a box like I sometimes do in a hotel room. There was also a balcony to let fresh air in. Location wise, it is in a great position. Around the corner is the Town Hall station, right next to a supermarket, and is about a block away from the main shopping centre. Half a block the other way and there is a cinema complex and a block away is the World Trade shopping area.  The only negative I would put down is that the internet whilst free is limited to just 1GB per day before slowing you down. That may not be a problem to many visitors who should be spending more time out seeing the city, but for business visitors like me working back in the apartment that it runs out faster and can be a bit inconvenient. Other than that, I would happily stay there again. In fact I have already booked the next stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468131120~“Good place will stay again”~It's a very well situated property for city shopping and transport options. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The staff was a little lost at times, bringing a tea towel and then a bath mat when asked for a bath towel. That's minor though! Great place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467948846~“Meriton - a Known Quantity”~You know what you are going to get with a Meriton serviced apartment – a new-ish apartment of clean lines and modern kitchen / bathroom, although expect the odd dodgy aspect. We had a two bedroom apartment – upgraded from our requested one bedroom, although the extra features were locked off. We had a noisy building construction across the road from 8 am to 6 pm and a lot of street noise during the night. We had a postage stamp size balcony that was awkward to access so why bother. The bedroom wasn’t much larger than the kingsize bed. The furnishings were just OK. The kitchen was good and well equipped; the bathroom was roomy and OK. The three lifts struggled to cope with 51 floors and the comings and goings of the guests – but that’s Meriton. At $330 pn, it’s not cheap, even more so when you consider parking and credit card charges make this $380 pm. Only OK – but that’s Sydney – and we’d consider a Meriton apartment for our next visit (although probably not the Pitt Street one).~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467910313~“Construction nearby”~well located-BUT construction/demolition across street results in a lot of noise six days a week. Some rooms on lower floors (nb lobby is floor 11!) in a courtyard so dark. Comfortable and well equipped apartment.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467759350~“Total lack of cleanliness”~To start with something positive, the staff at reception are charming and helpful. However, our suite was dirty when we arrived, the bathrooms were filthy, the hob and microwave disgusting, covered in old food. Four days later, it was worse. The waste paper badkets were overflowing and not emptied once. The hospitality tray was never replenished, we were never given clean towels and the beds were not made, the coverlets were turned back over the crumpled sheets. Finally, we complained, as we should have done on the first day. A team was sent up to clean but tge result was no better. Kitchen and bathroom were not touched, though we had clean towels, they forgot the bath mats and hand towels. Picture frames remained coated in grime and dust, the windows filthy.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467736620~“Great Apartment, Good Location”~Myself and 3 friends stayed here last night of our jaunt around Sydney. The 3 bedroom apartment is very spacious and comfortable. No little éxtras' as is self-sufficient, but with the 7/11 downstairs and several breakfast and food places close by, it didn't matter. Staff were very bright and cheery and helpful. Underground parking beneath the building, everything was very convenient.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467658724~“Great staff!”~Had some issues with the apartment but staff members were very professional and handled them well. Would like to especially commend Mena, Johnson, Jasmin, Peita. May be time to review the maintenance of the apartments and the wifi services.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467453149~“Clean and comfortable”~We spent a night here and found the apartment to be comfortable and centrally located, late 2016. Sadly, there was a major construction underway at the time nearby, and we were placed in an appt facing the building works. We asked to be shifted as the booking had been placed well in advance if our stay. We were told, somewhat tersely, there was no chance of being moved. If the reception staff had looked at the computer to check this, and if the information would have been conveyed in a nicer tone, this would have been better received. . . The construction work was very noisy!  The appt was as it was depicted on several booking sites. The lifts were a little strange, as other guests also conveyed in comments. Would be interested in staying at this chain again, but not at this location.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467451014~“Excellent location”~4 of us plus baby stayed at the Pitt St Meriton for 2 nights & enjoyed our stay very much. Top marks for the location, near restaurants, shopping, Hyde Park & Darling Harbour, all in easy walking distance. The staff were great & the cots we requested was waiting for us in the room free of charge, but the 3 lifts were very slow to respond. The room was quite nice, a little plain but had everything we needed & best of all the beds were extremely comfortable. The only real negative is one morning we were woken at 7.30 to the sound of jack hammers from next door. Thank you Meriton!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467430116~“A lot better”~Well, further to my review in November 2016, where i advised Meriton had to really improve well they have.  We stayed again in February this year, and the service was by far a lot better than before. Well done Meriton, keep it up, i know you are going through some training and changes and i think it is great. We will be back again.............~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467426621~“Location is better than other Meritons”~There are many Meriton Apartments in Sydney. I think Pitt street is better than other ones.Because it is close to city center or Circular Quay, close to the train station and close to two big super markets, Coles and Woolworth.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467359329~“Great spacious apartments”~This is a fantastic apartment to stay in central Sydney very large with full kitchen Large bathroom master bedroom has large tv on the wall and we had two balconies in our apartment staff were great very helpful could not fault all for a great price with supermarkets a few metres away.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467265320~“A unique experience”~The moment I step into meriton, I realized that this isn't the one that I wanted to book to, the one that I wanted to book was located near world square, however after I have stayed one night over I do realize that it does have a different aspect in it. The staff members were nice, they will say hellos, see you and have a nice days to us even if there is no conversation made, and I find that very heartwarming. Definitely would go there again~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467159900~“Fabulous accomodation”~My girlfriends and I decided to stay at the Meriton in Pitt St Sydney overnight in a 2 bedroom apartment. When we arrived, we were told that our room was experiencing some electricity issues, Zoe at front desk assured us that it would be sorted as quickly as possible and it was, she was so lovely and helpful and we were shown our room in no time. The room itself was gorgeous overlooking Sydney, i would definitely stay in the Meriton apartments again. Thank you for such a lovely experience. Kind Regards, Carly Wayman~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467147917~“Perfect location”~Great room, great service. Very happy with everything. Note to housekeeping though, the rubbish next to the toilet should be relocated, a spot well away from previous male guest splashes! Other than that can highly recommend~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467144585~“Fantastic spacious apartment”~We really enjoyed our stay at Meriton. The 2 bedroom apartment was very spacious with bedrooms at either end with Kitchen, dining and lounge in between. 2 bathrooms also which was very handy for 4 adults getting ready at the same time. Great location and walking distance 5 mins to Queen Victoria Building, Pitt St Mall, Super markets and Town Hall Train Station which was supet handy to catch connecting train to Central then Olympic park station. Staff were all very friendly and helpful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467131623~“Sydney CBD Holiday”~Meriton service was first class but our visit was marred firstly with a studio room where the air-conditioning completely broke down during the night and couldn't be repaired and secondly by horrendous noise from an adjacent 60 story construction site with jack hammmers 30 metres away operating continuously 7am to 6pm for the whole week. We were also promised a room above 25 but ended up in level 19 (broken air-con) and then level 23. Considering the room rate we were paying this was well above comparable hotels. The building work will go on for another 12 months.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467130056~“Noisy stay”~Recently stayed for one night. Very noisy room from nearby construction but also from within complex. Neighbours doors very loud when opening and closing, enough to wake you when sleeping. Level of cleanliness also poor especially bathrooms. Curtains in bedrooms were stained. Walls scuffed etc. Apartment just did not look cared for.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467112883~“Always Excellent !”~I have been to Sydney 3-4 times in the last 8 months and every time I visit I stay at Meriton Apartments on Pitt Street. I refuse to stay anywhere else. It is almost like my home away from home. All the staff are very friendly, helpful and professional. The location is perfect and the views are priceless.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466655670~“Nice central rooms with one big problem”~We have stayed at these apartments years ago when they were called something else, back then they were probably new and super modern. Some rooms are showing signs of ageing but a sign in the lift does state they are constantly being updated. This appears to be the case. When we checked in after a long flight from Perth for Mardi Gras at about 11pm we were greeted with poor homeless men sleeping outside the entrance and some drug crazed guy going off at the reception desk staff for some reason. Not a fault of the apartments but we had wondered where we had just checked into. Check in was slow as a result, and the fact there was only 1 person serving with a few parties in front of us. We were staying a full week. We were pointed to the lifts and had to lug 6 items of luggage up ourselves, after a long wait at the slow lifts, we got to our single bedroom apartment. The looked quite dated and had dirty chipped tiles throughout. The bedroom was nice though and was comfortable so we finally fell asleep about 3am after trying to find food and unpack etc. We were woken after only a few hours by extremely loud jack hammering, when we looked outside, there was a huge office tower that looks like it's being demolished. Back down to reception and the very friendly staff helped us move to a higher floor facing another direction. I feel the staff should have advised us of this when booking or at least checking in, its just unacceptable to be selling these rooms. The construction goes Mon-Sat 7am-7pm, so don't expect any respite. We had to wait a few hours for a room facing the opposite direction, being tired the wonderful staff tried to locate other rooms for us so we could get some more sleep. We were given a side facing room with two bedrooms as an "upgrade" - it was appreciated but the noise was still audible. The master bedroom was right at the end and furtherest distance from the construction, we tested this out and decided it was ok and only slightly noisier than general city traffic. The new room looked so much nicer and cleaner than the one bedroom we had come from. Unfortunately the bed wasn't as comfortable. I had several calls from management and staff to make sure our new room was better which was appreciated. We only had a few issues with the new room. Firstly there was unexplained water entry into the master bedroom, on one occasion it ruined a pair of my shoes that were left by the foot of the bed (near the closed window) - another occasion there was a wet patch next to the right side of the bed against a wall. I told the staff and was told that sometimes this happens, I really can't see how though, there were no real entry points I could see, but it did seem to happen after heavy downpours which left the bedroom smelling musty for most of our stay.  Another issue was wifi signal, it didn't quite reach the master bedroom, which was annoying. Also only giving 1GB a day to each room (2GB to a 2 bedroom unit I believe) just isn't enough as our devices uploaded photos taken through out the day for backup purposes - we ended up using Telstra instead at greater expense. Finally after our second day, the second bedroom and bathroom was inexplicably locked. We were told we could enjoy full use of the room when we were moved but a cleaner had obviously had enough of us using the second toilet, so locked the excess rooms. We managed to get the bathroom unlocked but didn't bother about the second bedroom as it was right opposite the construction noise anyway. Just thought this was a bit rude. After wasting at least a full day of our holiday trying to get settled, we managed to get out and enjoy the area. The location is perfect, distance to Town Hall station is excellent, a few min walk at most. A full supermarket (open 7am-midnight), bottle shop, a 24 hour 7-11 all within the same block or right next door. Late night eating spots along George St are easy to get to with the whole road being shut down for construction work. We will probably stay here again as the construction will probably be finished by the time we return. You can't go past the awesome location and as long as the more dated rooms are updated regularly, I can't see why we wouldn't recommend this to our friends.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_466341125~“Excellent place to stay”~Perfect location and excellent place to stay. Great amenities. Only downside was that they don't accept anything else than a credit card.

review_465791400~“Quality did not match price”~Booked a 2 bedroom suite for one night. On arrival one of the bedrooms was locked and the other bathroom. Went to lobby to ask someone to open it and was told someone would be sent straight up. 15 minutes later no one had come yet, called front lobby to have a woman at reception say she will tell someone to come up now, even though I went to the lobby and was assured someone will be sent up straight away. Another 15 minutes go by and still no one has come up to unlock the second bedroom. I ring lobby again to have the same receptionist be quite rude with me and say that someone will come up when they have time. I was so shocked, check in was available at 2pm and I hadn't checked in until 4pm. There was adequate time for staff to have our rooms ready. I had paid for 2 bedrooms, not just one and another with a locked door? And the fact the receptionist made it seem like it wasn't a priority and I was asking a favour made it all the more worse. Some more time passes and we are so fed up waiting we go back down to the lobby where the female receptionist blatantly ignores us, another man working at the hotel then asks us if we need help, I explain the situation and he says he will go up there himself right now and open it. While he was nice there was no apology from staff for the poor service.  Other than that there were cigarette butts still on the balcony and the bathrooms were not fully clean.  Everything else was satisfactory, location was good and beds were comfortable but overall the Meriton did not even come close to living up to it's "5 stars".~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465755614~“Not to bad”~Good sized room, provides everything you need. However, construction site over the road caused nuisance noise. Not always provided a full set of towels when room was freshened, e.g missing bath mat, flannels.  Nothing over and above what you would expect~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465744519~“Pretty good apartment”~Had all the utilities we needed for our short trip with daily cleaning I.e kitchenette with a small stove.

review_464258313~“Meriton is incredibly underrated, I had to moved in”~Really happy with Meriton, fell in love with the spacious apartment. I've stayed in Mantra, QT sydney, QT bondi, Hilton and Novotel and I'm definitely most happy with Meriton. I was hesitant it isn't as decorated as I like but the spaciousness, cleanliness and quality of the furnishings make up for it. It's directly on PItt Street and close to everything, laundry facilities and full kitchen, incredible city views with a large/lengthy balcony rather than most places that give you a couple of square metres, really good value for money, a 24 hour gym, unlimited free wifi, gorgeous city views especially with the sunset and sunrise and more. :)  Thanks so much to Sean for amazing service and allocating a gorgeous apartment I'm happy to stay in for months! They also catered for early check in despite being full the night before so I'm all for Meriton's great service.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
