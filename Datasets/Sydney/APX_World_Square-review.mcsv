review_476738501~“A random high night stay ”~It was a night minute booking and was the closest one to my located. The place is average in accordance with the price (moderately price serviced apartment) . But there receptionist was super courteous and polite. I didn't bother checking out there free Wi-Fi and TV. But what's great avout this place is the location. Located in the heart of Thaitown and 5 minutes away from Chinatown. World square Shopping Centre has Coles so one can go and buy groceries. The room was more than enough for me.  FYI, the king bed is made up of 2 single beds joined together. If one is looking for cheap accommodation, this is the place to be at~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475429403~“Poor and a not very helpful front desk!!!”~The room was ok then that is where it stopped, front desk staff where poor mannered and I didn't get my bond back ($200) till a couple of weeks after the stay and we had another random couple enter our room with their room key!!! WTF!!! Asked for late checkout (11am) and that was granted but at 10am I received 3 calls in a matter of 5 minutes to say I had to leave!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473290099~“Disappointing”~The best I can say about this place is that you'll survive it. The hotel was average, with the room looking a bit old and shabby. Not sure what the concierge staff were paid to do, as they mostly just stood at their computer being friendly but unhelpful. TV and DVD player were broken, and we received no assistance in spite of several requests until late on the night before we left- at that point, it was tactless to even offer. I guess, looking back, the room had a good range of facilities (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, oven) but the shower was terrible! Stinging like pins! Not one we would return to.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472733001~“Satisfactory apartment in a great location”~This is a moderately-priced serviced apartment with an excellent location in the center of Sydney. I booked the Executive Apartment (1BR) for 6 nights, and I was placed on the 4th floor. There is plenty of natural light through the windows, but virtually no view from the windows or balcony on this floor. The furniture and bathroom fixtures show some signs of wear, and there was a musty (perhaps cigarette) smell when i first arrived. However, it's a modern and spacious apartment, and the kitchen and laundry were nice to have. I was able to buy food right across the street at the Coles Supermarket in World Square, and enjoyed making breakfast in the kitchen. The king bed was on the soft side, and comfortable for my taste, although you should be aware that it is actually two twin beds pushed together. The bathroom was not sparkling clean upon arrival, and although housekeeping came in every day to replace supplies, it doesn't appear that any touch-up cleaning was done. Accommodations in Sydney are very expensive, especially during peak periods. If you're trying to spend less money on accommodations and you want a decent, spacious apartment, this is a good choice. If you're willing to spend more, there are better serviced apartments in the area.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471158042~“Good location and friendly staff”~These apartments are located centrally in easy reach of station and Darling harbour. The entrance is uninspiring but made up for by the friendly staff inside. The apartment was clean but could do with updating. Free wifi and washing facilities were welcome. The double bed was pushed against a wall which was annoying. We were allowed to use the pool after check out which was useful. The pool is very cold. New sun loungers appeared on our last day and there is a shower room near the pool .~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_470999465~“Great Apartment Hotel! ”~We stayed at the APX World Square over the weekend and the location was definitely the best part! We were within walking 10 minutes to the City Westfield, 10 minutes to Darling Harbor and China Town. Plus there were so many other bars and restaurants close by we were spoilt for choice. The apartment itself was great with a large kitchen/ living space separate from the bedroom and bathroom. We also had a balcony which was nice to sit out on while the sun was setting over the city. Highly recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467976397~“Excellent service and accommodation ”~Recently my newly wed wife along with my son and daughter in law booked into the APX World Square for a weekend away to celebrate both my wife and my birthdays. Due to unforseen circumstances there was a small problem with our accommodations. The management and staff went way and beyond to provide us with absolutely top class accommodation. The problem was handled with professionalism and empathy which made us all feel we were important. Would highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465461296~“Staff not knowing about jack hammers at 7.30am”~I was disappointed as the 1st and and 2nd mornings we were awoken by jack hammers. The staff at first did not know how long this was going to go for in days eventually they found out after I asked. This spoiled our visit otherwise we enjoyed the adequate facilities.~4~nan~4~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462577614~“Underwhelming”~When booking for this stay we chose APX because of the ability to have a kitchen. Whilst it ticked some boxes on arrival, it left many blank. Firstly on arrival, the reception staff were not very welcoming and kept their responses to my questions very minimal- they acted like we were disrupting them. As we got there early we left for lunch and came back at 2 so we could check in. We checked in at 2 and went to our apartment. Approximately 15 minutes later housekeeping was banging on the door and barged in to vacuum even though we said no. This should have been fully completed before the check in time. The beds were also a let down being advertised as a king bed, when really it was 2 singles pushed together - I wish there had been a note about this prior to booking. The air conditioner was also terrible and so very loud on the private balcony, so much so that we couldn't use the balcony. While the rooms were spacious and modern, and the shower was excellent, I wouldn't choose to stay here again unless I really had to.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462072692~“Clean, well located, surprisingly quiet”~Stayed 3 nights, it's a bit more of a walk into my office but I don't mind a 15 minute stroll, particularly when I want to find a breakfast cafe stop along the way. It was clean, quieter than I expected and a number of dining options for the evenings. A short walk to Capital Theatre. I slept well from night one which is always a bonus.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_459923036~“You pay your money and take your pick”~In terms of facilities, there are none. Actually that is not true there is a pool and I am advised there is a Gymn. As for everything else there is Sydney. Right across Cunningham Street there is an excellent cafe where a good breakfast of lunch can be bought for a reasonable price, there are numerous places to eat well within a a five minute walk, including a excellent Thai Restaurant whose name I do not have. We were in Sydney on business, but as a venue for a family trip this would make a great base. Some of the furniture is a bit stained, but the beds are clean and reasonably comfy. I would stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_457022085~“So close to Chinatown, George Street and yet kind of hidden”~We stayed on level 9 in a 2 bedroom interconnecting apartment. I can't say you'd stay there for the view, but for cleanliness of the apartment, services and proximity it was great. The parking was close by, $50 a night - pricey in itself, but pretty comparable to other places. Cleaning staff were super efficient, comfortable rooms, usual stuff in the bathroom (shampoo / conditioner / body wash / body cream). Bed was ok, not super hard like a lot were. Safe in the room, long life milk + tea / coffee / hot chocolate & plenty of tourist guides + daily papers downstairs. Very easy checkout, just drop the keys by the door and head off. Would definitely stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_455776855~“Not suitable for families”~I phoned and made a booking with a staff member for our family of 4 - I was advised the best room to suit us would be the 1 bedroom open plan suite as this has a fold out couch that both children could share. Upon check in we were informed there was only 3 people booked in and the room was ONLY allowed 3 people to sleep in there!!! I asked where they expect the 4th person to sleep?? Sometime later we were offered an 'old' mattress we could use - we did not use this as there was no space for a mattress so we took turns sharing the 1 queen and 1 single bed.  The daily service was a bit of a let down - with the kids we were out most of the day an back in the later afternoons for sleeps and relaxing - housekeeping came everyday from 3-5pm - RIGHT when we would be showering or kids sleeping. One occasion, there was no knocking they just opened the door. The car park is expensive and smells TERRIBLE!!! I read many complaints about this before we booked in - it is as bad as people say.  It is in the heart of Chinatown too - which I was not aware. Overall though, had we not had an issue with the sleeping arrangements- it was clean and tidy and enjoyable.~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan~3~nan

review_453464774~“Budget Accomodation”~I recently stayed here on a work trip. I was on level 11 and in a large 1 bedroom apartment. The hotel itself is in a busy area of the city so I would suggest if you are a light sleeper this hotel isn't for you - as you can hear outside noise from your room. The apartment itself was very large with a huge living area, kitchen all separate from the bedroom and the separate bathroom - The shower pressure was good but each time you flushed the toilet there would be a loud squealing noise for about 2 minutes after.  The bed was comfortable and they offered free WiFi (which was OK speed) and free in house movies.  The cleaners, however did only the bare minimum when they came in during the day.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_452526778~“Great location, good size room, comfy bed”~Located very centrally close to train, bus and darling harbour. Nothig fancy from the outside, but studio apartment had full kitchen, dining table, sofa, balcony with outdoor setting and good size bathroom. All very modern. Bed and pillows very comfortable. On the top floor so not noisy. Pool could do with some chairs around for relaxing if they want it to get more use. Staff friendly and helpful, we were able to get early check in. Good air con (was 39 and humid but room was cool and lovely). Full fridge, oven, microwave and dishwasher. Perfect if you want a comfortable room for sleeping and not looking for lots of bells and whistles (no bar or restaurant, no lounge area, etc). We spent most of our time out and about so it was perfect.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_452494136~“Convenient location and amenities”~Apartments lived up to expectations and advertising. Great location between Central and Town hall. Although hidden in very small Cunningham st so you will need to have GPS or know the area. Apartments well laid out with good size bedroom, through to the kitchenette and lounge room with small balcony. There is only 1 pool which is a lap pool and indoor/outdoor arrangement. Unfortunately no chairs, tables or lounges to relax by the pool side. Near pool is a toilet/shower not very clean. Gym small but has the main machines needed. Overall, would recommend here for families on holiday or business.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_452438762~“Sydney weekend ”~Great location for visit to Capitol Theatre. Room was average but needs attention to appliances and pillows. Pool deck was filthy which given it was hot and middle of summer I felt it should be checked and cleaned daily, but looked to us like it hadn't been done in a while given the build up there.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449032947~“Good Service, Good Hotel”~We stayed for 6 nights over Christmas. The service at reception when we checked in was excellent. The apartment was roomy, very comfortable, came with a balcony, full kitchen, and full laundry facilities. The bathroom was a bit small. Although close to a couple of late trading pubs with the balcony door closed at night their was no noise problems. The room was serviced daily, except for 2 days over Christmas, and during this time reception were more than happy to provide any needed personal items free of charge.  We would definitely stay there again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_446500372~“Convenient, spacious Studio room”~Down an unassuming lane opposite the southern end of World Square shopping centre, APX offers spacious accomodation in a part of Sydney convenient to Chinatown, darling harbour and CBD attractions. A 5-10 minute stroll from both central & town hall stations, 2 blocks south (away from Circular Quay) from the hotel finds the reliable tram to The Star and beyond. Presentation lacks charm or elegance but the room was clean and generously proportioned offering couch & TV, full kitchenette and a large balcony. Pokey bathroom was clean; usual gels, soaps etc provided. Street and hallway noise was occasionally noticeable, namely early morning.  Surrounded by shopping, restaurants and attractions in practically every direction, APX offers functional digs in a less glam part of Sydney. Similarly priced Apartment Hotels experienced in the area offer superior quality, if you book earlier enough.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_444709653~“RIP OFF”~I have given this hotel a 2 star rating for the following reason.Upon arrival the hotel took $200 deposit from us.Not a problem.The apartment itself was excellent,the facilities,the staff and the location,but it is with a heavy heart we feel we have been ripped off..We never used the mini bar or anything.Upon leaving i asked the receptionist for the deposit and he said it would be in our bank within 5 working days.I said oh thats good even for us from the UK.He said sorry maam but it takes 4 to 5 weeks for it to go back into your bank.Fast forward 8 weeks later ,numerous phonecalls and emails..Nothing.They have told me its in your bank..i have gone to my bank and checked statements ,nothing has gone into that account.They have taken my bank details over and over,they even told me i had made a mistake and it was in..a ploy to get me off the phone no doubt. ,I think its disgusting..i know its only £116 in English money but that holiday cost us a small fortune and i cant/wont let it go. I will go on every travel site going until i get this sorted.Overseas travellers please be aware of this con.~2~nan~nan~5~nan~5~1~nan

Staff members were helpful and suggested some good restaurants.Thanks for the suggestions.My only concern was we had friends on other floors wish we could get rooms together it would be much more fun rather than going up and down in elevator all the time.

review_436703237~“Great location, interesting room layout”~Comfortable apartment with large outside patio - but odd location for the bedroom (half way down the passage and before you get to the kitchen / living). And no way you could shut it off, so happy I was travelling solo and not with the spouse who watches tv way after I go to bed. Also odd location with a table opposite the bed (ie in the passage) as there was no way you could get past this if you had a wheelchair or pusher. Washing machine and dryer in bathroom. Very clean and very comfortable. Would feel even safer if there was a lock on the inside of the door.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_433137184~“A mixed bag.”~We were in Sydney for our grandsons birthday. We decided to have three nights in the city for convenience. The first drama was, with a vomiting 3 year old, we asked if my son could park his car anywhere whilst we cleaned the lad up. We were given a key and directed to a loading bay. We accessed said loading bay but when the son and family came to leave we could not get his car out of a locked garage. This was after midnight and no staff were on duty. The reception was not staffed, despite the grill being open. I contacted the after hours number to be told the staffer was 10 mins away. He arrived and when I got him to come to the garage, he told me I was in the wrong garage, how did I get in? And did the receptionist not take me to the correct place. Very unimpressed with this approach. We eventually managed to manually open the garage door at about 1.30am. The apartment was ok but in a noisy location. Cleanliness was below par and on the first morning I caught a lift to be greeted by a pile of vomit on the floor not cleaned up. Will not use this place again.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~3~nan

Liked the free internet, kitchen with gas oven, microwave, reasonable utensils, daily room services / cleaning, reasonably well-maintained. Staff (Karina and Amanda from Business Dev, Nouman at Reception are simply superb).

Room was really clean, had cooktop, washer dryer, and even room for a bath. Staff were really helpful and ask constantly if ever thing was okay. Only minor complaints were the shower enclosure was a little small (I'm a big guy) and parking cost was substantially more than our last visit to Sydney at $50.

review_429976269~“Amazing stay at Best Hotel with Awesome management”~We stayed at this Apartment hotels which is located at one of the best locations I have stayed in. The rates were absolutely amazing and reasonable as well. We came to hotel around 12 pm however the rooms were not ready and check out time was 2 pm but the reception staff was so cooperative and understanding that they offered us to store our luggage with them. We got time to go to darling Harbor and get to see the beauty. Surprisingly we hot a call from hotel that your rooms are ready and this was so sweet. On check in,we were even asked if we are tired and so much concern was shown by the staff who was different from morning one. Tasked us for the credit card for some bond or pre authorisation I guess which they explained why it is taken. It was refunded in our account in 5-7 days which they promised. We stayed there for 3 nights and I must say it just felt like home away from home.Especially the staff and the management which I think should get all credit.Even at the checkout, the manager asked us if our stay was good and asked for suggestions and I must appreciate this gesture. At last I would just suggest to renovate some room amenities like blankets, furniture and decor. Rest all was 100% perfect.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_428595413~“Sloppy cleaning services”~We stayed for 5 nights. The apartment is spacious with a kitchen. We absolutely enjoyed cooking our dinners at the apartment. The apartment does offer daily cleaning services but they did not do much cleaning at all. The only thing they did was tidying our bed, emptied the bins and put new washing powders on top of the washing machine every day.  Other cleaning services were not carried out. Just to name a few, they threw our clothes on the sofa when they tidied our bed and the apartment was not vacuumed throughout our stay. The kitchen was worse.. they didn't even mop the floor or wiped the counter-top once. We did all the cleaning and washing works ourselves. Our apartment faces the World Square, it was very noisy at night with loud bar music and people partying. The wifi was very slow.~2~3~nan~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_428064099~“Could have been OK; but was filthy”~We stayed in the APX Haymarket for 3 nights. ; 1-2-3 October. We chose this because it was a long weekend there was virtually nothing else available. We had an Executive 2 Brm apartment. The location is pretty good, and it's close to Central station and Darling Harbour When we arrived, the carpet outside one of the apartments was very wet. We notified reception immediately. Because it was a long weekend, we were told that there were no cleaners available. The receptionist brought up some towels and put them on the wet area. It smelled iffy too. The towels absorbed a bit of the moisture, and turned yellow. More towels were brought up, but the original towels were left in the apartment. The receptionist (understandably I suppose) didn't want to touch them. I put them outside the front door. And there they stayed. We continually referred to the smell and the dampness every time we had to go to Reception to get our access keys reprogrammed. This was pretty regular. We'd get to our rooms and one, or both access cards refused to operate, and we'd grumble back down stairs. On the 3rd October a Manager was finally available and came to investigate the issue. He sprayed some deodorant/antiseptic on the stain, which meant that the ever present towels turned from yellow to pink. He acknowledged that there was a problem, and that he'd need to check who was in the apartment before us. I pointed out that this was, as far as we were concerned, irrelevant. He also indicated that there would be some compensation. In the interests of disclosure, we WERE offered new rooms on the 3rd; our last day. I pointed out that, with us leaving the next day, packing up 4 adults and two young children was not the way we wanted to spend our break. I got a phone call from APX on the way home. There was an apology, and what I understood to be an offer of 1 nights accommodation refunded. I have since been told that the offer was for one nights PARKING. $50. Our bill for the three nights was about $2400. And for our money we were put in an apartment that was enriched with yellow dampness outside the toilet. There were no cleaners available, and we were left to make it as close to habitable as we could. There was an exorbitant premium charged, but the hotel did not see fit to clean the apartment. The keys worked, at best, sporadically. The beds were hard. Why didn't we move? We had prepaid! And it was Grand Final weekend and there was literally nowhere else to go. We've stayed in a lot of places. We've never, even in much, much less expensive accommodation, been told that there were no cleaning staff available to make a room habitable.~1~nan~4~nan~1~nan~1~nan

Being on a purely business trip, I was looking out for a peaceful & tranquil location & this place just nailed it. Not only it has a great location, but it's close to the city center as well and quite convenient to get around. The rooms are very clean, well maintained & spacious. The staff here too was extremely friendly yet courteous & attentive. Throughout my stay, they made me experience a home away from home feeling. Extremely Satisfied. Highly recommended for all travellers whether on business or leisure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415990707~“Ordinary at best”~The extra bedding supplied for our children was completely unusable - one bed resembled a "wave" it was so uneven and the other dipped completely in the middle and stank of cigarette smoke!! It was pitiful. Staff were nice and pleasant. Rooms were OK in cleanliness - no servicing on Sunday's or public holidays though. - a clear measure to save money on wages. People pay very well to stay here so this is pure stinginess!  Wouldn't return~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_476738501~“A random high night stay ”~It was a night minute booking and was the closest one to my located. The place is average in accordance with the price (moderately price serviced apartment) . But there receptionist was super courteous and polite. I didn't bother checking out there free Wi-Fi and TV. But what's great avout this place is the location. Located in the heart of Thaitown and 5 minutes away from Chinatown. World square Shopping Centre has Coles so one can go and buy groceries. The room was more than enough for me.  FYI, the king bed is made up of 2 single beds joined together. If one is looking for cheap accommodation, this is the place to be at~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475429403~“Poor and a not very helpful front desk!!!”~The room was ok then that is where it stopped, front desk staff where poor mannered and I didn't get my bond back ($200) till a couple of weeks after the stay and we had another random couple enter our room with their room key!!! WTF!!! Asked for late checkout (11am) and that was granted but at 10am I received 3 calls in a matter of 5 minutes to say I had to leave!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473290099~“Disappointing”~The best I can say about this place is that you'll survive it. The hotel was average, with the room looking a bit old and shabby. Not sure what the concierge staff were paid to do, as they mostly just stood at their computer being friendly but unhelpful. TV and DVD player were broken, and we received no assistance in spite of several requests until late on the night before we left- at that point, it was tactless to even offer. I guess, looking back, the room had a good range of facilities (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, oven) but the shower was terrible! Stinging like pins! Not one we would return to.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472733001~“Satisfactory apartment in a great location”~This is a moderately-priced serviced apartment with an excellent location in the center of Sydney. I booked the Executive Apartment (1BR) for 6 nights, and I was placed on the 4th floor. There is plenty of natural light through the windows, but virtually no view from the windows or balcony on this floor. The furniture and bathroom fixtures show some signs of wear, and there was a musty (perhaps cigarette) smell when i first arrived. However, it's a modern and spacious apartment, and the kitchen and laundry were nice to have. I was able to buy food right across the street at the Coles Supermarket in World Square, and enjoyed making breakfast in the kitchen. The king bed was on the soft side, and comfortable for my taste, although you should be aware that it is actually two twin beds pushed together. The bathroom was not sparkling clean upon arrival, and although housekeeping came in every day to replace supplies, it doesn't appear that any touch-up cleaning was done. Accommodations in Sydney are very expensive, especially during peak periods. If you're trying to spend less money on accommodations and you want a decent, spacious apartment, this is a good choice. If you're willing to spend more, there are better serviced apartments in the area.~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471158042~“Good location and friendly staff”~These apartments are located centrally in easy reach of station and Darling harbour. The entrance is uninspiring but made up for by the friendly staff inside. The apartment was clean but could do with updating. Free wifi and washing facilities were welcome. The double bed was pushed against a wall which was annoying. We were allowed to use the pool after check out which was useful. The pool is very cold. New sun loungers appeared on our last day and there is a shower room near the pool .~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_470999465~“Great Apartment Hotel! ”~We stayed at the APX World Square over the weekend and the location was definitely the best part! We were within walking 10 minutes to the City Westfield, 10 minutes to Darling Harbor and China Town. Plus there were so many other bars and restaurants close by we were spoilt for choice. The apartment itself was great with a large kitchen/ living space separate from the bedroom and bathroom. We also had a balcony which was nice to sit out on while the sun was setting over the city. Highly recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467976397~“Excellent service and accommodation ”~Recently my newly wed wife along with my son and daughter in law booked into the APX World Square for a weekend away to celebrate both my wife and my birthdays. Due to unforseen circumstances there was a small problem with our accommodations. The management and staff went way and beyond to provide us with absolutely top class accommodation. The problem was handled with professionalism and empathy which made us all feel we were important. Would highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465461296~“Staff not knowing about jack hammers at 7.30am”~I was disappointed as the 1st and and 2nd mornings we were awoken by jack hammers. The staff at first did not know how long this was going to go for in days eventually they found out after I asked. This spoiled our visit otherwise we enjoyed the adequate facilities.~4~nan~4~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_462577614~“Underwhelming”~When booking for this stay we chose APX because of the ability to have a kitchen. Whilst it ticked some boxes on arrival, it left many blank. Firstly on arrival, the reception staff were not very welcoming and kept their responses to my questions very minimal- they acted like we were disrupting them. As we got there early we left for lunch and came back at 2 so we could check in. We checked in at 2 and went to our apartment. Approximately 15 minutes later housekeeping was banging on the door and barged in to vacuum even though we said no. This should have been fully completed before the check in time. The beds were also a let down being advertised as a king bed, when really it was 2 singles pushed together - I wish there had been a note about this prior to booking. The air conditioner was also terrible and so very loud on the private balcony, so much so that we couldn't use the balcony. While the rooms were spacious and modern, and the shower was excellent, I wouldn't choose to stay here again unless I really had to.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462072692~“Clean, well located, surprisingly quiet”~Stayed 3 nights, it's a bit more of a walk into my office but I don't mind a 15 minute stroll, particularly when I want to find a breakfast cafe stop along the way. It was clean, quieter than I expected and a number of dining options for the evenings. A short walk to Capital Theatre. I slept well from night one which is always a bonus.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_459923036~“You pay your money and take your pick”~In terms of facilities, there are none. Actually that is not true there is a pool and I am advised there is a Gymn. As for everything else there is Sydney. Right across Cunningham Street there is an excellent cafe where a good breakfast of lunch can be bought for a reasonable price, there are numerous places to eat well within a a five minute walk, including a excellent Thai Restaurant whose name I do not have. We were in Sydney on business, but as a venue for a family trip this would make a great base. Some of the furniture is a bit stained, but the beds are clean and reasonably comfy. I would stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_457022085~“So close to Chinatown, George Street and yet kind of hidden”~We stayed on level 9 in a 2 bedroom interconnecting apartment. I can't say you'd stay there for the view, but for cleanliness of the apartment, services and proximity it was great. The parking was close by, $50 a night - pricey in itself, but pretty comparable to other places. Cleaning staff were super efficient, comfortable rooms, usual stuff in the bathroom (shampoo / conditioner / body wash / body cream). Bed was ok, not super hard like a lot were. Safe in the room, long life milk + tea / coffee / hot chocolate & plenty of tourist guides + daily papers downstairs. Very easy checkout, just drop the keys by the door and head off. Would definitely stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_455776855~“Not suitable for families”~I phoned and made a booking with a staff member for our family of 4 - I was advised the best room to suit us would be the 1 bedroom open plan suite as this has a fold out couch that both children could share. Upon check in we were informed there was only 3 people booked in and the room was ONLY allowed 3 people to sleep in there!!! I asked where they expect the 4th person to sleep?? Sometime later we were offered an 'old' mattress we could use - we did not use this as there was no space for a mattress so we took turns sharing the 1 queen and 1 single bed.  The daily service was a bit of a let down - with the kids we were out most of the day an back in the later afternoons for sleeps and relaxing - housekeeping came everyday from 3-5pm - RIGHT when we would be showering or kids sleeping. One occasion, there was no knocking they just opened the door. The car park is expensive and smells TERRIBLE!!! I read many complaints about this before we booked in - it is as bad as people say.  It is in the heart of Chinatown too - which I was not aware. Overall though, had we not had an issue with the sleeping arrangements- it was clean and tidy and enjoyable.~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan~3~nan

review_453464774~“Budget Accomodation”~I recently stayed here on a work trip. I was on level 11 and in a large 1 bedroom apartment. The hotel itself is in a busy area of the city so I would suggest if you are a light sleeper this hotel isn't for you - as you can hear outside noise from your room. The apartment itself was very large with a huge living area, kitchen all separate from the bedroom and the separate bathroom - The shower pressure was good but each time you flushed the toilet there would be a loud squealing noise for about 2 minutes after.  The bed was comfortable and they offered free WiFi (which was OK speed) and free in house movies.  The cleaners, however did only the bare minimum when they came in during the day.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_446500372~“Convenient, spacious Studio room”~Down an unassuming lane opposite the southern end of World Square shopping centre, APX offers spacious accomodation in a part of Sydney convenient to Chinatown, darling harbour and CBD attractions. A 5-10 minute stroll from both central & town hall stations, 2 blocks south (away from Circular Quay) from the hotel finds the reliable tram to The Star and beyond. Presentation lacks charm or elegance but the room was clean and generously proportioned offering couch & TV, full kitchenette and a large balcony. Pokey bathroom was clean; usual gels, soaps etc provided. Street and hallway noise was occasionally noticeable, namely early morning.  Surrounded by shopping, restaurants and attractions in practically every direction, APX offers functional digs in a less glam part of Sydney. Similarly priced Apartment Hotels experienced in the area offer superior quality, if you book earlier enough.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_444709653~“RIP OFF”~I have given this hotel a 2 star rating for the following reason.Upon arrival the hotel took $200 deposit from us.Not a problem.The apartment itself was excellent,the facilities,the staff and the location,but it is with a heavy heart we feel we have been ripped off..We never used the mini bar or anything.Upon leaving i asked the receptionist for the deposit and he said it would be in our bank within 5 working days.I said oh thats good even for us from the UK.He said sorry maam but it takes 4 to 5 weeks for it to go back into your bank.Fast forward 8 weeks later ,numerous phonecalls and emails..Nothing.They have told me its in your bank..i have gone to my bank and checked statements ,nothing has gone into that account.They have taken my bank details over and over,they even told me i had made a mistake and it was in..a ploy to get me off the phone no doubt. ,I think its disgusting..i know its only £116 in English money but that holiday cost us a small fortune and i cant/wont let it go. I will go on every travel site going until i get this sorted.Overseas travellers please be aware of this con.~2~nan~nan~5~nan~5~1~nan

Staff members were helpful and suggested some good restaurants.Thanks for the suggestions.My only concern was we had friends on other floors wish we could get rooms together it would be much more fun rather than going up and down in elevator all the time.

review_436703237~“Great location, interesting room layout”~Comfortable apartment with large outside patio - but odd location for the bedroom (half way down the passage and before you get to the kitchen / living). And no way you could shut it off, so happy I was travelling solo and not with the spouse who watches tv way after I go to bed. Also odd location with a table opposite the bed (ie in the passage) as there was no way you could get past this if you had a wheelchair or pusher. Washing machine and dryer in bathroom. Very clean and very comfortable. Would feel even safer if there was a lock on the inside of the door.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_433137184~“A mixed bag.”~We were in Sydney for our grandsons birthday. We decided to have three nights in the city for convenience. The first drama was, with a vomiting 3 year old, we asked if my son could park his car anywhere whilst we cleaned the lad up. We were given a key and directed to a loading bay. We accessed said loading bay but when the son and family came to leave we could not get his car out of a locked garage. This was after midnight and no staff were on duty. The reception was not staffed, despite the grill being open. I contacted the after hours number to be told the staffer was 10 mins away. He arrived and when I got him to come to the garage, he told me I was in the wrong garage, how did I get in? And did the receptionist not take me to the correct place. Very unimpressed with this approach. We eventually managed to manually open the garage door at about 1.30am. The apartment was ok but in a noisy location. Cleanliness was below par and on the first morning I caught a lift to be greeted by a pile of vomit on the floor not cleaned up. Will not use this place again.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~3~nan

Liked the staff (Reception, Head office, Customer care), eager to help, listen and address the requests / requirements.  Liked the free internet, kitchen with gas oven, microwave, reasonable utensils, daily room services / cleaning, reasonably well-maintained. Staff (Karina and Amanda from Business Dev, Nouman at Reception are simply superb).

Room was really clean, had cooktop, washer dryer, and even room for a bath. Staff were really helpful and ask constantly if ever thing was okay. Only minor complaints were the shower enclosure was a little small (I'm a big guy) and parking cost was substantially more than our last visit to Sydney at $50. But it did have a balcony, which kept the smoker happy and free wifi up to 8GB :)~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_429976269~“Amazing stay at Best Hotel with Awesome management”~We stayed at this Apartment hotels which is located at one of the best locations I have stayed in. The rates were absolutely amazing and reasonable as well. We came to hotel around 12 pm however the rooms were not ready and check out time was 2 pm but the reception staff was so cooperative and understanding that they offered us to store our luggage with them. We got time to go to darling Harbor and get to see the beauty. Surprisingly we hot a call from hotel that your rooms are ready and this was so sweet. On check in,we were even asked if we are tired and so much concern was shown by the staff who was different from morning one. Tasked us for the credit card for some bond or pre authorisation I guess which they explained why it is taken. It was refunded in our account in 5-7 days which they promised. We stayed there for 3 nights and I must say it just felt like home away from home.Especially the staff and the management which I think should get all credit.Even at the checkout, the manager asked us if our stay was good and asked for suggestions and I must appreciate this gesture. At last I would just suggest to renovate some room amenities like blankets, furniture and decor. Rest all was 100% perfect.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_428595413~“Sloppy cleaning services”~We stayed for 5 nights. The apartment is spacious with a kitchen. We absolutely enjoyed cooking our dinners at the apartment. The apartment does offer daily cleaning services but they did not do much cleaning at all. The only thing they did was tidying our bed, emptied the bins and put new washing powders on top of the washing machine every day.  Other cleaning services were not carried out. Just to name a few, they threw our clothes on the sofa when they tidied our bed and the apartment was not vacuumed throughout our stay. The kitchen was worse.. they didn't even mop the floor or wiped the counter-top once. We did all the cleaning and washing works ourselves. Our apartment faces the World Square, it was very noisy at night with loud bar music and people partying. The wifi was very slow.~2~3~nan~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_428064099~“Could have been OK; but was filthy”~We stayed in the APX Haymarket for 3 nights. ; 1-2-3 October. We chose this because it was a long weekend there was virtually nothing else available. We had an Executive 2 Brm apartment. The location is pretty good, and it's close to Central station and Darling Harbour When we arrived, the carpet outside one of the apartments was very wet. We notified reception immediately. Because it was a long weekend, we were told that there were no cleaners available. The receptionist brought up some towels and put them on the wet area. It smelled iffy too. The towels absorbed a bit of the moisture, and turned yellow. More towels were brought up, but the original towels were left in the apartment. The receptionist (understandably I suppose) didn't want to touch them. I put them outside the front door. And there they stayed. We continually referred to the smell and the dampness every time we had to go to Reception to get our access keys reprogrammed. This was pretty regular. We'd get to our rooms and one, or both access cards refused to operate, and we'd grumble back down stairs. On the 3rd October a Manager was finally available and came to investigate the issue. He sprayed some deodorant/antiseptic on the stain, which meant that the ever present towels turned from yellow to pink. He acknowledged that there was a problem, and that he'd need to check who was in the apartment before us. I pointed out that this was, as far as we were concerned, irrelevant. He also indicated that there would be some compensation. In the interests of disclosure, we WERE offered new rooms on the 3rd; our last day. I pointed out that, with us leaving the next day, packing up 4 adults and two young children was not the way we wanted to spend our break. I got a phone call from APX on the way home. There was an apology, and what I understood to be an offer of 1 nights accommodation refunded. I have since been told that the offer was for one nights PARKING. $50. Our bill for the three nights was about $2400. And for our money we were put in an apartment that was enriched with yellow dampness outside the toilet. There were no cleaners available, and we were left to make it as close to habitable as we could. There was an exorbitant premium charged, but the hotel did not see fit to clean the apartment. The keys worked, at best, sporadically. The beds were hard. Why didn't we move? We had prepaid! And it was Grand Final weekend and there was literally nowhere else to go. We've stayed in a lot of places. We've never, even in much, much less expensive accommodation, been told that there were no cleaning staff available to make a room habitable.~1~nan~4~nan~1~nan~1~nan
