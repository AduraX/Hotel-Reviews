review_63112058~“A knockin shop!”~The Crest is inexpensive compared to most Sydney hotels and you'll soon see why: it's located in the heart of King's Cross, the red-light district. True the area is more unsavoury than dangerous but criminality is usually comcomitant with these types of locales. They also suffer from neglect by the municipal authorities e.g. the state of the footpaths was lamentable in King's Cross. The street the hotel is on can be noisy and chaotic at night, my sleep was frequently interrupted. This can be countered by earplugs, what a shame the smell of must in the room couldn't so easily be cancelled out. I found reception staff to be rude and unhelpful and breakfast was below average although there is a nice cafe called 'The Fountain' just up the road and the 'Bourbon Hotel' is good for food too. Despite the apparent slew of 'entertainment' options in the area, there actually isn't any decent bar to drink in and we often resorted to bringing off-licence to our room or better still, frequenting cool bars in the Rocks and Harbour Districts. There is a bus that goes from King's Cross down the the Harbour but it can be time consuming during daytime traffic.  Try to get a hotel nearer Darling Harbour/The Rocks/Downtown and take a trip to Manly rather than wasting half a day going to the overhyped Bondi Beach~2~3~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_30558014~“Appaling service”~The service was appaling. They were not at ll interested in serving guests and when one person in our party told the bar man that he was perceived as being condacending he couldn't care less, he even told us so!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_12406894~“Crest Hotel - Cheap and Reasonable”~The Crest Hotel was a good comfortable place to stay. If you are a budget traveller and you want a SAFE place to stay, this is a place I would recommend. Its in Kings Cross which is in a red light district, but the GOOD side to this is the food. THe food is amazing on Darlinghurst Street. You can get pizza, kebabs, indian food, thai, malaysian, chinese - you name it. And very cheap prices! Best of all, they are open all night. The street has peddlers who ask for money and you might see some red light workers on the streets in the early hours of the morning or late at night but having stayed here twice I had no problems.  The views were incredible, the bed although it was old was comfortable and clean. The sheets were clean. I took off the main cover. The bathroom was clean. It came with a table and a basic tv, an alarm clock that worked (this is very important).  Overall, for 80 dollars or so and for its central location close to Elizabeth bay and the harbour views to the opera house I would have to say I was satisfied. What more could you ask for on such a cheap price? Seriously you get what you pay for and a little extra here. IF you can handle the fact that the hotel is old 70's style hotel and needs a renovation then you will be most pleased.  Sydney hotels this close to the harbour dont come cheap, and I guarantee you that no place, no matter hoe expensive does not come with the range and diversity of food choices as this place. Take a step out of the hotel and you will be amazed. For $10 dollars I got 2 curries, 2 tandoori chickens and 2 slices of pizza. You go anywhere else and you will pay almost $20 dollars for that. Also the hotel is within walking distance of the botanical gardens. I stayed at Manly once, and it required a ferry and a bus and cost me almost 50 dollars return.  With regards to safety in Kings Cross - this is my advice for you. The only way you might get into problems is if you actively look for this kind of thing. If you walk down the street at a brisk pace and dont stop like I did, you can avoid any troubles. Hopefully some people out there will be agreeing with me. As with anything - you get what you pay for - THIS PLACE - you get what you pay for and extra.~4~4~5~nan~3~3~4~4
review_7474670~“Yes, the place is run down....but...”~I stayed at the Crest hotel for two nights in April. I had a room on the 14th floor. And indeed it looked nothing like the photos on the hotel-website. There were stains in the carpet, the in-room fridge did not work. Some of the light switches were cracked. In the bathroom there was mold in the shower and plaster peeled off the ceiling...so far so bad.  But the hotel is in a great location, good restaurants and bars nearby, excellent train and bus connections to all major city-attractions. And since I only needed the room to sleep and not to hang out all day, I must say the room smelled surprisingly fresh, the beds were clean and comfy, and I got an unbeatable rate considering it was easter-weekend. ~2~2~4~nan~2~2~3~3
review_6110050~“Great Hotel with an interesting location”~A friend of mine and I visited the Hotel in August 2002 and we really enjoyed our stay! We had a hotel room, which ovelooked the opera house and the bridge (Great full view)! The staff is very nice and very helpful, the location is very lively at night and we never got bored walking in the hotel area! Please note that when we were there there were quite a few strip joints in the area and there were people soliciiting clients to enter! That didn't bother us but if it bothers you don't go to this area! Furthermore, there are several restaurants and bars in the area and the place is lively all night long but you will not hear any noise from your room! ~5~4~4~nan~4~4~5~4
review_6004447~“Rooms have wallpaper on the ceilings!!???!!”~Stayed here for 3 nights. Reception staff were friendly. Room was tired and lacklustre. Even had wallpaper on the ceiling!! I'd stay here again, but I would request a room that overlooks the city rather than Kings Cross - which is a real grotty part of Sydney. If your room overlooks Kings Cross, then you will find it very noisy at night! I found it very hard to sleep. Staff were helpful with storing my suitcase and arranging transport to the airport, etc. ~3~3~3~nan~2~2~3~2
review_5957473~“Comfy at the Crest”~Ww stayed here for a week and loved it! The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a spacious room with 1 double and 1 single bed for the two of us with a great view of the tower. The hotel was a bit tatty, especially the bathroom where we had a permanent drip, and there was a strange smell in the corridor outside our room, but, apart from those minor details, we were really comfortable and relaxed. We were also glad to make use of the underground parking. The hotel offered a special offer for two people having breakfast which was very good value, but with so many alternatives we only had breakfast once at the hotel.  There was a great little pavement cafe next door to a bakery more or less opposite the main doors which served very reasonably priced but delicious food (also a very acceptable claret) where we ate cheaply and often.  The main beauty of this hotel is that everything you need is right there. Station, bus stops, supermarket, bars, cafes, restaurants, chemists, massages and most went on until very late so no worries about buying the bits and pieces that got overlooked during all that sightseeing.  Kings Cross is the red light district, and there were a number of adult entertainment venues, but the street was well lit and crowded, and as two females of a certain age we can say we felt perfectly safe and unmolested at any time of night. If you are looking for those little extra touches of luxury, I guess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for a reasonably priced. lively location with good transport links this could be the hotel for you. I hope to make a return visit before long, and although possibly due for a refurbishment, I really hope it doesn't change too soon. ~4~4~5~nan~2~3~5~5
review_5564368~“Dingy hole”~Arrived at hotel and taken to room that had a good view of the city on floor 6. Upon further inspection found dried blood (quite a bit actually) on duvet, rang roomservice to advise and made to feel like i was a nuisance. Walking into bathroom looked at the carpet to find someone elses disgusting toenail clippings, obviously not a great cleaner. 2nd night the power in room blew at 9.30pm, rang reception, (ours was the only room this had happened too, so it wasnt as though they were trying to help alot of others) half an hour later someone came to look - we are sitting in dark room waiting- he says he will be back shortly, rings and says power not able to be fixed that night pack up (in the dark) and they would move us to another room. Not impressed did as he said and waited another half hour until he finally came up with another key. We had been in a non smoking room, this time they moved us to floor 12 and overlooking the cross, noisy as hell especially coming from a room that was quite, also this was a smoking room.. No sorry kiss my ---- or anything from reception. All the carpets are stained and the wallpaper is ripped. Everything is old and needs a lot of work to bring it up to a reasonable standard. Around bath is disgusting all needs to be re sealed. Dont look too closely you might not like what you see. At $104 nz per night per person this place is far too expensive and would never stay again, would also advise others not to stay here. ~1~1~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3
review_5506101~“You Get What You Pay For”~Stayed for 3 nights during a trip from Africa to New Zealand. The hotel is old but cheap & comfortable. Staff were not you typical hotel staff but that made the stay better! The room maid kept everything very clean, the breakfast girls were always smiling and friendly and the front desk clerks couldn't do enough to help. Will stay there everytime I'm in Sydney! ~4~4~5~nan~3~5~5~2
review_4128934~“go for the breakfast”~We always stay here when we go to Sydney. It's right above Kings Cross station which is like one stop to the city. It's also a short walk to the Botanical Gardens or Oxford Street shopping strip. The rooms are big and comfortable. The staff are not very friendly but they do their job.  The major downside (for some) would be the location - although convenient with the train station and walking distance to good food etc. - it is not family friendly. If you are one of those people who gets intimidated by groups of youths who aren't white or advertisements for strippers, you will probably be severely put off. Unofrtunately that is what a big city is like and we don't mind that to walk through. The BEST bit is the buffet breakfast. They have everything you want and it's thrown in the price, it's the kind of breakfast you'd pay $35 for at another hotel. Sausages, bacon, eggs, cooked vegetables, cereals toasts, asian breakfast. And eat as much as you want. mmmm! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_3900561~“Rude Desk Staff and dull rooms”~I had a disastrous experience in Sydney.  It was weekend of the Big Match and all accommodation booked out. I found a room at a Backpackers in Pitt Street which was like a rabbit warren with what looked like a prison cell with a small bed and no window. I stayed there Saturday, but went looking for new hotel for Sunday to Wednesday when i was flying out. I booked using 'Hotels' the Crest and selected room with view of the bridge. Book out was 10 am so I took a taxi to The Crest. They said the room was not ready until 2PM, gave me a room on the 8th floor, and I left my luggage, including laptop, with them for storage with instructions that I will not return till 9pm or later, as I was going to visit my family, could they please put luggage in my room and prepare room for me to return to. At 10PM I return, to find a very rude desk clerk. I stand there saying, I need a key...he said I have one..I say I don't, that my room was not ready. He brings me an account from the spa bath to say I was there. 'Yes", I say, 'I was there because the room was not ready and I had to fill in a few hours before going to visit my family". He is not convinced. I get angry. I ask to see someone about a key. He finally gives me a key for room on second floor. I say I was on 8th before with harbour view.  Then I see my luggage still in the foyer tied with a chain. He unlocks the chain, and I stand there. I sayneed help with 3 cases to my room. He says there is nobody to help. I say if you take a bag and I carry 2 to the lift I can manage from there. He says it is not his job. I ask for help to find lift and room and again we have words. He takes me to the lift and it doesn't go. He takes my door card and puts it in lift..I have never seen door card for a lift before. I go up alone and find my room. It is very bleak. Brown with brown bedcover, and small bathroom. I look for view...and I can barely see the bridge. I feel sad. Its not nearly 10.30pm. I go downstairs and tell him I do not wish to stay there. He does not care...I pay for the spa...and I stand there wondering what to do. I walk outside...my luggage is still standing in the foyer... I see a Internet cafe next door, and ask how much. I go and get my luggage and place it by the door and go on Internet and look for another hotel....then my cousin calls to ask how I am and I tell her I have no-where to stay. She says take a taxi and come there...I hail a passing taxi and stay with her till I leave for Korea. I do not like the Crest Hotel and think that the night desk reception staff was very rude to me. You can see my photos at Artwanted where my artist name is Ladymaggic I also have a Sydney Album at Webshots Community.webshots.com/user/ladymaggic I have a travel page ----- where you can read about other places I have written about or visited. I have done much travelling and the Crest was the rudest I have ever met and its the first time i have walked out of a hotel ...at 10.30PM too in the night.

review_1895383~“Strategic Budget Hotel”~Front desk staffs were extremely friendly and helpful.They gave us tips on how to get around and shared with us many insights of the city. Nothing much could be said about the room as it  was kind of old and the flooring carpet was stained but liveable. Into the wee hours we were 'entertained' with lewdy slurs of drunks and pub patrons.Still,we fell into deep slumber after a while so it didn't bother us much. If you're looking for a budget hotel,this is a good pick as it's strategic to get around with the Kingscross station and bus stops only a few doors away.Accessing the eastern suburbs and city was easy as ABC.~3~3~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan

review_1368367~“Not Posh”~Hotel and furnishings seems a little dingy. The carpets seem old, abused and dirty. Wallpapered walls are greyish brown giving a depressing look to room. Hotel service attitude seems neutral. No facilities for kids. Soundproofing poor, especially in room with connecting door.Closeby outside on the street are drug addicts, pushers, ****, pimps, sleaze joints, dodgy-looking fast food shops etc. You need to take the subway (no lift), bus or taxi to reach main tourist locations in the city, or walk for 20 to 60 minutes. Many loud drunks on the streets on Friday and Saturday nights.A disappointment if you are used to international standard good 3 to 5 star hotels - if you are a tourist it's worth upgrading to a better hotel and location. OK if you're on a tight budget, without kids, and a bonus if you like ginseng baths and/or massage, or rough and sleazy bars.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
