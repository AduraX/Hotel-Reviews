review_479030572~“Perfect location”~We stayed here as we had tickets for Kinky Boots. The location is perfect, bordering Chinatown, across the road from Darling Harbour and Paddys Markets and a 5 minute walk to the theatre. The rooms are quiet, spacious and clean. Great coffee and brekkie, except the omelettes. Delightful staff but they need to sort out their checkins. We had to wait till 4pm to get into our rooms. If you are an IHG member you get free wifi~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_478823824~“Great Upgrade.”~Stayed at the HI for 3 nights, some 5 years since last visit. Not much changed in that time within the hotel as far as i could see. Excellent service as expected from front desk staff (greatly appreciated upgrade to corner suite). Well appointed and spotless rooms and bathroom with walk in shower. Breakfast buffet was very good in choice and quality. Reasonable bar menu in lounge area. Close to Chinatown, Markets, Central rail station, with Darling Harbor restaurants , bars and attractions 10 mins walk away. No hesitation recommending this hotel and location.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_475729877~“Staff Amazing! Suites are nice, very roomy and clean, great china town location.”~You can always expect with a Holiday Inn brand for them to be clean, friendly and in a good location, this hotel doesn't miss a beat. The Holiday Inn darling harbour is right next to Darling Harbor, and China Town in Sydney CBD area. Checkin was smooth, even to the point where the front desk assistance escorted me to the back elevator as there was a large checkin group using the main elevators! THANKS Hasan?? Breakfast can be busy and noisy, but there is plenty of food choices, fresh fruit juices and barista coffee at no extra charge. Book your breakfast when checking in and you can save! Using Ubers from the hotels are easy, download the app and they know exactly where you are, or there are taxis out the front if you want to pay a little extra. Walking distance to Darling harbour (4mins) and right next to china town and the markets. Internet worked fine, and it was fast! no issues. thanks for the upgrade and i will be back as a Spire member sometime soon!~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475690060~“Comfortable, clean, easy! ”~Holiday Inn is such a great place to have as your base. Especially if you're heading to the ICC as we were. It was barely a 5 minute walk to the venue and as we spent all day there it was very convenient.  Room was adequate, bed was comfy, you get a choice of soft or hard pillows so you can mix it up during the night if you feel the need. Bathroom is small but again you don't need much if all you're doing is coming back to the room to sleep and wash.  Had the usual tv channels and a gym as well.  Buffet breakfast was alright. Nothing exciting and probably could be a bit better but still adequate. I loved the juicer. The warm brekky was good but again, just not exciting!  Overall a good place to stay and wonderfully central for the darling harbour area. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475498062~“Close to the Harbour, Paddy's Market and China town”~The room was clean and spacious with a good shower and a view over the construction site. We had to go to Paddy's Market to get wi-fi as there was ONLY 30 free mins in the hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel but there were places close by and down at the Hardour. On a wet day the Maritime Museum is a good place go, to be honest you need more than a day. Don't go to the Zoo on a wet day as most of the animals stayed in their housed - wise!!~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_475308137~“superb location for China town food”~The room was spacious, clean and pretty smart ... also had a great view over the construction site ... which was interesting to be honest!

review_475225250~“very good hotel”~My daughter and I spent 5 nights at this hotel and were very pleased with it. It is only 5 minutes walk from the nightlife in Darling Harbour. Round the corner from Paddy's market and a couple of streets from little China It is about 20 to 25 minutes walk from Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable and the staff were excellent. The hotel was also very quiet. As we had room only I cannot comment on the food .~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_475024265~“Decent position on edge of China town.”~Stayed here for three nights at the end of a tour of New Zealand and Australia. Decent sized room with a recently modernised bathroom. No views to speak of but only ten minutes walk to all the restaurants and shops in Darling Harbour and Cockle Quay. Close to George Street and a thirty minute walk down to Circular Quay for ferries around and across Sydney Harbour with all the sights. Breakfast room is slightly small and gets congested at peak times but food was enjoyable. Bar is comfortable and bar meals good.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_474955529~“Well located in the city centre.About10 minutes walk to a subway station”~We were lucky enough to get a top floor room with quite good views over the adjacent construction sites. This suited me as I was a Civil Engineer before I retired. The room was a decent size, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom well equipped and clean. In short, everything I have come to expect from an IHG hotel. Will return on our next visit~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474770939~“Good Location”~This hotel is located approximately a ten minute walk away from Darling harbour and a twenty minute walk away from Circular Quay. We had a good sized room because we were upgraded due to being a reward member for the Intercontinental Hotel Group. The view from our window was over a building site but we weren't aware of any noise. This also gave us unlimited internet use in our room which was much appreciated. Friends of ours had a basic room and 15 minutes of internet in the lobby. We did not use the restaurant or bar so can't comment on this. I used the gym; this was functional but very small.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_474599372~“Good stay”~A few days in Sydney. I have a couple of customers to meet near Darling Harbour and in order to minimize travel, I booked this hotel. Location: walking distance to Darling Harbour and Chinatown. Two blocks away from George Street and very convenient indeed.  Room: Very basic. Old but fairly comfortable. Amenities very basic. I do not even have a pen to write on the laundry sheet.  Wifi: Good speed. Check in and out: Person not properly trained. There are more questions directed to me instead of how they can help. It was not a good experience after flying 12 hours and being tired when checking in. The same experience occurred when checking out. Recommendation: OK for a quick stay but if you have options to explore, give others a try as well.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474544488~“Nice location, large rooms”~The hotel has a good location close to the chinese gardens and darling harbor. Stayed in a large room unfortunately with zero view and vey small window. Breakfast in the hotel was very good. Would recommend this hotel but ask for a room with a view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474466904~“Close to darling harbour”~Walking distance to the sights and restaurant/bars of darling harbour. The hotel itself is clean and tidy, not ultra modern but still a good hotel. Easy layout with very helpful and friendly staff. Rooms were spacious and free wifi for IHG members. China town was right next to it with an abundance of restaurants, also short walking distance to shopping. I will be staying again as it's also walking distance to a lot of businesses in the area, mine was a ten minute walk. The only thing that let it down was no car park, but discount was given at one across the road.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_474383541~“One night at Darling Harbour”~We spent one night at the Holiday Inn, Darling Harbour and really enjoyed our visit. The checkin staff were very efficient and friendly.

We would certainly stay there again~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473983124~“Great location”~We stayed here for 3 nights whilst in Sydney. It is located right next to Paddys markets which has an Iga plus food and clothing places and then downstairs the market area. It is approximately 2 minutes walk to either Woolworths or Coles supermarket. It has the light rail just approx 30 seconds walk away and a 5 minute uphill walk to Central train station. It is also approximately 5-10 mins walk to Darling harbour and a 2 minutes walk to one of the ends of the ICC. The hotel was clean and neatly presented. The room was a good size and and was not too bad for the four of us. The bathroom was slightly older but was still serviceable. The beds were quite comfortable. There is a breakfast restaurant downstairs and then a restaurant for the rest of the day and night where you can get coffee and meals. The check in staff were friendly and helpful. To access the rest of the sydney city area you could catch public buses although you would need to walk about 2 minutes to find the buses. The hotel is directly linked cater across from the Chinese friendship garden.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473975967~“Chinatown”~All my usual hotels were either sold out or extremely expensive. I also had an early morning flight out. Chose to stay at this Chinatown Holiday Inn for a night. The internet worked fast but the room was unremarkable that unfortunately usually is the case with Holiday Inns. Could return if only quick overnight.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473948412~“Excellent ”~Everything about our 6 night stay at Holiday Inn Darling Harbour was great. To begin with the checkin staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Our room was spacious, comfortable and clean - recently refurbished, I believe. Despite construction works on the block across the road from our window, we heard very little noise thanks to good soundproofing in the hotel. We made good use of the hotel gym - don't be deceived that it looks small, it's very adaptable, and we successfully managed complete workouts. Location of the hotel was good - comfortable walking distance to Darling Harbour, close to the marketplace with its factory outlet stores, light rail, ferries and ample choices of food outlets/restaurants nearby. The food at both hotel restaurants was delicious and the service was very good. The price of our room was more competitive than most other hotels in the area, and we feel good value for money. This hotel is always busy, accommodating airline staff from 5 different airlines, so I'd suggest booking in advance. Overall we had a very comfortable and pleasant stay and would definitely return again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473510954~“Good rooms in the heart of Chinatown”~A clean, good sized room with massive king bed and a choice of pillows. Some Fox stations on the TV. There is a large construction site opposite but the noise is pretty low, ask for a room in a high floor. Failing that, they have earplugs if you need them (I always travel with them).  The staff are friendly and efficient. The check out area is often busy in the morning so I'd recommend organising it all the night before for a quick departure.  The only downside is the food selection. I got in very late and ordered from the 24 hour menus. The wedges I ordered were not good and I left a note next to the uneaten order, but there was no response to my feedback. Eat at one of the thousands of restaurants within metres of the hotel.  Travel safe :)~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_473269284~“Corner double double room”~Really spacious room with two double beds on the corner. Unfortunately there is construction right across the road at the moment so not much to look at but the noise didn't bother me at all. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. I haven't stayed here since before they took the monorail line away...so many years...and I was really happy to have stayed here again. It is a as close as you can get to Chinatown and is an easy couple of minute walk to the new ICC Theatre. Really enjoyed my stay and would stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_472795714~“Great Location”~We stayed here for two nights, upon check in we found that the staff excellent, the room was fantastic and the breakfast was great. The hotel is located in a great location with easy access to train stations, a short walk to darling harbour, and only 30 second walk to Patti’s market.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472782665~“Dated but a Great Location”~Stayed three nights and it is a great location if you want to explore Darling Harbour and Chinatown and it is an easy walk, about 15 minutes to the major department and outlet stores in George and Pitt Street. The hotel does not have parking but there is a commercial secure car park close by and guests get a discount. So that wasn’t a problem, we just parked out the front, checked in and dropped our bags off then parked the car. The staff were very helpful and the car park is only a 5 minute walk away. Our room was spacious and the night curtains worked well. The bed and the pillows were OK maybe due for replacement in the not distant future. The bathroom is dated and past its use by date, a little maintenance needed but it was clean.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_472735853~“Centrally located for activities”~The hotel looks as if it is in need of refurbishment and is bustling with people coming and going at all hours - the front desk is constantly busy and the manager on duty sits at the front ready to deal with any issues. Our room looked onto a side street and was quiet; while not large it was comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. There was a guest washer and dryer on site - great help when travelling for several weeks. We had breakfast at the hotel - there was a queue each day for seating and the tables turned around quickly with much noise and confusion at times. We chose not to eat in the bar/restaurant attached as we were right in the heart of Chinatown with many Asian restaurants on offer. The hotel is very close to the tram which goes straight to central station - ideal for finding our way to other parts of the city.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471832281~“Nothing good to report”~We stayed here for a night prior to a cruise. We were arriving late which I had advised by both phone and email. When we got there we were advised we didn't have a booking. It took a good 5-10 minutes to find our booking. We went to the room and unpacked, it was than we realised they put us in the wrong room. Paid for a king and given a queen. Tried to resolve, by this time it was late. It would be good if the staff were given more tools to resolve such concerns.  The room itself was dated and needs a refresh. The shower needed a good clean.  Wouldn't stay there again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471503242~“Good simple clean”~The Holiday Inn Darling Harbour is an older hotel and this is noticeable especially in the carpet and painting. However the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was good in the restaurant and there is a bar that serves meals as well. The amenities were fine except the toilet is in a strange spot with the shower directly in front of you and not much room to sit. There is a choice of pillows, the to had a reasonable choice of channels and the wifi was a strong signal. I enjoyed my stay and would come back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

My room, which was supposed to be 'superior' actually faced a wall, so I couldn't see the sky.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, the breakfast was good and there was a pleasant bar.

The room is comfortable and clean, we had a room with two queen beds and WiFi was available in room. The front desk always been very helpful to all lour needs.

review_471223959~“Basic style”~I stayed here for a week for a work commitment. The location was perfect as I was at the new convention center all week. The rooms and hotel quality are very basic and average. I would not choose to stay there if it weren't for work. The staff were pleasant but seemed bored and just doing a job. The restaurant for breakfast did not appeal. Buffet style so I skipped this in search of more interesting options. This hotel has potential to be cool and fun instead it's just a boring hotel. Rooms were adequate. Everything about the place is just adequate. There are so many innovative options out there. Holiday inn needs to take note.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470748546~“Very Busy Hotel in a Central Location”~The hotel location is the deciding factor for me in choosing this hotel as it is only a ten minute walk to my client in Surry Hills. Furthermore, since the hotel is located in the middle of Chinatown, you should not have any difficulty finding a place to eat--hopefully you like Asian food. I was upgraded to one of the corner rooms, which is a suite with separate bed and living rooms. Unfortunately the layout is rather odd. There is no access to the bathroom from the bedroom, so one has to go across the living room to get to the bathroom. Also, the room felt very dated with old fixtures, loose flanges and hooks, and damaged wall from the door slamming into it. There weren't any electrical outlet by the desk or the bed. (I know one shouldn't look at iPhone or iPad in bed, but still...). The bathroom is rather small. The tub/shower has that swinging-type tempered-glass screen that only covers half of the tub. What were the builders and interior designers having when they decided that such a thing was a good design idea?! I am, however, most disappointed with the housekeeping. The hotel was very busy, and it seemed the staff were rushing through the daily cleaning. The carpet in the hallway never looked completely vacuumed. And the housekeeping seemed to follow a confusing checklist, if there is any checklist at all. Empty shampoo bottles should not be removed, but apparently towels hanging on the hook should be replaced. Dirty dishes and utensils left on the dining table should be left as they were, but trash bin moved to another location should be moved back to its original place. (I intentionally moved the trash bin out from under the desk since I found myself banging against it each time I sat at the desk; the trash bin seemed to make its way to its original location every day.) And for several days, I seemed to be playing some kind of a game with the housekeeping staff. There was a dirty bath robe that I wanted removed from the room, so I put it on the bath tub. When I returned to the room, the bath robe was hanging together with the clean one on the same hook. The next day I put the robe in the tub with the dirty towel; when I returned to the room, that bath robe was nicely folded and put on the shelf. I tried one more time to get the bath robe out of my room, so I put the robe on the floor. When I got back to my room, that robe was hanging pretty in the closet. I decided to let them win this game I didn't know I was playing. The most alarming thing happened when the housekeeping staff left my room door open one day. The door could not slam shut if you just let it go; either the warped floor or door frame or door itself was preventing it to swing freely. You need to pull it and shut it tight. One day I returned to the room in the early evening only to find the door ajar. Thankfully, nothing was taken from my room, and the hotel staff fixed the door the very next day. But I wished the housekeeping staff had paid more attention.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_470213233~“Nice hotel but a bit pricey”~The hotel itself was very nice, staff were great and rooms a good size. I had booked two rooms, one king size for myself and a twin for my mum and friend. Both rooms were a very good size. Disappointed there wasn't anything in the mini bar - empty so you can fill it yourself! My bed was too soft but when I asked for the mattress to be changed they were able to put a board under the mattress which helped.  You are a good 7 min walk to Darling Harbour which is tiring after a long day sight seeing and I did think it was a bit pricey considering you are across from a building site and no mice views. Overall though a pleasant stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470210033~“Very convenient to ICC”~Great stay and close to ICC. Very friendly service. Walking distance to China town , CBD and Darling Harbour precinct. Rooms good.

review_469925619~“Rating 3 or 4 depending on price.”~Stayed here on a recent trip. Having never been to Sydney it seemed a safe option. On arrival the construction outside is off-putting. I know it's not their fault and there's lots of work going on around Sydney. Have to say though, it didn't disrupt our stay. We arrived early after a long flight . Room wasn't available but they stored our luggage.  Room, was big but a bit tired. Bathroom was a little shabby. Only 2 sachets of coffee for 2 people. Had to ask for extra every day. Location is good close to, but not overlooking Darling Harbour. Close enough to walk most places. Maybe I expected more from the Holiday Inn chain. The staff were, to a person, lovely and helpful. We got this at a good rate, so I was happy enough but the rates can be around 300 AUD and at that price, not for me.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469746996~“Very comfortable”~OK, so it is a four star Holiday Inn, and not a five star, but our bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, room very clean, breakfast excellent (although the restaurant where b/fast is served is quite noisy with lots of hard surfaces), and staff friendly.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_469510325~“Chose familiarity once again + fishing”~Decided to stay with Holiday Inn Darling Harbour which I have not done so before, as I am usually assigned to Four Points by our corporate administrator. Anyway, made the change and I am glad I did.  The location of this hotel is simply marvelous as I was just within 5 mins walk to the Darling Harbour. The services provided by the hotel is as usual, same as all the Holiday Inn hotels that I have come to like. Only peeve, if any, is that they only provide the toothbrush and toothpaste upon request unlike the Asian branches that I had been to. This trip, I actually bought a fishing license and proceeded to the harbour to fish. As I couldn't find any online info whether I am allowed to fish in the harbour, I proceeded with care and was always wary and ready to ask anyone of authority if fishing was indeed allowed. Anyway, I was fishing around cockle bay close to the aquarium. I was lucky to catch a 0.5m tailor on lure (which I released). I also managed to talk to a policeman later and learned that I can fish there as long as the security guards are ok with it. (apparently, the harbour is managed by the property management team around it) oh yah... the views outside my window aren't great now due to construction works.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468465670~“No frills, great location near Chinatown.”~The Holiday Inn Darling Harbour is a no-frills hotel. There were many tour groups staying there, so the small lobby is crowded a lot. It was always easy to obtain a taxi, but just walk a block and you are in Chinatown with some great food.  There is massive construction going on just across the street, but I did not notice any noise in my room. It makes things a little dicey, though, if you are trying to get in or out of the area.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_467172147~“Overall, I would be looking to stay somewhere else next time.”~We were disappointed in the room that we were offered at first - having paid for an "extra night" so that we could check in before 9am after a long flight we expected better than a ground floor room looking into a back alley covered in graffiti. Getting a reasonable room took a bit of persuading the staff to change the room. The location of the Holiday Inn is near Darling Harbour , but you cant see the harbour from the hotel, however its only a short walk away. The rooms at the front of the hotel overlook a large building site ( as at 2017) and I dont see how any of the rooms could offer a view of any interest. The restaurant , although quiet when we visited, told us that it would take half an hour to serve a simple steak - unless we wanted to cook it ourselves at the table on a hot stone. Fortunately, there are lots of restaurants nearby. Overall, I would be looking to stay somewhere else next time.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~4~2~nan
review_466524856~“Average Stay.”~First of all, the hotel does not have car parking, so you need to plan your trip accordingly. Secondly, it is about a KM from the Darling harbor. Breakfast was OK, I stayed there for 2 weeks and almost it was the same menu all through my stay. View from the room is not that great as some construction is going on. Apart from these negatives, it is an average stay.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan

review_465140000~“Great hotel close to city and conference centre”~I know that this place has had some bad reviews but I think people are being a bit harsh. It is a Holiday Inn not the Ritz.  I had a superior room on the 9th floor. Great amenities in the bathroom with all the things you would expect, good towels, soaps, shampoo etc. The room had iron and board, earplugs, laundry bags etc coffee making facilities, internet and desk facilities. I am not sure what people expect from a Holiday Inn but they provided everything i expected and it worked. The room was clean and the bed was firm with plenty of pillows with clean sheets and well presented. Decor is a little bit dull and boring but then it is a Holiday Inn not some 'uber hotel'.  Reception and room service were efficient and worked. There is a small workout room and all the equipment was working which is an amazing achievement with even the best 5* hotels not being able to always provide this. Is this hotel an amazing experience, no but it was functional well equipped and the hotel provided what they said they would do. If you want luxury hotels there are plenty in Sydney with luxury prices to go with them. This is a good, efficient, well equipped hotel and given the number of hotels I stay in over the last 30 years this was good value for money in Sydney.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_464710651~“Out of sync with other Holiday Inns”~I booked this hotel for our family vacation because of its OK location, expecting the usual Holiday Inn standard. As someone who does not have a lot of time to research these things and a long time IHG member I took the safe option. After spending one night (out of the four which we have planned), I can say that this hotel is really not up to Holiday Inn's standard which I've had chance to experience across Europe and Asia.  Things that were not ok: -overpriced room (~250-315 AUD/night without breakfast) -no Concierge and bell-boy service -worn-out look. The place really does need a facelift. -lot's of tiny flies in our bathroom which also had a funky odour Things that were ok: -breakfast, although it was more up to Holiday Inn Express standard  -friendly people at the IHG counter and at the breakfast restaurant.  My recommendation: look around, there are plenty of very good hotels nearby where you'll get better value for your money. After all, we did it and we spent the remaining 3 nights in an amazing place just 5 min away.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464545210~“Facing building site”~East walk to darling harbour. Hotel facing building site which was noisy. Room near laundry room , corridor smelt damp and stale. Stated that we couldn't join hotel loyalty scheme to get WiFi in room as part of a group. Luckily we are members in england so was given access. Breakfast disorganized, room too small for the amount of people staying in hotel. Had to queue for about ten minutes on first morning. Room was ok.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464178574~“Not amazing - makeover required ”~The Holiday Inn Darling Harbour is in a great location. Close to China Town and Darling Harbour, walking distance to Pitt Street Mall.  The staff are friendly, the bed was comfortable and the pillows are great.  However the rooms are very tired and worn out, the bathrooms need a make over.  The hotel is very expensive for what you get and also for the price we I thought breakfast should be included. It would be nice to get at least free bottled water in the mini bar.  Good spot but it needs work.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
