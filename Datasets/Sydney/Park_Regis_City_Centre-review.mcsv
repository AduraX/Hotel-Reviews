review_479011934~“Average Hotel”~An awesome view from the top level balcony was the highlight. Well located Hotel, close to Museum and Town Hall stations. The hotel is a bit out-dated and the bathroom looks very old and simple. The room was ok and evrything we needed.  Way too expensive for what you get on a weekend.~3~2~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_479011669~“Honest review - ok for a day or two but no longer”~I like to think I'm pretty fair when am reviewing hotels and also like to give them a chance to sort my problems, So having read your responses to guest feedback on trip advisor where often the hotel asks that they be made aware of situations at the hotel whilsts guests are still here I've a couple of points to note that I emailed to the manager during my stay pointing out I was not enjoying the Hotel, it's yet to be responded too!  1. My original room 1309 was horrendously dark and dreary and whilst I was moved to 1508 which is significantly brighter and nicer the essence of my room move was not understood. I asked to move as whilst I ordered a king room direct from your website believing I would get the best rate, the king bed is actually two single mattresses zipped together and being allergic to feathers as I am asthmatic the feather topper had to be removed a result of which the seam in the bed became very uncomfortable and disturbed my sleep. The room I was moved to had the very same issue, however can I take the time to applaud your housekeeper Zany who actually listened to my issue & put extra blankets on this bed, to lessen the seam impact, but it's still there. She also had done an immaculate job in cleaning the room for my arrival and took time to learn about what impacts my asthma - such as dust and chemicals, you have a valuable asset in that employee. 2. Housekeeping - I was aware it was Easter weekend, however having travelled the world during various public holidays and festivities I have never seen a hotel that announces bar replenishing of products (towels) there will be no housekeeping for 4 days. This is unacceptable for a number of reasons, mostly being I am asthmatic and your rooms are already rather dusty, I rely on the housekeeping to keep this dust at bay, and I would not dream of not cleaning the environment I'm staying in over a 4 day period. I've taken to wiping down the surfaces with a damp facecloth to remove the dust. Having paid over $700 for these 4 nights alone i find it ridiculous that you can hike your rates by so much for the Saturday night when no housekeeping is being provided. 3. Quiet rooms - when I was being moved rooms I did ask for a quiet room, however being next to an electrical cupboard where people are constantly coming and going cannot be considered quiet. 4. Roof terrace - you describe on your website as a haven, and I disagree, there are no where near enough seats, I spent some time up there good Friday in the good weather and realised it's just a place for smokers of the building to come! The seats that were there were soaking and you cannot access toilets, plus the pool was not clean and as such you could not use. This was a selling point for me for the hotel, probably one reason I booked your hotel over others, at extra expense. 5 wifi - as I'm sure you're aware 250mb daily limit is a joke, especially on the modern world, as stated I booked directly with you believing I would get better wifi but this is incorrect advertising on your website, I could have booked for less on a third party site and saved myself app £140. I specifically booked it as a relaxing place for an 8 night stay, but I feel I'm not the target demographic, as you probably target those only here for 1/2 nights, and who don't want to pay very much! If you get it cheap fine, but don't plan on spending there.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_478363972~“overnight in the centre of Sydney”~The room was spacious and the bed comfortable but there was a lot of street noise, yelling and sirens blaring and what sounded like ambulances arriving about 2am. I couldn't sleep well because of the noise.~3~3~4~1~3~4~3~nan
review_478073781~“Quick sydney trip”~Tidy and clean room staff very friendly and helpful. Water pressure in showerrwasn't ver good. 5 minute walk to convention centre for a concert we attended. Close to restarants and shops great spot was perfect for a quick trip~4~3~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_477597020~“Great value for money”~The Park Regis is a great place to stay, right in the heart of the city, friendly and I have to say the housekeeper was amazing, she was just delightful.  I was in Sydney for a course so the location was perfect for me and the accomodation suited my needs.~4~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_477304868~“Saturday night stay”~I had a great experience staying at this hotel. It is in the heart of Sydney close to everything you could possible want. The best part of the stay was the friendliness of staff and the location of the hotel. There was nothing I disliked~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_476657105~“Busy Sydney”~i booked this as the city was extremely busy at the time. The room was very small and very noisy as it was located near the lift. The hotel is centrally located. Would prefer to book another hotel but it was sufficient for just one night.~3~3~4~2~2~3~4~nan
review_476642796~“Good location”~Good location, Cafe next door, 7 11 right next door, 2 min walk to train station. NOTE: they charge $2 per bag to leave your bags once you check out, never experienced this with a hotel before and have traveled all over the world~4~4~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_475956306~“Great inner city stay”~Location is very convenient and the rooms are very serviceable and clean. It is also great the the lower floor rooms have opening windows which allows fresh air. There are many food and bar outlets nearby and the hotel is very close to public transport. Highly recommend~4~4~5~5~4~4~3~nan
review_475745093~“Central Location!”~Room upgrade which was great! Comfortable beds. Clean room - bathroom a little too small. Terrific city view. Central location - easy access to Town Hall railway station and walking distance to Darling Harbour. Late check out fee charged! Not much joy at the reception desk. :-(~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_475126562~“Paying for location”~Staying at this hotel you are basically paying for the location. Providing you want to be close to Sydney's main attractions and you will be only spending minimal time at the hotel, go ahead and book. If you are looking for any bells and whistles or luxury then this place is not for you. it was clean and basic and I had no complaints but the photos definitely make it look at lot better than it is. However, considering I was out sightseeing most of the 3 days I was here, it was enough for me.  I will mention a couple of things I was disappointed about: - The pool was dirty and there were NO lounge chairs to sit on. Or any chairs at all surrounding the pool for that matter. Considering I didn't want to sunbake up against a brick wall nor swim in a pool full of bugs and leaves, I decided to boycott it. - The shower had crappy water pressure Otherwise, the staff were friendly enough and it met my needs of a half decent place to sleep for the night.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_474922401~“Colin's Excellent 1 night Stay.”~Have stayed @ the Hotel before when visiting Sydney, whenever I need to stay in the city I like to stay @ accommodation which is close & handy to where I have to go etc... Park Regis with its central position is ideal. With its reasonable rates, excellent service & very good clean rooms its the ideal place to stay when visiting the city.~4~4~4~4~5~5~4~nan
review_474853848~“Very regretful a backpackers would have been better.”~Absolutely terrible, you could hear the elevators going up and down all night, staff were rude, bed was uncomfortable, would not recommend anyone i know to stay there. A backpackers would have been better then staying here.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_474811096~“Great location”~Clean room very friendly staff, would stay here next time. Was able to check in early. Breakfast available next door, within waking distance to shopping and China town. So close to town hall train. Recommend~4~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_474419942~“Good place in great location”~We stayed here overnight in Sydney. The hotel was in an awesome location, walking distance to everything plus bus stops right outside the door and one block to the train. The room was small but as it was only to sleep for one night it was perfect. Clean and everything you needed.~5~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473964564~“Great find”~Location was great close to everything that one goes to the city for. Room was small but still workable and was clean and comfortable, very dark for sleeping and quiet even when facing the main road, I was concerned about noise from the lifts but once settled for bed it was fine. This was a great find and I will be back again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473940448~“Do NOT stay here!!!”~Toilet seat and toilet roll holder broken in room, shower doesn't work / no hot water. The beds are grotty and also broken. Reception staff horrible avoid avoid avoid!! Would have been better off in backpackers. Worst experience I've ever had.~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_473935245~“Happy guest”~From the very beginning of my stay the staff were friendly, helpful and very welcoming.  The room was great. Had everything I needed. Bed was comfy. And it was nice to have a hot shower in a hotel for once. I was very happy with my stay. Even the cleaning staff I came across while walking through the hotel and catching lifts were all so nice and friendly. The only downfall was there was no restaurant or room service. I know this is because there are restaurants/cafes near by but when you just want to relax in your room after a long and busy day it would be nice to have the option to order room service. Its a shame that the people in the cafes nearby aren't as lovely as the hotel staff~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473482417~“Michael L”~Excellent location which suited our needs. Close to transport and dining. The staff were friendly. The room although small was comfortable and clean. The bath room had hot water with good pressure for the shower.~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_473285526~“Not a Place for Business Travelers”~I was here on a business trip. On the booking portal it was mentioned that their hotel is best suited for business travelers. Close to all the major spots in town. Receptionist was not friendly, very tough. Rooms are too small than shown in the photographs.~1~1~4~3~1~2~3~nan
review_472777997~“Fit for purpose”~Park Regis hotel rooms are very clean and tidy and quite comfortable enough for a nights stay. The lifts were very noisy and could be heard from the room but on the whole this did not detract from getting a decent nights rest prior to work the next day. plus there is a Starbucks on the nearest street corner!!~4~3~4~3~4~5~5~nan
review_472773943~“Park Regis”~The position was very convenient for my work conference. It is close to restaurants, public transport and Hyde Park. Nice views from the roof. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful, thanks.~4~5~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_472587011~“Decent enough for one night”~Stay was decent enough for one night. Rooms were not very nice, but I suppose you get what you paid for and $130 doesnt get you very far. Staff were not very helpful - any question asked was met with a response that implied I was an idiot.~2~2~3~3~3~3~2~nan
review_472575178~“Convenient”~Good location, it was a last minute booking. Would like a room that didn't have common wall with lifts next time. I would stay again but would use tri ago again to get a cheap deal as full price is too expensive~4~3~4~2~4~4~4~nan
review_472396686~“Absolutely satisfied!”~The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everything was very enjoyable and the location was ideal! The hotel also offered a host of interesting excursions and trips which I could unfortunately not profit from. Maybe next time!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472299641~“Average hotel”~We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights. The location is great. It is walking distance to Pitt mall ( Westfield where the Sydney is located), St. Mary's Cathedral, Hyde park, Darling harbour, Woolworth, cafés and restaurants. It is quite old hotel with small size elevator. I had a hard time in adjusting the hot/cold shower. There is a limited tv channel. The view in the roof top (44th floor) is stunning. Free wifi is limited to 250mb a day.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_472261965~“OK, common areas very, very, very tired”~For a cheaper hotel in the CBD it is OK. The area it is in is convenient and the hotel works as a place to sleep. It has no ambiance whatsoever, it is old and tired and the staff don't really care ( I suspect the ones that still care a little bit won't care at all after much longer). In short the property is in need to a radical remodel and also some re-invigoration of the management to give the whole place a bit of life. Even a lick of paint in the horribly dated and banged up common areas would make a significant difference.~3~3~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_472222710~“Conference trip”~The room was basic, bed was ok, no food available. Clean room the toilet ran all night. The shower lacked pressure but was warm. I think the price is expensive for what you get. The photos do not reflect the room.~3~2~4~3~3~4~3~nan
review_471976300~“Great place to stay, handy to everything.”~Budget hotel with a big hotel price. Very comfortable though and close to public transport, eateries and pubs....Queen Victoria Building prob has everything you'd ever need and Town Hall station. Circular Quay is 2 stops away and the Rocks is a great place to visit. Also Darling Harbour is close by and the casino for all you high rollers and Centrepoint tower is a short walk to get the size of Sydney from a high point. Enjoy your stay.~3~3~5~4~3~5~5~nan
review_471771810~“Nasty Bathroom”~The bathroom was a bit nasty, i had to open up the window for releasing the moisture atmosphere otherwise small bugs and bacteria would be propagated, but just after a while for the opened window, insects began to flew in. Other than the bathroom environment everything is good.~3~3~5~5~4~2~4~nan
review_471514914~“Poor worst experience”~Do not ever stay in park Regis city center. Personally I won't recommend to anyone and I won't go back to that hotel.  Smelly room Loud air conditioning Small and dirty place Old room Pillows are flat and smelly~1~1~2~1~1~1~1~nan
review_471501936~“Very disappointing. Avoid if at all possible”~Would not recommend this hotel. Old, quality poor, basic things like air con, bed quality, cleanliness and noise levels were all significantly below expectation for a room of this price. At less than $200 per night location is good.~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan

review_471049069~“Stay in Sydney at Park Regis mHotel”~A neat, clean room  as hotel is getting quite old it is not as luxurious as more modern ones. The rooms are not very big,but clean, comfortable and adequate for a short stay. The price was excellent for the room compared to many other properties in Sydney. Also can't beat the location, central CBD . Shopping, Restaurants, entertainment~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_471006691~“Very average poor customer service”~We were informed prior to booking that parking was included in hotel fee. We were not informed otherwise until we checked out and were about to get back in the elevator to go in the car park. It was $45!!!~2~1~5~3~2~4~1~nan
review_470957280~“short stay”~Clean rooms with basic furniture, but comfortable. Bed was very comfortable, bedding was crisp white cotton sheets, central location, easy to get to public transport, a bit noisy with traffic, would stay again~4~4~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_470794633~“Adequate hotel but not an enjoyable one”~We stayed here for a night after a late flight into Sydney, and we were glad to be leaving after just one night. The hotel is very run down despite what you see in the pictures online. The bathrooms are very dated and the hallways and elevators looked a bit dirty, but I have to point out that the bedroom itself was decent and clean. The location is great but that is about the only positive. My advice would be to fork out a little bit extra for a better hotel in the area, this one is not cheap enough to be worth it.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470486662~“Weekend stay”~Comfortable accommodation good room clean and well maintained. Reception is helpful. Location is excellent and convenient to busses and train. Hyde Park close. Lift doors are a bit quick to close. Enjoyed the stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470415720~“Park Regis - great staff, good location, expensive for the size of the rooms”~The location of the hotel is great but the price was high based on the quality of the rooms and bathroom. The staff were friendly and helpful. Charging for left luggage even for a few hours felt a bit unfair after the price we paid for the accommodation.~3~3~4~3~3~4~5~nan
review_470168307~“Comfortable and conveniently situated”~Another review which I'd give 3.5 to if I could! Sydney City Centre convenience, 2 minutes walk from the train station the same for Hyde Park and Pitt street leading straight down to Circular Key... A comfortable room at an affordable rate for Sydney City centre and a swimming pool on the 45th floor!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470146692~“Worst hotel yet....”~Filthy and dirty, tiny rooms, what appeared to be dried blood on duvet and looked like it was never properly cleaned. The reception staff brushed it off and the room was never Serviced. Never again will I stay~1~1~3~1~1~1~2~nan
review_469714217~“Way overpriced for a mediocre hotel”~The hotel was rather shabby and run-down looking, but I'll forgive that. The rooms had most of the basic amenities a traveller would need (kettle, fridge, safe, iron, hairdryer), and although the bed wasn't great, it was okay for a night or two. There was a fair amount of noise from the street (I was on the 8th floor - may have been quieter from an upper floor). There was no restaurant or room service, though, so all-in-all, this feels like an inexpensive 3 star hotel. But because of the lack of accommodation rooms in Sydney, they are able to really over-charge (I paid more than $300 a night, way too much for the room quality). But what really annoys is their habit of then charging little extras on top of their fees, the sort of little extras you'd expect to pay for at a $20 a night hostel, not when you've already paid hundreds (like charging $2 per bag if you want to leave your luggage at the hotel for a few hours after checkout). Nickle-and-dime-ing, which feels so unnecessary and annoying.  And their wifi is pretty bad - you get 250MB free per day, which is sufficient to check emails, etc., but not to stream content, however their wifi system has a habit of thinking you've used it when you haven't (I checked a couple of emails one morning then went out for the day, then when I returned that afternoon it said I'd used all my data. When I queried it at the front desk, they told me that unless I logged out of the wifi network before I closed my web-browser or email system, it would think I was still using data and keep deducting from my balance - which doesn't even make any sense). So I had to buy additional data, and that is even more annoying because they sell it on a subscription basis - you have to first notice this in the fine print, then remember to log back in to the website where you purchased the data and cancel the auto-renewal, or you'll find you're charged again after you leave the hotel. What idiot thought that was a good idea for selling a service to an inherently transient population?~2~1~4~3~3~4~3~nan
review_469710886~“Sydney stay”~Looked for central place to stay on booking site. Hotel was spartan compared to what listing promised and we never did find the pool (elevators not labelled). But bed and bedding were superior and we slept well.~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_469523259~“Average Hotel”~While the hotel itself was fine, I was disappointed by the fact that after checkout we had to pay $2 per item for left luggage (despite having just paid hundreds of dollars for our stay). The hotel advertised wifi in the rooms, it is capped at 250MB per day for all your devices, you also have to collect a daily password from reception to use it. While internet may not be important to others, the inclusion of free wifi had been one of our reasons for picking this hotel over others in the same price range/area.  I also felt that the bathrooms were misrepresented in the photos on the hotel's website, it is not a full shower, rather just a dip on the bathroom floor and shower curtain so it was unavoidable that the entire bathroom ended up flooded.  We also found that many of the reception staff were quite unfriendly, especially when we tried to raise the issue of the $2 per bag for left luggage.  The location was fantastic, and from there it was very easy to walk around the centre of the city and utilise the public transport.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_469504179~“Absolutely disgusting, do not stay here!”~Nothing like the photos online! Paid over $200 for one night, only to be met by the smell of bleach and mould. Air was really musty and the edges of the carpet were caked in dust, everything was filthy. There was pubic hair on the bed and feces in the toilet. It turned my stomach just being in the room. More of a backpackers than a large inner city hotel. Ended up being moved to a bigger room down the hall which was a lot better but still not up to par. The window frame was broken and hanging off and it was poorly maintained and needed a good clean. I ended up catching the train home that night. A complete waste of money! I've read reviews on here that are similar to mine dated years back, so nothing has changed. Very, very disappointing!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469485565~“Not a clean hotel”~Was really unimpressed with this hotel. Horrible smell in the hallway and rooms. Bathroom in the room was not clean. Dirty tissue was on the floor upon me entering the room. Very dated furnishings and old windows.~2~3~3~3~2~2~3~nan
review_469266408~“Not Value for Money”~Staff were helpful but the room was unclean including the toilet and smelt moldy. We were upgraded which was better but a shame things like broken window frame and dirty curtains spoiled the nicer room. Needs some TLC~2~2~5~2~3~1~5~nan
review_469225466~“Average hotel”~Wouldn't stay here again. It's more of a dirty motel then the hotel it claims to be. Was very disappointed that the rooms weren't as they claimed. And the fact that we got downgraded to a room with no air-conditioning on a 35°c day is ridiculous. 100% would not recommend or stay here again.~1~1~4~2~2~2~1~nan
review_468938036~“Great location and clean rooms”~The location was excellent right in the heart of the city and not far from public transport. Next door there are coffee shops, pubs and food outlets. Easy walk to most central parts of the city. There are 2 railway stations within a short 5 minute walk. Hyde Park and Martin Place are also close by. The rooms whilst not large were comfortable and clean.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
