review_478320447~“Great weekender”~An excellent spot to stay for a couples weekend or one away with a group of friends. Opposite the beach & park. Very easy walk to all restaurants & the coastal walk. Rooms on the small side, have toaster, microwave & jug if you want to make a quick snack. Bathroom compact, good parking facility.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477863388~“Great Little Find”~Spent four nights at Coogee Sands with my husband and two teenage daughters. Arrived early and was able to check in straight away which was fantastic as we were a couple of hours early. Apartment was huge and although older, spotlessly clean with ample toiletries, towels and TOILET PAPER( thank god no running out). The apartments are so convenient, a few steps to the beach, bus stop and cafe's. Really refreshing to have reception staff look like they enjoy their job and ALWAYS acknowledge you as you enter or leave reception with a smile and a chat about your day. Absolutely loved being able to use the complimentary beach towels, no more wet sandy towels dragged around the apartment. Housekeeping noticed we had two teenage daughters with long hair and kindly gave us a couple of extra shampoo's, very thoughtful as its's the little things that will bring you back. Only one complaint which i have noticed not only at Coogee Sands but other hotels, the lack of seating. Four large people in a huge room with one tiny two seater lounge . Couldnt really relax as a family as three of us had to sit on the floor. Will definitely return in the future.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476922620~“One night ”~Had an amazing welcome from the lovely receptionist Stacey & room was beautiful with stunning view on beach! 100% go back. Beautiful coastal walk and shops are local also. Little shop right next door too hotel so it easy to pick up snacks.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475440312~“Great location on the beach!”~We stayed for one night at the Coogee Sands hotel. The room was clean and a generous size and the bed was comfy. The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming and the location is fantastic... right on the beach and with numerous cafes and restaurants nearby. The free undercover parking was a bonus and we were able to check out and leave our car in the carpark whilst we went off to a cafe for brunch. As we were only staying the one night, we choose a standard room with no balcony or view which was great value for money, however, if we were staying longer, I would definitely spend the extra money and book a room with a balcony and view. The only downside was that the rooms were not very soundproof and we could clearly hear the people in the next room from quite early in the morning... not ideal when you are holidaying and want to sleep in past six am! Other that that, I would certainly recommend this hotel.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474862044~“Great location but disappointing apartment”~Advertised as a luxury studio apartment, this was simply a large motel room with a microwave. No small stovetop, no cooking utensils (even for microwave), and no small table and chairs. Only place to eat was on a bench, centimeters from poorly positioned TV screen.  Bed was uncomfortable, needing a mattress topper or replacement.  Fabulous location right on Coogee Beach. Not good value for money.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474835297~“Hospitality : Excellent"”~Had a lovely stay with the family , kids slept on fold out and were very comfy. Great Location, very beautiful and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. A lot to do in this area and if you need public transport to explore its just out your door. Busus and Taxis available when ever you are. Having underground parking available was a bonus has its hard to find parking in Coogee for FREE. Will be staying there again. WE will be back!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474400230~“Fantastic Location”~Nice room - very clean and good amenities. Next time I would request a room with courtyard though. Excellent location right on Coogee Beach with the baths, beautiful walking tracks/boardwalk with terrific views.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_473312244~“Lovely!”~Had a great stay at this hotel. I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to a sea view room. Really convenient with the car park underneath. Very clean with helpful, friendly staff. Would have been good to have free wifi throughout stay. Only get limited amount per day. But there is a cafe below the hotel which has free wifi so not the end of the world.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468824847~“Be near the Beach - it's worth it !”~We chose Coogee Sands Hotel and Apartments for a two night stay in Feb 2017 and were very pleased with our choice. The location is very very good. Our second floor room was spotlessly clean, spacious and comfortable with a balcony. There was an in room kitchenette with fridge, kettle, microwave, dishes, cutlery and glasses. We liked the quality of the toiletries provided. The staff on the front desk were very friendly, and very helpful, taking in our luggage as we arrived too early, which allowed us to get out and start checking out the area right away. We loved the vegetation in the park area in front of the beach .. and the beach itself is just amazing. There are always lots of people around, walking dogs, running and swimming. You can walk along the trail that winds along the coast, and the views (from the top of the little hill) of the rocks and the ocean were stunning. There are plenty of places to eat in the area, including the Pavillion right next door. There is a terrific take away spot where the buses all stop, and McDonald's is close by as well if you wish. We took a bus into downtown Sydney for a day of sightseeing, and although a 30 minute ride, it was easy because downtown is the end of the line going in, and Coogee Beach is the end of the line coming back. Simple. Wish we had longer - this hotel is definitely a comfortable home base for all your sightseeing in Sydney. Much better than the much more costly, concrete choices of downtown Sydney.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468255003~“Don't stay on weekends unless you sleep well through loud music”~Clean and spacious room, comfortable bed. We had a third floor room with a view of a brick wall. As it's right next to Coogee Pavilion we got a lot of noise on Friday and Saturday night. If you either sleep well though an incessant thump thump thump beat, or at the place dancing to thump thump thump music, or too pissed to care and you can sleep through anything then this is the hotel for you. Great location but was more like a glamorous backpackers than a luxury hotel. Other much nicer places to stay in the area without the background music.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_467974292~“Clean room and friendly staff. ”~My wife and I recently spent a night here.  We had. Room with a partial sea view which was just fine.  The Coogee Sands is in a busy area of Coogee which is very handy if you enjoy the beach, great walking areas, nice restaurants and nightlife.  The room was very clean and well fitted out. The staff were very friendly and I would definitely recommend staying here but make sure you book a room with a partial or full sea view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467746142~“Great location, great servicd”~We spent just a night here, having flown into Sydney that afternoon before heading off in a road trip down the NSW South Coast. It was easy to find, brilliantly located right by Coogee Beach and the reception staff were very welcoming and helpful. The only reason I didn't rate this hotel a 5 was our room's bathroom and the hallways are a bit tired and the noise from the surrounding air conditioning units outside was noisier than than surf crashing on the beach. So despite the warm, humid March night, we had to sleep with the window closed. On the plus side, the room's air conditioning was really quiet. We'd certainly stay here again. Had fantastic meals at Coogee Pavillion next door and a bakery/cafe on Coogee Beach Rd, as well as a fantastic walk up in the park before setting off on our road trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467373642~“Absolutely Fabulous”~Myself, my husband and daughter stayed here for a Saturday and Sunday night, we had a room with a balcony that had ocean views. We thought the rooms might be noisy because the property is right next to the Coogee Pavilion but we were very pleasantly surprised that the sliding door cut out virtually all noise. The room was comfortable and clean. The kitchen was great, especially having the bench space and microwave, fridge, kettle etc. The staff were fantastic and were very helpful and accommodating. The parking was easily accessible and had wide spaces to fit all types of cars. We really loved the fact that you didn't need to cross the busy road to get to the beach, you just walked out of the Hotel and you were virtually on the beach. I loved that the stairs between the floors were open so you didn't have to always take the lift. The Hotel is very close to the bus (373) that takes you straight into Circular Quay (takes 30 mins) which we took on the Sunday - very cheap for a family ($10.70 for three of us). The best thing about the whole place was the access to the rooftop balcony!!! OMG it was fantastic!!!! We took our wine and snacks up there for our "Happy Hour" each night and watched the sunset and took lots of photos. We really loved it at the Coogee Sands Hotel and will definitely come back, we won't stay anywhere else in Coogee again!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467339504~“Great location, beautiful views!”~My wife and I stayed here last June. Unfortunately we were only there for a day. Great views and right next to the beach walk. I would assume it can only be better during the spring/summer. Front desk was very friendly. We forgot a few of our things when we checked out and they were kind enough to hold them for us until we were in the area again! You can hear a bit of noise from outside with all the people partying next door or hanging out at the park but it's not too bad. I would consider staying here again if we were in the area.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467073426~“Great Place”~My wife and I stayed here for a week, Great places to eat and great transport hub did not have to take the car in to town at all. Clean Rooms had a balcony and had great views of the ocean. Would stay there again~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_463999736~“Perfect location, great views, nice apartment”~We stayed in a beach view balcony self catering apartment for 5 nights in February 2017.  Staff were lovely, the room was spacious, bright and clean, as was the bathroom with shower, not bath. Kitchen facilities were very limited (sink, fridge, microwave, kettle, no hot plate) and not much crockery or cutlery (although I did hear someone ordering a hot plate and frying pan for their room so it might be available but not advertised). However as there were many restaurants and takeaways nearby this wasn't a problem for us. There are no bed and breakfast or bar facilities at this hotel although they do have a chargeback arrangement with some of the local restaurants. Coogee was a lovely, lively, friendly and safe feeling place as a base for a few days. But one or two of the days the bay was plagued with bluebottle jellyfish which limited sea bathing. However there are some seawater pools along the far side of the beach which were less affected. The pavilion bar and restaurant next door also sold takeaway food and drinks. However, this was extremely busy and hectic and (take note) very noisy till about midnight at the weekends. This didn't bother us unduly as we were only there Sunday to friday and kept patio doors closed on Sunday night. From Monday it was quiet. The bed was very comfortable and large, and there was a sofa in the room, plus balcony furniture. TV had a good range of programmes including CNN and Sky news. The balcony was a lovely place to sit and watch the bay activity so if your budget stretches, go for a front facing balcony room.  There was also a lovely roof terrace complete with comfortable seating and barbecue equipment for use by guests. Buses ran very frequently from just across the road into Sydney and other places, which was a bonus. The blue ones take cash but they prefer you to get the equivalent of an Oyster card (Londoners understand) and top it up. This can be bought in Sydney where the bus stops at Circular Quay. It took between half and three quarters of an hour into Sydney, depending on traffic. We were very happy with the hotel and its position. Being able to get into the centre of Sydney so easily was a bonus.  Checkout time at the hotel was 11 am but if you had a late flight you could pay 20 dollars an hour to extend your stay in the room if it wasn't booked. Unfortunately ours was and hotel was then fully booked. As we wanted to stay on the beach for the day we had hoped they could offer shower and changing facilities at the end of the day but they could only offer a small cloakroom for changing clothes. Given the locality, it would be nice if the hotel could consider providing s shower room as many flights don't leave till 9 or 10 pm and the airport is only half an hour away. We overcame this by spending the day at wonderful Wylies pool (along the seafront) which for a small entrance fee provided a lovely place to spend the day, have lunch and a hot shower. Please see separate review. PS I would have given 5 stars except for the lack of shower facilities, minimal kitchen equipment and the weekend noise from next door. But all in all a lovely place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463417121~“Great location”~We stayed here last week while spending a couple of days in Sydney. The hotel is in a great location with good public transport options to the Airport and the City. Staff were helpful and held on to our suitcases after we checked out so we didn't have to carry them around all day before going to the airport.  Not a big problem but the free wifi cap of 100mb was a bit frustrating as we needed go and find somewhere with wifi to organise our travels. We had a musty smell in our room - it was room 201 right at the end of the hall so could be one of the damper rooms.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~5~nan
review_462571836~“What a view!”~I visit Coogee twice a year and go somewhere different each time. This week I ventured to the Coogee Sands- and have to say it's my favourite hotel yet. My room had a comfortable bed, a sofa, a kitchen- everything I needed and more. The bathroom was great too- it had a little clothes line in the shower- perfect for beach side! My room didn't have a view but that wasn't an issue- as the sundeck on level 6 was open to everyone. The views from the deck were amazing. I sat there in the sun and even got a bit of study done- just a lovely place to be. I did trip twice, going into the bathroom (as it's at a slightly higher level), but that was the only thing that bothered me. Staff were lovely. Location brilliant. It's my new favourite place in Coogee :)~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460791084~“Nice weekend away in a beautiful location!”~Coogee Sands is a great spot to stay at when in Sydney. It's right on the beach and close to many facilities and events. The staff are very nice and are a pleasure to deal with! The hotel is well furbished and the lobby is very nice. We highly recommend this hotel when in Sydney also due to the easy access to public transport, taxis and restaurants.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460573920~“Over night stay”~Stayed for one night to help a sick family member in hospital. Close proximity to POWH. Reception staff friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a partial ocean view room which had view of wedding cake island. Lovely clean room and decor, comfy bed and pillows. Nice cool aircon. Very close to the beach. Well appointed mini bar and snacks. Recommend for short or long stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460227521~“Vacation”~Great place to stay to the East of Sydney. We had a bright studio room looking good over Coogee Beach with a lovely terrace. Room serviced daily and communal areas kept spotlessly clean. Free parking but slightly dodgy free Wi-Fi. Only downside is late noise coming from the Pavilion next door. But trade that for convenience of a good place to eat, drink and have Gelato albeit at crazy prices.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459568519~“Lovely stay!”~Yes it's a little bit dated but the room was very clean, with comfy beds and lovely linen. From the arrival to departure the staff were super polite and helpful. There were cleaners polishing the front doors and lifts frequently, very impressed. On arrival the air conditioner seemed to be dripping. One call to the front desk and it was rectified by the time we arrived back to our room. Our room 411 was quiet with only the occasional noise from doors slamming. It's not 5stars but I would recommend a stay there, and having "The Pav" next door for drinks on the roof top bar, and food/ good coffee downstairs was an added bonus!~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_459541809~“AVOID AT ALL COSTS - WALLS ARE PAPER THIN AND COACKROACHES IN THE HOTEL”~The only thing good about this hotel is the location, nothing else. The walls are paper thin, you can hear the other guests watching tv, taking a bath or even peeing! We saw several crickets in the rooms and two huge coackroaches! Charging like a 5 star hotel but being worst than a hostel!~1~1~5~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

It's on the beach and within easy walking distance of all the local restaurants and night spots. Our room was comfortable and well equipped as was the bathroom.

review_458420342~“Close to all facility's ”~Great hotel and staff friendly be sure to ask for towels when you head to the beach also my only gripe was the poor internet connection and slow to load  Otherwise it's a great place to stay we opted to call the hotel and ask for any specials and we booked a few months ahead and although there were no specials they were happy to give us complimentary breakfast voucher to the local cafe  thanks~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457489728~“No Complaints”~I just wanted to thank the staff for their care and outstanding service during our recent stay. I was travelling with my 88 year old mother who has extremely limited mobility. The staff went out of their way to accommodate her needs including finding me a park right next to the entrance to decrease her travelling distance to the lift. The helpfulness and caring attitude certainly made my trip a lot easier and very pleasant. Thank you~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_451838348~“Great location”~No complaints. Quick checkin, friendly staff, free parking(!), awesome location. Rooms are fine, clean and equipped. Bed was comfy and big. There was a kitchenette but we didn't bother using it. Would happily stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451609174~“By The Beachside”~We stayed for 4 nights and found the location superb. Metres from popular Coogee beach which is both clean and patrolled by lifeguards. Great walking paths along the coastal area too. Staff were nice and helpful. We stayed in the deluxe courtyard room. The room was clean in general and enough space needed for a cosie stay. The bed was very comfy, even two pillow choices. Free WI FI and TV with FOX. The kitchenette is limited and the bathroom "small" both in need of an update but clean and functional. There’s really good transport service to the CBD with bus stop only 2min walk away - its 25 min bus ride to the city or good bus options to Bondi Junction/beach. From Sydney airport a taxi ride approx $35 + tolls. Great eateries options nearby with our fav being; La Spiaggia. We would go back.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_451366719~“Great location!”~The location of this hotel is fantastic, but it is a no frills, basic hotel.

review_447654683~“Actually September 2016 I stayed there! ”~I was there for one night during the week. The staff were professional and friendly. The room was as clean as you can expect any property that resides by the sea salt. LoL. I love this place, and it gives the Crown a run for its overpriced rooms!.  Oh don't forget the Dolphin Pavilion next door. Awesome pizzas, beer and pokies.  Had a great time, looking forward to my next stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446894288~“Perfect for a place away from the City Centre”~We have chosen this place about 6 times when we go to Sculptures by the Sea. One of the reasons is that we need to leave the car somewhere, and here they have a secure carpark and there is no fee. It's also easy to get express buses into the city for business purposes. The room has always been clean and adequate for our needs. There are plenty of eateries nearby but the Irish Takeaway Seafood place on the same street tempts you to eitehr sit and eat in the nearby park or take it to the room. The staff are helpful and smile!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_445110738~“Great location - too expensive for gross room”~You are paying for the location. We arrived to two cockroaches running through the kitchenette. They came back a few times; we named one Craig. The bed was SUPER uncomfortable and we had a terrible night sleep. This was not helped by the tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic of the air conditioner. So painful to try to sleep to a non-rythmic tic!!! Even Craig couldn't handle it by 3am.  The bathroom is damp smelling, has no ventilation, it is tiny and the door required the force of 10 men and industrial ear muffs to close; (which is required because the toilet bowl was no more that 1.5m from the bedhead.) This place needs a upgrade soon or stop charging $250 plus for a night in Mould Manor.  The location is fantastic for a beach holiday. And the staff were super friendly and organised. We had free parking which is valuable in an area where it is impossible to park.  The Coogee Pavilion pub is right next door and is super loud. We didn't hear it from our room but I am sure the rooms close to the front of the hotel would be noisy too.  As I said, you are paying for the location. If your expectations cease there, then you will be fine.~2~nan~nan~1~1~nan~4~nan
review_443637859~“Excellent location, between beach and city life but very noisy at week ends”~we stayed several weeks in a spacious unit with balcony and view on sea and park. We enjoyed the location, the proximity of beach, coastal walks,buses,shops and restaurants. The staff was courteous at all times. The cleaning was done very quickly, too quickly to my taste,in the late afternoon.The bed was very comfortable.Kitchen is a bit outdated, it would have been useful to have more kitchen ustensiles. The carpets would need to be replaced in a near future but overall we enjoyed staying at Coogee sands hotel.What we hated though,was the awful noise coming from the Pavilion next door. They play loud music every week end till early in the morning and ear plugs are not enough to shield from the noise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441658231~“Always greay”~Have been visiting Coogee Sands for many years and with the perfect location right by the beach it's a great value option for accommodation.

review_440838606~“Lengthy stay”~I had a lengthy stay and loved the location just a couple of metres away from the beach, I have stayed at Coogee Sands before and find the views from the view and bbq deck on the 6th floor very amazing. The room I was staying in was very clean and serviced everyday. The frontdesk staff were extremly friendly and whatever I asked for they did. I will go back there anytime.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_440492557~“Convenient location and very good staff”~The hotel is located at the beach with private and public transport within walking distance. Free parking is a rarity and is a much appreciated feature of the hotel. As it was a special occasion for us we received a bottle of champagne. The reception staff are very efficient and willing to assist us with information.  We did suggest that rooms could include a small coffee table for the lounge chair.  Very reasonable rates.  The complimentary breakfast at the Yeeros Cafe was appreciated.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_440040978~“Location, location, location!”~Stayed two nights before heading home from our five week journey. This location is truly right across from the beautiful beach. Very lovely view from our third floor unit. Nice hotel amenities such as washer/dryer, free and secured underground parking, lovely deck on the top floor and a friendly staff. The two cons would be our unit wasn't as clean as we would have liked and the parking lot across from the hotel gets pretty noisy at night.  Otherwise a very pleasant stay!~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_436611763~“Great location - and very affordable in the expensive city of Sydney”~We found this place by accident (referral from another hotel) and lived it. Located more or less on the beach at Coogee it's a great place to stay. An easy 20-30 minute bus ride into town where you can enjoy all that the inner city offers - and then come back to the haven that is Coogee. Great cafe next door - Coogee Pavillon - and a street of great restaurants a short walk away. We had an Ocean Studio room that looked out over the roof of the Pavilion. Decent sized room with kitchenette and couch. Great sun deck on the roof.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_431812460~“Right on the beach”~Lovely location steps from the beach and right next door to popular Coogee Pavilion. The hotel itself is pretty nondescript, but solid. Room is reasonable size, a bit larger than standard and had a very nice balcony area with outdoor seating. Very pleasant to come back and sit there as a family with takeout! Also, the coast right there is incredible for a morning or evening run up to Bondi. I was there for some business at UNSW, which was about a 20-25 minute walk away. But taxi also super easy to catch to get there. A bit more of a trek to get to the harbour and stuff like that.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan

review_427150278~“Good place to stay”~This is my second stay at coogee sands hotel. The rooms are large and clean, though the furnishings feel a bit dated. The shower head in my room had a few jets spraying off at the wall, but nothing major wrong with the room. I did find there was a lack of outlets in key locations (like near the bedside tables), and the WiFi isn't complimentary.  The location is perfect, nearby to many shops, restaurants, bars, cafés, and obviously the beach. The staff were all friendly and helpful, and I enjoyed my stay again. I recommend the hotel to anyone coming to the area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426943106~“Clean but make sure you research ”~The staff were absolutely lovely and the room was clean but make sure you do your research. The hotel is right next to a night club so keeping the patio doors open means you can't hear the TV and you want earplugs if you expect to sleep!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425770228~“Good place to stay”~The hotel is conveniently located right at the beach. There are plenty of food choices, cafés, convenience stores etc either next door or within walking distance. The hotel room is spacious and well equipped, from ironing board to kitchen amenities-it has all you need. It is just a 20 mins taxi ride to the airport or to the city. I would stay here again. Charging for wifi for a 4 star hotel is poor though and should be reconsidered as one can expect that to be included in the price these days.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425128725~“Another Pleasant Stay”~This time we were a total of 4 couples visiting for a nearby engagement party. Everyone commented that is was so easy … (a) buzz for entry into the free car park (b) walk just a few steps to reception for check-in (c) then take the lift to our nice clean and functional room/s.  One of our group had a beach-front room with terrace and a view that was the envy of the rest of us … but … the other rooms were very comfortable (and obviously cheaper), and had every facility we could want. This was a first-time stay for two of our couples … and all agreed they will definitely return. It’s still an affordable, very pleasant, convenient place to stay … with the same high standard of service. Lots of cafes/restaurants close-by … and just a minute or so to the bus to the city and Bondi Junction.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_421667850~“Good place to stay”~Great location. Rooms a little small and bathrooms beiginning to show their age. No view unless your in tthe top rooms.. Breakfast is outsourced to a cafe 100 metres away.No problems accessing cafe and great breakfasts there.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478320447~“Great weekender”~An excellent spot to stay for a couples weekend or one away with a group of friends. Opposite the beach & park. Very easy walk to all restaurants & the coastal walk. Rooms on the small side, have toaster, microwave & jug if you want to make a quick snack. Bathroom compact, good parking facility.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477863388~“Great Little Find”~Spent four nights at Coogee Sands with my husband and two teenage daughters. Arrived early and was able to check in straight away which was fantastic as we were a couple of hours early. Apartment was huge and although older, spotlessly clean with ample toiletries, towels and TOILET PAPER( thank god no running out). The apartments are so convenient, a few steps to the beach, bus stop and cafe's. Really refreshing to have reception staff look like they enjoy their job and ALWAYS acknowledge you as you enter or leave reception with a smile and a chat about your day. Absolutely loved being able to use the complimentary beach towels, no more wet sandy towels dragged around the apartment. Housekeeping noticed we had two teenage daughters with long hair and kindly gave us a couple of extra shampoo's, very thoughtful as its's the little things that will bring you back. Only one complaint which i have noticed not only at Coogee Sands but other hotels, the lack of seating. Four large people in a huge room with one tiny two seater lounge . Couldnt really relax as a family as three of us had to sit on the floor. Will definitely return in the future.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476922620~“One night ”~Had an amazing welcome from the lovely receptionist Stacey & room was beautiful with stunning view on beach! 100% go back. Beautiful coastal walk and shops are local also. Little shop right next door too hotel so it easy to pick up snacks.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475440312~“Great location on the beach!”~We stayed for one night at the Coogee Sands hotel. The room was clean and a generous size and the bed was comfy. The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming and the location is fantastic... right on the beach and with numerous cafes and restaurants nearby. The free undercover parking was a bonus and we were able to check out and leave our car in the carpark whilst we went off to a cafe for brunch. As we were only staying the one night, we choose a standard room with no balcony or view which was great value for money, however, if we were staying longer, I would definitely spend the extra money and book a room with a balcony and view. The only downside was that the rooms were not very soundproof and we could clearly hear the people in the next room from quite early in the morning... not ideal when you are holidaying and want to sleep in past six am! Other that that, I would certainly recommend this hotel.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474862044~“Great location but disappointing apartment”~Advertised as a luxury studio apartment, this was simply a large motel room with a microwave. No small stovetop, no cooking utensils (even for microwave), and no small table and chairs. Only place to eat was on a bench, centimeters from poorly positioned TV screen.  Bed was uncomfortable, needing a mattress topper or replacement.  Fabulous location right on Coogee Beach. Not good value for money.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474835297~“Hospitality : Excellent"”~Had a lovely stay with the family , kids slept on fold out and were very comfy. Great Location, very beautiful and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. A lot to do in this area and if you need public transport to explore its just out your door. Busus and Taxis available when ever you are. Having underground parking available was a bonus has its hard to find parking in Coogee for FREE. Will be staying there again. WE will be back!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474400230~“Fantastic Location”~Nice room - very clean and good amenities. Next time I would request a room with courtyard though. Excellent location right on Coogee Beach with the baths, beautiful walking tracks/boardwalk with terrific views.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_473312244~“Lovely!”~Had a great stay at this hotel. I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to a sea view room. Really convenient with the car park underneath. Very clean with helpful, friendly staff. Would have been good to have free wifi throughout stay. Only get limited amount per day. But there is a cafe below the hotel which has free wifi so not the end of the world.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468824847~“Be near the Beach - it's worth it !”~We chose Coogee Sands Hotel and Apartments for a two night stay in Feb 2017 and were very pleased with our choice. The location is very very good. Our second floor room was spotlessly clean, spacious and comfortable with a balcony. There was an in room kitchenette with fridge, kettle, microwave, dishes, cutlery and glasses. We liked the quality of the toiletries provided. The staff on the front desk were very friendly, and very helpful, taking in our luggage as we arrived too early, which allowed us to get out and start checking out the area right away. We loved the vegetation in the park area in front of the beach .. and the beach itself is just amazing. There are always lots of people around, walking dogs, running and swimming. You can walk along the trail that winds along the coast, and the views (from the top of the little hill) of the rocks and the ocean were stunning. There are plenty of places to eat in the area, including the Pavillion right next door. There is a terrific take away spot where the buses all stop, and McDonald's is close by as well if you wish. We took a bus into downtown Sydney for a day of sightseeing, and although a 30 minute ride, it was easy because downtown is the end of the line going in, and Coogee Beach is the end of the line coming back. Simple. Wish we had longer - this hotel is definitely a comfortable home base for all your sightseeing in Sydney. Much better than the much more costly, concrete choices of downtown Sydney.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468255003~“Don't stay on weekends unless you sleep well through loud music”~Clean and spacious room, comfortable bed. We had a third floor room with a view of a brick wall. As it's right next to Coogee Pavilion we got a lot of noise on Friday and Saturday night. If you either sleep well though an incessant thump thump thump beat, or at the place dancing to thump thump thump music, or too pissed to care and you can sleep through anything then this is the hotel for you. Great location but was more like a glamorous backpackers than a luxury hotel. Other much nicer places to stay in the area without the background music.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_467974292~“Clean room and friendly staff. ”~My wife and I recently spent a night here.  We had. Room with a partial sea view which was just fine.  The Coogee Sands is in a busy area of Coogee which is very handy if you enjoy the beach, great walking areas, nice restaurants and nightlife.  The room was very clean and well fitted out. The staff were very friendly and I would definitely recommend staying here but make sure you book a room with a partial or full sea view.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467746142~“Great location, great servicd”~We spent just a night here, having flown into Sydney that afternoon before heading off in a road trip down the NSW South Coast. It was easy to find, brilliantly located right by Coogee Beach and the reception staff were very welcoming and helpful. The only reason I didn't rate this hotel a 5 was our room's bathroom and the hallways are a bit tired and the noise from the surrounding air conditioning units outside was noisier than than surf crashing on the beach. So despite the warm, humid March night, we had to sleep with the window closed. On the plus side, the room's air conditioning was really quiet. We'd certainly stay here again. Had fantastic meals at Coogee Pavillion next door and a bakery/cafe on Coogee Beach Rd, as well as a fantastic walk up in the park before setting off on our road trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467373642~“Absolutely Fabulous”~Myself, my husband and daughter stayed here for a Saturday and Sunday night, we had a room with a balcony that had ocean views. We thought the rooms might be noisy because the property is right next to the Coogee Pavilion but we were very pleasantly surprised that the sliding door cut out virtually all noise. The room was comfortable and clean. The kitchen was great, especially having the bench space and microwave, fridge, kettle etc. The staff were fantastic and were very helpful and accommodating. The parking was easily accessible and had wide spaces to fit all types of cars. We really loved the fact that you didn't need to cross the busy road to get to the beach, you just walked out of the Hotel and you were virtually on the beach. I loved that the stairs between the floors were open so you didn't have to always take the lift. The Hotel is very close to the bus (373) that takes you straight into Circular Quay (takes 30 mins) which we took on the Sunday - very cheap for a family ($10.70 for three of us). The best thing about the whole place was the access to the rooftop balcony!!! OMG it was fantastic!!!! We took our wine and snacks up there for our "Happy Hour" each night and watched the sunset and took lots of photos. We really loved it at the Coogee Sands Hotel and will definitely come back, we won't stay anywhere else in Coogee again!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467339504~“Great location, beautiful views!”~My wife and I stayed here last June. Unfortunately we were only there for a day. Great views and right next to the beach walk. I would assume it can only be better during the spring/summer. Front desk was very friendly. We forgot a few of our things when we checked out and they were kind enough to hold them for us until we were in the area again! You can hear a bit of noise from outside with all the people partying next door or hanging out at the park but it's not too bad. I would consider staying here again if we were in the area.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467073426~“Great Place”~My wife and I stayed here for a week, Great places to eat and great transport hub did not have to take the car in to town at all. Clean Rooms had a balcony and had great views of the ocean. Would stay there again~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_463999736~“Perfect location, great views, nice apartment”~We stayed in a beach view balcony self catering apartment for 5 nights in February 2017.  Staff were lovely, the room was spacious, bright and clean, as was the bathroom with shower, not bath. Kitchen facilities were very limited (sink, fridge, microwave, kettle, no hot plate) and not much crockery or cutlery (although I did hear someone ordering a hot plate and frying pan for their room so it might be available but not advertised). However as there were many restaurants and takeaways nearby this wasn't a problem for us. There are no bed and breakfast or bar facilities at this hotel although they do have a chargeback arrangement with some of the local restaurants. Coogee was a lovely, lively, friendly and safe feeling place as a base for a few days. But one or two of the days the bay was plagued with bluebottle jellyfish which limited sea bathing. However there are some seawater pools along the far side of the beach which were less affected. The pavilion bar and restaurant next door also sold takeaway food and drinks. However, this was extremely busy and hectic and (take note) very noisy till about midnight at the weekends. This didn't bother us unduly as we were only there Sunday to friday and kept patio doors closed on Sunday night. From Monday it was quiet. The bed was very comfortable and large, and there was a sofa in the room, plus balcony furniture. TV had a good range of programmes including CNN and Sky news. The balcony was a lovely place to sit and watch the bay activity so if your budget stretches, go for a front facing balcony room.  There was also a lovely roof terrace complete with comfortable seating and barbecue equipment for use by guests. Buses ran very frequently from just across the road into Sydney and other places, which was a bonus. The blue ones take cash but they prefer you to get the equivalent of an Oyster card (Londoners understand) and top it up. This can be bought in Sydney where the bus stops at Circular Quay. It took between half and three quarters of an hour into Sydney, depending on traffic. We were very happy with the hotel and its position. Being able to get into the centre of Sydney so easily was a bonus.  Checkout time at the hotel was 11 am but if you had a late flight you could pay 20 dollars an hour to extend your stay in the room if it wasn't booked. Unfortunately ours was and hotel was then fully booked. As we wanted to stay on the beach for the day we had hoped they could offer shower and changing facilities at the end of the day but they could only offer a small cloakroom for changing clothes. Given the locality, it would be nice if the hotel could consider providing s shower room as many flights don't leave till 9 or 10 pm and the airport is only half an hour away. We overcame this by spending the day at wonderful Wylies pool (along the seafront) which for a small entrance fee provided a lovely place to spend the day, have lunch and a hot shower. Please see separate review. PS I would have given 5 stars except for the lack of shower facilities, minimal kitchen equipment and the weekend noise from next door. But all in all a lovely place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463417121~“Great location”~We stayed here last week while spending a couple of days in Sydney. The hotel is in a great location with good public transport options to the Airport and the City. Staff were helpful and held on to our suitcases after we checked out so we didn't have to carry them around all day before going to the airport.  Not a big problem but the free wifi cap of 100mb was a bit frustrating as we needed go and find somewhere with wifi to organise our travels. We had a musty smell in our room - it was room 201 right at the end of the hall so could be one of the damper rooms.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~5~nan
review_462571836~“What a view!”~I visit Coogee twice a year and go somewhere different each time. This week I ventured to the Coogee Sands- and have to say it's my favourite hotel yet. My room had a comfortable bed, a sofa, a kitchen- everything I needed and more. The bathroom was great too- it had a little clothes line in the shower- perfect for beach side! My room didn't have a view but that wasn't an issue- as the sundeck on level 6 was open to everyone. The views from the deck were amazing. I sat there in the sun and even got a bit of study done- just a lovely place to be. I did trip twice, going into the bathroom (as it's at a slightly higher level), but that was the only thing that bothered me. Staff were lovely. Location brilliant. It's my new favourite place in Coogee :)~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460791084~“Nice weekend away in a beautiful location!”~Coogee Sands is a great spot to stay at when in Sydney. It's right on the beach and close to many facilities and events. The staff are very nice and are a pleasure to deal with! The hotel is well furbished and the lobby is very nice. We highly recommend this hotel when in Sydney also due to the easy access to public transport, taxis and restaurants.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460573920~“Over night stay”~Stayed for one night to help a sick family member in hospital. Close proximity to POWH. Reception staff friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a partial ocean view room which had view of wedding cake island. Lovely clean room and decor, comfy bed and pillows. Nice cool aircon. Very close to the beach. Well appointed mini bar and snacks. Recommend for short or long stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460227521~“Vacation”~Great place to stay to the East of Sydney. We had a bright studio room looking good over Coogee Beach with a lovely terrace. Room serviced daily and communal areas kept spotlessly clean. Free parking but slightly dodgy free Wi-Fi. Only downside is late noise coming from the Pavilion next door. But trade that for convenience of a good place to eat, drink and have Gelato albeit at crazy prices.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459568519~“Lovely stay!”~Yes it's a little bit dated but the room was very clean, with comfy beds and lovely linen. From the arrival to departure the staff were super polite and helpful. There were cleaners polishing the front doors and lifts frequently, very impressed. On arrival the air conditioner seemed to be dripping. One call to the front desk and it was rectified by the time we arrived back to our room. Our room 411 was quiet with only the occasional noise from doors slamming. It's not 5stars but I would recommend a stay there, and having "The Pav" next door for drinks on the roof top bar, and food/ good coffee downstairs was an added bonus!~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_459541809~“AVOID AT ALL COSTS - WALLS ARE PAPER THIN AND COACKROACHES IN THE HOTEL”~The only thing good about this hotel is the location, nothing else. The walls are paper thin, you can hear the other guests watching tv, taking a bath or even peeing! We saw several crickets in the rooms and two huge coackroaches! Charging like a 5 star hotel but being worst than a hostel!~1~1~5~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_459480042~“Coogee Sands delivers”~My wife and I stayed at Coogee Sands in late January and we're delighted by the location, the room and the front desk staff. The location is fabulous. It's on the beach and within easy walking distance of all the local restaurants and night spots. Our room was comfortable and well equipped as was the bathroom.

review_458420342~“Close to all facility's ”~Great hotel and staff friendly be sure to ask for towels when you head to the beach also my only gripe was the poor internet connection and slow to load  Otherwise it's a great place to stay we opted to call the hotel and ask for any specials and we booked a few months ahead and although there were no specials they were happy to give us complimentary breakfast voucher to the local cafe  thanks~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457489728~“No Complaints”~I just wanted to thank the staff for their care and outstanding service during our recent stay. I was travelling with my 88 year old mother who has extremely limited mobility. The staff went out of their way to accommodate her needs including finding me a park right next to the entrance to decrease her travelling distance to the lift. The helpfulness and caring attitude certainly made my trip a lot easier and very pleasant. Thank you~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_451838348~“Great location”~No complaints. Quick checkin, friendly staff, free parking(!), awesome location. Rooms are fine, clean and equipped. Bed was comfy and big. There was a kitchenette but we didn't bother using it. Would happily stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451609174~“By The Beachside”~We stayed for 4 nights and found the location superb. Metres from popular Coogee beach which is both clean and patrolled by lifeguards. Great walking paths along the coastal area too. Staff were nice and helpful. We stayed in the deluxe courtyard room. The room was clean in general and enough space needed for a cosie stay. The bed was very comfy, even two pillow choices. Free WI FI and TV with FOX. The kitchenette is limited and the bathroom "small" both in need of an update but clean and functional. There’s really good transport service to the CBD with bus stop only 2min walk away - its 25 min bus ride to the city or good bus options to Bondi Junction/beach. From Sydney airport a taxi ride approx $35 + tolls. Great eateries options nearby with our fav being; La Spiaggia. We would go back.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_451366719~“Great location!”~The location of this hotel is fantastic, but it is a no frills, basic hotel. For the amount we paid, and Sydney is very expensive, we were happy enough with it, but it is by no means a luxury hotel. The 20 metre walk to the beach was terrific!~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_447654683~“Actually September 2016 I stayed there! ”~I was there for one night during the week. The staff were professional and friendly. The room was as clean as you can expect any property that resides by the sea salt. LoL. I love this place, and it gives the Crown a run for its overpriced rooms!.  Oh don't forget the Dolphin Pavilion next door. Awesome pizzas, beer and pokies.  Had a great time, looking forward to my next stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446894288~“Perfect for a place away from the City Centre”~We have chosen this place about 6 times when we go to Sculptures by the Sea. One of the reasons is that we need to leave the car somewhere, and here they have a secure carpark and there is no fee. It's also easy to get express buses into the city for business purposes. The room has always been clean and adequate for our needs. There are plenty of eateries nearby but the Irish Takeaway Seafood place on the same street tempts you to eitehr sit and eat in the nearby park or take it to the room. The staff are helpful and smile!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_445110738~“Great location - too expensive for gross room”~You are paying for the location. We arrived to two cockroaches running through the kitchenette. They came back a few times; we named one Craig. The bed was SUPER uncomfortable and we had a terrible night sleep. This was not helped by the tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic of the air conditioner. So painful to try to sleep to a non-rythmic tic!!! Even Craig couldn't handle it by 3am.  The bathroom is damp smelling, has no ventilation, it is tiny and the door required the force of 10 men and industrial ear muffs to close; (which is required because the toilet bowl was no more that 1.5m from the bedhead.) This place needs a upgrade soon or stop charging $250 plus for a night in Mould Manor.  The location is fantastic for a beach holiday. And the staff were super friendly and organised. We had free parking which is valuable in an area where it is impossible to park.  The Coogee Pavilion pub is right next door and is super loud. We didn't hear it from our room but I am sure the rooms close to the front of the hotel would be noisy too.  As I said, you are paying for the location. If your expectations cease there, then you will be fine.~2~nan~nan~1~1~nan~4~nan
review_443637859~“Excellent location, between beach and city life but very noisy at week ends”~we stayed several weeks in a spacious unit with balcony and view on sea and park. We enjoyed the location, the proximity of beach, coastal walks,buses,shops and restaurants. The staff was courteous at all times. The cleaning was done very quickly, too quickly to my taste,in the late afternoon.The bed was very comfortable.Kitchen is a bit outdated, it would have been useful to have more kitchen ustensiles. The carpets would need to be replaced in a near future but overall we enjoyed staying at Coogee sands hotel.What we hated though,was the awful noise coming from the Pavilion next door. They play loud music every week end till early in the morning and ear plugs are not enough to shield from the noise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441658231~“Always greay”~Have been visiting Coogee Sands for many years and with the perfect location right by the beach it's a great value option for accommodation.

review_440838606~“Lengthy stay”~I had a lengthy stay and loved the location just a couple of metres away from the beach, I have stayed at Coogee Sands before and find the views from the view and bbq deck on the 6th floor very amazing. The room I was staying in was very clean and serviced everyday. The frontdesk staff were extremly friendly and whatever I asked for they did. I will go back there anytime.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_440492557~“Convenient location and very good staff”~The hotel is located at the beach with private and public transport within walking distance. Free parking is a rarity and is a much appreciated feature of the hotel. As it was a special occasion for us we received a bottle of champagne. The reception staff are very efficient and willing to assist us with information.  We did suggest that rooms could include a small coffee table for the lounge chair.  Very reasonable rates.  The complimentary breakfast at the Yeeros Cafe was appreciated.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_440040978~“Location, location, location!”~Stayed two nights before heading home from our five week journey. This location is truly right across from the beautiful beach. Very lovely view from our third floor unit. Nice hotel amenities such as washer/dryer, free and secured underground parking, lovely deck on the top floor and a friendly staff. The two cons would be our unit wasn't as clean as we would have liked and the parking lot across from the hotel gets pretty noisy at night.  Otherwise a very pleasant stay!~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_436611763~“Great location - and very affordable in the expensive city of Sydney”~We found this place by accident (referral from another hotel) and lived it. Located more or less on the beach at Coogee it's a great place to stay. An easy 20-30 minute bus ride into town where you can enjoy all that the inner city offers - and then come back to the haven that is Coogee. Great cafe next door - Coogee Pavillon - and a street of great restaurants a short walk away. We had an Ocean Studio room that looked out over the roof of the Pavilion. Decent sized room with kitchenette and couch. Great sun deck on the roof.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_431812460~“Right on the beach”~Lovely location steps from the beach and right next door to popular Coogee Pavilion. The hotel itself is pretty nondescript, but solid. Room is reasonable size, a bit larger than standard and had a very nice balcony area with outdoor seating. Very pleasant to come back and sit there as a family with takeout! Also, the coast right there is incredible for a morning or evening run up to Bondi. I was there for some business at UNSW, which was about a 20-25 minute walk away. But taxi also super easy to catch to get there. A bit more of a trek to get to the harbour and stuff like that.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_431531526~“Smelly room, old falling apart toilet - hostel rather than hotel”~The room smelled like mound. Toilet old and falling apart. Super noisy nightclub downstairs cannot sleep.

review_429015984~“Can recommend..by the beach”~Room is spacious, but very flimsy front door, so can hear all the noise as people walk past.

The bed was very comfortable with good pillows.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_427150278~“Good place to stay”~This is my second stay at coogee sands hotel. The rooms are large and clean, though the furnishings feel a bit dated. The shower head in my room had a few jets spraying off at the wall, but nothing major wrong with the room. I did find there was a lack of outlets in key locations (like near the bedside tables), and the WiFi isn't complimentary.  The location is perfect, nearby to many shops, restaurants, bars, cafés, and obviously the beach. The staff were all friendly and helpful, and I enjoyed my stay again. I recommend the hotel to anyone coming to the area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426943106~“Clean but make sure you research ”~The staff were absolutely lovely and the room was clean but make sure you do your research. The hotel is right next to a night club so keeping the patio doors open means you can't hear the TV and you want earplugs if you expect to sleep!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425770228~“Good place to stay”~The hotel is conveniently located right at the beach. There are plenty of food choices, cafés, convenience stores etc either next door or within walking distance. The hotel room is spacious and well equipped, from ironing board to kitchen amenities-it has all you need. It is just a 20 mins taxi ride to the airport or to the city. I would stay here again. Charging for wifi for a 4 star hotel is poor though and should be reconsidered as one can expect that to be included in the price these days.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425128725~“Another Pleasant Stay”~This time we were a total of 4 couples visiting for a nearby engagement party. Everyone commented that is was so easy … (a) buzz for entry into the free car park (b) walk just a few steps to reception for check-in (c) then take the lift to our nice clean and functional room/s.  One of our group had a beach-front room with terrace and a view that was the envy of the rest of us … but … the other rooms were very comfortable (and obviously cheaper), and had every facility we could want. This was a first-time stay for two of our couples … and all agreed they will definitely return. It’s still an affordable, very pleasant, convenient place to stay … with the same high standard of service. Lots of cafes/restaurants close-by … and just a minute or so to the bus to the city and Bondi Junction.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_421667850~“Good place to stay”~Great location. Rooms a little small and bathrooms beiginning to show their age. No view unless your in tthe top rooms.. Breakfast is outsourced to a cafe 100 metres away.No problems accessing cafe and great breakfasts there.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
