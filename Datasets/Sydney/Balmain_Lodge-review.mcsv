review_389974422~“Traditional place for life style Aussie.”~It´s perfect place for enjoy with friends. The hotel is located in the best famous street in Balmain. This place is close for everything, transports, supermarkets, a lot of stores and boutiques. Easy to go and back.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_278371723~“Awful place”~I stayed here for a week ($300) and it was honestly an awful experience. Cockroaches, spiders you name it. The room I was given wasn't even clean (Looked like a prostitues den) and it was quite obvious the manager didn't care, he just wanted the $ in his pocket. Bathrooms were filthy, I had to wear thongs when showering.  Please don't get fooled just because this place is in the wonderful Balmain, Stay somewhere else, this place and the staff are quite frankly a joke.  Goodluck to them~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_190560112~“Candid review by local”~A few years back when it was a bit newer this was an acceptable budget choice. The best room is/was the one above the Wok on Inn takeaway. The rest of the place felt like a stale Uni hall of residence. That was a few years back. Recently I head someone describe it as "the Manus Island of Balmain." Say no more.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_79177733~“Don't do it!!”~Stayed at Balmain Lodge for a few days, had planned to stay there for much longer but couldn't handle the conditions and I have stayed in some terrible places around the world and this would be the worst. It looked like there was faeces on the bed covers, had to wash all the linen myself as I felt sick from the smell. There was cockroaches and mouse / rat droppings in the cupboard. The shower was cold and dirty, felt sorry for my thongs having to be one with the ground.  Whatever you do don't stay at this hole!~1~2~5~1~1~1~1~nan
review_23734508~“Simply bad”~I stayed in the exact same room (no. 19) as the reviewer above (who stayed there July 2008). I can tell this by the photos he left. I paid $85 a night. The room was not clean. it stank of rancid oil or grease and old shrimp/prawns. The windows were dirty. The screen that cover the windows did not fit and were bent, allowing all sorts of creatures into the room. The curtains were dirty with food. The balcony was grubby - dead plants in pots, cigarette buts everywhere, dirt all over the floor. Very hot in the summer (It's January now) and the small fan in the room did not help much (obviously no air conditioning).  At seven AM the nieghbors started playing the TV very loud. Walking through the weedy, unkempt inner courtyard you can smell the cooking form the rooms and see the shared bathrooms, There was a guy urinating in plain view - didn't bother to even close the door. It felt and looked like something out of a movie. I suppose if you have no expectations and are a young backpacker with little experience this would be ok. But for $20-40 more a night you can enjoy a real room in a real hotel in a much nicer location. Sure, Balmain has lots of shops and you can take the bus to the ferry wharf - but that's true of many places in Sydney. I decided to leave, without a refund, after one night. I booked a romm at the Stamford Double Bay Hotel which was slightly more but light years above Balmain Lodge in quality, cleanlines, service. And the room didn't stink~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_17969898~“Woo Hoo for the Balmain Lodge!”~Gloucestershire, U.K. We have stayed a couple of times at the balmain Lodge on Darling St and had a great time. This is kind of a Motel type thing with our room having a basic kitchen and an en suite bathroom, but not all of the rooms are the same, some have a shared bathroom and toilet etc. We had a large balcony with chairs etc to sit on - but others have just a smallish balcony. Check with the guys what you are going to get. There are some long term residents there who seem to keep the rooms cleaned and tidy instead of chambemaids. The rooms are basic, clean and they work for the money you pay - if you are expecting luxury then stay at a 'branded ' hotel chain. The management are just 100% excellent, friendly and helpful - booking on the internet is easy and safe - no worries there. Being on Darling St there are loads of buses direct to the city itself and anyway you can get a bus to the ferry at Balmain and go where you want i.e. Darling Harbour or Circular Quay. Eating - tons of restaurants and cafes - something to match everyones tastes and budgets. Pubs everywhere - live music, good grub, just brilliant! Balmain is a safe neighhbourhood and is kind of trendy - not the cheapest locale in Sydney but nice - there is even a smashing park you can take the family. Loads of food shops and supermarkets within walking distance from the Balmain Lodge - newsagents, florists, take aways (the Wok on Inn is below the hotel so good cheap noodles below - cooked in front of you and to order). Washing machines and driers are available - coin operated. There is a small garden centre to the side of the Inn - with a Parakeet who is only vocal during the day. Inside the Inn itself there is a small courtyard that is really excellent for chilling out - exotic plants and seats make it a really pleasant area to read a book. We had a great time - they are wifi enabled and its free but you have to stand outside to get it - so what, its part of the charm. We have stayed a few times and will stay again. Hope this helps.
