review_479099742~“Anzac Day stay”~Good location in centre of city one of the closest to Martin Place which was important to us as we were attending the dawn service for Anzac Day currently under renovation so there was no dining  Available however they did have an arrangement with a cafe across the road where you could get Breakfast and charge it to your room .The room was clean & kitchenette was a bonus as you could make a simple meal if necessary~3~5~5~5~4~4~4~nan

review_478388943~“Not impressed at all”~We travelled from New Zealand at Easter with our Daughter & Son in law & 7 month old. We had booked adjoining rooms as we were babysitting for them while they attended a wedding near to the Hotel.  Aware we had an early flight with the baby, I contacted the Hotel a week before travelling to ask whether it was possible to have earlier access to possibly allow the baby to sleep on arrival. I was informed this was possible by paying for an extra night at $ 175.00 which we then did.  On arriving at the same time as us, another couple of the wedding attendees with no baby were allowed access to their room at no extra charge what so ever!!  We settle into our rooms on the 7th floor only to find our daughters room had no hot water for either showers or washing. The front desk was informed and we were told they would look in to it. Next day, still no hot water and this fiasco continued for the 5 days stay. Each day we informed the desk but were told it was impossible to get a plumber over the long break. All showers, baby cleaning etc for them had to be done in our room. Their room also had problems with the air conditioner/heating. This would not heat and the room was very cold. We even triedturned it off altogether but the vents stayed open on the unit & cold air was still coming in to the room. We then had to ask to have the door between rooms unlocked so we could run our heater and let the warmth go next door for the baby. The desk was also informed of this problem but no repairs made.  Not a great situation while on holiday with a baby! On checking out, our daughter once again informed the staff that they still had no hot water. She was then offered a nights refund on their accommodation. Considering we had paid a total of $1600.00 AUD between both of us for what turned out to be what I would term "a bit of a shambles" we were not impressed at all. It would certainly not be on the "Lets stay there again list" and we would be reluctant to recommend this Hotel. Having travelled overseas quite a bit including USA & Vietnam, we were very disappointed. On a plus side, it was good walking distance to the City area & Circular Quay.~3~2~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_477838734~“Clean and Comfortable”~This is a very clean comfortable hotel and staff are very friendly and accommodating. It is well placed within the city of Sydney but there are only 2 or maybe 3 cafe's within close vacinity which are not opened at night. No in house restaurant althoughtyou can byo food.~4~4~4~5~4~4~4~nan
review_477642422~“Good location at reasonable value for Sydney CBD”~We stayed at the Travelodge Martin Place for the long Easter Weekend. The location was excellent for us as we were here to explore the city and visit family. Although building works are currently underway at the hotel, as it was the Easter weekend it was very quiet, with no work being done. The hotel represented good value for us compared to other hotels around the CBD. The staff on duty over the weekend were friendly and helpful. Our son enjoyed the mini Easter Egg treats and complimentary popcorn from the popcorn maker behind reception. Finding a Chocolate Easter Bunny on our bed on Easter Sunday was a nice treat too! We were able to easily walk down to Circular Quay and all the attractions around there, and were very close to the Botanic Gardens, Hyde Park and the shopping areas around George and Pitt Streets. Just along the street is the Lindt Chocolate Cafe which was nice for a chocolaty treat! Martin Place train station is also conveniently close by. We look forward to staying here again in the future and seeing the finished refurbishments.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477023287~“Poor Cleaning standards.”~the only thing this place has got going for it is the location otherwise it is overpriced for such poor standards. The room not properly cleaned, old mattress and cheap pillows guarantees back/neck pain and a lousy experience.~2~2~3~1~2~1~3~nan
review_476346121~“OK”~We stayed during some major renovations. Scaffolding outside our window and corridors had plastic laid down. Main lift broke down on our 2nd day so had to use the labourers lift. All of these things are ok except maybe the price should be lowered a bit while this is going on? Room itself is fairly outdated which I assume will be redone in the Reno. But had everything you needed including some fox channels which was great for an AFL supporter in a rugby city. Is in a fantastic location really close to bus stops and Martin Place train station and an easy/enjoyable walk to darling harbour. Also really close to lots of restaurants.  When I checked out, the hotel staff tried to charge me for a $25 movie which I never ordered. The manager sorted it out though but it was a bit weird. Seems very expensive for a movie too.  Overall, just OK for the price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476272879~“My review”~I stayed for 3 nights in a single room when travelling to Sydney for a Conference.  The room was clean, neat and contained all of the basic and useful requirements.  I was comfortable and slept easily. The location was ideal, easy to get to via public transport as well as other types of transport. I enjoyed the quiet position of the room.  ~4~4~4~5~4~4~4~nan

Box with small plastic bag. Ironing board, Iron . It was quiet and location was perfect The lift broke down on the first night so we used the service lift. Didn't think much of the building on the out side due to renovations going on.  ~3~4~5~4~3~4~3~nan
review_474843301~“Business Trip”~OK in difficult circumstances as building if being refurbished. Guest list was not functioning - needed to use the service lift which also served as the builders lift. Rooms were clean and functional.~2~3~4~3~2~3~3~nan
review_473718785~“Travelodge Martin Place”~Great position and reasonably priced accommodation. There was a power outage while we were there and it went on much longer than we were advised it would. We had no way of contacting reception except by going down 8 floors and there were no announcements made about emergency contact until 2 hours after power should have returned. Power was actually off for 4 hours not the one we were advised. Eventually we did descend the 8 flights of stairs but it was quite gruelling as we are not young.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473711124~“Terrible hotel”~This hotel was really expensive $200 for a night and breakfast not even included, it was really noisy and building works wake us up at 7am. The lift doesn't work (only one and really old) ... furthermore there is nothing at the reception to seat and wait for a taxi..~1~1~5~1~2~2~2~nan
review_473479954~“Friendly staff, great location, housekeeping needs improvement”~Housekeeping and maintenance let this place down. Which is a shame as it's a great location, friendly and helpful staff on reception. Breakfast at cafe across the road is a must - delicious food - that is charged back to your room.~3~2~5~3~2~2~3~nan
review_473390529~“Sydney Travelodge”~Excellent location. The room was very quiet. The vacuum was not run often during our 11 day stay. Liked that there was laundry facility onsite. Front desk was helpful with travel information.  Train station was very close.~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_473310838~“Disgraceful stay”~Disgraceful that electricity turned off 7am-8am - no reduction in tariff offered. Occupational health and safety issue - dangerous situation for people staying at motel. Guests should have been advised well in advance that electricity would be turned off and offered opportunity to cancel booking.~2~1~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_473284086~“Quiet despite renovations”~This hotel was very central and reasonably priced. Nice and quiet despite the renovations being done. There was no breakfast, but we had delicious breakfast at Silks across the road. There were also good restaurants nearby, and it was very close to 2 underground stations.~4~4~5~5~5~4~4~nan
review_473276296~“A pleasant, perfectly situated hotel”~Very comfortable, close to everything. Good cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Also just around the corner from Martin Street station. The hotel is undergoing renovations at the moment but the staff are managing well, the reno really didn't impact on our stay.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473266155~“Satisfaction”~Fantastic place to stay, right in the middle of everything. 2-4 blocks from all the major attractions, one can walk everywhere. Great place, great staff and will stay there again. Current renovations no problems and with the right encouragement, management MAY pay for an excellent breakfast at the nearby "Silks" restaurant.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472777415~“Clean, comfortable and affordable.”~Over all this hotel is good value.  Staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable.  Bathroom was a good size.  Would recommend for short stays.  No view from window but if you're just planning on sleeping in the room then that shouldn't bother you :)~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_472601410~“Unfortunate Series of Events”~Nice and clean An unfortunate series of events spoiled our stay.  The lifts were faulty and our room keys did not work nor the master key.  There was no public toilet available while we were waiting to get into our room after a long day at conference.~3~2~4~3~3~4~2~nan
review_472493931~“Quiet location”~Close to St James and Martin Place stations and an easy walk to botanical gardens, shops, numerous eating venues. Downhill walk to Circular Quay and The Rocks precinct. Quiet location of an evening due to this location being in a business area.~4~3~4~4~3~3~4~nan
review_472257903~“Location”~For a long weekend away in a great location this is a reasonable place to stay - excellent location, average room, average cleanliness but more than adequate for those who wish to be out and about all day in lovely Sydney and then just flop into bed at night. Nothing in Sydney is cheap on a weekend. This is far more reasonably priced than other hotels in the immediate vicinity. We would return.~3~4~5~3~3~3~4~nan
review_472249479~“Will Go Elsewhere Next Time”~Hotel currently undergoing renovations so it has annoying plastic on floors outside our room; 3 times we had to ask for our linen; I felt the rooms were a bit depressing - dark, dated, bit grubby. Bathroom did not get a proper good clean each day just a quick wipe over! Internet was painfully SLOW; no eating facilities available - we were advised to go to Silk Cafe across the road. Unfortunately despite the food being good, we were pushed to find a table because being in business area of Sydney, a lot of people conduct their morning business there too! This meant feeling awkward eating our breakfast among a 'sea of suits and sitting almost on the footpath! Silk Cafe is closed weekends so the only option is a long walk in all weathers to McDonalds for breakfast or train station for later meals. Although reasonably close to trains and shopping, we would not stay here again.~2~2~4~4~1~2~3~nan
review_471990744~“Adequate but well located. Undergoing renovation.”~We stayed here mainly based on price and location. Once you had sorted out where you were on the map we found that all the major sights were within 20 mins walk and buses and trains were close by. The rooms were OK, nothing special but comfortable and quiet with a small mini kitchen and basic cutlery, tea bags etc. There was a sign on the microwave that said you would be charged $1500 dollars if the microwave smoked and the smoke alarms went off! There seemed to be no other food services in the hotel. The safe was very easy to use (not always the case these days!). We had an issue with the toilet flush continuously running and the front desk gent said he would look at it and report it. I asked to change rooms if it couldn't be fixed but he instantly said that the hotel was fully booked. We ended up taking the top off and tying up the flush mechanism to stop the noise. I would have liked the cleaning of the bathroom to be better - toilet not cleaned on the 3 night stay and the basin given a quick wipe. Overall I'm not sure if I would stay here again - it would be interesting to see it when the renovations are completed - but the price might just persuade me - Sydney is very expensive!~3~4~4~4~3~3~3~nan
review_471774235~“Excellent location”~This is a good quality hotel with reasonable rates, friendly staff, and everything provided in the bedroom and bathroom. Our room was not huge or glamorous but it was clean and adequate and everything worked. ~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_471553345~“Fabulous location!”~Great location, very convenient. My room was very clean and had everything I needed. Staff were very friendly and helpful, directing us where to find dinner, as we arrived late and hungry. Couldn't fault it! Would highly recommend.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470966421~“Undergoing renovations -”~Website still advertising bar and other facilities- bar is now a vending machine on L6. One lift which doesn't always come to your floor when you press the button. Calling reception gets the lift with the comment "oh it was stuck on the ground floor"- no apology for the problem. Scaffolding and noise is advised, so you are aware of these issues and I expect the price reflects this inconvenience. Bathrooms not quite as clean as you'd like - some black in the grout and grey greasy marks on the floor. Air con a bit noisy. Location is good if you are doing the legal/ govt buildings/ Hyde park end of town~3~3~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_470714049~“Great location”~Even though this hotel was having renovations at the time of our stay, it was never an inconvenience or noisy.

review_470447092~“Good hotel”~The hotel was good and the staff were friendly and helpful with places to eat, go etc and how to get there. We stayed in a standard room with a queen bed. It had no view or hair dryer but was good and quiet which was really good! I think it's a great hotel for short stays. Location was good too and close to everything.~4~4~5~5~3~5~5~nan
review_470434800~“Ok basic hotel, handy location”~Overall had all your essentials, handy location. Rooms were dated, aircon noisy and beds uncomfortable meant for not a great nights sleep. Please note whilst renovations are on they have no bathrooms or amenities, we arrived early before our room was ready and being heavily pregnant needed the toilet, unfortunately were sent out onto the street to find a café or something else ourselves.~3~3~4~2~3~4~3~nan

review_468204920~“Tired Old Hotel”~Stayed here one night on the way from New Zealand to Singapore. That was enough. Not a nice hotel, made worse by the outside being covered in scaffolding. Reception is old, tatty and in need of refurbishment. We had requested an early check in as we were arriving in Sydney at 9:00am. No early room was available so we had to hang around for 2 hours. There was no offer of help to get our luggage to our room. I was asked how I was going to pay for the room. I said it was pre paid but the reception staff didn't know this. Eventually they checked and confirmed payment had already been made. The room was just about adequate, clean but old and tired. The bathroom was clean but in need of updating. Flooring tiles were stained and the toilet dripped constantly as it was in need of a new flush mechanism.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468193308~“Basic but decent”~Cheap, close to transport in Sydney CBD. Room basic but good. No major issues. Toilet had to be flushed twice as it ran loudly otherwise and A/C dripped on to carpet for the remainder of my 3 night stay after 10-15mins use on the first night. Not major but distracting. Very quiet room. Lift being fixed so had to wait a while at times. Parking nearby expensive and difficult to use but the Travelodge provides a discount which is helpful however it is still very expensive, being the Sydney CBD. Get the train if you can.~4~4~4~4~3~5~4~nan
review_468170736~“Lovely staff but the actual accommodation in urgent need of renovation.”~Wasn't a good impression when we arrived & no help was offered by anyone, my husband had to carry my wheelchair & our bags upon some steps on his own & then help me up. The adapted room we were allocated was very dated & in desperate need of renovation itself, I assumed given the extensive renovation that was going on that this would include the room but was advised that the work was being done was to allow 4 floors to become commercial business space!!...the staff were very nice but as I said not to helpful with getting me or my wheelchair actually in, they did allow us to store the wheelchair though & our bags on checkout day till it was time to leave for the airport. Wasn't impressed at being woken & disturbed most of the night by guests as we were located next to the lift.~2~3~3~2~1~2~2~nan
review_467941152~“50 shades of beige”~Booked into this hotel midweek overnight for business. Beware it is under extensive renovations to the point that the outside is completely scaffolded. This should really be disclosed to customers before they book.  Location of the hotel is excellent - very central. Reception were uninterested (in me) and uninteresting. No effort to engage with me as a customer. HELLO ... these people are your first point of contact in a hotel with extensive work going on!! They should be trying much, much harder to engage with clients. No facility to eat in dinner or breakfast ... but this may be because of renovations.  Lifts have a warning sign on them as old clunkers to the effect that they are waiting to be replaced with new ones. Don't care ... just need to get to my room!! Room was fine. Linen clean and crisp. Mattress was poor with a roll into the middle.  Checkout was as disengaging as check in. Overall?? Unimpressed ... I would not stay there again. Yawn!! ... GS.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The hotel room was clean and well appointed. It had a fridge and kitchenette facilities which came in handy for us. The window however had views of an attrium and we were looking straight into the rooms across the way. So our blinds were always closed. The hotel is undergoing renos and I guess these would be teething problems at the moment.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
