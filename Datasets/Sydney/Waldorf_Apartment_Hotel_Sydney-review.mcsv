review_476260360~“Very central apartments.”~As the saying goes you do get what you pay for. Not one of my best chooses of places to stay. Very well located to a lot of things in Sydney bus and trains easy to get to lots of local shops near by, markets nice and close so is Darling Harbour. The apartment itself could do with a face lift, very dark and outdated, the smells were not pleasant, the noise factor was so loud we could not believe how loud it was outside we never got a full nights sleep it was crazy, from sirens to bin trucks to night road works to loud people it just never stopped, i do believe the windows were just to thin,we have stayed in other places in Sydney and never had this problem. The Staff were very helpful and always happy to help with anything i have no complaints about them. The roof top pool area was beautiful.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458816386~“Location and self contained apartment”~Recommend this property for families in the cbd, close to everything. Including Darling harbour, Town hall train station, Shopping centres, food halls and diverse eating styles. Great staff, serviced apartments every few days. Hotel is in the city so it's noisy but nothing you can't put up with.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_456797181~“Excellent Location”~We stayed in a two bedroom apartment for 12 days in October. We had stayed here a few years before and liked it. The apartment was clean and well laid out. Comfortable lounge seating and dining table with chairs. Enough room for family gathering and eating. There is a balcony wit a couple of chairs as well.  The kitchen was well supplied with all utensils and appliances , etc., if one needed to cook. The fridge worked well. The washing machine and dryer was most convenient for all our laundry. Best of all is the location. Right in the center of the city. 2 minutes walk on the same side of the apartment is Coles supermarket. In that mall are lots of eateries, hair and nail salons, dry cleaners, a pharmacy, health food store, bank, and other shops. There is also a post office close by. The booking process was very easy and emails promptly answered. Jan at the reception extremely helpful and always with a smile and cheery.. She took good care of us and made sure we had everything we wanted in the apartment, even bringing up the towels, etc. herself. There is free parking in the building. A bonus is this big city ! Train station was very close and a few minutes walk. There are plenty of restaurants and bars closeby. An easy walk to Chinatown and to Darling Harbor. Elevators worked well and the security key system is good.  We had a really enjoyable stay here with family.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454181160~“Inexpensive and clean, but lots of nextras”~Lots of hidden nextras (things you expect to get that you don't get). Things that were not publicised on the website but soon became clear: * No wifi in the rooms * Reception is staffed only between 9am and 2pm * Full servicing only once a week, even for short stays * Decor trapped in 1985.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_453070075~“Brilliant”~Stayed here in a 2 bed apartment in Dec and it was brilliant. All you needed and more. Full kitchen, laundry area and enough room to sleep 8 people. One bedroom had en suite shower room. Could not fault the staff either. The lady on Reception, Jan, was just fantastic, nothing was too much trouble for her. Every time we went out and came in when she was there she called us by first names. Wonderful lady. Keep up the good work. One day the maids were supposed to have been in and Jan asked if all had been done ok and I said they hadn't been in. She was not happy at all. When we came back later in the day there were 2 bottles of wine left and the cleaning had been done, and a note from Jan apologising. Jan had done the bed change and cleaning herself!!! Location brilliant.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_410996454~“Great location in need of some TLC”~We got an upgrade which was fantastic. Top floor with great views. Serviced apartments with limited guest facilities. The location is great, close to CBD, Darling Harbour and Chinatown. The apartment was spacious but needs a real heavy clean and it is looking very tired. The WiFi was free but only operating in the lobby, told the system was being updated, and the desk is only manned from 7am to 2pm The staff are helpful and we enjoyed our stay, but the whole place needs a refresh.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_362594414~“Awesome location Great staff”~We stayed 8 nights, and found it extremely central to all our needs. With Darling Harbour 300 metres away, Chinatown just a short walk and city shops within a 5 minute walk it was great. Clayton is a great guy ,very helpful and extremely accommodating.  I enjoyed the Aussie/kiwi banter and how you dealt with it. Cheers and certainly not your fault your team is not as good as ours.  Thank you and we along with our friends will stay again.

review_358117710~“Cracking place”~We stayed here in March 2016 for nearly 3 weeks and we really enjoyed our stay. Clayton and Joliegh are a credit to the place and they both couldn't do enough for us, printing directions to rugby stadiums etc. Everything is on your doorstep from Trains, supermarkets, attractions etc, so this is probably one of the best located apartment's for visitors to Sydney. We will definitely be staying here again in the future and we would like to wish Clay and Jo all the best. They both contributed to our fantastic time in Sydney.

review_343709729~“Would definitely return!”~We had an amazing week as a family in Sydney staying here. The location cannot be faulted, neither could the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff! Just a short walk to Darling Harbour, Town Hall Station and so much more. We have two small children (4 & 7) and so had a 2 bedroomed apartment, choosing a higher floor (19th) as this had been recommended on previous reviews to stay away from street noise, the living space and balcony were great once the kids were asleep. The downs ... the apartment was quite tired (cracked plugs and peeling paintwork in places), the oven was probably older than me but it worked and the cockroaches were plentiful, so it was probably a bit overpriced ... but would we stay there again ... no hesitation whatsoever!~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_338157124~“Excellent location!”~The location in Sydney is excellent, a few minutes walk to Darling Harbour, Chinatown, and Paddy's Markets. The nearest train station is Town Hall - this station has lifts and escalators and direct trains to the airport. The apartment was spacious, but looked a bit tired. Nearby supermarkets which is great. The couple looking after the place are extremely friendly and helpful. Wifi is only available in the lobby, but is complimentary. It is a bit pricey for the single traveler, but ideal for families.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_333621000~“Would return despite all the cons”~As the title suggests, there are plenty of cons, but after our experience, we think the pros outweigh them. We go to Sydney every so often, and we'd be happy to stay again in the future. The issues are whether you can overlook all the cons, namely: shabby interiors and shabby household stuff/less than 5 star cleanliness and presentation. Some examples: air con could only work in either lounge OR bedrooms at any one time - annoying; we had to ask for 3 lightbulbs to be replaced when we arrived; kitchen is less than satisfactorily equipped (peeler didn't work - really blunt, lack of cooking pots and pans, etc); had to also ask for shower head to be fixed; we found a dirty sock in the wardrobe (definitely not ours!) and whilst our apartment appeared clean, it seemed to have a layer of grime and dust and I get the feeling that it was cleaned a long time ago. The balcony door also didn't lock. Toilet was really old school (one flush - no half flushes, so that gives an indication of how outdated things are). And all the taps and shower heads seemed very leaky/drippy. Noise wasn't an issue for us - we were on the 9th floor and you could hear general "bustle" of the city. Occasionally you'd hear another apartment's front door slam, but that's about it.  But these are all things we would be prepared to overlook. The location is so convenient, being right in the middle of Sydney CBD. And staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a 9pm flight home and requested a late checkout. We were told to stay "as long as we want" on the last day and just drop the keys off into the reception chute.~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_331725720~“Off the beaten path, with FREE parking near downtown Sydney”~The room was very clean, and with the kitchen and washer and dryer it made our week in Sydney both very comfortable, and less expensive than eating out every meal. Within walking distance of some lovely coffee shops, and a large mall where you can food and products of all kinds. Check in was fast and easy. The patio overlooked a busy street though, so a bit of street noise with no real view. The hot tub up on the roof looked nice, but was very cold. They said it was cold because it had only been in the 50s outside. However, it appeared the heater didn't work at all...~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_328223860~“Like Borrowing Your Friend's Condo”~The Waldorf was a happy surprise. Located about midway between Circular Quay and the train Central Station, this property is half a block off George Street on Liverpool. The location provides easy access to light rail, bus, and subway public transportation virtually anywhere. Purchase an Opal card at either of the convenience stores, one next door and another across the street from the property, and you're good to go (unlimited rides every Sunday for $2.50 on your card, so that's a good day to use the ferries). There's a Cole's supermarket in the shopping arcade down the escalator at the intersection of George and Liverpool, as well as a ANB ATM at street level above the downstairs arcade. Anything you forgot and left at home you can probably replace very inexpensively at Paddy's Market (walk out the front door of the hotel, turn right on Liverpool, right again on George and continue to the light rail tracks, then turn right once more one block to Paddy's). Hankering for fish that's so fresh you have to slap it before you eat it? Take the light rail to the Fish Market, just a few stops from Paddy's. The location of these serviced apartments is close to perfect. You'll find the couple greeting you at check-in will treat you like family, help you with directions, and offer helpful suggestions to your inquiries.  If you're looking for a luxury Hyatt resort, this isn't one. It also doesn't rent for $750 a night. But if you want something comfy, secure, well equipped, and functional at a price that's wallet friendly, the Waldorf is probably the best overall value in Sydney.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_323414039~“In a state of disrepair and NOISY”~Disappointed. The building looks nothing like the pictures. From the grubby reception door to the shabby apartment. The aircon only has one setting ~ freezing! One would assume hat one could maybe switch it off and open the windows~ NOT! They a screwed closed! (That has to be in violation of some rule?) The bathrooms are ancient! the noise if one opens the front sliding door makes it impossible to think, never mind sleep! The paint on the walls is old and tatty and dirty. The bedroom cupboards stink. Thre in no place for folded clothes in the cupboards. The shower door comes off the rails if one breathes on it. The kitchen is not equipped for self catering. A few knives, forks and plates doesn't make it selfcatering. There are no: placemats, table cloths, no salad bowels, the are only 2x pots and one old poaching pan with the poaching bits missing, even the ironing board has broken legs. These apartments are in need of renovations, a good clean,paint and restocking. The positive is that all the staff that I have met have been very helpful. There are clean sheets and plenty clean towels.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_320884221~“convenient location”~This apartment is not fancy but it is perfect for families. It is located 5 min walk away from a good supermarket, train station and a bus stop. The supermarket is inside the mall, which has plenty of eating options and shopping. There is even a free bus that takes you on main street all the way to the ferries and to the Sydney Opera House. The Waldorf staff was very helpful, fixing few issues we had right away. They made our 2 week stay very comfortable. The apartments were quiet too due to their location, which means good sleep!!! Tip: there is a great cafe on your way to the market and buses that bakes the delicious muffins every morning. They are best in town and priced well :)~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_317641013~“Excellent value for money”~We booked a two-bedroom apartment in the Waldorf during the 2014 summer school holidays and could not have been happier with our choice of hotel. The Waldorf was one block from Darling Harbour's cafe district, six blocks from Circular Quay and one block from the shopping district. The apartment was very spacious and comfortable with big beds, a large kitchen and lounge and bathroom. This hotel was a really great find and the bonus of a rooftop pool and sauna and close to Chinatown a great bonus! One piece of advice- if arriving from the airport consider taking a train or a return-trip bus... the traffic from the hotel to the airport caused our taxi fare to bust through $50, even though it only cost $20 to reach the hotel in the first place!~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_314606990~“Wonderful Accommodation, Home from Home!”~We have just returned from a fabulous trip to Australia. We stayed for 3 weeks at the Waldorf Apartments, Liverpool Street, Sydney. NSW, and I can honestly say it was the best accommodation we have ever had!  Our apartment was very modern, it had one bedroom with fitted wardrobes along one wall, furnished lounge, TV, fully fitted kitchen, including dishwasher, microwave & fridge/freezer. A wonderful bathroom with large wet room. Washing machine and tumble drier. Large balcony. The staff were wonderful, very friendly and helpful. The apartments were serviced twice a week with clean towels, bedding and supplies, including, tea, coffee, sugar & milk. Unfortunately the swimming pool on the roof was being updated so we weren't allowed access but that didn't matter as there were so many other things to see and do. The apartments are in a wonderful location in the city, central to everything. 5 minutes walk to Darling Harbour, where you can catch ferries to different locations. China Town is literally round the corner, the Spanish Quarter, with restaurants, Flamenco Dancers and great Sangria is next door. Underneath is a fabulous Italian restaurant called Mammas, serving delicious home-cooked Italian food. There are loads of restaurants, cafes and pubs to choose from in and around the area. 10 minutes walk to Paddy's Market. A massive shopping centre with Coles Supermarket is 5 minutes away in George Street. You can catch a bus from George Street to almost anywhere. We would recommend a 'high up' apartment to the back of the building, as the city can get very loud, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, so this helps deafen the noise. We were on the 14 floor at the back, not a great view during the day but at night it was wonderful to look out at the lights of the city. We can thoroughly recommend The Waldorf Apartments in Liverpool Street, we would definitely go there again if we ever return to Sydney.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

Ideal location with our 2 small boys as we could go to Darling Harbour and release them in the playground. Housekeeping is every 4 days so we had clean sheets pretty often.

review_270150012~“Don't count on the pool!”~Great value, location, clean, comfortable, everything works.  Service - generally good although offsite after hours. Close proximity to city, Darling Harbour, great restaurants. We chose this hotel for a weeks stay as we had our grandchild travelling with us. It advertises a pool. The pool area is at the top of the building & is a very depressing tired old space. The pool broke down whilst we were there. No out of order notice, just all locked up. Vague response from mgt about when it would be available and we had to cope with the expectations of a child. Arrggh. We solved the problem to some degree by cabbing to Wooloomoo Pool (awesome) and walking up town several blocks to a local public pool...also a pretty good experience. Even after the pool was fixed- we chose to avoid.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan

review_226780819~“Another good experience”~This time we stayed in a studio apartment, rather than a one bedroom one. Our first room had a rather unpleasant smell and on being informed, the very pleasant and helpful staff apologised and promptly gave us another room. We find the position great for using public transport, the free undercover parking and very adequate breakfast a bonus . It is a quiet, convenient location within easy reach of a great shopping centre with a very good supermarket, a short walk, and lots of interesting art galleries, studios and eateries. Our home away from home in Sydney.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_225938606~“Clean and convenient”~This place was spotless. The staff were friendly and the facilities were great. We stayed in a studio apartment and was satisfied with our stay. It was very quiet and the staff were friendly. The breakfast was basic but plenty of cereal choices and juices. No complaints. Was a bit far from the CBD but once we worked out the bus system it was fine. A quick walk to the local supermarket so long as you don't mind the massive staircase! Wasn't too bad! Over all we were very happy and would stay again,~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_216091488~“Dirty and run down”~I checked-in last night and will be checking out first thing today. When walking into the apartment half the lights didn't work, taps leaking, en suite smelt like a urinal which stunk out the master suite, rusty looking water coming out of taps and dirty floors, broken parts of walls falling off and unsafe electrical cords broken and exposed. I have taken photos of all this to send through to the company that booked my accommodation as this is not normal or acceptable standard. I would not recommend staying here especially if you have a crawling child or toddler.  I noticed my daughter was eating something off the ground, they looked like rabbit pallets they were everywhere and when picking her up she was black on her clothes and hands, I grab a wet cloth and wiped the floor to my disguist it was absolutely filthy.  So shocked at the price they charge for this run down crap shack. I am now moving to the Meriton which I In fact know are 100 X's better and surprisingly a fraction of the price.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_208984386~“Great value and location”~Fantastic location, nearly on the corner of Liverpool & Sussex streets Sydney. A short stroll to Darling Harbour. A 15-20 minute walk to 2 train stations, Town Hall and Central, and from there, you can get all around Sydney. I had a 1 bedroom apartment, with a large lounge/dining room, separate full kitchen and large bathroom. Also had a big balcony. I rang 4-5 days prior to my arrival and booked the onsite car parking spot; no charge, which is a huge saving for Sydney accommodation costs. This is secure building, so only those invited in, get in. Bob on the front desk is amazing, being knowledgeable on tourism issues and friendly to boot. Reception is not 24 hours, but this is not a problem. There are a couple of convenience stores close by, and a Coles supermarket 1 block away. This location is close to many first class restaurants. I had a room on the 15th floor, which was far enough away from the traffic noises of a big city; the room was in the back of the building~5~5~4~5~4~3~4~nan

review_203787391~“Noisy and dated - fantastic location”~On the positive side: the one br apartment is spacious and well equipped. Nice bed and good sofa bed in the living. Fantastic location close to Darling Harbour, museums, shops etc. Great value. Free parking. On the negative side: a very dated apartment, lamps that were already an eyesore in the 70'ies, no decorations, very basic. We were on the 19th floor at the front- it was extremely noisy from road noise and party-goers and from the corridor. No sound insulation. In the week we were there it was serviced once. I guess you get what you pay for. We were very much aware that the reception closes at 4pm. No problem. The very basic apartment was also not a problem. We actually had fun discussing the most horrible ceiling lamps I ever saw - so ugly that they became interesting. It was also great to have free parking - that normally comes with a huge price tag in the CBD. What really got under our skin was the street noise. Never realized that police and fire trucks had to race through the streets so often. We expected the 19th floor to be high enough, but without sound insulation it obviously wasn't.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_203670126~“A very comfortable stay.”~This was my second stay at the Waldorf Apartment. The first time was with a group of friends and we had two, two bedroom apartments, this time my stay was with my husband in a one bedroom apartment. I was pleasantly surprised at how roomy the one bedroom apartment was. It had everything that we required, a fully equipped kitchen and washing machine and dryer. The location could not be better. Only a short walk to shops in the CBD and numerous restaurants to choose from. The apartment was very clean. The bed extremely comfortable. I found the staff on the front desk very helpful on both stays. It is very difficult to find accommodation in central Sydney such as this at such a reasonable price. We will definitely be staying here again when traveling to Sydney next.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_202773309~“BRILLIANT LOCATION”~Our family of 5 had a fabulous time at the Waldorf. It's a good solid 3 star hotel at an excellent price (with free parking!) The location could not be better- so easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go in the city and lots of restaurant choices on the door step (try Mammas for dinner- really good food at very reasonable prices). We could hear sirens but no other street noise so that didnt bother us) We had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 8th floor - views weren't great but the apartment was renovated so we were very happy. The kitchen was extremely well stocked with everything we needed and the washer and dryer were a nice touch. Would not hesitate to stay here again.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_201312072~“accommodation”~We found the apartment was quite good apart from the staff on the front desk who weren't very helpful especially when we were leaving with our friends who by the way had to catch an international flight which they had booked the day before with the staff only to be told after waiting half an hour for the airport shuttle that he had forgotton to notify them and when we challenged him he just shrugged it of with the comment `I must have forgot`, this is not the way to run a business, we had intended to book into the Waldorf in August but after this fiasco we obviously looked elsewhere.~3~1~5~2~4~3~1~nan
review_199380310~“Great Stay in a Central Location”~We were booked 3 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment and were situated on the 15th floor. The apartments are a little outdated but this was only a minor moan. They were spacious plenty of kitchen utensils, very comfortable. we had a balcony which overlooked the city and we could see the sea. the location is great for everything in the city, we could walk to most tourist attractions, the cost of the apartment was very reasonable for the location. We arrived at 10.00 am in the morning and the previous people had just vacated the apartment but the guy at reception took our luggage from us and told us to go for a coffee and he would get the cleaning staff into the apartment straight away and we could obtain access about 11.00am, which was great because according to our booking access could not be until 2.00pm He wa very helpful, pleasant and would help with any query we had.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_198014938~“fab apartment in great location!”~I booked this apartment with 2 bedrooms as my sister and I were visiting Sydney with our parents and we wanted somewhere nice for them to stay. It was a bit pricier than other places we had seen on line at $1400 for 5 nights but divided by 4 that's not too bad for a great location near darling harbor and George street. we were extremely pleased when we opened the door to find the apartment was ginormous and nicely decorated and looked fresh and modern. the folks had a room with a double bed and en suite and my sis and I shared a twin room and had the bathroom down the hall. There was a nice sized kitchen full of everything you would want, a lovely sitting room with big TV and a balcony overlooking Liverpool street. we had a great time in Sydney and would def stay here again my only one criticism is there is a small sharp barely noticeable step going into the bathrooms and poor dad stubbed his toe very badly on it!~5~4~4~4~5~4~5~nan
