review_478464934~“Best Hotel I have stayed in”~4th stay at this marvelous hotel where the service has never diminished. Each time I have been upgraded which is very much appreciated.  Each member of staff provides the top service in their area from concierge to housekeeping to check-in and checkout. Great location for shopping.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478426175~“Perfect location and Nespresso”~Location: Townhall station is in proximity. A surrounded by great restaurants and a plenty of shopping malls. With a short walk to China town for a variety of best restaurants. the closest supermarket is Woolworth at Townhall station and Coles world square both are in 350 meters. Reception: check-in and check-out process are very efficient and impressive Room: spacious size of room, i love the hotel provide universal plug in the room. i have no problem charging my electronic devices :D. I felt the room has been recently renovated. You can find any information from the TV screen. The electronic light switch is a bit difficult to handle. you need to read each item before turning the light on. Not to mention, i enjoyed a cup of Nespresso every morning of my stay. The hotel provides us 3 capsules a day. Building: the tower is not high relative to surround building. i got a room with the view of construction site.  Bath room: sexy bath room a glass wall overlooking the bedroom, but the hotel equipped the curtain on the wall. Toiletries are local brand Appelles. The thing i don't like the bathroom is in the shower area. The shower opener locates on the different side of the wall of the shower. it is very inconvenient. the water pressure is a bit low comparing to the other hotel i stayed in Sydney. Gym: the hotel has a little gym on the basement. limited number of machine~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478141089~“Nice hotel with great location ”~Nice hotel with really nice rooms. Got and upgrade since I stayed here 9 nights. Staff was smiling and helpful. Location is next to the shopping area and walking distance to the circular quay.  The pool area is nice BUT next to the hotel is a building under construction witch makes it impossible to be in the pool area.  In the morning you can also hear the construction noice in the rooms.  I would have rated the hotel with a four but due to the noice I only gave them 3.  I would love to come back to the hotel again but only when the neighbor building is finished.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477887678~“Primus Hotel - Devine Decadence!”~Art Deco Glamour from the Roof-Top Terrace, Bar & Pool down to the Ground-Floor Lobby, Eateries and Bar. The Deluxe King Room was spacious, luxurious and very peaceful. No view but the closed curtains looked stunning anyways! Style - Faultless Service - Faultless  Room - Faultless Tip - adjacent construction work was on hiatus during my stay - very lucky! Best to check in with reservations about this before your stay~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477849794~“Wonderful week's stay”~We stayed for week between cruises. We were greeted by concierge, Buster, with a very warm and sincere welcome. Our room was not quite ready forfor shoe took care of storing our luggage until it was. Check in was extremely easy and also very pleasant. Kudos to David and others at the front desk. All very knowledgeable and friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable.  This hotel is centrally located for easy access to publictransportation, though we never used it. We were able to walk easily to such places as Circular Quay, Chinatown, Darling Harbor. Hyde Park was just a block away. Also the Hop-on-Hop-Off bus to Bondi Beach was around the corner.  We had a medical emergency and the staff made sure we were able to get to emergency room. We were surprised when we received a call from assistant manager Refel(sp?) checking to see we were getting the care we needed. If you are coming to Sydney you won't be disappointed by staying here. (There is construction going on and daytime noise may be bothersome but there is lots of construction in Sydney). Go and enjoy yourselves.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477330828~“hotel information”~First time at this hotel will probable stay again, however I did experience a problem, they advertised a certain rate, booked this however changed this on the last day before we came to stay stating that they were nearly fully booked and needed to change the price, however we agreed that they have to stand by their initial booking. suggest people who stay should always check this.~4~4~4~5~5~5~4~nan

review_476924678~“Quick Easter Break in Sydney”~Great location on Pitt Street close to everything you need for a fun stay in Sydney. Hotel staff super friendly, helpful and polite. Breakfast was lovely and worth adding to remove the worry about where you will eat your breakfast, although there are plenty of places nearby. Room was amazing with plenty of space to move around with a sofa and desk for working from. Plenty of storage, hanging space for your clothes.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476747919~“Overall good stay”~Stayed at the Primus for 5 nights. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Our only complaint was with housekeeping. Just about everyday we were there we had to call to ask for something they had missed in our room. They were quick in responding but we should not have to call for missed items. Overall, we had a good stay.~5~4~5~5~3~4~4~nan
review_476278458~“Loves this hotel...super spacious room. ”~Stayed one night after an overseas flight before returning home. Room was lovely, great bed, lovely bathroom and plenty of space.

Easy walk to train station with lifts if carrying luggage.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476232052~“Caters to overseas tourists”~Two night stay over Easter. Arrived Thursday evening and after fighting traffic and roadworks had a hell of a time actually finding the hotel (it's really poorly signposted). Once we arrived the car was valet parked (beware it's $70 per night but that looks like the going rate locally). Ours was a king room and really spacious. Separate lounge area, big bathroom and two TVs. Bed was comfy... only complaint was the eternity it took to get hot water through the taps. Best spot is the rooftop area with a bar and pool... we had a couple of relaxing hours in the sun there. We payed $25 each for breakfast on Friday morning which was OK but the service was a bit lacking and we only found the hot options by accident as they are a bit hidden down by the kitchen. Service generally was good but a bit pretentious for us and clearly aimed at high end international travellers. Other issue for us was that we had (and still have) nearly $800 held on our credit card despite paying in full from a savings account on departure. When I rang the hotel to ask why this still appeared (and so impacted our available balance) I was told it is because a different credit card was used to pay (it was not a credit card) and that the funds would be released in 3 to 5 working days. Not sure if this is a hotel issue or a bank issue but it is pretty ordinary.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475765085~“Excellent stay”~My husband and I stayed for two nights at Primus hotel in Sydney recently and we had a great stay. We received a warm welcome on arrival, a room upgrade and an early-check in, and the room and hotel facilities were all great. Good wifi, great location close to everything, comfortable bed, amazing bathroom - I could go on. There is a construction site next door which is somewhat unfortunate, but there is double glazing and they don't start work until after 8am so although we were worried when we first walked up, it really didn't bother us at all. Overall a wonderful stay, and I would certainly stay again and recommend to others!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475411465~“bad experience”~noise of next door made my stay unbearable. staff never told me about this when i checked in and i was rudely awaken by a works elavtor and crashing pipes and heavy shifting from before 7am. the next night i shifted to the other side of the hotel. still heard the noise but bearable. don't stay here if you want to sleep in!~1~1~4~1~2~5~2~nan
review_475372509~“Australia 2017”~Amazing hotel. Likely the best room we ever stayed in. Unfortunately there is some construction going on next door, but besides that noise our 3 day stay was fantastic. The breakfast at the hotel is well worth the money.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474844605~“Part hotel part construction site”~Hotel is part of a construction site. The noise starts at 5am with workmen yelling and machinery on the move and carries on throughout the day to the point it shakes the fittings in the room so dont expect to enjoy the amenities like the rooftop bar and gym in relative peace and quiet. If you've been within 1km of the area you can hear the noise. Its a shame because I'm sure its a great hotel when it's peaceful but this is all I'll remember from my stay at The Primus, and it was unfortunate that there was no warning at the time of booking that you're just a high viz jacket and a hard hat away from being called onto the job site.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474380486~“Another fabulous stay at Primus”~Customer service is amazing at this hotel. Always feel so welcomed, nothing is too much trouble.

review_473922368~“Do NOT stay at this hotel if you want nice and quiet holiday”~We stay in room 201 from 8-11 April. Absolutely horrible experience and do NoT recommend anyone to stay here if you want nice and quiet holiday. Heavy construction site literally next to hotel and construction noise starts as early as 7.15 am and full drilling at 8am sharp. Drilling sometimes shaken the ground and we can feel even in the room We would have wanted to check out since first 1 hour after checking in - but it has been prepaid agoda.  Staff are useless and they have done nothing despite our complaints.  Again - do NOT stay, until construction is over which I guess could last a year~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472972099~“5 Night Stay in Sydney”~This was our first visit to Australia and the Primus was our first hotel experience in this country. It exceeded our expectations. We arrived very early in the morning after along flight from the UK. Our room wasn't ready but the helpful reception staff arranged to phone us as soon as our room was available while we went and explored Sydney. On our return to the hotel, we were delighted to find that Derrick had arranged an upgrade to ensure that our room requests were catered for. Also our bags had been sent to our room. The room was modern, spacious and clean. All the staff were extremely helpful, efficient and friendly. Breakfast was delightful.The hotel is situated within walking distance of the main shopping area,train stations and most of the sights. We could not fault our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472913010~“Great hotel and super location”~This hotel has a fabulous central location within walking distance of many tourist sites. The room was large and the bed comfortable. There is some construction noise next door during the day, but it stops in the evening and overnight so it wasn't a problem. Staff were friendly and helpful, all our requests were met quickly and with a smile. We would stay here again.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_472509624~“Lovely hotel - perfect location”~My husband and i just stayed there for 2 nights this past weekend. Hotel was lovely apart from the construction noise next door, but it wasn't going on at night, so fine. We got a free upgrade to a suite - it was fantastic - wow - so spacious. The location is perfect - just a few minutes walk to Darling Harbour and about a 25 minute walk to Circular Quay to see the Opera House and Bridge. The staff were fantastic - super polite and friendly, just really likeable people ! We lucked out with weather and it was perfect on Saturday. We did the hop on - hop off bus tour - worth it. Both nights we ate down at Darling harbour. The buffet breakfast was nice, although we only ate there one morning as we had to leave early for a flight on our last day.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_472263462~“Another awesome stay”~Had a short stay in Sydney on my way to China, decided to stay back in the Primus after a year since my last I wanted to see how it has changed. Everything has settled to a routine and the staff look and work more at ease, the first time everyone was to highly strung. I noticed there are some signs of wear and tear that a 5star should be on top off. mainly chips and dings. I do find the lobby a little sterile and unfriendly, its missing something, just a bit of warmth and love. Staff interacted well, my stand out was actually the elevator tech guy, I was struggling to get to the elevator with my bags, he parked the lift for me, went and grab my other bag and took me down...awesome service. This is still a hidden gem and good value, I love the location for an early morning walk in the park. Yes pretty dam good overall. Thank you~5~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
review_472243617~“Fantastic and World Class Service, Just Excellent!”~This property excites me a little. Reading through all the reviews, i thought i might give it a go. I travel to Sydney for business almost twice a month from Singapore.  I have to say this is by far one of the best hotel service that I've experienced in Australia. I've stayed in many hotels in Australia but not one single hotel can beat the level of service that this hotel provides. I'll highlight the reason at the end of review.  Firstly, the check-in. It was a wet rainy late afternoon. As soon as i arrive, my door was promptly opened and i was greeted warmly by the door lady with an umbrella. Can't really remember her name but she had a lovely smile. She took my bags and brought it into the hotel immediately. Then a whole bunch of My colleagues arrived on a bus.  At this time, the lobby looked really busy and my, those pillars looked stunning and amazing. The space was grand! The lobby does need a little more decoration though, it looks a little too empty. Maybe some modern lighting hanging from the amazing skylights would be a great start?  Anyways back to check-in, there was a long Q cause of our group arriving all at the same time. Wasn't sure why the organizer didn't arrange for a group check-in for us.  While we were on Q, we were greeted by Mavrick. He had one of the biggest smiles. He greeted every single person in line by welcoming us to the hotel while waiting for us to be served. The check-in process, i must say, was the fastest I've ever experienced. Towels presented to me when i arrive at the desk, welcome drinks provided, great touches there! don't think you can find it at any other aussie hotels. Information was then reconfirmed, keys presented, wifi and hotel facility all explained within minutes. Can't ask for more. As soon as i got my keys, the porters then escorted me to my room. What a perfect and smooth sailing check-in process.  Now the room, it was modern and the design was great. Lighting panel was a little problematic as mentioned by other reviewers but it's fine, i can live with it. The room was a little dusty though. Servicing of the room was a little worrying, bits and pieces was missing here and there throughout my stay. Room was touched up after i've mentioned it to the front desk staff, return back in the evening and turndown looked great and at the same time simple. Received two chocolate balls with a card when i returned. How good was that?  overall service was very good cause whatever problems or request i had, it all came through almost instantaneously. For example: i requested for a 10 page printout and it arrived at my door within 5 minutes. Talk about service express, other top international chain hotels should learn from this.  while walking towards the restaurant for breakfast, i was then greeted by name from 2 of the front desk staff. How did they know my name? Anyways for breakfast service, it was a little average. The spread was very good for an aussie hotel, however with the amount of staff members on the floor. Maybe staff members could be engaging more with guests rather than grouping around and chit chatting. I can see managers trying hard to interact with every table but staff members seemed lethargic or reluctant to work. We are all human, doesn't really bother me. Nonetheless, breakfast experience was Ok but could be better. The bar at the lobby was an interesting one, staff members were very engaging and welcoming. Aurel and Nitin served us and they were both lovely! Maybe the drinks could have been presented quicker? was waiting quite a long time for my drinks to arrive though and the place wasn't full.  Overall experience was Excellent! small little points to work with but it was great as it beats any other Australian hotels.  Now to the reason, My experiences in Aussie hotels (Chain or not chain). All of them and i mean ALL, love defending themselves or arguing with guests when something wrong happens but this hotel, they do more to rectify the stay and try their best to do the extra mile. This is what defines service in hospitality and Asia does best in this. Aussie hotels need to learn from this hotel, especially how the porters and front desk staff carry themselves. you must be very proud in having such an amazing bunch of people. I've wanted to rate it 4 star with all the hiccups but the service from the front desk staff and porters is the very reason why i rate 5 star for this property.  With this experience, I would definitely share with my friends back home in London and in Singapore. Would definitely return for a second stay.  Side Note: There are still some construction noise coming from next door but it's not the hotels problem though. Speak to the front desk staff, they will arrange a room move for you immediately if you're not happy with the sound and room type. If you're looking for a relaxing afternoon, you won't be able to enjoy the pool or pool bar with the noise going on like that all day but a visit to the hotel is definitely well worth it.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471503989~“Great Downtown hotel”~The Primus in the middle of the bayfront downtown action. The staff are very friendly waiting to help you with every need. The rooms are good size with minor mildew in the bath area, but very clean and updated. The building was office space converted to a hotel, old but a little unique. You can walk to the waterfront or museums in minutes.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471417974~“Very Good”~Nice hotel with very good staff. The hotel has a large lobby with wonderful architecture, rooms are very clean, a bit of noise though from the construction going on near by the hotel during my stay however, was later transferred to a different room that was less noisy and spacious overall a great hotel with good service and very helpful staff.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_470975423~“Great service and a beautiful transformation of this heritage building”~We had an absolutely excellent stay here a couple of weekends ago and from beginning to end the experience was faultless. An upgrade at Check-in and super helpful staff are the sorts of things that make all the difference. Yes there was construction in the building next door which made the pool/terrace area noisy on Monday morning but the weekend was unaffected. This won't last forever and the hotel will be even better once this has been completed. Added to this was the wonderful way in which the building itself has been restored with all the best features lovingly enhanced and adapted.  We will definitely stay here again next time we're in Sydney. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469748825~“Very happy with our stay ”~Lovely food, fantastic customer service at the bar in the lobby, architecture is truely fascinating (I love the big red poles!). Comfortable stay and conference room was spacious and well-equipped. Only thing I could critique was the strange idea of blurred glass in the bathrooms (I was staying with a work colleague) - and she could see my silhouette on the toilet/getting undressed for the shower. I know it's only a silhouette but still mildly akward...! However would not be an issue to stay with a partner or family :) overall loved it, would go back~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469227132~“Sydney's Primus Hotel is a good choice”~The location of the new Primus Hotel in Sydney is excellent; close to a lot of restaurants, shops, and nightlife. The lobby is very attractive and the room was nicely done. The concierge went out of his way to provide ideas on activities and nightlife and I appreciated that.  There was noise from street construction and that was a bit irritating even though we had an interior room. It would have been a lot worse in rooms facing the street.  I found the light system in the room to be very confusing and there were no instructions.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468999108~“Ideal”~The hotel is in an ideal situation. Within walking distance from station, easy to catch Uber and centrally located amount great small food shops. The reception are or lobby is bright and shows off the Art Deco traits of the building. The dining area and bar are well serviced by waiters and batman. The one dinner and great breakfast I had was very enjoyable. My bedroom was clean and well furnished. However, Like some other reviewers I did have trouble with the Privacy light! Found the bed and pillows very comfortable to sleep upon. Essentially my only problem was like some other reviewers , poor or no response from House keeping. It could have been my problem with Privacy light but even with request being put to Reception three times Housekeeping didn't attend to my needs. Just not good enough house keeping !! I won't return, but would suggest you give it a try as the people are very willing to help as best they can ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468561581~“Impressive!”~We were very impressed by our four night stay at the Primus Hotel in February 2017. The renovated building is beautiful and gave a wonderful first impression as we were greeted promptly and efficiently by the front desk staff. Our hotel room was spacious, very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathroom was a perfect size with a large walk in shower. We appreciated the large fluffy towels and the comfy robes. We noted that the room was equipped with everything that you might need such as an international plug adapter, a corkscrew, flashlight and even a weigh scale in the bathroom. The staff of the Primus Hotel are very professional and personable and respond promptly to all questions and requests. Special mention to Connie who assisted us with a concern in a very kind and professional manner. We enjoyed the lovely breakfast buffet each morning and again we compliment the staff on their excellent service. We will highly recommend the Primus Hotel to our travel advisor and to any of our family and friends who are travelling to Sydney.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468151354~“In the heart of Sydney”~Great location on Pitt and Bathurst, the Primus Hotel was nondescript from the exterior however delightfully posh inside.  David, the head concierge, imparted wisdom on the best eats, great get around ideas as well as the history of the building.  This was the old Water board building and a lot of original marble, strong rooms, stairs and even toilets were used in the restoration.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and large with primo soap, shampoo and conditioner. I'd have liked a door on the toilet however the big soaking tub makes up for it. TV programming is vast and varied and if desired, there's a good selection of mini bar goodies.  Construction on the building next door wasn't an issue during the evening, however quite loud in the day.  Finally, there is a lovely pool on the top floor with a bar.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468117598~“Wonderful downtown hotel”~This hotel we liked the best because they have a rooftop swimmingpool (believe it or not, not so common in Sydney), and relax area and bar. Unfortunately for the hotel, the neighbours are building the tallest residential tower in town. This comes with noise. Our first room was therefor very noisy and after complaining we where transferred to another no noise room plus some very generous extra's. The staff is very friendly and efficient. Breakfast generous and a good for supper too. After 24hr airplane food the wagyu burger tasted devine.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_467906849~“Great location - that is about it”~Room was not the best, old and was popped into a disabled room. Each time I showered water would fill the bathroom. Also had to ask for ice three times and still never received this.  When checking in they advised that I would have a lovely view of the "atrium" lol it was the view of the roof of the middle of the building, that someone had dropped a packet of cigarettes and a notebook on top of. LOL View! Drinks and food very over priced, and the rooftop bar has had some great pics taken of it because it doesn't look like that in real life. Location however is great, easy to get to all the laneway bars and eateries........also quick walk to the harbor. So for location, great for accommodation not so great for me!~2~2~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_467715760~“Great stay, a few minor niggles”~We stayed for 4 nights straight after 24 hours of solid travel from the UK. We arrived a bit early for checking in at around 9am due to our flight times, and unfortunately the hotel couldn't allocate us a room any earlier than 12-1pm. So although I was tired and dying to freshen up, we did have to go out into the city and amuse ourselves for a few hours until a room was available, though we could leave the suitcases at the hotel. We had emailed the hotel in advance about early room availability too, but no joy.  Anyway, once we had our room the hotel was lovely. Big spacious room and shower. Downside was we had no bath tub. Also we found the automated light switches a little confusing (couldn't seem to get just the bedside lights on, and my husband is an engineer and has a keen interest in designing home automation, so if we couldn't work it out then I doubt others could!!). The do not disturb sign was also electronic and easy to forget to turn on or off. Breakfast was good quality and plentiful and overlooked the impressive lobby area. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was in a good location to explore the city, not far from the tube station and walking distance to Darling Harbour and other places. Unfortunately weather was not such that we could enjoy the pool area, but this was very stylish and inviting. Unfortunately as well as overcast weather there was also building works going on in close proximity, so we didn't spend much time at all up here. All in all we had a good time here with just a few minor niggles. But the hotel as a whole is very impressive and it did feel like a grand place to stay. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467304818~“Great Staff”~Nice spacious room - although the labelling for the light switches might bear in mind that not all of us have 20/20 vision! That apart - we could not fault this hotel.

review_466863958~“Loved it! Excellent Sydney base and wonderful staff!”~I chose this hotel for a short stay in Sydney based on the glowing TripAdvisor reviews and am so thankful I did! Everything, from the staff to the spacious rooms, was impeccable. The hotel itself is a boutique right in Sydney's CBD, with easy access to public transportation.  PROS: 1) Large rooms - Our executive rooms was huge, complete with walk in shower and stand alone tub. The beds were very comfortable and the room facing the inner courtyard had no noise. Our room rate also included free wifi.  2) Excellent staff - From the moment we arrived, we were waited on hand and foot by the friendly and engaged staff. We arrived at the hotel around 8am and the staff had us into our rooms by 10am (even though check-in is 3pm), along with a complimentary upgrade to an Executive Room! The concierge even gave us a lovely brunch recommendation while we waited for our room to be serviced.  3) Rooftop pool and amenities - Because of our early morning arrival, we were given access to the rooftop pool, complete with showers and clean towers to freshen up. This was a lifesaver as we were coming off a long flight from the U.S. The rooftop itself is trendy with an inviting pool area and bar. CONS: 1) No great views - the hotel is in a relatively low rise refurbished waterworks building with a lot of the great, old architecture. But, it's eclipsed by skyscrapers on all sides, so there are no really great views. This is a nitpicky point, as the hotel is only a 10-15 minute walk to the harbor areas, where there are more than enough fantastic views. 2) Rooms facing street can be a bit noisy - our inner courtyard room was quiet and peaceful, but the room facing Pitt Street had some outside noise from the cleaning trucks early in the morning.  Overall, I loved staying at the Primus and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to avoid the large, corporate, and faceless CBD hotels. It's a beautifully restored hotel with great staff.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466617088~“Just Superb!!”~Checked in for one night. On check in we were given a free room upgrade to a Superior Suite. Staff couldn't have been more helpful if they tried and so very polite and courteous. The hotel itself is a magnificently restored Art Deco masterpiece! The room we had was just beautiful. Huge bathroom, comfortable bed and very tasteful decor.  In the morning we had the very reasonably priced buffet breakfast. If you can't find something here you don't like you're not looking hard enough as they had everything you could imagine.  Suffice to say we'll be staying at The Primus again.

review_466607632~“Lovely Hotel, Great Room & Breakfast”~Stayed for 5 nights on our first trip to Sydney. Hotel is about 20 minutes walk to the harbour so in a very good location. Room very nice, clean & great shower. Breakfast very good, lots of choice both hot and cold. Staff friendly and helpful from the start to the end of our stay. Would recommend~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466392429~“Excellent hotel in a very convenient location ”~Stayed for 8 nights in an Executive twin. Very nice and modern room. Free use of nespresso coffee machine. Everything is electronically controlled, including the "Privacy" sign. The staff is very courteous and willing to help. Did I mention that it is centrally located! A short 15 minute walk gets you to Central Station where you can catch any bus/train to anywhere in Sydney. There is also a bus stop and train station located within a 5 minute walk. All in all an excellent stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465984950~“Beautiful”~My partner and I stayed at the Primus Hotel for a special occasion and we absolutely loved it. The suite we had was beautiful and clean and very modern. The staff are all very friendly and go above and beyond to help you. We had drinks downstairs and something to eat at the bar, the service was great and the calamari was delicious. We didn't want to leave at the end of the weekend and we'll definitely be back soon! Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465883267~“Excellent hotel.”~Primus is a gorgeous hotel in Sydney CBD. The room was spacious and well appointed, the staff were friendly, and the rooftop pool added a nice touch. We stayed there during Australia Day festivities and were able to walk down to Darling Harbour for fireworks.  My only complaint: the towel rack situation. The bathroom towel rack is located INSIDE the shower, which by the way has no door or way to fully enclose it, which is counterintuitive to say the least. But in the grand scheme of things, I really enjoyed the room and would definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_464890916~“Fabulous birthday night away”~Excellent service, the staff couldn't have been more helpful - we were made to feel very special. The Wilmot restaurant and bar was amazing. The food is sensational and service extraordinary.  Definitely recommend staying and dining here. From the complimentary room upgrade to the birthday cocktails, we had a great night to remember.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464682971~“Primus is primo!”~Though the hotel is new, the staff and the facilities seem to have been put through the paces and things ran smoothly and seamlessly from reservation to check out.  On check in we were warmly welcomed by Adrian and through conversation were advised about dining options internally and nearby. He provided us with a map, and we felt comfortable to explore on our own on foot. Great location for both shopping and sightseeing (Darling Harbour & Circular Quay are 20 mins walk).  We had an executive king room. It was beautifully appointed! Some nice touches were the Bluetooth alarm clock, the fast wifi, the Nespresso machine for coffee, the lg chaise lounge, and the picture windows and high ceilings. The soaking tub, walk in shower, boutique toiletries and luxurious robes made for a relaxing end to a long day.  Once construction next door is completed the roof top pool and bar area will be a wonderful oasis! Currently dust and noise levels during the day time leaves only late evenings to enjoy a swim.  I enjoyed my short stay at the Primus Hotel Sydney. I look forward to returning for a longer stay in the near future. The Primus is Primo!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464636692~“Top of the line in Sydney”~Absolutely fabulous stay. For a five star hotel in Sydney, it greatly exceeded my expectations - despite the Mardi Gras peak, their personalised service lived up to their five star rating, which is a rare find in a city like Sydney where service borderlines robot efficiency. I was upgraded but no one made a big fuss about it and I didn't realise until I walked into the room. Fantastic discreet surprise for a business traveller like myself. Inside the room, all five star amenities were complete, including toiletries (and toothbrush set), slippers, robe, hairdryer(s) and umbrella were all provided as expected. This place is a perfect example of how in hospitality, if a hotel just gets everything right, that is already more than enough. I would've been perfectly happy without the room upgrade.  I also want to commend the hotel in the soundproofing. I don't know if additional work was carried out despite the heritage listing, but as someone who has lived in Sydney CBD for years near this block, the soundproofing at this hotel is probably the best in Sydney.  Now if Primus wanted to reach the next stage of being one of the greatest hotels, there's a few things that can be looked at - such as concierge sometimes can seem absent as they tend to not see me until I've already lugged my luggage down the couple of stairs at the front door, the concierge is also not manned 100% of the time (e.g. very early in the mornings), the privacy light policy can be a bit confusing even though there are blaring signs on the tv so it would've been nice if reception mentioned it proactively, there was only one set of toiletries (and shower cap) for a two person room (with double vanity) which wasn't a problem for me but can be a problem for some, there is no hair straightener available in-room (although I didn't ask), the quilt ran a bit short for a small person like me, which could be a big issue for others but it may just be housekeeping need to review how much they tuck under the bed - it only ran to 3/4 of the bed about 30cm below the placement of the last pillow upright. All in all though, these are little things that sound a lot more bigger than they actually are, and I was extremely satisfied with my stay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464376103~“Great stay!!”~Superb and new hotel. The staff from the front desk to room service was prompt and professional. In the heart of the city, so if you want a beach front view, stay closer to the harbor. However, lots of people due to cruise ships parked there. Stay here if you want new furnishings, great service and an awesome breakfast.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464330528~“Great hotel, facilities and attentive staff”~I really enjoyed staying at this hotel as the rooms were spacious and well designed. Had breakfast and dinner and both were excellent.

review_464169259~“Amazing city hotel, wonderful staff + service!”~We stayed at the Primus Hotel in January. We live in Sydney but wanted to have a city break and take advantage of a weekend enjoying shopping and other sites we don't get a chance to visit often. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a valet who helped with our luggage and directed us into reception. The foyer/reception area of the building is stunning with high ceilings, lots of gorgeous furniture and light fittings and an overall feeling of glamour. Check in was quick and we were so happy with our room. It was large, airy and we loved the modern art deco features in the bathroom (also loved the bath products). Our room didn't have a view but there was lots of light and it was very quiet. Some nice touches on arrival were a bottle of champagne on ice and a cheese board. (My husband had mentioned it was a special occasion.) We headed up to the pool deck and bar. Such a great spot. Lots of tables and comfy places to sit, chilled music playing. The pool area is a bit smaller but plenty of room for sun loungers and the pool is big enough to not feel on top of each other. The roof top deck has a "New York" feel as it is amongst the city scape and surrounded by other taller buildings. We had a couple of cocktails here and a few snacks before deciding on room service for dinner as we were too tired to go out after our busy day. The quality of the food we ate was amazing. I'm not exaggerating when I say I had the best club sandwich ever. My husband had the spanner crab risotto and loved it too. We had breakfast at the buffet the next morning as this was included in our room package. It was nice, the standard hotel buffet. Cereals, pastries, bacon, eggs, sausages etc. Overall we had a wonderfully relaxing stay, the service was lovely and attentive. We really loved the central location and being in the heart of the city. It was only a couple of blocks walk to Pitt St Mall and the surrounding shopping areas and restaurants.Or a short cab ride to The Rocks, Circular Quay or Darling Harbour. They have some great packages available for room/parking/bfast. Worth keeping an eye out on their social media.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464056955~“Great Value but Dubious location”~Formerly the Head Office of the Sydney Water Company, the Primus Hotel still shows traces of its semi industrial heritage. Dark colours predominate and the ground floor is vast. However, rooms are very comfortable despite some confusing lighting arrangements, staff are outstanding and breakfasts very good. Construction work was going on whilst I was there which made one side of the hotel very noisy. Pitt Street was jammed with backpackers and construction vehicles which detracted from the vacation experience.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_464043962~“Lovely hotel but lots of street noise at weekend”~We stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night, taking advantage of a Weekend Escape package which offered a lower room rate, discounted valet parking (significantly below the usual $70 per night) and a complimentary breakfast which was excellent. The room and the bathroom were very spacious with efficient and easy to use aircon. The hotel has a huge and attractive lobby and bar area. The location is quite a distance from the harbour but that was no problem to us as we enjoyed walking. There were a few niggles. For example, the light switches are over-designed such that the reading lights are in the ceiling and blind you, but the bedside lamps can only be operated by a 'feature' switch which you have to get out of bed to operate. In the shower it was too easy to spray water into the bathroom because the shower divider only goes half-way across. We didn't use the pool but it looked very small.  The main complaint was the amount of street noise that could be heard in the room, particularly on Saturday night where boy-racers seemed to be having a great time into the small hours. This affected our sleep and left us feeling disappointed with the stay. Yes, it's a nice hotel but if I'd paid the normal expensive room rate I would have been very annoyed.~3~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_463923961~“New Hotel in the CBD well worth a visit!”~Sydney city is getting ridiculously expensive and this new hotel, whilst being 5 star provides great value for money. It used to be the old Waterboard building and is heritage listed. You can do a bit of a tour to see old relics of it's past life. The rooms are well sized for a CBD property and the food in the restaurant was excellent. Location is also a bonus being right in the heart of the shopping district. It's the first of the Primus hotels in the world I believe - with a second to go up in Shanghai - so it's not part of a chain. A great option for a Sydney stay.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463899155~“top value”~we stayed with 2 couples for 2 nights and can only recommend this place. our room was like new. very quiet even facing the street. Lots of restaurants, everything in walking distance. nice pool; excellent breakfast;~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463666370~“Iconic hotel with a few faults .”~Hotel and room great friendly staff , unfortunately house keeping fell very short . Beware of the dreaded privacy electronic soft touch pad in you room . If you press it by mistake , very easy to do , then you room never gets serviced ever .  Common areas adjacent to all areas need a good dusting . Seams like the house keeping manager needs new glasses .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463368445~“Even more amazing!”~This was our fourth visit to this beautiful hotel, and this one took it to the next level - when we arrived we were informed we had been upgraded... to The Presidential Suite! You can see from the photos that The Presidential Suite was truly something else (I'll let the photos speak for themselves, although they don't show all the features, like the butler's pantry with separate entrance, the wall of wardrobes, the entry foyer or the guest powder room). We still would have had a great time at the Primus if we hadn't been upgraded - but it became truly amazing because we were! Everything I wrote in our previous review on Tripadvisor still holds - this is a truly special hotel, with a beautifully restored building, great service (and again we were particularly taken with the warmth and efficiency of the concierge staff), food and facilities. If you want to spoil yourself with good accommodation, you normally have two choices. If you want all the facilities, like pools and 24-hour dining choices, you can choose a grand, luxurious hotel - trouble is, no matter how opulent, most big-name hotels still seem to have an air of sterility and a lack of character. Or you can choose a quirky, charming, individual boutique-style property, but then you usually miss out on some of those big hotel facilities. The real beauty of The Primus is that you get the best of both - a hotel big enough to have everything you might desire, and yet is a million miles away from the blandness of the big-name hotel chains. What luck they had such a wonderful building to start with, the good sense to restore and fit it out so exquisitely, and the good management to employ the right people to provide such a high standard of service and food.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_463086818~“Excellent stay”~We spent 3 night at the Primus Hotel Sydney and throughly enjoyed our stay. We loved the way they have kept some of the original City Water Company features and incorporated them into the hotel. Our room was wonderful and very comfortable. Bathroom was very large with a nice tub and separate shower. Bed very comfortable and WiFi good throughout the hotel. The restaurant food was good but a little limited for our taste. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. The hotel is located in the CBD and surrounded by a large Asian community. If you like Korean & Chinese food you will like the area. If we travel back to Sydney we will definitely stay at this hotel, we enjoyed this unique hotel very much.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462842846~“A new favourite in Sydney”~Simply the classiest stay in Sydney for those with an interest in authentic Art Deco style or a passion for the art of architectural reinvention. Located in the old Water Board building, this hotel has grand and beautifully appointed public and private spaces.  The vast volumes of the atrium, with its gorgeous red marble columns, make it the most elegant venue for drinks and conversation. A truly lavish, stylish and oh so comfortable place to relax. And then there was the suite....Suite 609 was spectacular and enormous and glamorous and I never want to stay anywhere else ever again. It was simply dreamy.....Oh, and did I mention it had a second bathroom?~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462555385~“Fantastic Service”~This was my first visit to this hotel that clearly used to be the grand headquarters of the Sydney Waterboard but has been lovingly converted to a hotel, featuring the very best of art deco style and design. The first thing that hits you however is not the grandeur of this heritage building but the service. From the moment you arrive at the front door to the greeting at the reception desk and on through to your room and departure, I could not fault the way the staff looked after me as a guest. Charming, helpful, going above and beyond this was some of the best service I have experienced in a hotel for a long time. As a fairly new hotel the decor is fresh, clean but historically considerate which delivers a charming experience from the entrance, through the corridors, in the lifts, your room and beyond. The rooms are well kitted out and roomy, with very stylish bathrooms that make you feel at home. Nice little extras that not all hotels deliver these days were provided such as bathrobes and slippers and a reasonable mini bar and room service menu. The only negative was that there are no windows - at least not in my room - which makes it a bit claustrophobic although the rooms are large enough to ensure they are not oppressive.  Overall I had a wonderful stay. I did not get to try the restaurant although it looked impressive and I explored the roof top pool and bar area which would be a fabulous spot to hang out on a summer evening with friends or business partners. Centrally located it is handy for business although it seems many taxi drivers have no idea where it is being reasonably new so make sure you check out your Google Maps to give them directions. I visit Sydney regularly for business and I will go back. I look forward to learning more about what this grand old building has to offer.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462174114~“The Small Details Matter”~Set in a recently renovated art deco building in the heart of the Sydney CBD, Primus Hotel offers an outstanding experience. Arriving late at night, the reception staff were prompt, helpful and friendly. My first-floor room was well appointed, spacious, comfortable and very quiet. It was immaculately presented and kept. The decor is a modern take on the Art Deco era, which gave the room character and warmth. The windows were 'frosted' to obscure the view. The room had a Nespresso machine, with 3 unmarked capsules. The bathroom was fabulous: good hairdryer, great toiletries.....not a lot of bench space, but enough for make-up/hair/grooming.  For the business traveller: lighting in the room was very good - particularly above the desk area. Power outlets were easily accessible – on both sides of the bed. Lighting and aircon were easy to operate. Wifi was fast, easy to access and reliable. The check-out process in the morning was efficient and the service was exceptional. From start to finish, the attention to detail and service was outstanding.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_462171012~“Stunning Art Deco Luxe Hotel”~We spent 4 days at Primus  Hotel and loved our stay at this magnificent five star heritage hotel.

review_461037975~“Art Deco space”~We stayed here on overnight trip. Based on reviews. This hotel didn't disappoint. There was space galore! An old 1930's building has undergone a great renovation.  Service was first class from the doorman, concierge, check-in staff as well as restaurant and bar staff. My wife and I shared 1dozen oysters and some salt @& pepper squid at the bar. Oysters natural must be served on ice in the shell and these were superb. The squid was fresh and deep fried with crispy texture. Both dishes were well priced and not over the top. Room had everything except a view, bed really comfortable. Breakfast buffet had it all including eggs cooked to you liking on order. Loved the big space in the foyer, dining & bar area. My only negative which is small, is I cannot understand why you put the soap dispenser on the wall 3 feet to the right of the wash basins in the men's toilet. We visited the rooftop bar and pool area. It looked great although it was a wet afternoon so not usable but imagine it would be awesome on a fine day  We like something different and this hotel offers that. We would go back for sure~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461014791~“Brilliant. What a beautiful hotel.”~We stayed on night. It starts in the lobby what a luxuries and trendy atmosphere.Love the colour scheme its as if the designer created a perfect balance combining old with new and masculine and feminine lines. The red marble pliilars with the velvet sofas amazing. This colour scheme was taken right through to the rooms, loved the mat black tapware. There is great focus on the little things, the lobby toilet had terry cloth hand towels and hand cream available for use after washing your hands , these little things make a huge impact. We had dinner in the restaurant, meals are very reasonable 3 course for $65 . Meals were on the fine dinning side however did lack a little taste at times. Had the deconstructed cheese cake this could be a lot better, But overall if you don't want to go anywhere is very acceptable. I will not however decrease the five star rating Ive given this hotel. The staff excellent, we trained nothing is a problem always friendly always smiling. The rooftop bar: we only managed to quickly have a look before we checked out unfortunately it was raining so we didn't use this facility but would definitely spend an evening there. overall thank you to the management for a wonderful stay.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460982142~“Art Deco hotel”~Beautiful restoration building, nice setting but not much to see out of the window. Staff are fantastic, very friendly and helpful, rooms are a very generous size and comfortable. This is a great hotel for a business traveller but I would be more than happy to stay here for leisure. I always have breakfast in the hotel restaurant which has a great range of breakfast options.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460229413~“Girls Weekend”~Such a great place to stay in Sydney, hotel is old style but modern and large spaces for an inner city hotel. Staff were very helpful to meet our needs and even added a roll away bed to our room so all 3 of us could share 1 room. It was the middle of winter so we did not use the pool facilities even though the pool is heating it is not warm enough to use mid winter as it is still located outside. This would be a great spot in summer. We had breakfast at the hotel daily and the service staff were amazing. Although it was a buffet chef would cook you eggs and omelette to order and the staff would even deliver to your table. Will be back next time in Sydney!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459985781~“Interesting building in the heart of Sydney”~We stayed here for 3 nights. When we arrived, the noise from the building site next door was horrendous. We voiced our concerns to the receptionist immediately, she informed us that we had been allocated an inner courtyard room away from the noise. We were very relieved and have to say she was correct. We did not eat here, but did enjoy the bar facilities one evening which was pleasant and relaxing. Found the staff very friendly and helpful, rooms clean but a little over the top with drawers, wardrobes etc. large unnecessary coffee table in the middle of the room, we kept knocking ourselves on. Good location. We only went in the pool once as the building works were too noisy to spend any time up there!~4~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_459785052~“Unbelievable Experience”~I booked Primus Hotel as my husband was having a retirement Dinner in the city. He had started work in the building, which is the Old Sydney Water Building, when he was seventeen. When we checked in they told us we had been selected for a random room upgrade from a Delux King to the Vice Presidential Suit. It was perfect. We were also given a bottle of champagne. Thank you Primus Hotel for a memorable stay.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_459589269~“Service Excellent”~We have to agree with other reviews that the hotel does lack atmosphere, we are not sure if this is to do with the large open space from reception to the bar area andwe are sure some people may like this, but it wasn't for us. The staff at this hotel are an absolute credit to the hotel. From start to finish everyone that we encountered were friendly and efficient, nothing is ever too much trouble for them. We had an early flight in and as the hotel was full we had to wait for 4 hours tor our room, but this was no fault of the hotel as the room was allocated to us before their advertised check in time. The room was well equipped with everything you would expect from a 5* hotel. Breakfast had a good choice and the only thing that could have arrived quicker for us was the tea and coffee, as you are asked what you would like when you sit down and then someone goes to the bar area to make it. One day we had nearly finished breakfast before it came, but I guess this was because it was put on the wrong table. The reason we give this hotel 4* is the lack of atmosphere and the fact that the building works right next door are awful if you want to chill out by the pool or in your room. We went to the pool two days running in the afternoon and couldn't stay there because of the noise. However we did get some time there on the Saturday afternoon as they finished work early being the weekend. I guess if you stay at a weekend then you are less likely to be disrupted. All in all a great hotel and will be so much better when the building is completed next to it.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_459388756~“Faultless!!”~Top hotel! The customer service is excellent; really feel your patronage is valued. High standard of cleanliness in the room and a very comfortable bed.

review_459054509~“Great location, wonderful hotel”~The Primus Hotel is a lovely little escape from the busy streets of Sydney. It's location is great, very central and easy to get to all the bits you'd want to see, i.e short walk to circular key, opera house, hyde park.  The staff were friendly, the rooms extremely clean (the housekeep staff came several times a day) and the roof top pool are bar were a fab edition. The only down side to our trip was that the building next door was being taken down, so a tad noisey if you wanted to go for a sun bathe/swim on the roof. This is obviously not the hotel's fault so nothing to grumble about!~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_458825433~“Wonderful Experience”~From the Doorman, who helped us with our luggage, to the Reception staff, Rooftop Bar staff, Restaurant staff and everyone in between, the service was friendly, helpful and five star. The rooms were large and clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom had good products as well as a lovely bath in which to soak. We enjoyed a buffet breakfast in the restaurant which had a large choice of food and juices/teas/coffees. We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay. The only criticism is the price of cocktails.. $24.00. A round of drinks 2 cocktails, 1 mocktail, a soft drink and 2 beers was close to $100. Other than that minor complaint, we would definitely stay here again. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457987938~“Absolutely Brilliant”~My husband & I just stayed at the primus for 1 night on business and could not have been happier.  Firstly Its so nice to see the integrity of the art deco architecture being maintained during the rebirth from the Sydney Water Board Building to the now beautiful Primus Hotel. This place exudes luxury. Entry into the amazing column filled reception is a delight . Rooms are extremely generous in size, and style - Beds extremely comfortable and service is quite simply exceptional. From the Valets right through to the managers - nothing is too much of an ask. We will be back. I also recommend the restaurant "The Wilmott" - stunning all round.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_457655107~“Room for improvement ”~First I have to say the staff at Primus are wonderful from Reception (particularly Bridie) to the doormen and housekeeping they are probability the jewels in crown for Primus. I couldn't give five circles because, like another reviewer has already said, the hotel lacks atmosphere. I  Think the decor of reception area is nice but the ambience is not inviting enough, maybe some live music, plants, artwork, anything really. Another reason is our room (422) smelt mouldy however we could see no evidence of mould. There are no real views to be had and it's a bit of a hike to circular quay etc particularly in Sydney 's humid weather. It's only a new hotel and hopefully with time it will develop more of a personality so to speak.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457312608~“Great hotel ”~We spent 3 nights at the Primus Hotel. Great location, in the heart of the bustling central business district. Beautiful place -- spacious lobby, nice lobby bar. Although we did not eat there, the hotel restaurant also appeared to be very nice. Our room was very nice also -- spacious, modern, and comfortable. Twice, after long days spent sightseeing, we ordered dinner from room service. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The staff was outstanding, greeting us by name, always friendly. The concierge was especially helpful, even weeks before our arrival as he arranged our a Blue Mountains. Top-notch hotel!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457194676~“Rooftop Bar”~Cool oasis in the middle of the city on a hot Saturday afternoon. Almost deserted but a great place for a reviving beer. Expensive but worth it for the ambience. The main hotel is stunning and we look forward to dinner there soon ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455735595~“Luxurious, relaxing, and high attention to detail! Perfect for a Sunday staycation!”~My husband and I live in Sydney and checked out the Primus for a Sunday staycation. We had a gorgeous day and spent it relaxing at the rooftop pool--we napped, swam, enjoyed the sun, and had beautiful poolside snacks and drinks. The rooms are so comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are amazing (I am particular here) and loved both the shower and bath. Beds were super comfy and had such a good night's rest. We finished off our staycation with breakfast in the morning at the Wilmot. It was such a nice way to finish off a weekend and start off the working week. Couldn't recommend this place enough!!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_455722761~“Secret Sydney Oasis”~I came across this hotel on a hotel site, having heard nothing of it and being a Sydney sider my whole life. This hotel is new and I stayed here on Australia day and the price of the room was super competative and the location is central to everything you need.  The pictures are exactly what you should expect! The rooms are large and well presented with the best of small luxuries. The lobby is impressive while the roof top heated pool is one of the best in Sydney! Such a great place to chill and has a real 'resort' feel to it even though its in the heart of the city. You almost forget where u are!  The customer service was outstanding and getting a late check out was easy with a small cost involved. The buffet breakfast was delicious and had a lot of variety.  I definitely recommend the hotel to anyone reading my review and to all my friends. Its a very untapped hotel with historic charm and 5 star loveliness :)  Undoubtedly my new favourite 5 star hotel in Sydney!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

I arrived early morning and the reception team couldn't have been more accommodating in providing me somewhere to freshen up and change. Whilst a room wasn't available (understandably) as it was so early said they would call me as soon as they could make one available, which they did just as promised. My room was large, luxurious and the bathroom was huge, I was very pleased.  Every aspect of my stay was wonderful, particular thanks to the staff who made every effort to make my visit a happy and comfortable one. The location close to Pitt Street is brilliant with the city a short walk away or access to the train network with Town Hall station just around the corner. The hotel also has a rooftop pool and bar which I sadly didn't get a chance to use. No matter, next time I'm in Sydney I'll be staying again!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_454901486~“Great experience!”~We stayed overnight at the Primus Hotel after attending a party at the hotels' beautiful roof top bar and pool. The roof top and pool area is spacious and the perfect, private space for an inner city celebration. From the moment we arrived, staff in all areas of the hotel went out of their way to ensure we were happy. Our room and amenities were very comfortable and we will definitely stay again. Overall, a really enjoyable stay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454873767~“Didn't stay but would go back in a heartbeat for the Pool Bar”~Excellent service, especially by the manager Nitin. He was great and looked after my friends and I everytime we went. The selection of cocktails are amazing and they even make traditional cocktails that aren't on the menu if requested. They really cater to their customers. Definitely recommend!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454846420~“Weekend get away”~I recently stayed at Primus Hotel in Sydney with colleagues. The hotel provided all we could want, excellent accommodation, attentive staff, great food and very well located. Whether it's a run through the gardens to Circular Quay or a Harbour Cruise, Primus is a great starting point. A swim and a drink on the rooftop pool bar are a must. We will be back for sure!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454684561~“Had a great stay with baby”~I stayed in Sydney for a night whilst catching up with friends with my baby (8 weeks old) it was a great central location easy to access from the airport. Lovely Art Deco room which was really spacious and quiet. I caught up with friends in the hotel restaurant and also the roof top bar and pool area which is fantastic for inner Sydney, I would stay here again just because of the pool area. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I would highly recommend for a city stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454653832~“ Chic Art Deco in the Heart of the City”~I can highly recommend this hotel. The Art Deco design makes for a real point of difference. The service was impeccable. The rooms were spacious and beautifully presented. The Roof top pool and bar provide a great place to cool off. The hotel is conveniently located in the centre of the city. I will definitely be back for my next trip to Sydney.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454641343~“Great service”~Spent two nights at the Primus and hosted party at their rooftop bar. The management and staff made organising the event very easy. Food was great, waiters very attentive and courteous. All our guests had a great time and I'll definitely be a return customer. Visit the Wilmot for breakfast, lunch or dinner... you will not be disappointed.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_454500950~“Construction noise way too loud ”~The hotel as you enter the great lobby and take in the marble pillars is awe inspiring. The receptionists are friendly as they should be. The rooms are a great size and bathrooms are well appointed. Beds comfortable and the TVs are the latest technology. Not to mention the great rooftop pool and bar.  Unfortunately the hotel is currently let down by a huge huge problem.  Jack hammering.  It's loud. Very loud. And it starts in the early morning. If you're going to stay here please phone ahead and check if the construction is still happening. It was enough to make me check out early. I can usually sleep through mostly anything but these noises were way too loud.  Sorry primus but your hotel will only hit its stride at full capacity when these constructions are complete.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
