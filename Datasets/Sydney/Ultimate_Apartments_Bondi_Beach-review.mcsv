review_467482902~“Unpleasant stay”~I was charged for 2 telephone calls that I have not dialled. One of the staff was very sure that me or my friend had made those phone calls. She came across judgemental and insisted that i should be responsible for it. The response from my friend was delayed, and the staff did not wait till it has been confirmed, rather insisted i should be paying for it now. And i felt pressured to pay for the bill. Also felt mistreated, angry, disappointed and upset since she did not believe me. Overall, i ended my weekend trip feeling more exhausted than before, and it certainly wasn't a pleasant experience. The property later on found out they had a computer problem, and one of the other staff did email back, apologised and explained, which made me feel better. I would not particularly recommend it. but if you are after budget (lower range compared to other places in the area) accommodation at a convenient location, the this may be for you. and good luck.~1~nan~nan~2~3~nan~1~nan
review_446171118~“Budget motel accommodation”~This is a budget hotel, I would class it as a motel, about 1km from Bondi Beach, only 10min walk up. It's one of the less expensive accommodations in Bondi, but I wouldn't stay here again, I would pay more to stay somewhere better, but unfortunately we had to book last minute. The walls are paper thin, we could hear all the noise from next door & I couldn't sleep for most of the night. The bed wasn't comfortable either. I suppose you get what you pay for.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~3~nan
review_416218593~“Good price & handy location”~The apartment had very basic facilities, you wouldn't be able to cook anything but microwave meals! However, the bed was very comfortable and the beach was only a 10 minute walk away past a great selection of cafes and bars.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402730448~“Not great”~I'm going to talk about the positives first, the only reasons why I would consider staying here again. The good: -Free secure parking - very hard to find in Bondi -Cheap midweek accommodation -5 minute walk to restaurants and shops The bad: -If you arrive late there's no instructions for how to pick up your keys. I was lucky enough one of the residents was out the front to guide me -The apartment was extremely tired and not cleaned adequately, like really not clean! -No blankets -Noise, so much noise! From noisey residents smoking outside their rooms, doors opening and shutting, paper thin walls and traffic. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402334271~“It was ok”~I was in Bondi for a conference, up late one night and out early the next so wasn't in the place very long. While I was there however I did notice the place could do with a tidy. I don't think this is your traditional motel, I was given a rental agreement to stay just the one night so there are some long term tenants here. In the car park was a car with 2 flat tyres, that gave an indication to who may be staying here. Just a small thing but the toilet didn't have a half flush. There were signs up telling me to conserve water and this would help to do that. Inside the unit was nice enough. Bed was comfy, not a massive room but only me in it so it was fine. Decent value for money and the location was excellent.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_402053603~“do you like bugs?”~my girlfriend and I first arrived at this god awful place that should be shut down for poor service and screwing over their clients.  once we arrived we noticed that the reception desk closes at 5pm which means if you didn't make a call ahead of time your locked out of the apartment and must make other arrangements for that night with no refund for the missed night. Day 2 we were finally able to check in to get our key to what I would call a half room it's literally a bedroom and a bathroom that's it with a 20 inch television smack dap in the middle. there are no cleaning services of any kind!! which means that however you keep the apartment will stay like that until their maid services feels like cleaning your room which in our case was only once we made a complaint stating we were being eating alive by bed bugs!!(they only changed the sheets and then stated they didn't find any) I've never been in a hotel or apartment where you get bed bugs and have a business that doesn't care about their clients or tells in you person with sheer ignorance that "we don't have bed bugs" I removed my t-shirt showed the women both sides of my chest that clearly reflected red bite marks from their bed bug infestation! she immediately went quite which wasn't too shocking when the proof was right in front of her but instead of apology we were offered an accusation that we brought them with us from a previous trip which is impossible considering the fact that we didn't get the bed bugs until 2 days after our stay and our previous hotel at Airlie beach (amazing BTW) didn't show any signs or bite marks on mine or my girlfriends body! On our last day their they finally offered to change our room the only problem with this is what's the point if your only going to stay another 12 hours and for us not to be bitten we stayed fully dressed instead of our pj's or undies. we were able to circumvent on our own. On top of all of this the only reason the reception office called us is because my girlfriend wrote a review of our experience on Expedia and they wanted us to remove the review. if this happened in America I would have contacted the BBB(the American federal government organization that looks into shady deals from businesses and has the capacity to shut them down!) Lastly once I finally get home I would update my review to reflect the bed bug bike marks that are still on my side!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401562288~“Average at best ”~Small styles apartments - the only service you'll receive is when you check in and check out.  Advantages being, plenty of off street parking and a very nice central local to Bondi. Plenty of bars and restaurants surrounding this location. And a short 4 minute walk to the Bondi beach front. All you really need to a 2 - 3 day stay in Bondi.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386843484~“made me ill”~Very basic, looks better in the photos. very tired and dated. Some people live here long term. I arrived on 25th June, cold and rainy. late evening and had to find the key to let myself in. instructions not that clear. the bed throw was dirty and smelly. The air conditioning unit also serves as a heater. I had to put this on for several hours just to heat the very cold room up. The next morning I woke up feeling so ill. I only started to feel better after a couple hours outside. as I was out all day when I returned I did not put the heating on. The next day I woke up feeling fine, therefore I knew the problem was the heater. I reported this to the service desk, and wanted to check out a day early which they did refund me for under the circumstances. I suspect all the heater units are the same very old and not serviced. This apartment is really not worth the money. And I don't think it's safe.~1~nan~3~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_367068885~“Bondi stay”~A small apartment style unit with everything you need for your stay. Just bring any food you require. Good security. Main gates always closed. You have a key to get into the grounds. Lockable screen door on the units also. A little traffic noise if you have a front unit. Basic furnished units, but clean. Good staff, but only there certain hours of the day. Only a 7 minute walk to the beach. Bus stop outside with a 5 minute ride to Bondi Junction Not the cheapest for what you get, but hey! It's Bondi.... Would stay there again..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_361628693~“Basic but clean.”~We rented a studio apartment at Ultimate for two nights. Check in is from 1 pm. We were there shortly after and the apartment was ready for us. Check in was friendly and efficient. For check out we just dropped the keys off.  It is not big and pretty basic with two single beds (that can be pushed together) but it was clean, freshly painted and everything worked. The bathroom has a walk in shower with a rather high step. Certainly not suitable for "disabled" as our apartment was marked to be. In the bathroom there is one towel for each and a piece of soap. No shampoo or other supplies. During the weekend we were there the apartments were not serviced - no new towels. There are cooking utensils but no cooktop - only a microwave. No supplies like tea, coffee or milk were provided. Each unit has its own parking. In the centre of the court is a nice swimming pool: very clean and not over chlorinated as with many hotel pools. There is a smaller sitting area with some lounge chairs. The location is five minutes walking distance from the main shopping street and ten minutes to Bondi beach. wireless internet is available for $3 per day ($5 for three days) and is reasonably fast but for one user only (cannot be shared between a phone and a laptop at the same time)~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_358624026~“Great Location & Secure”~Arrived about 1.30 & room not quite ready, checked in & sat by the pool till cleaning had finished. Parked car outside the unit which was in the corner & near the smoking area, although no one smoked while we were staying. Room was clean, beds comfortable. Our only complaint was the noisy air conditioning unit, i did put in earplugs during the night so i could sleep. Ten minute walk to the shops & beach which was perfect. Purchased wifi from the offsite provider which worked really well. $5 for 24 hours. Excellent pool. Clothes line handy to dry towels but please bring your own pegs.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_342928691~“Reasonable price, walking distance do the beach”~Roomy and clean apartments with all essentials and within walking distance to everything Bondi beach has to offer.

review_297811194~“Affordable,Quiet and Secure Hotel 9/10”~We book this hotel/apartment for the last minute booking and by our surprise its such a nice, secure and very quiet accommodation, we really love it, its a bit old fashion but its great for families with kids, the place was gated, got swimming pool in the middle and so close to all restaurants, pubs, supermarket, bank and bondi beach. we'll surely coming back to this place.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_293621396~“Sign, Sign everywhere a sign”~I have never stayed anywhere that had so many signs advising what was not allowed. There were so many it became funny. We made a point of looking for them. Despite having to sign (no pun intended) a contract stating we were responsible for the number of knives and forks, blankets, mattresses, etc. the room was very clean, comfortable and quiet and had everything we needed (the signs actually work). The receptionist/property manager was friendly and very helpful. It was good value for money as very reasonably priced and only a short walk to the beach and restaurants.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_292254122~“Reasonably priced accommodation in Sydney”~we stayed here for the first time in July 2015 and the apartments are well priced and very good for short stays. Each apartment has a kitchenette and an ensuite with secure parking. There are lots of restaurants and shops close by and a bus into the city stops right outside the door. We would have no hesitation staying here again.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_290903733~“Great value tucked away in Bondi”~Really good location for Bondi Beach and surrounding areas. Quiet and tucked away with ample secure parking. Rooms really clean and lovely comfy beds. Useful kitchenette and a heater ! ( it was a cold weekend when we visited)  Great value- cheaper than budget lodges we have stayed in the past but with slightly higher standard. Nice friendly welcome on check in. Would definitely stay again if in the area.Would be good for couples,families and elderly.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_284106923~“Very good location!”~I travel to sydney very often and my chosen spot is Bondi, always! I found this place online for a cheap price and booked it! Safe to say if you're a luxurious traveller don't stay here. It's a basic motel, rooms with tv and whatnot, everything is oldish but I don't mind at all so I loved it :) it was worth the price. I drive up so this place had a car park and bondi beach was a 5 minute walk down the main street! I would definitely recommend this place :)~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_282748561~“Cheap for a reason”~Was dining with friends locally and didn't want to drink and drive so this seemed good value. Close to the beaches and many restaurants and looked good value. Obviously an old motel and very basic BUT the killer was the choice of beds. Didn't read the fine print that said bed configuration was at their discretion. Finished up with single beds , no choice or discussion.~2~nan~nan~2~2~nan~nan~nan
review_279689393~“Ok but very basic”~Good points: clean, secure, and about 10mins walk to Bondi beach on relatively quiet street with lots of good places to eat nearby. Staff seemed friendly. Free parking with our booking. Original artworks in the room. A nice touch.  Not so good: don't expect a lot. This is a motel 70s style as you would find in a country town. No free internet. Shower only. For the price-$280 for 2 nights-you may be able to find better.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_278668302~“Brace your Back!!!”~Used this place for an overnight stay in Bondi. Location is excellent with beach and Westfield shopping centre nearby and a bus stop on the opposite street. However not happy with the upkeep and maintenance of the place. We were 3 adults and I got the rollaway bed. It was in urgent need of replacement as the springs were short and there was big dip in the centre. Used layers of blanket to get a decent cushioning. The normal beds were a lot better but the other 2 occupants weren't too happy as it did gave them a slight back ache in the morning. However the room as such was tidy and so was the bathroom with excellent hot water. Parking is in front of the room and it is a secured complex. All in all this is a budget accommodation which is priced as such.~3~nan~5~1~nan~nan~2~nan
review_275810903~“Great location near Bondi Beach”~If you want to be by Bondi Beach, but don't want to break the bank, this is a decent place. We just needed a place to stay for one night with free parking, and this was one of the only options on short notice. It seems to be intended for long term stay customers, however it also works for 1 or 2 night stays. The rooms was nice and had everything you need (except internet) and were comfortable. However, they were not very clean. We opened a bedside drawer to find dirt, and dead bugs. There were also left over shampoo bottles in the shower as well. Just a lack of attention to details was all really. The place was also hard to find and confusing on where to park until you checked in. However, if I were to stay near Bondi beach again, I would consider this place again.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_263226103~“So nice we stayed longer”~We had a really good stay in this motel. In fact, we liked it so much we stayed longer than originally planned. The room was nice and clean, it was great having a little kitchenette, the bathroom was a little old perhaps but whatever, everything worked. We have a little one so having easy access to the car (parked right out the front) was a bonus. As was the pool for a lazy afternoon dip. But the best bit is the location. 10min walk from the beach and past a bucketload of good looking bars and cafes (except Glicks which looks good but I had below par service and a doughy, undercooked croissant). And although it is on a reasonably busy road, behind the big wooden gates it feels like a quiet little sanctuary. Will definitely stay here again when we're back in Bondi.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_262358804~“no fuss accommodation in convenient location”~this hotel is an older style "appartment" block. they offer free parking which is secure. the rooms are quite big for Sydney and as we were at the back of the complex also very quiet. they are older style but clean and the bed was comfortable. water pressure left something to be desired and there was no shampoo but these are minor complaints. if you are after budget without loosing comfort I highly recommend the apartments. nothing fancy but great quality.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_261964806~“Good location”~Stayed here for two nights.  Good stuff: Bus stop right out the front was wonderful. FREE PARKING!  Close to Bondi restaurants and the beach. Bad Stuff: Noisy old air-con. Creaky crappy beds. No onsite reception out-of-hours is annoying.  Not so fussed about the lack of tea/coffee facilities because Bondi is covered in good coffee spots. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_261221650~“Simple accommodation”~Stayed here twice this month both times for 6 nights. Well located for bondi beach. Bus stop right at door. Very secure. Very simple accommodation, ample space for two. Basic kitchen with just two of everything so no entertaining guests. No tea or coffee. Appeared clean on arriving but on looking closer a bit of fluff , dust and cobwebs. Shower difficult to access. Linen and towels only changed weekly. Lady on reception very helpful. Good laundry facilities.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_259509681~“Good for a simple room.”~Stayed recently for a work trip. Was very basic, but super clean and a comfortable bed.

review_257874906~“Not Good”~Rooms are very small hot and stuffy there was not enough towels or toilet paper for a stay of 6 nights we was given 1 roll of toilet paper to accomodate to 3 females. People working around the apartments didn't speak to us or even gave us a smile the place is very very noisy as its right next to the round about. Bondi isnt a place to stay if your on a stricked budget as central city is to far away and your forever calling a taxi the shops are very over priced and the people ain't that friendly I won't be coming back to bondi that's for sure.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_256278003~“Saved us a bundle.”~My dad and me stayed two nights. The beds were comfy enough with ample bedding. Ok kitchen lacking tea and coffee yet that didn't matter TOO much as many beautiful cafes nearby.  Noise travels around this place - as a light sleeper I struggled a little bit getting to sleep. We couldn't close a window in our room (#28) so noise was heard easier I guess. Great location  Friendly staff Good budget stay. Oh and friendly 'helper ants' in the bathroom sometimes cleaning up on the sink.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_253733444~“Terrible”~Our fridge didn't work, there was no tea and coffee!! The room wasn't that clean at all. The beds were hard and un comfortable and also the office wasnt even open at 8am. There not flash rooms pretty standard and for $290 per night for a two bedroom it was crap.~1~1~3~nan~2~2~1~nan
review_251187218~“Great Location”~Recently stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights with my partner. Rooms are ok but nothing special. TV was very small. Has a good pool area but a BBQ area would be nice.

review_249947705~“Great location, great facilities, secure, will be back!”~Loved this place! Not only do you get free parking at your door (and in the heart of Bondi Beach that is truly a rarity) but it's reasonably priced. The studio apartment we had was scrupulously clean, modern, comfy with a nice kitchenette and great shower. We felt very secure here behind the lockable gates, it was like a tranquil little oasis in the heart of the bustle of Bondi, yet a very short walk had you right at the restaurants and the beach. There was also a lovely sparkling pool to enjoy. No problems at all, and great value.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_249538927~“Ok if you don't want to pay much”~This motel is ok. It is fairly old, the decor is dated and so is the building. However, it is fine if you do not want to pay the high prices at Bondi. We paid about $200/night for 3 people, but if you are going to have a 3rd person on the sofa bed - don't! It was a spring mattress with no padding - we asked for (and were provided with) another mattress to go over the top. This was sufficient for the 2 nights but still not ideal. The location is pretty good - a 5 min walk to the main restaurants on Hall Street. If you want something just above back packing and without the high prices of other hotels in Bondi, it is sufficient. You pay for what you get! I can't complain as I only wanted a budget motel and I got it.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
