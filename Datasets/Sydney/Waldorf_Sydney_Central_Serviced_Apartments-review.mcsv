review_476056906~“Promise of goodness, let down by maintenance”~Chose to stay at Waldorf for combination of price and facilities. The location and price combo were good, along with conveniences of an apartment (washing machine and dryer). After two days camping where we were passing from Mudgee to elsewhere in NSW to see family, this seemed too good to be true. Indeed it was. Room 119 did have working remotes - we had to replace the batteries in both. This could have been some by previous guest. However, what is more annoying was that the appliances had not been tested and tagged. The dryer was near death and eventually died on us, and with reception closed at 1700 on Sundays, it will not be fixed until you departure. The superficial presentation of the apartments for the price is quite good, but untested and sickly appliances is not acceptable.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473913535~“Very noisy between 3 and 4 am”~This hotel is also referred to as the Waldorf Sydney Central Serviced Apartments. Our room on the first floor was clean and the beds were comfortable. The hotel is located about 20 minutes walk from Sydney's Central Railway Station which services the domestic and international airports. It is also about a $40 To $50 taxi journey to the airport depending upon traffic conditions. Many people using this hotel catch early morning flights which results in continuously closing hotel doors between 3 and 4 am. I found the noise impossible to sleep through. If staying at this hotel and not catching an early flight you should request a room on the 3rd floor as far away from the hotel entrance as possible if you wan't a decent nights sleep.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471268847~“Hotel room where well worn and dated”~the hotel has a good location for shopping in the city rooms where noisy and dated interaction with the staff was pleasant beds were not good pillows were not good for the money spent not good value at all~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_470949722~“Stay somewhere else.”~The only good thing about this place was Kimberly and Jerry at the front desk. We stayed here a total of 5 nights in 3 different rooms. Each unit is owned by individual investors and Waldorf manages them; which means the rooms can be maintained or Not, renovated or Not. See attached photos. The scariest part for me was when we arrived late at night after office hours. Management had changed the prearranged code on the lock box so we couldn't access our new room key! I thought we'd be sleeping out in the cold that rainy night! Until we noticed the Emergency phone by the sliding glass door---the man instructed us to punch in new numbers in the lock box so we could finally get in. We will never stay here again.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469585521~“Worn and dated but rooms okay”~Stayed here for a couple of nights for nearby business meetings. The outside of the hotel and the surrounding area is not much to look at and probably isn't the best part of the city. Interior is fairly worn and dated. I had a studio room and reasonably comfortable but like other parts of the hotel it was all looking a bit worn out. Reception service was efficient and helpful. I wouldn't recommend for an extended holiday stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463737993~“No. Just no. ”~We had booked and checked in for 5 nights and booked in somewhere else within 15 minutes. Horrible area of Sydney, everything was really dated and had a funny smell. All the appliances needed replacing and furniture look very old. Felt low level hostel type stay. Not what we thought. Only positive was the receptionist was lovely and helpful. I am in the process of trying to get my money back !~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456266182~“Not the best stay!!!!”~On arrival the receptionist was very helpfull with maps and chatting about the day, which was prior to Australia day. Our room was 124, the last in the row, lower level, if you get anywhere on this floor, ask to be moved!! Occupied by Asian clients/hotel workers flitting from room to room with suitcases, kids and food at all times of the day and night. Doors banging closed at 5:30am and onward as people go to work. The there's the smell of cooking! OMG! So bad! If you're into overpowering Chinese cooking at all hours fine, but nah far too much.  We decided to have a swim as it was a hot 36 degs, as we approached the pool it had the fire hose in, and a man telling us it being topped up, fine... it was about 20 degs and cold. As was the spa, we asked him what the temp normally was and he said he said 30+ as it was gas heated, so give it a few hours to heat up and it'll be fine. I looked at the gas meter that was supposed to be heating it and it wasn't even running! So we decided to wait and see. A sauna in the gym looked ok, but had no light inside, so pitch dark. I asked the same pool guy about it and he said the globe had blow, and he'd have to call an electrician to replace it!! He be out tomorrow, Australia day!! Don't think so! So 3 hours later checked the pool out, still cold, surprise. The sauna door was now open and we assumed he'd put a light in himself, no, so I caught him in the lift going up to the sauna, asked and he said it must be the owners that have opened the door and it was still not fit for use. He put an out of order sign on the door! The pool, just said it should be warm!! So all we could do was sit on the roof top terrace which had a great view of the city, but the pavers were an absolute accident waiting to happen! So many were broken and uneven to the point you could loose you footing near the wall over the edge! Pictures attached. Room was average, bulbs missing in lights, dish washer didn't work, lots of noise from above, washing machine or dryer constantly on. So not a place I'd recommend at all. The two staff we meet, Australian and English were great, but seemed to be under pressure.~2~nan~nan~2~2~nan~3~nan
review_444568284~“Great location & value for money”~Stayed here for 3nights. Perfect for getting to Circular Quay & seeing the sights. Secure parking & a clean apartment with all the facilities needed for a few nights. The rooftop pool was a bonus for cooling down and relaxing after a day of walking. Would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444128709~“Very expensive ”~When we arrived at the hotel we was quiet happy, the reception was clean and tidy and a young lady beside the desk was very helpful even drew on a map local shops that we could go to. Didn't seem to have any problems till second week of staying there. During second week of being there first problem started when we had a knock on the door and they had viewings of the furniture going on, why they couldn't do that when the room was empty I don't no.. even told us it was lucky we was in otherwise they would have just let themselves in. I no they can't help all guests but there seemed to be very loud voices coming from the hall way late at night. At 10:30 on a Sunday evening someone was drilling in the appartments. Most days when going to the pool it was clean there but on the odd occasion there was bird poo on more then one occasion it was EVERYWHERE even in the pool I come to find out after getting in. Again not that they can help but there was a power cut but there was no apology or even consideration when asking if it was all okay I got does it look like it we've had a power cut.. I also approached the manager about our problems he was very rude and not far of accusing me of lying about these problems for the money we paid I wasn't overly happy with the situation when I no the Tennants of the accommodation are paying alot less then what we do as holiday people.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440509199~“Very poor”~We left feeling very dissatisfied with our stay here! The room was dirty and outdated- far too expensive for what it was. Upon arriving home, we discovered we'd left some shirts hanging in the cupboard by accident. We called the hotel and the next day the manager called to say they couldn't find the shirts. He then argued with us and was incredibly rude to us. We said we were taking it further and he then called back later to say he had found them and that the cleaner had them the whole time, after telling us he had already spoken to the cleaner about them and that the cleaner hadn't seen them. So in other words, he'd lied to us. He refused to apologise for how he'd dealt with us. He sent the shirts back to us and we got them a week and a half later, but we had to pay for postage! After all that, he couldn't even pay for HIS mistake. I won't even rate this place a 1/10. Horrible location, rude staff, overpriced.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440190450~“good location good value”~Hotel is in a brilliant location, close to shops and bars and restaurants. We booked a 1 bedroom unit and I'm so glad we stayed in the hotel. The apartment was larger than it appeared in the photos which was great for two of the five nights we stayed. The "kitchen"ette and bathroom were completely serviceable and clean .Reception were super helpful, allowing one of our party to check in before me as the main booker. I'd recommend this hotel for location, and the handy pool. It's not super modern but great all the same and very good value for money for Sydney accommodation~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_437650797~“Sofa bed”~We had 2 apartments over the weekend, both using the sofa beds, my son and his girlfriend booked another motel due to the springs being unbearable to sleep on. In the other apartment my daughter-in-laws brother was on the sofa bed and was cocooned in the mattress as it sunk in the middle. I wouldn't recommend using them.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_436902176~“Handy to City and transport.”~Accommodation was very comfortable, the apartment was very well appointed with all you would need as if you were at home. General condition of the room was a bit tired and housekeeping matters need attending to as well as general info booklet which is out of date! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434999749~“Not a 4 star hotel”~I stayed there for 5 days during a recent work trip to Sydney - if I had not have gotten a good price I would have moved hotels - especially after the first night (As it is quite noisy - located on a very busy road), the room was quite dirty I had to wash the dishes before I used them (and I am not a germaphobe), the shower tiles where mouldy and there was food stuck to the couch (so I would not use it) and the remote control was sticky (YUCK) the room was very tired and in need of a freshen up. However the bed was great (and that's the main thing I guess) The kitchen had very limited utensils for cooking (but with spice alley and Brickfields nearby I didn't need to cook much). On Friday and Saturday night there is a lot of street noise (lots of Uni Halloween Parties nearby) - A very short walk to Redfern station (straight down Eveleigh st - yes it safe these days). And there is a good SPAR there also (the staff will tell you about the Wollies near Central Park (but this is closer). This hotel is in a good location and overall I had a comfortable stay and felt safe to walk around the neighbourhood at night as a lone woman traveller.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433794760~“Lovely hosts”~The room was clean and airy, and the front of desk and management staff were very pleasant and helpful, especially with local maps and shopping. The night-time key service worked well (I always worry about those!) as there was no 24-hour front of house service, and I felt very comfortable moving around the hotel alone at night. The pool area is AMAZING (especially as I had it all to myself)!  The only downside was the fact that the council decided to dig up the road outside my bedroom window at midnight. That is in no way the fault of the hotel, but due to the layout of the room I felt that I was at the dentist every time the concrete vibrator started up! This was the only thing that marred a lovely night's stopover.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~5~nan
review_432801580~“A surprising find”~I stayed here with my daughter recently for 2 nights. Very convenient to drive to, but equally good from train or airport. We had a car and parking was included in the room price. This is almost unheard of in Sydney and a big bonus for us. Usual nightly charge is $30 plus. Our studio room was well equipped and had washer/dryer as well as full kitchen facilities. Funny that it only had a bar sized fridge. We also had a balcony as well as opening windows. Good to have that option. Our first floor room was at the front on Cleveland Street so there was a lot of traffic noise which is difficult to get used to coming from the country. Service was good. It is easy to get a cab out the front, didn't have to wait long. Would recommend a stay here.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_432594094~“Wonderful”~The only shame was that we were only staying for one night. The discovery of the washing machine and tumble dryer in the bathroom was a big plus. The kitchen was very well equipped and the bed was comfortable. Free car parking in Sydney is apparently a bonus. It was a bit of a hike to the harbour but the rain didn't help.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431694008~“Fantastic Customer Service”~Stayed here on our last night in Sydney after a great cruise on Pacific Jewel. Our room was ready for us as soon as we arrived and the ladies who welcomed us could not have been more helpful. Room and facilities were clean and very comfortable and our check-out time was extended at no extra charge so we could enjoy our last few hours in the city before travelling to the airport. Very good value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429017415~“Filipino budget traveller”~The rate is superb compared to other apartments located at the center. A little over a US$100 per night. The unit we stayed was a 1-bedroom apartment for 4. It has a queen bed and a sofa that can be turned into a double bed fit for 2. Perfect for families.  The surroundings are not busy. If you intend to cook your meals, it is 5-minute walk to the nearest woolworth supermarket & asian store located at the Central park mall, you can also find nice burger, ramen, coffee n doughnut shops, daiso and other shops at the mall.  Its relatively walkable going to Capitol theater, Market street, townhall etc. around 18 AUS$ if you ride a cab to opera house from apartment The only downside is, no cleaning for the 5 nights we stayed. They replenished the supplies like coffee shampoo, towels etc only once during our stay - on the 3rd day. We didnt bother asked because by the time we arrive, the reception is already closed. Garbage is self disposal.  You can ask reception for assistance to call a cab to airport. 33-38AUS$ to the airport.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_428276543~“Clean, complete and cheap”~Stayed here with my mom and stepdad for 3 days and two nights, it was a lovely and memorable holiday. Staff were very accommodating and helpful...they assisted us very well since we arrived Sydney from Melbourne very early, prior to check-in time. They gave me a call to notify us that the room was ready. One thing that I did not like was the pool undergoing renovations without giving any notice at all when I booked though Booking.com. Apart from that, the apartment was clean, comfy, quiet and safe. They also gave us WiFi for I think around 1000mb.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_417282956~“Cheap & Cheerful”~This place perfectly suited our needs - a bed for a night and secure parking after a really long drive. We stayed on the first floor, previous occupant had clearly been cooking but a quick airing and the room was fine. Had washing machine and kitchen facilities. The biggest benefit was definitely the on site parking. Very hard to find in the city! Nice and close to the Chippendale Hotel for good food and beer and only a $15 cab ride right into the city. Will stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414918236~“Mediocre at best...”~We really wanted to like this place because the location was good. But the creaky floors, thin walls, and sorry breakfast (NO protein, fruit or yogurt--only bread/cereal) outweighed the proximity to Sydney's sites. Most of all, "free" wifi was not "free." A daily cap per user of 200MB is equal to nothing if you're like most travelers and you like to share your holiday experience via social media, including...ahem...hotel reviews. This is not a place for people who are light sleepers, with many young children running the halls and whose cries could be heard around the clock. Our stay was paid for with reward points from a credit card, otherwise we would've given this place an even lower rating.~3~3~nan~1~nan~nan~3~nan

Close to shopping, next door to a great pub that served great food and an easy stroll to waterfront dinning with many choices. The apartment was very well equipped, clean and very functional. Underground parking was a plus too. We stayed 3 nights at the end of a month long trip, with the underground parking we did not have to gut the rental car every time we went out. the location was perfect for day trips and they even had some great suggestions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Quite a number of convenient stores around. Muslim tourist may have dinner/lunch in a Malaysian Chinese halal cafe which a walking distance to apartment near a petrol kiosk. Tho room lil small and not much of a view. Still its good. Necessities needed are quite good and well kept. Great place to stay for a short night. Staff are friendly.

review_401192985~“Nice & value for money”~We spent 4 days 3 nights in Sydney. Since we were on a budget, we didn't mind looking for a place that was a little distant away for Sydney centre. It was a good choice. The place has fully-equipped kitchen & washer dryer. It was not that far from the train station. There was a small sundry shop & Woolworth was only a few blocks away. It was really a nice place - value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_394523970~“Location location location”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which had all the facilities you could want. The only issue was that when the sofa bed was extended there was no room at all left in the lounge room - but we were not in the room all that much so it wasn't a real problem. The roof top pool, gym and BBQ area was handy and useful - just a shame that the water tap at the sink by the BBQ didn't work. The room was clean and everything was included, such as dishwasher powder and laundry powder. The car park which was included was very handy and because the apartment was within easy walking distance to many things we didn't even take the car out! But knowing it was secure in an off street locked garage was reassuring. We walked everywhere and the Central Park shopping centre (about 5 minutes walk away) had everything we could ask for including a supermarket, which was great for self catering.  The reception did close at 7pm during the week and 5pm on weekends which was a bit annoying but when the staff were there, they were helpful, friendly and courteous. The Queen Victoria building was about 15 - 20 minutes walk away and from there we just strolled down to Circular Quay.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_390305119~“Location Location”~Very good location. The studio apt was nice, it was not big however had all of the things you need to be self efficient.

We will stay there again and would recommend it to other travellers.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_387592376~“Don't have a choice”~We stayed here because most places we looked at are either more expensive or not an apartment with kitchenette and washing machine. We needed these as we are a family of 3 and staying for 7 days. Location isn't that great...about 15mins walk from Central station especially at night the surrounding feels unsafe. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights there are always some party going on from 11pm till 4am! We can hear people laughing, yelling, singing as they were drunk causing us not being able to sleep. The studio apartment looked nicer than our 1 bedroom apartment with better bedding and newer looking. But we had to stay in a 1 bedroom as it had a queen bed and a sofa bed, whereas my sisters' studio apartment had a king bed. The sliding doors to the balcony looked dodgy...only just latching on to the lock and still a gap showing even though it's considered locked. Reception closed at 7pm daily and 5pm on weekends which is very inconvenient especially when they were changing the entry doors to each apartment and a new security access card needs to be issued before we can enter our apartment. We came back later that evening and couldn't get into our apartment and had to call them where they gave us instructions to get a temporary access card from the pinned locked box out the front entry of the building. We had to go back to reception the next day to be issued with our new security access card. Overall an ok stay considering the price we paid as we booked a few months in advance.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386855656~“Incredible value for money”~Can't believe the low cost for a decent sized studio apartment 10 minutes from Central. Has a very family feel to it, staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are your standard non-lux city fare and it's a quick walk to pretty much everything you need. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386780577~“Great place to stay when visiting Newtown”~I chose this place to stay with my partner when we visited Sydney to see a band at the Enmore Theatre in Newtown. We got an uber to and from the event with no trouble. This hotel is also a five minute walk to Redfern station and maybe fifteen minutes from Central. Our room was great! The bed was comfy, we could not hear even a bit of noise coming from outside on a busy Friday night. Definitely would stay again and recommend to anyone seeing shows around Newtown.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384776857~“Comfortable for three.”~The large sofa bed was great for an extra adult. the staff were friendly and helpful. the rooms were fine for our short visit. We enjoyed being close to Central Park shopping area [five minutes walk ]and suggest visitors explore the Spice Alley near the Central Mall, fantastic Japanese cake shop and cute little restaurants. Central Station also about 5 minutes walk. Free parking is a bonus and we were able to extend the time we left the car parked after checkout.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_384337784~“Average cleanliness and service”~Close to CBD. Needs better cleaning in the apartments and cafe. Swimming pool is tiny not as wonderful as it looks in the pictures.

review_383577229~“One bedroom unit for 3 adults”~It was an average accommodation that serves the basic needs of a traveller. There was free limited Wifi. Room size was sufficient for 3 adults. Staff were friendly and accommodating. They had an available room and allowed us to check in early which was fantastic. Free parking is a bonus. The drawback would be the loathsome shower in our one bedroom unit. Water that came out of it was sparse and did not do a good job of a proper shower. As for the location, it is located at the fringe of Sydney CBD and about 15min walk to Chinatown.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383401245~“A definite 2/5”~I am here for business. Like many people, I use trip advisor to make an informed decision on where to stay. As a business traveller I am looking for value for money, I have only so much to spend. At $200 a night and average 4 to 5 on trip advisor you think this place would be top notch, well it isn't. If you appreciate anything nice in life do not stay here. If you appreciate the smell the of an old man rolling around on your sheets just before bed, and are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege, by all means book here. I stayed in Perth last week at the Richardson for $190. It is Conde Nast listed and was immaculate. 24 hours reception. I got here late and waited 15 minutes outside for someone to pick up the phone and let me in. This place is like skid row. Do not stay here if your thinking it's worthy of a 4.5 and $200 approx a night stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382939991~“Good location and free parking”~The apartment is located near the university at UTS and Chinatown. It is easy to get into the city centre and the motorway. We booked the family apartment with 1 bedroom, toilet, living, dinning, kitchen, TV, refrigerator, sofa bed in the living and a balcony.  There is free parking and it is not noisy and the place is clean and quite. A good place to stay if you drive.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376889103~“Ok. Can be better.. ”~We booked the one room apartment which can fit 4ppl. The only problem is the sofa bed gives me a very bad backache. After 6 there is no one in reception so difficult to change if u need to. Otherwise kitchen utensils are good, toilet is clean, fridge washing machine and dryer are in good condition. We cooked almost everynite in the apartment. Most importantly it's in good location. Only 400m to redfern station which is one station away from central station. U can also go straight to circular quay station from redfern which is another bonus. Will I stay again? Ehm maybe but def will not book those with the sofa bed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_375297847~“Good value & well located”~Well appointed, clean apartments within easy walk of Central Station. The rooms facing the side streets are amazingly quiet. There is a fantastic restaurant (Kindred, 137 Cleveland St) within a short walk and a great cafe (Brickworks) on the same block. Not far from the White Rabbit Gallery if you are after some culture. The apartments would make a good base for a visit to Sydney as they come with small kitchen facilities and washing & drying machines too.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_368571094~“Great Location; Clean and Good Value for money”~Was there earlier last week and stayed at a one bedroom apartment. Was an excellent stay; great location with just a 2 KM walk to the CBD attractions and had a lot of amenities. Good value for money as well, this place having free car park. The staff was kind enough to let me park after the check-out for a couple of more hours since my flight was a bit later. Definitely a pleasant experience.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_358624221~“Good value close to the city”~I stayed here for a recent weekend visit to Sydney. The property can be a little hard to find if you're unfamiliar with the area, especially as there is no right turn into Chippen St from Cleveland St. Prices compared very favourably to the CBD hotels, and free undercover parking made my stay even better value. I simply parked the car and used taxis to get to and from the city, but it is also very close to the train station. My studio apartment was surprisingly spacious and had a comfortable king size bed. There was a small but well equipped kitchen, which included a fridge, dishwasher and even a full size stove/oven. The bathroom was clean but had some floor drainage problems as water from the shower tended to pool in one corner of the room. There was no shelving or storage area in the bathroom. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. A continental breakfast is avaiilable for just $5 each from the ground floor breakfast room. There is also a heated pool on the rooftop.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_358085911~“Overnight Stay”~Its ok. Alot of traffic noise outside. Alot of outside light. We were an end unit so that wouldnt help i guess. Bathroom shower was a bit average because water went all over the floor. They tried to patch up the fact that the shower screen door had been broken and removed and installed a curtain but the curtain was on the outside of the glass screen if that makes sense? Result is water everywhere. Otherwise it was tidy enough. Wifi was free but a bit of a waste of time because it was pretty slow. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_356414380~“Good location, Clean and Quiet”~Front staff were very helpful, apartments were a little older but in good shape and clean, free parking which is a nice touch when in Sydney. Everything worked and beds were comfortable. There is an outdoor pool on the roof top with BBQs for resident's use. Groceries were about a 10 minute walk.  The Chippendale area seemed at first to be a little sketchy at night but after being there for a few nights we discovered that it was more than fine to walk there at night. Location was a little bit of a walk from CBD in Sydney but buses and trains were 5-10 minute walks. Short 15 minute walk to Chinatown and Darling Harbour is about 30-45 minutes. Ensure that you let the staff know if you need late check-in. They are only at the front desk until 5-6pm most evenings. They are accessible but the doors will be locked.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_356056154~“One Night Stay”~This was a perfect fit for us, picked a car up from the airport and only a 20min drive to the apartments. FREE undecover parking is the real bonus here. Asked for and got a second floor room. Clean and quiet, 10 min walk to the nearby station takes you anywhere you want to go in and around Sydney. Highly recommended, very very good value for a Sydney room with parking, would stay he again for sure. Good WiFi too!~4~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_355417283~“Free Carparking”~We stayed in studio apartment for 2 nights. It was a very large studio as it had a full kitchen with dish washer, full stove and hot plates and fridge. Large King Size Bed and Bathroom also included a full size washing machine and dryer. We had a light breakfast that was included in our room rate also the best thing about these apartments is the FREE CAR PARKING. We arrived early and checked in but our room wasn't ready but the lady at reception took our luggage and put it into our room for us we were given our key so when we arrived back in the afternoon we only had to proceed up to our room. It is very close to a Woolworth Supermarket and is only a short walk to Paddy's Market and also Broadway and the Main Railway Station.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan

review_476056906~“Promise of goodness, let down by maintenance”~Chose to stay at Waldorf for combination of price and facilities. The location and price combo were good, along with conveniences of an apartment (washing machine and dryer). After two days camping where we were passing from Mudgee to elsewhere in NSW to see family, this seemed too good to be true. Indeed it was. Room 119 did have working remotes - we had to replace the batteries in both. This could have been some by previous guest. However, what is more annoying was that the appliances had not been tested and tagged. The dryer was near death and eventually died on us, and with reception closed at 1700 on Sundays, it will not be fixed until you departure. The superficial presentation of the apartments for the price is quite good, but untested and sickly appliances is not acceptable.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473913535~“Very noisy between 3 and 4 am”~This hotel is also referred to as the Waldorf Sydney Central Serviced Apartments. Our room on the first floor was clean and the beds were comfortable. The hotel is located about 20 minutes walk from Sydney's Central Railway Station which services the domestic and international airports. It is also about a $40 To $50 taxi journey to the airport depending upon traffic conditions. Many people using this hotel catch early morning flights which results in continuously closing hotel doors between 3 and 4 am. I found the noise impossible to sleep through. If staying at this hotel and not catching an early flight you should request a room on the 3rd floor as far away from the hotel entrance as possible if you wan't a decent nights sleep.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471268847~“Hotel room where well worn and dated”~the hotel has a good location for shopping in the city rooms where noisy and dated interaction with the staff was pleasant beds were not good pillows were not good for the money spent not good value at all~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_470949722~“Stay somewhere else.”~The only good thing about this place was Kimberly and Jerry at the front desk. We stayed here a total of 5 nights in 3 different rooms. Each unit is owned by individual investors and Waldorf manages them; which means the rooms can be maintained or Not, renovated or Not. See attached photos. The scariest part for me was when we arrived late at night after office hours. Management had changed the prearranged code on the lock box so we couldn't access our new room key! I thought we'd be sleeping out in the cold that rainy night! Until we noticed the Emergency phone by the sliding glass door---the man instructed us to punch in new numbers in the lock box so we could finally get in. We will never stay here again.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469585521~“Worn and dated but rooms okay”~Stayed here for a couple of nights for nearby business meetings. The outside of the hotel and the surrounding area is not much to look at and probably isn't the best part of the city. Interior is fairly worn and dated. I had a studio room and reasonably comfortable but like other parts of the hotel it was all looking a bit worn out. Reception service was efficient and helpful. I wouldn't recommend for an extended holiday stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463737993~“No. Just no. ”~We had booked and checked in for 5 nights and booked in somewhere else within 15 minutes. Horrible area of Sydney, everything was really dated and had a funny smell. All the appliances needed replacing and furniture look very old. Felt low level hostel type stay. Not what we thought. Only positive was the receptionist was lovely and helpful. I am in the process of trying to get my money back !~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456266182~“Not the best stay!!!!”~On arrival the receptionist was very helpfull with maps and chatting about the day, which was prior to Australia day. Our room was 124, the last in the row, lower level, if you get anywhere on this floor, ask to be moved!! Occupied by Asian clients/hotel workers flitting from room to room with suitcases, kids and food at all times of the day and night. Doors banging closed at 5:30am and onward as people go to work. The there's the smell of cooking! OMG! So bad! If you're into overpowering Chinese cooking at all hours fine, but nah far too much.  We decided to have a swim as it was a hot 36 degs, as we approached the pool it had the fire hose in, and a man telling us it being topped up, fine... it was about 20 degs and cold. As was the spa, we asked him what the temp normally was and he said he said 30+ as it was gas heated, so give it a few hours to heat up and it'll be fine. I looked at the gas meter that was supposed to be heating it and it wasn't even running! So we decided to wait and see. A sauna in the gym looked ok, but had no light inside, so pitch dark. I asked the same pool guy about it and he said the globe had blow, and he'd have to call an electrician to replace it!! He be out tomorrow, Australia day!! Don't think so! So 3 hours later checked the pool out, still cold, surprise. The sauna door was now open and we assumed he'd put a light in himself, no, so I caught him in the lift going up to the sauna, asked and he said it must be the owners that have opened the door and it was still not fit for use. He put an out of order sign on the door! The pool, just said it should be warm!! So all we could do was sit on the roof top terrace which had a great view of the city, but the pavers were an absolute accident waiting to happen! So many were broken and uneven to the point you could loose you footing near the wall over the edge! Pictures attached. Room was average, bulbs missing in lights, dish washer didn't work, lots of noise from above, washing machine or dryer constantly on. So not a place I'd recommend at all. The two staff we meet, Australian and English were great, but seemed to be under pressure.~2~nan~nan~2~2~nan~3~nan
review_444568284~“Great location & value for money”~Stayed here for 3nights. Perfect for getting to Circular Quay & seeing the sights. Secure parking & a clean apartment with all the facilities needed for a few nights. The rooftop pool was a bonus for cooling down and relaxing after a day of walking. Would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444128709~“Very expensive ”~When we arrived at the hotel we was quiet happy, the reception was clean and tidy and a young lady beside the desk was very helpful even drew on a map local shops that we could go to. Didn't seem to have any problems till second week of staying there. During second week of being there first problem started when we had a knock on the door and they had viewings of the furniture going on, why they couldn't do that when the room was empty I don't no.. even told us it was lucky we was in otherwise they would have just let themselves in. I no they can't help all guests but there seemed to be very loud voices coming from the hall way late at night. At 10:30 on a Sunday evening someone was drilling in the appartments. Most days when going to the pool it was clean there but on the odd occasion there was bird poo on more then one occasion it was EVERYWHERE even in the pool I come to find out after getting in. Again not that they can help but there was a power cut but there was no apology or even consideration when asking if it was all okay I got does it look like it we've had a power cut.. I also approached the manager about our problems he was very rude and not far of accusing me of lying about these problems for the money we paid I wasn't overly happy with the situation when I no the Tennants of the accommodation are paying alot less then what we do as holiday people.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440509199~“Very poor”~We left feeling very dissatisfied with our stay here! The room was dirty and outdated- far too expensive for what it was. Upon arriving home, we discovered we'd left some shirts hanging in the cupboard by accident. We called the hotel and the next day the manager called to say they couldn't find the shirts. He then argued with us and was incredibly rude to us. We said we were taking it further and he then called back later to say he had found them and that the cleaner had them the whole time, after telling us he had already spoken to the cleaner about them and that the cleaner hadn't seen them. So in other words, he'd lied to us. He refused to apologise for how he'd dealt with us. He sent the shirts back to us and we got them a week and a half later, but we had to pay for postage! After all that, he couldn't even pay for HIS mistake. I won't even rate this place a 1/10. Horrible location, rude staff, overpriced.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440190450~“good location good value”~Hotel is in a brilliant location, close to shops and bars and restaurants. We booked a 1 bedroom unit and I'm so glad we stayed in the hotel. The apartment was larger than it appeared in the photos which was great for two of the five nights we stayed. The "kitchen"ette and bathroom were completely serviceable and clean .Reception were super helpful, allowing one of our party to check in before me as the main booker. I'd recommend this hotel for location, and the handy pool. It's not super modern but great all the same and very good value for money for Sydney accommodation~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_437650797~“Sofa bed”~We had 2 apartments over the weekend, both using the sofa beds, my son and his girlfriend booked another motel due to the springs being unbearable to sleep on. In the other apartment my daughter-in-laws brother was on the sofa bed and was cocooned in the mattress as it sunk in the middle. I wouldn't recommend using them.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_436902176~“Handy to City and transport.”~Accommodation was very comfortable, the apartment was very well appointed with all you would need as if you were at home. General condition of the room was a bit tired and housekeeping matters need attending to as well as general info booklet which is out of date! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434999749~“Not a 4 star hotel”~I stayed there for 5 days during a recent work trip to Sydney - if I had not have gotten a good price I would have moved hotels - especially after the first night (As it is quite noisy - located on a very busy road), the room was quite dirty I had to wash the dishes before I used them (and I am not a germaphobe), the shower tiles where mouldy and there was food stuck to the couch (so I would not use it) and the remote control was sticky (YUCK) the room was very tired and in need of a freshen up. However the bed was great (and that's the main thing I guess) The kitchen had very limited utensils for cooking (but with spice alley and Brickfields nearby I didn't need to cook much). On Friday and Saturday night there is a lot of street noise (lots of Uni Halloween Parties nearby) - A very short walk to Redfern station (straight down Eveleigh st - yes it safe these days). And there is a good SPAR there also (the staff will tell you about the Wollies near Central Park (but this is closer). This hotel is in a good location and overall I had a comfortable stay and felt safe to walk around the neighbourhood at night as a lone woman traveller.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433794760~“Lovely hosts”~The room was clean and airy, and the front of desk and management staff were very pleasant and helpful, especially with local maps and shopping. The night-time key service worked well (I always worry about those!) as there was no 24-hour front of house service, and I felt very comfortable moving around the hotel alone at night. The pool area is AMAZING (especially as I had it all to myself)!  The only downside was the fact that the council decided to dig up the road outside my bedroom window at midnight. That is in no way the fault of the hotel, but due to the layout of the room I felt that I was at the dentist every time the concrete vibrator started up! This was the only thing that marred a lovely night's stopover.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~5~nan
review_432801580~“A surprising find”~I stayed here with my daughter recently for 2 nights. Very convenient to drive to, but equally good from train or airport. We had a car and parking was included in the room price. This is almost unheard of in Sydney and a big bonus for us. Usual nightly charge is $30 plus. Our studio room was well equipped and had washer/dryer as well as full kitchen facilities. Funny that it only had a bar sized fridge. We also had a balcony as well as opening windows. Good to have that option. Our first floor room was at the front on Cleveland Street so there was a lot of traffic noise which is difficult to get used to coming from the country. Service was good. It is easy to get a cab out the front, didn't have to wait long. Would recommend a stay here.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_432594094~“Wonderful”~The only shame was that we were only staying for one night. The discovery of the washing machine and tumble dryer in the bathroom was a big plus. The kitchen was very well equipped and the bed was comfortable. Free car parking in Sydney is apparently a bonus. It was a bit of a hike to the harbour but the rain didn't help.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431694008~“Fantastic Customer Service”~Stayed here on our last night in Sydney after a great cruise on Pacific Jewel. Our room was ready for us as soon as we arrived and the ladies who welcomed us could not have been more helpful. Room and facilities were clean and very comfortable and our check-out time was extended at no extra charge so we could enjoy our last few hours in the city before travelling to the airport. Very good value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429017415~“Filipino budget traveller”~The rate is superb compared to other apartments located at the center. A little over a US$100 per night. The unit we stayed was a 1-bedroom apartment for 4. It has a queen bed and a sofa that can be turned into a double bed fit for 2. Perfect for families.  The surroundings are not busy. If you intend to cook your meals, it is 5-minute walk to the nearest woolworth supermarket & asian store located at the Central park mall, you can also find nice burger, ramen, coffee n doughnut shops, daiso and other shops at the mall.  Its relatively walkable going to Capitol theater, Market street, townhall etc. around 18 AUS$ if you ride a cab to opera house from apartment The only downside is, no cleaning for the 5 nights we stayed. They replenished the supplies like coffee shampoo, towels etc only once during our stay - on the 3rd day. We didnt bother asked because by the time we arrive, the reception is already closed. Garbage is self disposal.  You can ask reception for assistance to call a cab to airport. 33-38AUS$ to the airport.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_428276543~“Clean, complete and cheap”~Stayed here with my mom and stepdad for 3 days and two nights, it was a lovely and memorable holiday. Staff were very accommodating and helpful...they assisted us very well since we arrived Sydney from Melbourne very early, prior to check-in time. They gave me a call to notify us that the room was ready. One thing that I did not like was the pool undergoing renovations without giving any notice at all when I booked though Booking.com. Apart from that, the apartment was clean, comfy, quiet and safe. They also gave us WiFi for I think around 1000mb.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_417282956~“Cheap & Cheerful”~This place perfectly suited our needs - a bed for a night and secure parking after a really long drive. We stayed on the first floor, previous occupant had clearly been cooking but a quick airing and the room was fine. Had washing machine and kitchen facilities. The biggest benefit was definitely the on site parking. Very hard to find in the city! Nice and close to the Chippendale Hotel for good food and beer and only a $15 cab ride right into the city. Will stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414918236~“Mediocre at best...”~We really wanted to like this place because the location was good. But the creaky floors, thin walls, and sorry breakfast (NO protein, fruit or yogurt--only bread/cereal) outweighed the proximity to Sydney's sites. Most of all, "free" wifi was not "free." A daily cap per user of 200MB is equal to nothing if you're like most travelers and you like to share your holiday experience via social media, including...ahem...hotel reviews. This is not a place for people who are light sleepers, with many young children running the halls and whose cries could be heard around the clock. Our stay was paid for with reward points from a credit card, otherwise we would've given this place an even lower rating.~3~3~nan~1~nan~nan~3~nan

Close to shopping, next door to a great pub that served great food and an easy stroll to waterfront dinning with many choices. The apartment was very well equipped, clean and very functional. Underground parking was a plus too. We stayed 3 nights at the end of a month long trip, with the underground parking we did not have to gut the rental car every time we went out. the location was perfect for day trips and they even had some great suggestions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Quite a number of convenient stores around. Muslim tourist may have dinner/lunch in a Malaysian Chinese halal cafe which a walking distance to apartment near a petrol kiosk. Tho room lil small and not much of a view. Still its good. Necessities needed are quite good and well kept. Great place to stay for a short night. Staff are friendly.

review_401192985~“Nice & value for money”~We spent 4 days 3 nights in Sydney. Since we were on a budget, we didn't mind looking for a place that was a little distant away for Sydney centre. It was a good choice. The place has fully-equipped kitchen & washer dryer. It was not that far from the train station. There was a small sundry shop & Woolworth was only a few blocks away. It was really a nice place - value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_394523970~“Location location location”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which had all the facilities you could want. The only issue was that when the sofa bed was extended there was no room at all left in the lounge room - but we were not in the room all that much so it wasn't a real problem. The roof top pool, gym and BBQ area was handy and useful - just a shame that the water tap at the sink by the BBQ didn't work. The room was clean and everything was included, such as dishwasher powder and laundry powder. The car park which was included was very handy and because the apartment was within easy walking distance to many things we didn't even take the car out! But knowing it was secure in an off street locked garage was reassuring. We walked everywhere and the Central Park shopping centre (about 5 minutes walk away) had everything we could ask for including a supermarket, which was great for self catering.  The reception did close at 7pm during the week and 5pm on weekends which was a bit annoying but when the staff were there, they were helpful, friendly and courteous. The Queen Victoria building was about 15 - 20 minutes walk away and from there we just strolled down to Circular Quay.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_390305119~“Location Location”~Very good location. The studio apt was nice, it was not big however had all of the things you need to be self efficient.

We will stay there again and would recommend it to other travellers.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_387592376~“Don't have a choice”~We stayed here because most places we looked at are either more expensive or not an apartment with kitchenette and washing machine. We needed these as we are a family of 3 and staying for 7 days. Location isn't that great...about 15mins walk from Central station especially at night the surrounding feels unsafe. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights there are always some party going on from 11pm till 4am! We can hear people laughing, yelling, singing as they were drunk causing us not being able to sleep. The studio apartment looked nicer than our 1 bedroom apartment with better bedding and newer looking. But we had to stay in a 1 bedroom as it had a queen bed and a sofa bed, whereas my sisters' studio apartment had a king bed. The sliding doors to the balcony looked dodgy...only just latching on to the lock and still a gap showing even though it's considered locked. Reception closed at 7pm daily and 5pm on weekends which is very inconvenient especially when they were changing the entry doors to each apartment and a new security access card needs to be issued before we can enter our apartment. We came back later that evening and couldn't get into our apartment and had to call them where they gave us instructions to get a temporary access card from the pinned locked box out the front entry of the building. We had to go back to reception the next day to be issued with our new security access card. Overall an ok stay considering the price we paid as we booked a few months in advance.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386855656~“Incredible value for money”~Can't believe the low cost for a decent sized studio apartment 10 minutes from Central. Has a very family feel to it, staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are your standard non-lux city fare and it's a quick walk to pretty much everything you need. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386780577~“Great place to stay when visiting Newtown”~I chose this place to stay with my partner when we visited Sydney to see a band at the Enmore Theatre in Newtown. We got an uber to and from the event with no trouble. This hotel is also a five minute walk to Redfern station and maybe fifteen minutes from Central. Our room was great! The bed was comfy, we could not hear even a bit of noise coming from outside on a busy Friday night. Definitely would stay again and recommend to anyone seeing shows around Newtown.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We enjoyed being close to Central Park shopping area [five minutes walk ]and suggest visitors explore the Spice Alley near the Central Mall, fantastic Japanese cake shop and cute little restaurants. Central Station also about 5 minutes walk. Free parking is a bonus and we were able to extend the time we left the car parked after checkout.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_384337784~“Average cleanliness and service”~Close to CBD. Needs better cleaning in the apartments and cafe. Swimming pool is tiny not as wonderful as it looks in the pictures.

review_383577229~“One bedroom unit for 3 adults”~It was an average accommodation that serves the basic needs of a traveller. There was free limited Wifi. Room size was sufficient for 3 adults. Staff were friendly and accommodating. They had an available room and allowed us to check in early which was fantastic. Free parking is a bonus. The drawback would be the loathsome shower in our one bedroom unit. Water that came out of it was sparse and did not do a good job of a proper shower. As for the location, it is located at the fringe of Sydney CBD and about 15min walk to Chinatown.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383401245~“A definite 2/5”~I am here for business. Like many people, I use trip advisor to make an informed decision on where to stay. As a business traveller I am looking for value for money, I have only so much to spend. At $200 a night and average 4 to 5 on trip advisor you think this place would be top notch, well it isn't. If you appreciate anything nice in life do not stay here. If you appreciate the smell the of an old man rolling around on your sheets just before bed, and are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege, by all means book here. I stayed in Perth last week at the Richardson for $190. It is Conde Nast listed and was immaculate. 24 hours reception. I got here late and waited 15 minutes outside for someone to pick up the phone and let me in. This place is like skid row. Do not stay here if your thinking it's worthy of a 4.5 and $200 approx a night stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
