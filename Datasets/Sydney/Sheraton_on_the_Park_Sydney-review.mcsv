review_478693471~“Poor start but happy ending ”~We arrived late at night and moved rooms 4 times!! Due to hygiene and noise issues. It was our anniversary so we were quite disappointed but I will say the staff were extremely lovely and more than willing to appease our concerns. We received free champagne and were offered free breakfast and drinks. The room we finished up with was very nice and by the time we left we were happy with our stay. Special mention to Billy Tang who was a legend.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478407978~“Not a great return visit”~Couldn't open the blind due to office workers in next block that could look straight in due to being so close. We did ask reception for a better room this time !!  No coffee at all so it was not refilled after last guests !! and no saucers to put our mugs on.  Bed was uncomfortable and the satin cover on quilt spent more time on the floor than on the bed. Very annoying.  We have stayed at this hotel many times over the years and chose this again due to position but in future will be looking for another hotel for our weekend getaways.  I think it needs to be refurbished as it is getting old and nothing has changed over the past 10 years.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478362092~“Nice hotel in a good location”~This hotel is in a great location, 1 mile from the Opera House and across from Hyde Park. The pool area includes a hot tub, sauna, and steam room, as well as a small sun deck. The linens in the room are very nice and the room is spacious with a large bathroom. Room service and mini bar available. Recommend this hotel for a nice stay.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478327330~“Nice but not blown away”~Great location if you want to be in the city area. Walking distance to most attractions. The rooms are lovely but the hotel itself could use being renovated. The feel of the hotel is very corporate. Nothing special to write about though.....~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_478326198~“Horrible check in ! Platinum go away from this hotel !”~I have requested an early check in, as I stay more than 200 nights per year. I didn't get any reply. When I arrived at the check in, the person told me . Let me check with my Manager. I replied :" if you are fully booked , I understand". She said : "my Manager will decide". She came back ( the Manager didn't show up") and said it is not possible. Please just train properly your employees. At least say :" I am so sorry, we are fully booked and we can't unfortunately satisfy your request". would like us to take care of your luggage? Nothing : just, not possible. When I tried to book 4 rooms for the same days, I found out availability at the same price. That means , they have availability, but they just don't want to bother themselves to try to accommodate their customers. I will never be back in this hotel ! They just don't care, and they might be right if customers keep coming back, despite a poor service. It won't be my case ! I have as well Hyatt loyalty card, and I will use it in Australia for my next visits .~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478278304~“Great location! Professional Staff”~We stayed 4 nights at the Sheraton on the Park and we had the most amazing experience from check-in to check-out. Helpful and professional staff, great facilities (spa, pool, fully equipped gym), and very convenient location (10-15 minute walk from all tourist landmarks and 1 block away from Sydney Tower). Rooms are typical Sheraton-like. Highly recommended!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_478086408~“Elegant hotel in a great location”~I have stayed at this hotel a few times now and the service is always friendly, the rooms are quite spacious with an elegant feel. If you pay for a room on the front then the views are delightful over Hyde Park (rooms at the back are much less delightful). The pricing for room service and mini-bar are astronomical and if you are an SPG elite I wouldn't expect much,I am yet to receive a room upgrade (yet I was offered one at a charge), early check in has never been possible and the hotel doesn't seem to have enhanced amenities. Despite that, it's a solid hotel with friendly staff and a great location.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477669081~“Comfortable in an excellent location”~Not the best hotel in the world, but great value for money and very comfortable.

review_476995810~“Good Centrally located hotel.”~Great location right in front of Hyde Park, St. James Station is a minutes walk away. You can walk down to Darling Harbor. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby. I got a corner room which was pretty big. You could find much larger rooms in similar hotels for the same money, but i guess its the location that they charge. I loved the executive club. Do sit at balcony for a drink the view is amazing. They nice restaurants, i mostly ordered room-service and food was great. Staff at reception was really friendly and can help you with most of your queries.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476735625~“Ripped Off - $199 Deal a Scam”~I wanted to take my wife out and stay in Sydney and have a special night. Booked using a website and the advert read Queen Bed $199...Pay in advance, no refunds -  no cancellations - I presented to reception, I was informed there was only 2 single beds available. I had the paperwork and nowhere did it say the room was going to be 2 single beds...I was then up sold by $150 to begin with and then arrived at $70 upgrade in the end. Ripped off was the only experience I took away from this interaction. I had no desire to debate this at the time with my wife standing beside me - but this ruined the whole experience from my perspective. I checked online when I got to the room and Sheraton were still advertising the $199 deal with Queen bed for the night in question 16th April. If this is how the Sheraton does business then they have lost my business forever? Lure the customer in on a no refund offer that they have no intention on honouring and then gouge the extra out of the customer when they have no alternative- standing at reception with their bags. This was a very poor experience - and one I warned the receptionist about that I would complain, and that I felt ripped off - but this did not concern her at all.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_476658210~“Good 4* hotel...be wary of billing errors”~Great location next to Hyde Park, great Concierge folks. We were in Sydney for our 23rd Wedding Anniversary and chose the Sheraton on the Park. Was warned about billing issues from a colleague staying at the same hotel........and then the same happened to us as well. We had booked on the Sheraton site itself and prepaid for 3 nights. When the bill was presented it had a changed rate (much higher). After kicking up a bit of a fuss, we were told "somehow the rate got changed automatically".........that was the explanation.....left a bad taste in the mouth....~3~2~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_476612509~“Comfort and Convenience”~We chose The Sheraton on the Park for our recent stay in Sydney as we are SPG members, but also because of the hotel's convenient location. We were not disappointed. The hotel is within ten minutes walk of Darling Harbor and fifteen minutes walk of The Rocks and Sydney Harbor Bridge. The vicinity of the hotel is very pleasant, with Hyde Park opposite, and many shops, coffee bars and restaurants nearby. The hotel was very clean and our room very spacious with pleasant views over the Park. We would definitely use this hotel on our next visit to Sydney~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_476172966~“Always receive what we expect”~This Hotel is an amazing place to stay. It's downtown. Right beside the subway and other modes of transportation. Across from a large park. The Hotel exceeded our expectations as most SPG properties do. Great service, friendly staff, large well furnished room with well appointed bathroom and walk in closet. Definitely recommend this Hotel. Will stay there again if we return to Sydney.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_475441190~“Mediocre, won't use again.”~Have stayed here a couple years ago and it was great. This time around it just seemed off, the staff at tue front door/valet seemed very flippant and quite young with no interest in the hotel guests. I would trust them with a Lambo or Ferrari as were parked out the front. The rooms was dirty, tired and run down. TV channels not working properly. Good point is close to shops. Breakfast buffet food is also good. Although again the service was terrible, I asked for a spoon for my daughter and the service lady gave a snark and pointed over to the buffet and said "the spoons are over there!". Another said they had run out of spoons, no spoons had been set on the table either. Go to The Four Season instead, 5/5 both times in the last couple months. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

For 20 years I thought I had to stay closer to the harbour, boy was I wrong. Conveniently located across the street from the train and Hyde Park. Walked to the arboretum after an excellent breakfast in the Sheraton club. Nice, spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. Gym is fantastic, nothing to not like about this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474393602~“Birthday Weekend Celebrations”~Just stayed 3 nights at The Sheraton On The Park, Sydney and had a most memorable time. Complimentary drinks at the bar and a beautiful, delicious birthday cake awaiting our return to our room. Thank you Sheraton! These thoughtful gestures just added to our wonderful stay in Sydney, celebrating my birthday and visiting our loving son. A special mention must go to Mori at Reception...thank you so much for your warm welcome and obliging manner. Her efficiency and presence is certsinly an asset to The Sheraton team! Congratulations! Also, I would like to note that housekeeping needs to be more diligent in their cleaning...especially the shower tiles in Room 817. (Were not clean.) Thanks again and see you on our next visit to Sydney. :-)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474335740~“Unacceptable check in ”~I have just arrived at Sheraton on the Park ( after many visits over the years ) and have never encountered such rudeness as displayed by the Front Office Manager . I have been left sitting waiting for him to find someone senior for me to speak to regarding my booking . If this service to an SPG Platinum guest is indicative of their service overall this will be my last stay~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474283170~“World Class Hotel”~This hotel has impressed yet again. Have not visited in a number of years but on this occasion standards were as high as ever. Great rooms, only criticism is that TV/Entertainment system very slow to respond with remote and perhaps needs an upgrade.Food is otherwise even better than last time we stayed with great buffet breakfast and lunch. Superb location.~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_473657621~“Luxury to toot”~If you normally stay at a Sheraton, and you have lounge access, be prepared to be pampered. They have an amazing lounge with 5 star views. The food and drinks are incredible. It is one of the best I've experienced. They also have tea service on the weekend. So you get amazing breakfast, tea service, and dinner. The hotel is beautiful and is across the street from the park. The staff are amazing. I totally recommend this hotel!!! This is a view from the terrace in the lounge.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The bed is great but the bedside tables are so far away you have to get out of bed to reach them... Service: fine WIFI: no free wifi. Seriously in 2017 this isn't good enough.

Loads of attractions nearby, 15 minutes walk to Opera House. Love shopping well Pitt St Mall & QV Building within easy walk. Staff are friendly, helpful and efficient. Standard rooms are good size with comfortable bed and roomy bathroom. Car parking available. Would stay again if price is right.

review_471410974~“Amazing Hotel - Park View”~This is the place to stay, just a block from the Eye of Sydney, a 10-15 minute walk to The Opera House... Many things to see and do all in walking distance plus a train station across the street to access underground. You have restaurants and bars on site, so no need to venture out for this.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471256602~“Slept on the floor”~This is a beautiful hotel pity about the quality of the beds, the view and the buffet breakfast. The beds were so soft that within 10minutes of retiring I had a saw back so I ended up sleeping on the floor. The view for a $300 room is a brick wall and asking for a different room would have cost an extra $80. The buffet breakfast although you can't stuff up fruit and cereal, I decided to try the eggs benidict which were cold as were most of the other food. I took my mother as a treat and I was very disappointed next time I won't bother spending so much on my accommodation and probably get a better nights sleep.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471161623~“Almost perfect ”~Hotel was beautiful , well looked after , we found the maid to very hospitable and gracious very pleasant to deal with and visit with on our coming and going from room .  Room size was great , shower amazing and large bathroom . Our bed was very comfortable and made the huge time change easier for us to change to.  We had access to club room we had a huge variety and efficient staff , if not always the most friendly .  As we booked a early trip to Blue Mountain we eat one morning at the breakfast buffet discount as we had club room.  The breakfast buffet was the least impressive place we had been to. When you ask a chef to cook you a omelette well done and it runs all over your plate as the white was still runny as I had limited time did not follow thru with complaint but felt overcharged as we ate no different then club lounge which was included in our rate . My thought you wear the white hat your should be able to cook to requests.  On whole the room, the location , the club lounge and entertainment in main lounge where all first class .expensive but beautiful .Also internet worked fine for us.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470935628~“Fantastic hotel”~The Sheraton's central location right on Hyde Park was great! We were able to walk most places within 15 minutes, and the train to the airport was only a 5 minute walk. The room was spacious and well-furnished. Breakfast in the lounge was delicious, with a variety of options. And the hotel itself is simply beautiful. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_470347443~“Blissful Peace in Sydney”~What a great hotel! The location is right in the CBD, within a couple minutes walking from train and bus. The service was excellent, the room was SO quite and that's exactly what I was looking for. Everything was spotless, bed lines were indeed heavenly and the bed was super comfortable with wonderful pillows. I must say I was surprised that a Sheraton was so good! The only negative in all of Sydney are the hotel prices. I stayed there two times on this trip. The first time the rate was around $300 US per night; the second time the rate shot up to $550 per night! Unheard of in US.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470201866~“Sheraton quality”~Used my points to stay two nights over the weekend. As there were no regular rooms left had to purchase a more expensive room. Check in was smooth and was pleasantly surprised to be granted access to the club lounge. After check in, went to the club lounge and it was pretty well appointed with hot and cold snacks including sushi. There was waiter service and they were very efficient and professional. Through my stay we had breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks. It can get crowded in the mornings and evenings but other times it is pretty empty and a good place to chill out and get free drinks with waiter service. Otherwise the room is of the usual Sheraton quality although the sleep was a bit on the hard side. Wifi was efficient and worked without a hitch through my stay - it was included in my booking. It is pretty central and right next to St James station.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan

review_470011771~“What type of check out policy is this?”~It is our fourth stay in Sydney and second at the Sheraton on the Park. The room, food, service are or have been as expected, but when asked about late check out tomorrow they offered 12 noon....What is late about that? I don't feel like an appreciated member or repeat guest when I hear 11.....They immediately countered and said we could keep the room until 3pm for AUD100 extra. We need the room and said yes for this highway robbery. In other civilized places (hotels) they offer free late check outs for repeat guests or members (and real "late" check outs whether un Singapore or New York). At the very least they could have a later check out time than 11. The staff defended this policy by saying that they were equally difficult if guests arrived early and also by the fact that it is a CBD location. If you care about feeling like an appreciated member or guest I suggest you stay at Westin instead......I wonder though since first time we stayed Sheraton and their staff were absolutely fantastic.... Maybe they are conscious about the fact that last time we had an exec room while this time we only had a normal.........I hope this is not true....~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469787748~“Enjoyable”~Apart of giving me occupied room, my stay was great.  Lobby and area was was truly 5 star.  Huge bathroom but the room could get a little fresh up.  Stayed overnight so I really didn't try much facilities.  Will come back~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_469761137~“Central Sydney”~This hotel was very close to my business appointment in the central CBD.  I liked the old world charm of this hotel. The theme worked well. I booked an executive suite. It was enormous with a large functional bathroom, comfy king bed and terrific work station and desk. There was a separate lounge with TV facilities. The shower was excellent. What you would expect from a hotel of this stature.  The room was cleaned to a very high standard.  There was an annoying amount of street noise during the night. I would have also thought a night light in the bathroom as standard these days in most 5 star hotels.  The overall service was excellent. Staff went our of their way to make you feel comfortable. This was welcomed as most Australian Hotels I have visited have lacked the service one would have expected in a quality hotel. Happy hour in the executive floor 21 was brilliant. Food and drink as good as you can get for a happy. There was a vast assortment of cakes and savouries.  Breakfast was a little disappointing. I would have thought a little more hot food variety and fruits would have been appropriate considering the high tariff I was paying. Front desk was a little slow when checking in.  Overall I would stay here again.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~5~nan

Views nothing but city buildings, stairs when you pull Up which I don't like.. stairs all Over lobby and it's dated .bathroom Is also heavy dated black marble , carpets need replacing in suite. I like big closet and comfortable bed. I liked the plantation shutters but totally doesn't work w black marble bath? Need better products ..and room was freezing. No coffee and quick food options that are at all in the realm of a normal persons breakfast ..$50 breakfast buffet..no thanks.. when there are soooo many fantastic options just outside the door. French coffee shop in the mint was great. Sheraton on little collins in Melbourne was so much nicer than this one we thought . We are Starwood members so we stick To Marriott's and spg I didn't like that excursions booked through concierge could not be billed To room .

review_469243520~“VERY VERY GOOD”~We stayed on a Saturday night and got an early check-in- the staff at the reception were very helpful. We payed extra for an upgrade to a balcony room - not too much about $50.00 and worth every cent. Beautiful views over Hyde Park and the harbour. The room was beautiful (I think it had been recently renovated) very large and great bathroom and very good room service to get a softer pillow and a bucket of ice. Late checkout to 3.00 p.m. which is great to go and wander around the city. Well worth a stay here.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_469001739~“Night Out. For Adults”~There is not more that can be said about this Beautiful Hotel than. Wow.  Having never had the pleasure of using the Sheraton Club Lounge. I must say this is the only way to go.  By upgrading to Sheraton Club.  Don't worry about the extra expense.  It's well worth it.  The View from the 21st Floor over Hyde Park it's Stunning.  The Cocktail Service and Wine Selection and Canapés. One could even just Wine and Dine here. But if your going to use this as your Starting Point for a Night Out.  Do it.  The Breakfast that is Served in The Lounge is as good as you'd expect and Plentiful.  Great Scrambled Eggs by the way.  The Room was lovely The Bed was  So Comfortable and Kingsize.  I even had the misfortune of leaving my wallet in The Lounge. And when I'd discovered it 20 minutes later and dashing back to the Lounge.  My wallet had been found by Staff. Taken to the Lobby to the Manager and a Message had been left on the Room message service.  Thank you to the Caring and Professional Staff at Sheraton on The Park.  A wonderful stay was had.

review_468698496~“Disappointed”~Booked a last minute 'Hyde Park View' room as a surprise for my boyfriend through lastminute.com.au. We were given two single beds despite no notification a double wasn't available, and our view was the concrete top of the entrance and an entire wall of other room windows.

review_468694557~“Excellent location opposite of Hyde Park. Lots of dining options nearby.”~Sheraton on the Park Sydney is located next to Hyde park and also St. James station which connects to Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport via the Airport Link Train. However, if you are not traveling solo, I would recommend taking a cab to the hotel from the airport as its cheaper and more convenient. This hotel is a SPG Category 5 property with a complimentary night costing 12,000 SPG points. We checked in early in the morning around 9 AM and our rooms were not ready. The front desk agent gave us keys to the on-property Spa (On The Park Rejuvenation Day Spa) so we could freshen up and then drop our luggage with the bellman while we went sightseeing. We were a group of 4 and had booked 2 rooms for 2 nights. My room got upgraded to a corner room which ended up being my parents room. The other room was a standard room. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had a good night sleep on both nights. The Club Lounge at this Sheraton is pretty big and had plenty of breakfast options. The lounge also had evening appetizer hour which featured some cold as well as hot appetizers. Unfortunately we availed it for only one day as we were out sightseeing the other time. Thumbs up: Excellent location in the heart of Sydney , less than 2 km from Opera House. Located right next to St. James station that allows easy transportation access to rest of the city. Also you can catch either the 333 and 389 bus to get to Bondi beach right across the hotel. Very nice Club Lounge with great customer service by lounge attendants Thumbs down: 12,000 SPG points per night is not exactly a great value for this hotel. milespointstravel.com~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_468238797~“Horrible Service! ”~I am currently staying at the Sheraton on the Park. It is a great location and if you run, amazing park nearby.  As for the service, its horrible. I've been here for 4 nights and when I returned to my room yesterday, I found towels on my windowsill and wet carpet. Sydney is experiencing a lot of rain at the moment my room had a leak. The carpet was a wet smelly sponge. I called the front desk and they moved me to a new room. The new room doesn't have a leak but is dusty and doesn't feel fully clean. The sad thing, I can't connect to wifi in my new room. I spent three hours on and off with tech service trying to connect to the internet. The front desk sent me an envelope with four pieces of paper with wifi passcodes that allow me two hours of internet us. What a joke! This is a horrible way to solve a customer problem.  When I went to the front desk today and asked for more codes, they responded I can only use the ones I was given. I was also told Starbucks and another nearby coffee shop have wifi. I asked the employee if he was kidding and he responded with a simple no. He also recommended since I am here on business I could work from my office. Yet again, i asked if he was kidding .... yet again a simple response of a no. I received a letter about my wifi issue and was asked to call the front desk if I the issue still persists. So, I decided to talk with another employee, they recommended I work from public spaces throughout the hotel. Ridiculous!  Each person I spoke with showed no concern, empathy or genuine care. I'm shocked how they handled the leak in my room. Clearly whomever put the towels on the windowsill knew the carpet was wet because when I stepped on it, water would rise. The way they have responded to my wifi issues are truly sad.  For my first time in Sydney, the Sheraton has done nothing to show Sydney hospitality.  I find the the city extremely friendly... that service doesn't carry over to the Sheraton on the Park.  A guest overheard me discussing my wifi issues with the front desk agent and they saw me later and shared the frustrations they are experiencing and said this hotel is horrible. There seems to be a theme.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468214525~“High Tea with the girls”~We decided to take high tea at the Sheraton before going to see a special screening of Beauty and the Beast (great live action remake). We've been before and enjoyed it immensely and nothing has changed. For some reason the online booking we had made two months previously wasn't on their books but the staff were fabulously accommodating and quickly got a table ready for us.  From there we enjoyed the lovely buffet starting with the most delicious sandwiches and chicken curry puffs moving on to the most delightful desserts - I could have eaten 12 of the madelines!!!! Nothing we tried disappointed - the mini strawberry cheesecakes and fruit custard tartlets and much more - all enjoyed with a wonderful cup of tea and a side of warm and friendly service.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468186220~“High Tea”~Had a Fabulous experience here, my favourite place to go toofor a Girls Day out. The food from savoury to sweets was amazing, lots of lovely variety. Friendly professional staff and a relaxing place to be with friends.Well worth the price.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468004148~“SECOND TIME THEY HAVE OVER CHARGED ME”~I love this hotel for location and service - however this is the second time they have over charged my credit card and I have to call and sort out all the "additonal charges" I spend 40 mins on the phone trying to resolve it but they still are not clear on charges. Disappointing to say the least.~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467717559~“Worth every cent”~Stayed in park view executive floor room last Saturday night. Got the park, relax and stay package. Ok was expensive but Adele was playing Sydney so all accommodation at premium rate. Parking a breeze as you enter via Castlereagh st. Lifts take you straight to the lobby. Charming and happy young lady named June on check in. Room was ready even though it was only 1pm. Our room 1433 was in the far corner and had the most amazing view over Hyde Park right out to the heads. Could have stay and watched the word, go by for hours. Did get to use the included evening canapés and drinks as we had a date with Adele. Room was spotless, most deep glorious bath which a gain we didn't get to use. Beds sooo soft but I would prefer a firmer pillow but that's just being picky. Now buffet breaks...omg ! We were there about 8.30 and it was already busy but we were seated strait away. I am a big coffee drinker and my friend and I both remarked that the latte was possibly the greatest coffee we have had in years...seriously it was so good we had two and nearly went for three! Amazing selection of food, love an fresh omelette making station and wow granola ice cream! So can you tell we loved it....would def pay to stay here again......nice to stay somewhere special every now and then and next time for a time where can enjoy the facilities.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Staff were lovely and friendly. Very convenient location to circular key!  We had dinner in the restaurant,which I would highly recommend and I felt the prices were very reasonable. Wish we had stayed 2 nights!!!  We will be back. Thank You to all the staff!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467412115~“Excellent”~I stayed here with my sister over the Canberra Day public holiday weekend, just for one night. First of all, we got an amazing deal. $210 for 2 people for a night in a 5 star hotel? Amazing. Right from the start, customer service was excellent. We drove to the front of the building & were immediately greeted. The car was taken by the valet, & we were ensured our bags would meet us at our room. They did. Despite being in the least expensive room, we were treated like any other guest; with a great deal of respect & attentiveness. Check-in was easy. Despite a 3:00 pm check-in time, we were able to check in at around 1:00 pm with no questions asked. The room is massive, clean, & not at all dated or worn. Only con: No free Wi-Fi. This was a wonderful stay & I hope I can come back for more than 1 night next time.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467361384~“superb sheraton”~Staid with our family last weekend at Sheraton on The Park, staff were fantastic from porter, check-in staff to checkout.

Perfect weekend~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467311094~“My favorite hotel in Sydney”~Have stayed at this hotel many times over the course of the last 17 years. Excellent rooms huge bathrooms, great service, perfect location. Short walk to Darling Harbour and Circular Quay. Plenty of restaurants close by.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467097815~“Welcome to Sydney”~Lovely hotel across the road from Hyde Park, which is absolutely lovely to stroll through, we saw a bridal party having photos there, the perfect spot. We stayed in a balcony room overlooking the Park, The Bar is great, great food & great staff and shops on the doorstep. On arrival we indulged in the hotel High Tea very scrumptious, a bit pricey but hey you don't have that every day, it was also very popular, would stay there again definitely.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_466741771~“No Complaints - A Great Sydney Hotel for Business”~It's been almost a decade since I last stayed here but it's still a great hotel for business, and very convenient. Easily accessible by train from the airport to St James station (just across the road), and I can walk to many of the places that I need to go. Check-in was friendly and quick. Room was fantastic, slept extremely soundly, and felt like home away from home. Lounge just as good as it always was with ample breakfast selection. Sonny and the concierge team efficiently took care of a few matters for me, thanks. Whilst Sydney hotel prices are quite steep, the rate here is reasonable. Many thanks folks.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_466426059~“Starting to show its age a little bit but still my favourite”~I really love this hotel. This was also the first time I could take my wife here (and having to pay myself as well lol) and she loved it as well. Some may argue that it's a bit dated and needs a renovation but that doesn't matter to me as the rooms are large, have all the facilities you would expect, dining is excellent, public areas and the lobby are beautifully kept and the service is impeccable. We had a minor issue when we checked in with some dust on high surfaces around the wardrobe and shelves but the hotel resolved this immediately, giving the room a thorough clean next morning. They even offered to move us which I declined as it was not a big deal. Despite this, we had a nice bottle of red with a note apologising for the inconvenience that afternoon, completely unnecessary but just an example of how this hotels goes the extra mile for their customers. Self parking is simple (our rate included parking and breakfast) as the underground parking lot is quite spacious, especially compared to may other hotels in Sydney. Our rate also included club access and this was a great amenity as well with a lounge on the 21st floor with terrific views of Hyde Park, soft drinks and water plus you can have breakfast up there which is less crowded than Feast on Level 1. Finally the pool, accessed via the day spa, is heated, under a glass roof and spotlessly clean as well with a whirlpool bath to smooth away those aches and pains. I highly recommend this hotel, close to Sydney shopping and St James and Town Hall Stations for easy access to other parts of the city. Or just walk, it's about 20 mins to Circular Quay~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_466368417~“Misleading”~Reception staff are really pleasant and helpful,a room with view of the park actually means you need to put your face on the glass and look side ways....more real estate talk than actuall view of the park. Give breakfast in the club lounge a big miss unless you like broccoli and boiled bacon ,although sitting next to a window with a tradesman repairing the glass on a Sunday morning at breakfast time is unusual. In fairness the door staff tried to stop us going in to breakfast and advised we should go to the main Buffett breakfast down stairs,we paid for club lounge and expected club lounge.  We normally stay at the Langham hotels and this was a mistake,Sheraton is sub standard and overrated , generally dissapointing top to bottom. I suggest Sheraton staff should stay at the opposition for a night. Rooms ,clean,bathrooms usual 5 star, TVs slow and outdated,mini bar $9 for water (complimentary at Langham). Air con non responsive,over priced.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_465958374~“Solid but not Spectacular”~The hotel has become a bit tired, but from a business hotel perspective it works well (other than not having free wifi in the rooms). The hotel is a short 5-minute walk to St Martin's Place and the main office buildings and is near restaurants and shopping of Queen Victoria Building and Westfields. For exercise, one can run through the park across the street to the gardens/coastline/Opera House, and the gym is very good - lots of different equipment. The hotel would be a lot better if it was refurbished - the style is dated and the bathroom fixtures are a notch below luxury.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465726246~“decent central business hotel”~the good news with the sheraton hotel : it is centrally located in sydney. then the rest is disapointing: the rooms look tired (in the room I had...there was absolutely no view...), the breakfast was mediocre and the bathrooms look tired too.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465512744~“Best SPG in town, great service”~This is my go to hotel n Sydney in the SPG group, since the Westin never delivers. Rooms are big, albeit a bit dark. Showers are always functional and clean, albeit it's time for a Reno to move away from the 1990s. Staff are flexible, helpful and you can see they want to do what they can for you. Have stayed here multiple times in the past two years.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465487855~“Everything was great except...”~This hotel is in a good location in the city center. It's in the middle of the business district near tons of shopping, Hyde Park and a train station. The staff was great and the room was big and very nice. My only problem is there was no free wifi in the rooms. You had to pay $20/day for wifi in the room and they gave you a 1 hour login for use in the lobby for free. This is not my definition of free wifi that they advertised when I booked. In this day and age how can a Sheraton hotel still charge for wifi??~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465456621~“A perfect hotel for couples”~Situated on Hyde Park everything is walkable in Sydney city centre. Morning views for breakfast and dinner are beautiful.

review_465436123~“Comfortable, central, professionally run hotel in the heart of Sydney”~Two nights in December with parents in two, wonderful experience.

review_465265669~“Great Hotel”~What made the Sheraton on the Park so great was the service. The hotel is well-located in the heart of the city yet it is right on the park and a short walk to the Royal Gardens. The rooms are spacious with very good bathrooms. The lounge is fine with nice canapes and soft drinks all day. Breakfast is OK. But the front desk staff and the bell staff and the concierge and the staff at Feast were uncharacteristically helpful and friendly. They took a 4 star and made it into a 5 star.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465233321~“Stayed 2 nights ”~Stayed 2 nights for business and couldn't believe how old and run down this hotel is. In the best location across from Hyde Park and in the heart of the CBD this hotel has no tooth brush and would only give you that if you request. A kit Kat cost $6 and water was $9. This is hyway Roberry. Car Park was $50/$60 and a bloody joke. By the time it was all said and done you could have stayed at the Langham. It basically catered to the Chinese market and we Aussies were second class. Don't do it.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464672701~“Heart of the city”~First time guests here this weekend, unfortunately a bit dampened by the weather but the hotel facilities make up for it. Room was ready early so we unpacked then headed to the Club Lounge on the 21 St floor for a drink and a snack. Out through the rear exit and you are in the heart of the city for shopping and exploring, close to QVB, Strand Arcade and Pitt st mall. Back to the club lounge at 5:00 for canapés and drinks, wines, spirits and beers, you are waited on so due to the number of people in there on Friday afternoon they did struggle with the demands of the guests. Not a big selection of beers, only Heineken and James Boag, most club lounges have a bit of a bigger selection, canapés were varied and plentiful, it seems everyone chose to dine here other than have dinner elsewhere.  Executive King bed room was spacious and modern with a massive bathroom with shower and separate bath. Only gripe is the having to pay for in room wifi, you do have 1 hour free wifi in the club room by using a voucher but on the whole it was a very pleasant stay with helpful and friendly staff, would definitely stay here again given the opportunity.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_464648273~“High tea”~The worst good ever!!! It's 2017, people don't eat that kind of food. No fresh cream, all mock cream. Yuk! The sandwiches were dry and hardly any filling just thick bread. Samosa, old, cold and not crisp. Cheese no frills cheese not ripe, it was hard. The biscuits were wet and old. . No fresh fruit. Totally uninviting! For $59.00!!!  New a new chef with new 2017 ideas~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464564390~“Awesome Experience ”~We recently visited Australia and stayed at Sheraton on the Park twice during the trip. The Concierge Services were great, with wonderful recommendations. We booked what I would call a Jr Suite and with this came cocktail time in the Sheraton Suite. Great time to meet other travelers and business people from all over the world. We loved our time here. We stayed at 2 other Sheraton's in Australia, on the Park was by far the best. Best Sheraton I have ever stayed in across it's brand.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464505613~“Excellent business stay. In room amenities, service, location, food superb.”~For business hotels, I require three things – a quiet room, ample working area with good wifi and location near my work place.  Sheraton hit all the right notes. Room was whisper quiet even on a Friday night, wifi was very fast and the hotel is well situated - walking distance from Martin Place (for work) and Pitt St. Mall (for play).  Additionally, front desk service was excellent (I believe the person who checked me in was named Chau) and food at the hotel restaurant was delicious.  Great two night stay, highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_464351910~“Amazing hotel in fantastic location”~My first hot in Australia and what a pleasure. The hotel was perfectly located and the rooms amazing. We stayed in a room which gave us access to the club room in the 21st floor which was fantastic. Breakfast was a plenty and the standard of the food was amazing. We stayed here for 2 nights so didn't really have time to use the pool/gym but did check them out and they looked great. We ate in the bar on the first floor and the food/drink and service were 5 star. We managed to walk to the opera house through the park but recommend getting a taxi back as the return journey was all up hill. Having stayed at many superb hotels around the world this one ranks up there as one of the best. Thanks Sheraton on the park, we are looking forward to our return on the 18th march as we leave Aus.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464226727~“Great location, decent rooms, expensive food and lounge”~We stayed here for a week, partially on points. The rooms are decent in size and the bathroom is spacious. Shower water pressure could be a bit stronger, but overall nice. The pool area is beautiful, but the pool is FREEZING, I couldn't even go in. Used the hot tub instead, but it is small - two couples barely fit. We had access to the Club lounge our first night. The staff would not extend the access beyond that night unless we paid $90 PER PERSON. I mean, that is insane! $180 per day for us to have a coke and some yogurt in the morning. As a Marriott Gold member, the lounge is included as a benefit. I am SPG Gold and would have thought as a courtesy they would have extended it. Pros: spacious rooms, nice location - easy access to public transport, lobby is beautiful Cons: expensive lounge access and restaurant (breakfast was $44pp), concierge was not helpful before visit, but fine once we arrived, lobby is heavily perfumed, freezing pool; mediocre rooms service food.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_463845274~“Disappointing all round”~I have always made this hotel my destination when I travel to Sydney. However my young family of 4 had the most disappointing experience at the Spa & Health Club. After less than 30 seconds entering the health club before we even entered the pool gate. We were told by the malestaff that we were too loud. I thought he may mistaken us with other group as we weren't even in our swimming suits. His response was unacceptable in front of my family and especially my young children. My children were too scare to visit the pool area for the duration of our 4 day stay. I contacted the front counter manager and she was told by the staff a different version of event before we had the chance to the front counter. I think this sort of horrible culture towards young family is in in business. Why bother have so many Asian friendly staff if you one like at the Health Club? Also if you have such restriction then why don't you make it an adult only area. We will never go back again as there is plenty of hotels to choice from in Sydney.~1~nan~2~nan~nan~5~1~nan
review_463624021~“Pleasure and business”~I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the past 15 years but on this last stay their standards have dropped enormously. Staff are completely disinterested in customer service and it shows. Airconditioning in the room I stayed in was appalling. Too hot to sleep. Internet connection was shocking and slow speed. TV was not tuned correctly. Food in the buffet was cold and largely inedible. While current situation continues I would strongly suggest you find an alternative to this hotel~1~1~3~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_463391930~“A tad tired”~Overall a pleasant hotel but one can tell that it's seen better days despite refurbishment. Location is excellent, for both business and leisure. Across the street from Hyde Park, a stone's throw to decent shops including the Westfield mall and a reasonable stroll to Circular Quay. Rooms are comfortable but do not expect a view, given that this is a city hotel. My corner room looked out directly into neighbouring office blocks so the shutters had to be drawn all the time, which made the room somewhat depressing.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_463364985~“Hotel seems nice, but don't bother with the Spa & Health Club”~If you want an indulgence massage, mani/ pedi try some of the places around the city as this was a very disappointing experience for myself and my daughter. We did not stay at the hotel but have stayed at Sheratons in other countries and used their amazing spas. My 16 year old daughter did this as a special treat for my birthday. No herbal teas or special treatments, had to share the tiny bathroom with 15 other people and staff, we could barely move. My daughters slippers were ripped and her manicure was terrible. A luke warm water in a small paper cup was the excitement of our visit. Questioning our payment when my daughter had given the cc number weeks before was awful for her. I have sent an email that night, they then called her and asked me to call them which I did only to be told, I couldn't speak to the manager for 2 weeks, this left a bitter taste in my mouth as I believe I am entitled to a refund on her manicure at least.~2~2~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_463050515~“Great spot”~Currently staying at the Sheraton On the Park and think its fantastic. Check -in smooth and room excellent. In fact a big room with a great bathroom and walk-in robe. Had lounge access with the booking and spent an enjoyable hour with a glass of sparkling and a great view of Hyde Park and the eastern suburbs of Sydney. Found using the TV function a bit of a challenge and one call to guest services had William in the room within 5 minutes and all problems solved. Have used room service for a great club sandwich which was promptly delivered and breakfast this morning in the lounge was the right way to start the day. The location is outstanding in terms of access to some of Sydney's best shopping. Looking forward to the next few days.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_462595245~“Needs to Improve!!”~The building and its location across from the park is fantastic. this is central and close to malls and a walk to the opera house. The check in was efficient, but as a platinum member, it was disappointing that whilst no upgrade was possible, the even the allocated room did not have a great view! Not feeling the value of the platinum status with SPG at the moment!! The room was a reasonable size, but no coffee machine!! and just instant coffee sachets! The bathroom had a separate tub and old style shower. Very basic amenities and no shaving kit etc! Despite being a deluxe room, not a lot of extra creature comforts! The club lounge had great views, but a very limited choice at breakfast. The really BIG disappointment was the fact the hotel could not accommodate a late request for a breakfast box!! I returned to the hotel just before midnight after an evening out with colleagues and request a am wake-up call and breakfast box as I had a 6.30am flight. The hotel could not even manage a bottle of orange and a banana with less than 12 hours notice!! really - Is the 5* kitchen empty until the delivery van arrives at 6am? This was unacceptably poor and not what is expected from a 5* hotel. With such high expectations after seeing the hotel photos, the reality was very disappointing.~3~1~nan~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_462176536~“Dissapointing stay”~I believe check out time is 11am, being woken by housekeeping staff at 8am is not acceptable. Coming from someone in the industry, management needs to review their processes and procedures. Quite dissatisfied by this.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461904417~“Great Location”~I stayed here on two different weekends in Febrauary and had two different rooms, one facing the park the other not. Apart from the view there wasnt much between the rooms: both were clean and well furnished and both had great, BIG bathrooms. The hotel is ideally located beside Hyde Park and an easy walk across the park brings you to the Botanical Gardens and eventually the Opera House. Service was decent, though you feel its a hotel big with tour companies ( Japanese and Chinese), and at times check out was rammed and the lobby full of people waiting for their tour. The bar was...OK in a kitschy sort of way, but I couldn't see myself spending any real time there. The restaurant buffet had a cruise ship like queue to get in, and I assume was part of a tour package. I didn't eat there so have no comment on the food. There is a pool ( quite small) and gym on the top floor ( neither of which I used), but the view was nice overlooking the park The brekkie is a bit over priced so a tip would be to go to the cafe behind the station in Hyde park where I ate 4 out of 5 mornings. Great coffee and decent food served up with a cheerful smile. Sitting over coffee watching old Chinese guys play Giant Chess) was one of the highlights of every morning. All in all the Sheraton is decent hotel in a great location and if you get it at a good price , well worth it. I paid $300AUD a night which felt expensive.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_461593359~“Disturbed by Horrible Attitude and Manner from Staff”~I stayed there for celebrating my birthday,  flew all the way from Brisbane. We stayed in your hotel 17th February and I invited my two other friends to use the pool. When I got to the pool area, there was no one in the reception.  We just came in to the pool cause there was no one to indicate us and your rude staff Roger just stopped me without greeting and said "Did you 'guys' sign in?". I said no, as there was no one at the counter. He said "You need to sign in." I said yes and followed him.  He asked "Are you 'guys' all staying in the hotel?" I was being honest, said I invited two friends to the pool for celebrating of my birthday. Then he rolled his eyes once and said we cannot use the pool as my friends are not staying in the hotel. I told him that no one mentioned of this information. - Also I am a diamond tier for Hilton hotel and stayed several times in Four seasons, Park Hyatt, Sangri-la hotel and I didn't have any issue for this. Oh, also they didn't call me as guys either. -  I told him I want to talk with the manager then he SIGHED and ROLLED his eyes again in front of me. He called his manager Holly, my friend who actually works for Sangri-la for 10years had a chat with her, she was politely said that we can't use the pool, I already felt quite embarrassed in this experience so we went out.  Once I came out I tried to mention of her staff Roger, however Holly didn't even give me a chance to talk and kept going about the policy - said  1. "Sorry we can't let you in cause other guest might be disturbed" - hello, we are in our 30s. Does she even think that we don't have a public manner? And I am also the guest. 2. "We cannot actually go through all the policies with you when you check in, everything is on the website" - If other 5 stars hotels are okay with this blind spot of the policy, isn't that Sheraton's responsibility to explain us before we check in? I actually told her to stop cutting my word and let me finish my word first as she didn't even listen me to actually complain of Roger's attitude not that I was angry that I couldn't use a pool. No one wouldn't be happy someone sighing & rolling their eyes while you request information, after paying $500 per a night. Oh, I didn't mention that my hotel card room key wasn't working after upgrade the room so I waited for 20 minutes outside. It was just icing on the cake.  Holly asked my room number to cover herself for this complaint. However there was no apology or no follow ups. I strongly suggest re-educate and training Sheraton on the park Sydney staff for appropriate manner. You don't expect this service - being called GUYS and keeps cutting customers words - from 5 stars hotel staff.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461323770~“Pretty good. ”~We have stayed at the Sheraton a number of times before and it's been a good experience for the room and breakfast. Checking in and out is all good.  Cocktails in the bar is not as good as it could be. We are still looking for a good Sydney bar.  We recommend the Sheraton.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461316751~“Great stay”~The hotel was situated right across from Hyde Park, which is an excellent location. It was central to great food and bars, and key spots such as Circular Quay. The hotel itself was awesome - spacious room, really big bathroom, and great facilities on offer. I was impressed with the electric shutters (which I know sounds funny, but getting total darkness in a room at night is so good). The gym, pool, bars in the hotel were also fantastic.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_461316365~“Pretty Good Stay”~Hotel is not new but in an ok state of repair despite that. Check in was quick and easy and I received access to the club lounge as part of my platinum SPG membership. Actually making the booking was more difficult. I rang the hotel and was put through to reservations who told me that I could get a day rate which is exactly what I wanted. They said that they'd get someone from the hotel to call me back for the booking. This didn't happen so around 12 hours before I was due to land I had to call back. This time they couldn't guarantee a day room and I had to book the night before and make use of my platinum benefit if I wanted a guaranteed room. The communication wasn't great here but I must commend the lady I dealt with for being apologetic, polite and getting me sorted just before I was about to fly out. Room was big and comfortable for my sleep during the day after getting off an overnight flight. I had an evening flight to the airport and have always in this situation been able to avail the club lounge if I've had access to it after checking out until I need to leave for the airport. I asked if I could sit in the lounge after my spa treatments until it was time to go to the airport but was told it would not be possible. Although I wasn't entitled to this, it was a little disappointing, especially as I couldn't get a later spa treatment. The spa was very amenable and asked a therapist to work an hour later to fit me in which I thought was fantastic service. The treatments themselves were also of a high quality. Not cheap but also not the most expensive I've had internationally. There is a spa and steam room available for use - at least in the ladies' changing room. Club lounge - variety is a little on the poor side and afternoon in particular is just a few sweets but it's a pleasant environment. Service was patchy, I went around 20 minutes at afternoon tea time without seeing someone I could order tea from and had just about finished eating by the time I was able to order some. I seem to be missing my platinum welcome amenity points also. Overall not terrible but probably not as slick as they would like to be.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461100535~“Family getaway”~Stayed at Sheraton on the Park in a room overlooking Hyde Park. Room was big as we had a cot for our toddler. Beautiful bed, linen and pillows. Love the location as we could walk through Hyde Park and shopping just around the corner. I could not fault the Concierge staff who where always pleased to help. Breakfast buffet was ok.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461078153~“Location, Food, Comfort, Service -Its has it All”~I have stayed at the Sheraton on the Park many times over the last decade. It is my favourite hotel to stay at, especially for business but I also choose to stay here for personal visits to Sydney. One company I worked for polled their entire Australian/NZ employees as to the hotel they would prefer to have the company conferences at and Sheraton on the Park was over wheedlingly nominated as the choice!! The location is fabulous, on Elizabeth Street, opposite lovely Hyde Park. The Hotel is in the middle of the Shopping Precinct of one of the major world cities, so you will find all the major brands and goods at all price levels. Easy access to Pitt Street Mall, David Jones, Myers, Centrepoint Tower and the Queen Victoria Building. Also close by are a number of theatres if you are visiting too see a show. Sydney's fabulous Chinatown district is a short stroll and it's not too far to walk to Darling Harbour Precinct or even Opera House and Circular Quay but most will prefer to take a taxi to latter. The Staff at the Sheraton on the Park are one of the reasons this hotel is a great place to stay. All my interactions over the years have been positive. Service is always with a smile and not intrusive. The Hotel offers City sky-line views for the majority of it's rooms and for some of the standard studio rooms the reality is close view of another building. As a room tip; ask for a corner room over-looking Hyde Park. The beds are super comfy and rooms give you plenty of space to spread out and relax, even in the standard basic rooms. Bathrooms are roomy, and lots of cabinet space. The signature standout point of difference with the other top tier hotels in Sydney is the Sheraton on the Park food, especially in the first floor buffet style restaurant. Whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner you will find a Moorish, mouth-watering selection. In my humble opinion the breakfast and lunch selections are the best available of the top tier hotels in Sydney. The fresh Australia seafood bar is simply excellent. Transport access to the Hotel is easy; opposite is the St James Rail Station (underground), public bus stops nearby and carpark entrance is off Castlereigh Street which runs behind the front entrance, or just call into front foyer driveway off Elizabeth Street for valet parking service. This hotel is very popular with business community and International Stars, Guns & Roses stayed here on the 2017 Concert series in Sydney. On the first floor is a lovely cocktail bar and on a summer evening my favourite spot is to sit on the open balcony, enjoy an Old Fashion and watch the lights and people down in Hyde Park. One big tip; because this location is popular with business community, if you are travelling as a couple and looking for a romantic hotel stay then check on whether there are any big conferences' booked for period you are looking to stay. Reason I say this is that while Hotel easily handles the increased traffic, it makes the bar and restaurant areas very busy. Oh and by the way Sheraton is a lovely hotel to stay when travelling with someone special. I can highly recommend the Sheraton the Park.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460882663~“Disappointed ”~this is the Fourth time we stayed at this hotel this year . we are a creature of habit .location was convenient, the rooftop pool and the gym were above average and the rooms were comfortable . It stops there ! The front staff were not rude but robot like . I am not unsure if I continue to build my spg points using the Sheraton chain or explore other options if there is absolutely no special treatment given to repeat business customers . It is a pity that should someone have made a small gesture to make us feel welcome , I would have booked my work events . I will go back to the Four Seasons for my events and accomodation needs . The staff simply do not care as they know they will always sell their rooms with Sydney experiencing a shortage in hotel type accomodation . During our last stay, the staff hounded us non stop and threatened to charge us $50 extra per room for staying an extra half an hour while all along from the time of booking and the night before departure, another member of staff already agreed to the time extension . the fitness centre / pool staff ( a blond lady in particular ) was blatantly unpleasant. Nigel from the front desk was probably the only one who recognises the importance of treating your customers well Unfortunately the rest of the staff were either overworked, tired and unhappy as it shows in the way they receive their guest .~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
