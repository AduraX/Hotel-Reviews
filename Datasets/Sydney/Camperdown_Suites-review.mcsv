review_476560614~“Great reception help”~While visiting my very ill father in RPA I traveled from country victoria not knowing how long I needed to stay. I took a walk and found this motel. The young lady on the desk was so compassionate and helpful. She made my stay so welcoming and I was able to take time to relax during my break from the hospital. Thank you Pantai you are a gem. The room was quite well appointed and clean. Having crockery and cutlery and wine glasses was a real bonus.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_444015231~“Not too bad”~The beds were comfortable and the size of the room was average. The bathrooms were small but manageable. The room was quite clean. We had a sink, mini-fridge, toaster, microwave and a kettle pot. Our window faced the streets so we had to keep it closed as the sound of the cars were very loud at night. The room did have a weird smell when we kept our windows closed. The staff were very friendly and gave us suggestions and detailed information on where we should visit while in Sydney. The location of the hotel is good in that there are a few places to eat at nearby but right in front of the hotel is a bus stop. If you hop on the bus from there, it will take you directly to the downtown area for more food!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_442050979~“Great service, Good Value and Comfy”~We rented a room here recently for a few nights as I had to attend the Chris O'Brien Life House (within easy walking distance). We originally tried to get into the Adara rooms in Missenden Rd as they are in a quieter location but that site was full. The room we got was great. It was actually a wheel-chair friendly room (not that we needed it but the extra space was welcomed). The price was great (it seems you can get an even cheaper rate if you don't want the room serviced everyday, which we didn't know). The reception staff were great and very helpful, particularly with giving us a special rate for car parking (in Missenden rd). I'm a very light sleeper and personally found it a noisy spot (which I expected). The road noise doesn't worry my wife at all.It's a secure spot within walking distance of eateries, RPA and the Life House. They offer breakfast packages (which we didn't use). We didn't use the Wi-Fi as it seemed it a bit clunky.  Would I stay here again? Most definitely (but for me personally I'd probably try and get to the Missenden Rd site first).The customer service of this place was exceptional.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~5~nan
review_435201386~“A great place to stay - good access for travellers w. disability.”~A 2 month stay at Adara’s apartments - at 108 Parramatta Rd - in Camperdown proved convenient, very comfortable and reasonably priced.  A great location, with good public transport, for accessing the inner city. Surprisingly No traffic noise detected. Good range of quality coffee bars, cafes and restaurants nearby. Equally one can prepare own meals (good grocer on Missenden Rd). The Parramatta Rd team are awesome. Both front desk & service staff helpful with all requests for assistance/keen to make your stay as relaxing as possible. The accessible unit (no. 115) is well designed, and can be adapted to suit your access needs. Definitely recommend.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_124180547~“Avoid the Ground (First) Floor”~Stayed at the apartments for two nights mid week. My room was located on the first floor, which is actually the ground floor adjacent to the intersection of Parramatta Road and Lyons Road. This intersection is quite busy, especially at night with trucks, and is very noisy. The external noise problem is exacerbated by the internal noises of the plumbing (you can hear the toilets flushing on the second floor and when the showers are running) and the closing (slamming) of doors. It appears that the building was constructed for a commercial use but has been converted into aprtments. The rooms are nicely fitted out with all the mod cons, hwoiver the room is on the small side. The location is OK, with a 10 minute walk to the cosmopolitan Newtown high street. The cafe next door (Deus) is good for breakfasts.~3~3~3~1~3~4~3~nan
review_120829544~“It's the Tight Alternative”~This hotel is actually part of the Quest group and they sent me down here despite the fact I had a booking for the Missenden Rd Quest apartments. Parking is further down the road and outdoors, which is a concern in this area. There are 2 irons to service the entire building and these are kept in the first floor laundry which is open from 8am to 8 pm. There is no rooom in the laundry to use an ironing board. see photo and draw your own conclusions.~2~nan~2~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_120479583~“Great location, modern and comfortable”~These apartments are very close to Sydney University and RPA. The staff are friendly, the suites really comfortable. The lift was fast and quiet. The plates, cups etc were absolute minimum level. There is some traffic noise. They are really easy to get to using the bus (stops across the road on arrival) and train from the airport. City buses stop right next door very frequently and you can even buy tickets next door! Great cafe across the road. Individual airconditioner unit means that you can choose the temp level. Can walk to Annandale shops, cafes, postoffice, bookshop etc.~4~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_116727600~“Decent place for short term stays”~We were looking for a serviced apartment with a kitchenette to stay in Sydney for a week without paying too much. The booking was quick and easy via the internet and queries were answered promptly. The apartment was a little tight in terms of space but they had managed to fit in a microwave, fridge, sink, tv , working table, 2 chairs. Place was clean and spotless when we arrived and there were basic amenities provided as well.  We liked the location but this is if you want to be near University of Sydney or Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Having said that, trips to the city by bus is only approximately 10 minutes away and you are 20 minutes drive away from the airport. There are many buses that goes to the city so waiting time is pretty short. Our main grouse of the place was the servicing of the apartment. We stayed for 1 week and we had the apartment serviced 3 times, which would have been fine if the job was well done. Unfortunately it was not. Bed linen was not changed and in fact remain clearly untouched throughout. The entire bed area was not cleaned at all with dust collecting on the tables and furniture and carpets. (the main road next to us is pretty busy so it gets dusty). Toilets were hastily cleaned - very obviously a spray down cleaning without getting rid of any dirt. Amenities were not topped up unless called for (they do bring these things up pretty quickly though once you call for it). For those traveling with kids or folks who have sensitive airways or allergies, the level of servicing of the rooms may be an issue. Otherwise, the place itself is secure, pleasant and provides Wi-Fi (payable) as well as free common laundry facilities.~3~3~nan~4~nan~2~3~nan
review_115305686~“Look no further, surprise find, book today”~If you are looking for good value, clean, modern, friendly and convenient to city, shops restaurants and for me the RPA, then look no further than Camperdown Suites. I stayed part,/s my husband for over one week whilst I was in hospital. Camperdown suites are run really well by the Manager and all the staff. They are friendly and accomodating to everyones needs. Bus outside, internet next door by the hour and in rooms. close to city and RPA. Deus cafe/restaurant at side and just the best Thailand restaurant take away or sit down behind. The family that run it are so lovely and make great meals, great value and make the best herbal teas. Parking is at a small charge close behind and secure. They are on a busy and noisy road yet you would not think so when inside. Very clever design & colours with internal water feature open to the sky & some suites makes for a very relaxing and fresh sound and feel great to recoup after operation as myself. The rooms are very clean and modern. with LCD and comfortable bed and great strong shower. Kitchenette is good and colours all match to give a warm feel. At night very secure as security doors into the foyer and secure doors to each hall and level aswell. They supply free washing machines and dryers and irons which was great to not to have to go home to wash instead all done before. Thank you Camperdown suites. We would definately stay again without hesitation. Note we stayed in one a double room 116 and we were more than happy, so it can only get better with a queen or king ect. Do not bother to search for other accomodation as this place is a surprise package. They can organize breakfast if needed ect. But supermarkets close by anyway. Can hear doors shutting but that is in any hotel. Overall :Excellent value.~5~5~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
