review_459464630~“Fantastic location, reasonably priced and very comfortable”~My husband, son and I stayed in a studio room which included two large queen beds and a kitchenette. The bathroom was very large although no bath - if that is an issue for you. The whole suite was very large. My son's words on opening the door was "Wow! It's massive!" We loved everything about this hotel. The room itself was spotless, luxurious and spacious .The kitchenette was handy. Our family enjoyed the pool and had breakfast included which was a large selection and plentiful. The position is superb. It is one street to cross and you are in Darling Harbour. Transport, shopping and entertainment options are at the door. It was easy to walk and catch the train to Sydney airport . The staff were friendly and helpful. We thought it a nice touch that the hotel provided iced water and fresh fruit at the lift in the lobby to take up to the room after you have returned from your day sight seeing. We will stay in this hotel again on our next trip to Sydney.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_478445544~“Terrible Street Noise”~Room was very nice as expected until we tried to sleep no double glazing in a city hotel the noise was unbearable we were moved for our second night after complaining to a very quiet comfortable room the staff must be aware that the rooms facing the street are just too noisy. The hotel should address the lack of double glazing would never stay again such a shame as the rooms and location are perfect.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478314086~“Comfortable mid-city option”~Hire-car and taxi drivers hate it because you can't stop outside, but there's much to recommend this place.

review_478042750~“Great hotel (location) and staff”~I was impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel. The front desk staff especially Jason was exceptional and quite knowledgeable. Great location.

review_477409955~“Great Studio with balcony- location pretty good- Staff Wonderful- No lunch/dinner but Brekkie Terrific”~We booked this via Qantas site, which the hotel wasn't aware of (I get that- it only comes through their system as being booked by an agency). However, the requests we put in (balcony) did make it through and were accommodated, which was excellent. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean and pretty well maintained. The bathroom sink faucet had a drip issue with the cold water tap (which we reported the day we were checking out so they were aware) but it didn't make a noise so it wasn't an issue. The hot water was a bit tricky--- took a few tries to figure out how to adjust it. The bathroom was huge and had a great make up mirror/vanity separate from the sink so we could both be in the room getting ready without getting in each others way. The bed was so-so... I wouldn't say it was too hard or too soft, but just not the highest quality. Then again, it was heaps better than what we had the week prior, so maybe it was our backs protesting another change from what is 'normal' - LOL. The hotel does not have a full service kitchen/restaurant- they only serve breakfast (or as the Australians say- Brekkie). This breakfast buffet scores a 150% out of 100% for me as they had the most delicious cooked mushrooms every morning- something I have been on a craving kick. They will cook to order your eggs if you don't want the buffet scramble, and have either waffles or pancakes (I didn't partake), 3 kinds of brekkie meats which changed daily. (I counted 5 hot item chaffing dishes).They have a toaster with 3 choices of breads, pastries, cereals, fruit, meat, cheese, yoghurts, a coffee machine with choices (including cappuccino or cocoa) . This was a filling start of the day that was included in our room rate (by our choice- you can chose rates without it, but it was a better deal to pay the extra $20 as I think the buffet cost is $25 per person). Our studio was very roomy and had a mini fridge, plates and utensils, a billy (tea kettle) and a French coffee press with coffee, tea and sugar/cream provided (though we could have used more in the cream- that's just us) It also has a 2 burner range and cookware provided if you as (we didn't use this but if you are staying longer, there is a Coles supermarket 2 blocks away where you can buy food and cook it yourself to save money.... no microwave, though)The front desk staff were also very helpful in arranging a car for our trip back to the airport for only $55 (which is about $20 more than the train, but with our extra bags, we decided it was better since we did the train to the hotel and got turned around coming out of the station and figured a morning uphill walk for 15 minutes to the station with one bag that might decide to break again was not worth the cost savings). Would stay here again for sure!~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_477226294~“Vacation ”~Room was spacious but needs updating. Front desk was helpful but busy - really need a concierge to help guests with excursions and carrying luggage .

review_477075103~“Awesome location, nice hotel”~Great location right in the city, a stones throw from China Town and Darling Harbour. Service was fantastic (they made a country girl feel comfortable in the city), parking was convenient and reasonably priced and breakfast at the hotel restaurant was delicious. The suite I was in was very comfortable and extremely roomy and the pool & gym area was nice and easy to find. I will definitely go back and stay next time I'm in Sydney~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477325936~“Relaxing Family Stay”~Excellent service and a great location. We were able to walk to so many sites that we wanted to see. The Museum, China Town, Darling Harbour were so easy to get to. The breakfast was nice. The pool facility was lovely. The staff were very accomodating. Value for money was excellent considering the location and the standards of the room. We had our 6 and 5 year old sons with us and they loved it.~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_476976384~“Situated in a great location, staff is friendly however no characteristic in this hotel”~Stayed here for 3 nights, liked the location and staff were friendly however I couldn't find it a modern and appealing property for a 4.5 star level. Their lobby (guest waiting area) beside the reception looked so funny to me, you cant tell its a lobby of a 4.5 star hotel.  After a long tiring first day in Sydney we returned to hotel and found that the SPA/Swimming pool is broken and cant be fixed due to public holiday (Yes! imagine a 4.5 star hotel giving excuse of public holiday).  Since we did not have a bath tub in our room we asked if we can shift to a room with a bath tub, glad that we were upgraded for business class room for next day.  We appreciate this gesture however even business class rooms did not look appealing to me as compare to other above 4 star hotels I have stayed in.  The bathroom looks just above average of their business class room. We also had issues with running out of hot water and when we phoned the reception about it they advised us to wait for few minutes and it should get hot. It was a mission to wait for a full hot water shower.  Anyway, the hotel is just above average I would give it around of 3.5 - 4 star.  I understand Sydney is an expensive city and finding luxury hotels in budget can be a daunting task.  cheers~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_476289400~“Just lovely Xx”~We recently stayed at these suites. They were perfect clean, newly refurbished, large verandah, and the proximity was in the heart of the city. It was great value for money as well. We had booked a business class suite and breakfast is included in this price. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, the most comfortable we have experienced in a long time. The pool area was simply gorgeous, which quite surprised me. I would stay at this hotel again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_474947346~“Nice Hotel - Walking Location of Loads of Things to Do”~Stayed here on our honeymoon. Only after leaving Sydney we realised how good hotel was. Breakfast was good - staff extremely helpful on morning of our leaving (we were leaving early) We could walk to any location in Sydney due to a decent location and its near Townhall station. Room was nice and had a decent nights sleep. However AirCon was a little noisy even after been switched off. Would recommend to any couple who want to stay in Sydney. Try book a room with a breakfast plan - wont be disappointed~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474874749~“Couples weekend”~The location of this hotel makes it the perfect place to stay in Sydney as it is within walking distance to most places. We arrived just after 9.30 am and asked if we could leave our bags until check in and were told that our room was ready and we could go straight up. That was fantastic. Reception staff and all staff were friendly and always greeted you. Room was lovely and large and clean and was serviced daily. The kitchenette with crockery and cutlery is great if like us, you take your own breakfast. Bed was huge and very comfortable. The only downside was traffic noise and ear plugs and valarian stopped that. Would stay there again.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_473947445~“Great location in Sydney!”~We are in adult family of four who stayed in a two bedroom suite. The sweet included a living room and full kitchen. The rooms were clean, the location was perfect, staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We did not have breakfast because the $25 per person x four people made it prohibitively expensive. It would've been nice if they had offered a package, like so many other hotels dead, including the breakfast at half price. By American standards, this would be about a 3 to 3 1/2 star hotel. Comfortable but not lush.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_473336761~“Near Darling Harbour, nice big room.”~My partner and I stayed here for 1 night recently. In a good spot if you want to be near Darling Harbour, but a bit of a walk to the city shops, the harbour and the botanic gardens. The staff were friendly and helpful, check in was very smooth. Our room was quite large with a separate bedroom, bathroom, lounge area and small kitchen. The bed was very comfortable. We have stayed at the Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel in the city many times and much prefer that hotel to this one.(no room available for the night we stayed in SYdney) The Radisson Hotel and Suites was not quite up to the standard of their other hotel and the area not so good.(A bit shabby) The shower curtain was dirty /mouldy around the bottom and needed replacing.and there wasnt anywhere in the hotel to get a coffee or snack (only breakfast in the morning)We actually left in the morning and had breakfast somewhere else. Good hotel for a family as the rooms are quite large but would only ever stay at the Radisson Blu in the other part of Sydney in future.~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_472271683~“Fantastic staff”~I am a Radisson regular but never at this location. I booked 3 rooms for a family wedding and picked this Radisson for price,location and the large rooms..really a suite in most cases. Yes the hotel needs a refresh, but everything is clean and well run. We had a 2 year old in our group and he was made to feel as welcome as any of us. The front desk people were amazing..nothing was too much trouble. We had a very early start(4.30 am). They preorganised a Mercedes van for us at a very acceptable price to take us to the airport. It was raining heavily when it came to departure time so one of the front desk young men gave us 3 umbrellas, escorted us to the van to keep us dry, and then returned to the hotel. This is what makes a difference..we will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

This was our first time in Sydney and not being familiar decided to go with a trusted brand for my hotel - this has proven to be a mistake. There are many boutique hotels in the city that offer far better product and value.~2~2~4~4~2~2~2~nan

review_467279635~“Consider It”~Book early on Radisson website for best rates. Email the property for early check in and for private driver pick up at airport or cruise ports, pricey but worth it. Local taxi's take advantage of tourists. Hotel location is in Darling Harbor near to China Town, city malls, hop on bus, harbor tours, official tourism office, local restaurants. Reasonable rates, good front desk. Large rooms and shower tub/combo, kitchenette & balcony. Good hotel choice that is more business class than tourist or romantic location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467172763~“Great weekend atay”~We had a great family trip to Sydney and the apartment we stayed at suited us perfectly. The lounge was spacious. The kitchen was decent although we did not cook but used the fridge and cutlery/crockery. The bed was very comfortable. It was a bit loud at night but then again we knew we were staying in CBD and it would be loud on a weekend. We stayed on the business executive level (level 3) and buffet breakfast was included which was fantastic. Really could not fault the breakfast and the staff were very attentive and friendly. They also had a high chair! The reception desk staff were equally very friendly and accommodating. The room could do with a facelift to the bathroom (new bathtub and sink would be nice). Laundry would also be nice to have specially if staying longer than a couple of nights. There was a storage room in our bedroom suite which could easily fit laundry.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and particularly found it convenient as only a few blocks from the Museum train station where we could catch the train to/from the airport or to Circular Quay.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466597674~“Great location, room needed a little love”~Booked a 2 bedroom suite for family of 6. Location of the hotel is great if you want to head into Chinatown or darling harbour, it was super convenient to walk to everything.  Room was spacious and had all the facilities that you would need like a kitchenette, 2 bathrooms and massive wardrobes.  Kitchen only had microwave, and 2 burner stovetop but has no cooking equipment. Which was strange. I think you need to ask for it.  The room itself was ok but it is a bit dated. Things like a couple of busted power points, walls were a bit grubby, and the tv reception was poor and froze several times whilst watching movies. Aircon was super noisy and didn't seem to get cool even though it was set to 19 degrees.  Pool is nice. Spa out of order. Breakfast was good and had plenty of variety.  No view from suite. We did have a courtyard with outdoor table and chairs.  Valet Parking for hotel is around the corner and it was expensive but I guess that's what you pay for city prices. Had to wait about half and hour on the side of the road for them to bring car out to us when leaving.  It was one of the cheaper hotels we found trying to book for a large family @ $600 + per night incl breakfast and parking.  Overall ok but leaning more towards average just for what we paid.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466448408~“Too busy to help,,,,”~My husband and I stayed at the Radisson, Liverpool St, for two nights, Fri-Sat, to attend the wonderful Adele concert in Sydney. We sucked up the $375 a night because it was a special occasion. However, we purchased a King Bed suite but it only had a Queen bed. The room wasn't serviced "because they were too busy and ran out of time" so, despite the hotel being full, they didn't have sufficient staff on roster. Then on checkout, there was one poor guy with approximately 10 couples waiting to check out and retrieve their cars from the other guy on the desk. While trying to check out people, he also had to answer phone calls for reservations! We wanted to pack our gear into our car (we used their valet service) and have breakfast before getting our car, but they couldn't arrange it, despite saying we could access our car anytime, because "they were too busy." The staff were courteous but obviously their management were totally incompetent or too tight to arrange sufficient staff. I'd steer clear of this hotel, it certainly wasn't worth the money.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
review_466401767~“Many good memories for my wife and I”~The quality of the room was fantastic. I was really fond of the breakfast buffet. it had all kind of delicious gourmets. the quality of spa and pool was perfect but the size of the pool was so small. there are 2-3 treadmills for who likes o do running in the gym. location is fantastic and if you walk from the hotel to sandy opera house it takes only 40 minutes. Besides this hotel is close to Sydney tower house, Pitt street, Cruiser boats Anzac memorial and Darling Harbor. I stayed one week in this hotel and visited everywhere in CBD without need to pay for the shuttle tourist bus.Inside the hotel was very calm and relaxing and I really enjoyed. Besides the bar served an amazing tequila for me which I really liked it. unfortunately, the view of our room was not good and our room was exactly in front of a skyscraper.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_465961702~“Great value for money, nice hotel”~Hotel is centrally located easy to access from train or by foot. No car stop in front of the hotel makes it more complicated to load and unload bags. Hotel suite was big, clean, but little dated and will need little touch (etc. kitchen counter top had chip size of AUD 50c) Bed is like heaven on earth. Firm mattress and loads of pillows makes you fall asleep instantly.  Amenities in room and bathroom are pretty standard for business hotel and I wouldn't change it.  Internet was first day slow and hard to access, however when we mentioned this, hotel called provider and fixed the issue. And worked well till last day.  Each day we suppose to have turn down service, which hasn't happened, but we didn't mind.  Staff members at the hotel are very friendly, especially I would like to mention Rohit at reception desk, he remembers your name, room and creates very friendly atmosphere. Something very hard to find these days the housekeeping staff are friendly and they greet you on corridor, give you genuine smile and if you ask for extra coffee they bring you 15nespresso capsules, just what you need if you love coffee ;-)  Overall experience I would rate 4* but staff at the hotel are 5* even more.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464512108~“A very convenient hotel, good service and amazing location”~I am a frequent visitor to Sydney and this hotel was more affordable than others where I had stayed before; I stayed here twice in February. The location is fantastic, in the middle of CBD and you can walk to the harbor. Staff is very friendly and both times they upgraded me. The second time they gave me a huge suite, almost like a full size apartment. The rooms/suites had a full kitchen and everything was convenient. I am giving it 4 stars because they could've done a better job vacuuming the floors; I found things here and there and I think that the cleaning was a bit superficial. This shouldn't be the case for a hotel in this category. Wifi was choppy sometimes. But nevertheless, it was a good experience and I would return next time.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

I especially liked that the cleaner didn't move my stuff. Not being able to find things where I left them is a pet peave so seeing it all in place was very soothing!  One minor gripe is that there are few available plug sockets for laptops and phones, but I managed okay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464159383~“Lovely room”~Room was great - bed was comfortable and the pillows fluffy. Small balcony and sitting room and kitchenette were great. Bathroom was lovely as were the bathrobes. The views from the room were less than impressive, but they didn't detract from the room itself.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_463658254~“Generally very good except for the availability of adaptor”~Hotel location is very good as it is very accessible to shopping area and restaurants. Spacious and clean rooms.Colin and Rohit were very friendly, jovial, and helpful. Two others were not as helpful - Kamrul, who I got to know was a casual helping out during weekends, and Gulshan. My family of 6 booked two rooms for 8 days/7nights and there were 3 occupants in each room (we added rollaway bed). We requested for 2 adaptors (1 for each room) but Kamrul said only 1 adaptor will be given for everyone to share. We explained the need for another adaptor since we booked two rooms but Kamrul told us to just buy one from the convenience store across the hotel. He even said the cost of the adaptor is very minor since we will be using it for 7 nights. We had to call and request again before second adaptor was finally lent to us.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_463590511~“Great Location”~Accomodation was above average but not quite at the very good standard. Location excellent for china town, darling harbour & pitt street. pool area nice. front desk friendly.  We were a large group that travelled & disappointed that 2 bedroom room configuration could not be changed despite numerous requests, 1 couple had to have single beds during their stay,  whilst accomodation was fine & location fantastic, would i stay there again, probably not.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458857127~“Over priced for the room.”~Maybe there was something on in Sydney as rooms were at a premium. The room cost was exorbitant for what I would see as a 3-4 star hotel. The staff were good and attentive. We ate down the road for breakfast which was lovely. Depending on where you need to be in town check out other options.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458339382~“Nice hotel”~Nice hotel in a good location. Very clean. Good staff. Rooms were a good size. Nice simple but very adequate buffet breakfast. Room was quiet but was a number of floors up. Probably more for business or overseas tourists rather than families but that in no way detracts from the place or to say families wouldn't be comfortable here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
