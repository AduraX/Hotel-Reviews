review_458600136~“Forest Lodge”~Bar staff are friendly & pleasant. Although could do with new carpets or tiled flooring & an all over re-furb to make it feel cleaner.  I stayed in the 'Hotel'. It's student accommodation NOT a hotel in any way at all. It's got 20 rooms. Compared to the room I'm staying in, I couldn't comment on other rooms. Overall, it needs a massive deep clean. Clean carpets, or even if them & the sofas are steam cleaned. The kitchen isn't cleaned regularly by residents (my roommate & I always make sure we're clean) neither is the bathrooms, I can only comment on the females bathrooms obviously. Dust piles in the corners of the toilet cubicle in the one female bathroom & the other female bathroom, smells (without being remotely awful) like an old peoples home. The manager is rarely seen. In the month I've been here, I've only seen him a few times. I don't even know what his name is.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429916403~“Great bar food”~We visited for dinner on a Monday evening. The pub was busy but we got a table easily. We ordered fish and chips and a rump steak ( from the special offer menu). The food was well priced and the steak in particular was lovely! The bar staff were friendly and efficient.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_290328448~“Always great”~Always excellent. The beers on tap are always changing and delicious but if your unsure the bar staff will willingly help you out. The food is cheap and delightful and the atmosphere is fun. Highly recommended. we did have one incident with salted donuts instead of sugared, but we all had a pleasant laugh and moved on! Highly recommend the chicken bun stuffer or the burgers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_246435078~“Good stay”~I found this gem on agoda whilst looking for a well priced apartment in central Sydney. The rooms are great， they have good facilities and the staff always go out of their way to help. I never usually have breakfast buffets either but this one was one of the better ones i have seen. I have been here twice now and have been impressed both times.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_66511834~“Great location, but still a poor hotel”~I stayed at Forest Lodge Hotel for almost 4 months.  The rooms are all small, but some is smaller than others. They all cost the same, so you need some luck to get the best out of these lodge. I stayed in room number 3 which alongside with room number 2, 4 and 5 is the smallest.  You are supposed to clean the room before leaving. Well it seems that no one had done in years... Very dusty and the fridge was disgusting. We complained to the company we were renting the room of - The Furnished Property Group without luck. They were not very helpful.  You share showers and toilets with all the others of your sex in the hotel. The showers and toilets are supposed to be cleaned regularly by the "boss" living here - but they clearly had not been for a long time and were not cleaned once the 4 months i lived there! There is a kitchen and a living room in the hotel. You are sharing this with the others as well. The kitchen is not clean, neither the living room (which has disgusting green colored walls). There is a PC there, but it's full of viruses and is extremely slow. The TV tho is working good and has lots of channels.  The location of the lodge is great. 3 min to the university, 3 min to bus stop were buses going to the city is going all the time, and 10 min to Broadway shopping center that offers whatever you might need.  There is several nice cafes and restaurants in the area. Glee Pint Road is 5 mins walking from the hotel, and has lots of fine asian food.  I had fun staying at the hotel, but its really disgusting that it is dirty all over.  There is clearly better lodges in Sydney, but Forest Lodge will be OK especially if you are only staying for a few weeks. The price per week is about 190 AUD. I think u have to stay at least 4 weeks.~2~2~4~2~1~1~2~nan
