review_474997337~“We stayed here for 3 nights, great location, really nice area, great Market on Saturday, Good transport links”~Myself and my son spent 3 nights here before returning to Manchester after a month visiting Family in Melbourne and Hamilton Island.Located in Paddington ( nice area) on Oxford Road. The reception staff very helpful you get a 10% discount on any food or drink that you buy next door. Tried the food very good at a reasonable price. The room was more than adequate with a view over the internal garden. Beds very comfortable, had no problem going to sleep. The bus stop is just 100 yards away which takes you down to Circular quay, ypou can also get the bus to Bondi Beach on the other side of the road.The area has some lovely original town houses which have been lovingly restored.Its well worth a walk around the side streets.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470396070~“I'll be back”~Booked at the last minute, to make a family visit, this family owned & run place is a gem. Every room has an art theme including original works of art instead of the bland corporate non-art of chain hotels. All rooms feature original art works, fancier room get bigger art works.  Despite being in the cheapest category of room, I had a balcony overlooking Oxford Street in the foreground and the harbour in the distance. Rooms 301-305 on top floor get views over the buildings opposite, out towards the harbour (the water, not the bridge). The annual Sydney Mardi Gras processes up Oxford Street, but turns away before the Arts Hotel, so instead of a birds-eye view, visitors get an opportunity for rest.  The Arts Hotel has lovely garden & pool, where the noise of the city is almost inaudible. There is no hotel bar or dining room, but patrons get a discount at the Artslife cafe/bar of hotel next door. The nearby Arthouse Kitchen (next to the NSW Art School - hence the area arty theme) is good for breakfast. There are numerous cafes & bars very close, as well as the Verona Arthouse cinema and many clubs.  The rooms are clean; even the bathroom grouting was bleached during my stay. There can be a little noise from room to room, but no more than any other hotel and far less than recent builds with thin partitions.  When I next visit Sydney I will book here again. It is within walking distance of many of Sydney's attractions, and not far from Museum railway station. Several bus routes travel up Oxford Street or pass close by.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467934916~“Bit tired and disappointing ”~Reasonably well located: Paddington is a lovely area with very nice shops and cafes, good for breakfast. On a main road with direct bus routes into the city centre and out to Bondi. A short walk to Surry Hills, and a long walk to the city centre and Circular Quay but better to use the bus or a taxi. Views from rooms nothing special.  The hotel itself felt like a tired Travelodge. The public areas were cramped and sorely in need of refurbishment and really let the place down. Our room seemed to have been done up more recently and wasn't too bad, but was really poky. (We were apparently upgraded due to the works on the restaurant, but the room was small and pretty basic). Very small bathroom with a shower only. Had to ask for more than one towel each, although the reception quickly sorted that out. Nowhere for towels to dry though. Nice complimentary toiletries.  Didn't try out the pool, in a courtyard outside without much direct sun. Restaurant being refurbished while we were there. Breakfast not included but really good places for brunch nearby (try Ampersand across the road). There's a pub next door with reductions for guests. Communal laundry in the garage area downstairs, but only one machine and two tumbles, all coin operated and a bit pricey and shared with the hotel laundry.  Staff were fine, usually helpful, bit laissez faire. Overall, this place is nothing special and could really do with an overhaul, although even then the architecture feels very "motel". Well located and no problem with the staff.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462145597~“Great location but very modest property ”~The location of this property is very good but the place itself is very modest. I would call it a city motel not hotel. Room very small, bed and inbuilt desk in room 109 takes up 3/4 of the room, bathroom tiny. No face washers, breakfast not available on site and no room service. But room was clean and linen good. I'm not a tall person but the bed seemed very short, though plenty wide enough. Parking spaces limited and you can't reserve a space in advance which was a big worry for me but luckily I got one.  You get what you pay for and if you don't have a car and want a modest place to crash in a good Sydney location, then this would suit.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460561996~“Great spot for St Vincents visits but quite modest rooms”~I stayed for 2 nights in an entry level room on the second floor at the back of the hotel Pros Very handy to St Vincents Friendly, understanding staff Comfy bed Very quiet room Cons Fairly basic room , but fine for a place to rest your head and have a shower A bit overpriced~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_458551583~“Excellent Location for St Vincent's Hospital”~We stayed 8 nights in a room away from busy Oxford Street and found it quiet and beds comfortable. St Vincent's is only a short walk away, so easily accessible if you have to be at St Vincent's for appointments or to be admitted.  There is plenty to do around the area. Verona Cinema Bar for a movie, Berkelouw Books and cafe for books, books and more books and the Art Bar, the hotel next door to the Arts Hotel, a quiet place to have a meal and a wine after a long day. These are all in the same block as the Art Hotel!  Bus to anywhere from Oxford Street: eg: Bondi Junction, Bondi Beach, Watsons Bay, the City or Circular Quay, to name just a few.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_458544668~“Great location, friendly staff”~We picked Arts Hotel for the price and location and it was perfect for that. Compact rooms, everything clean and tidy.

review_456951291~“Great value for price.”~It might not be 5 star hotel but had great location and nice room. I would stay here when return to Sydney. Pool area was very nice on second floor. Close to gay area and public transport. Love all the local coffee shops.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453653172~“Great compact motel with fabulous location!”~I stayed here with my daughter for a cricket match at the SCG. Perfect location! Easy walking distance to SCG and Allianz, 10 minutes. Restaurant's up the road and cafes next door. Rooms are small but very clean and tidy and have everything you need for a short stay. Reception is there 24hours for when you come back a little late at night. I understand there is breakfast at the motel although we did not use this. Fabulous motel.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_451838777~“Clean, basic and central”~This is a basic hotel ideal for the short trips to Sydney near the SCG. Easy walking distance to the CBD. Bus at door. Reception can give you a discount voucher for the pub next door. Rooms reasonable size. Double bed, separate shower and toilet, windows on one wall, safe in room, small bar fridge, tea and coffee making facilities. Plenty of cafes close by. Great, helpful staff. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445989384~“Football weekend”~Found this gem of a hotel within walking distance of SCG for the Sydney Swans games. Clean rooms, friendly staff and lovely courtyard garden.

review_441311134~“A pleasant small hotel.”~Conveniently located in Paddington a rather trendy and historical part of Sydney.Buses pass the door for easy access to the city, about 10 mins. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and breakfast is available in the dining room. We only stayed for 2 nights in transit to Singapore so was adequate for our needs. However the rooms are quite small with rather dated decor and furnishings.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_440745399~“top location”~The hotel is in an excellent location with bus right outside for trips to the city and Sydney beaches plus walking distance to the Paddington markets and Hordern pavillion. Rooms are fairly basic but given we spent minimal time in the rooms the facilities including fridge, kettle, tea and coffee plus fee muffins were more than adequate. The pool and surrounds were quite clean and refreshing particularly on a hot afternoon. Staff were very friendly and helpful with places to dine. Parking can be a bit hit and miss but our experience in scoring free parking for 2 nights was a big plus~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_439181688~“Fab hotel and staff.”~I stayed at this hotel in mid-November and was really impressed. The hotel is situated in a central location and even though there is a bus stop right outside the hotel which would take you into the city, you could probably walk into the city centre with ease.  The room itself was very basic, however it had everything that I needed to get by and I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a base to stay in, but want to explore the city.  I really wanted to leave a good review though because the staff are amazing, they really helped me during my stay there. I came over from the UK and because my flight came into Sydney early in the morning, I was worried that I would not be able to check in to my hotel. Whilst they did tell me this would normally be the case, they would try everything to get me to check-in earlier than normal, and they did. I was extremely thankful as I was so tired after my long 21 hour flight. I would say this hotel is suitable to everyone, but even though it does lack certain things which would make it a 5 star hotel, it is definitely worth a look and like I mentioned earlier, it would make for a fantastic base if you are a keen traveler like me. Thank you so much to all of the staff at Arts Hotel for making my stay so enjoyable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438784447~“Holiday ”~Nice quiet hotel, room was comfortable. friendly staff. Enjoyed the continental breakfast for a small charge. Like the idea of the complimentary cakes for guests. Near bus routes as a good 15 minutes walking distance from Sydney central.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437167389~“Excellent :D”~We visited Sydney and Australia for the first time this year and the Arts hotel was a fantastic base for our visit.  Mark, was a tremendous help and managed to get us checked in early due to our early arrival from the UK. He also recommended some excellent things to do not only in the city centre but also in the local area of Paddington which we loved.  Would definitely recommend this hotel to others looking for a base in a trendy part of town.  Thanks again to the Arts hotel - we will definitely visit again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_421343987~“Don't bother!”~Booked this for my partner and young son as it was close to stadium for an event and it had parking......WRONG no parking what hotel does not have enough spaces for rooms its ridiculous had I been warned of this when booking I would have paid upfront for the parking to ensure they had a spot not having to drive around and pay ridiculous fees more than the room itself for parking what a JOKE!!!~1~1~nan~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_419628000~“Parking nightmare ”~Our overnight stay here was fine. But do not rely on parking. We had the most horrific luck with parking here. Ended up paying $117 for overnight at the hospital. A cheap stay turned into a very expensive one.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418665998~“Great location & price, wonderful staff”~My original 1 week stay morphed into 2 at this great hotel. All of the staff I encountered were professional and friendly and went out of their way to help and answer any questions I had. The room was a good size for me and always very clean. Add in a lovely little courtyard, it's own laundry, being so close to public transport, restaurants and cafes and you have a great hotel, in my opinion. Is it brand new, no, but it really is reasonably priced considering where it is!! Would definitely stay here again!!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_411204358~“Rather dated small rooms staff exceptional”~I stayed for a week whilst my husband was in St Vincent's for heart surgery. The lift was very scary so I used the stairs for the majority. Did not worry me. I could not fault the staff always helpful & obliging. Price was reasonable & bed comfortable. My room overlooked Oxford St but was reasonably quiet. Hotel next door had great meals & the staff there were just as great as in the accommodation area. Perhaps not really big enough rooms for family but I enjoyed my stay would stay again if I needed close proximity to the hospital~3~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_410916432~“Great location BUT room/mattress/hair dryer VERY DATED”~I booked this hotel via Qantas Holidays and was thoroughly disappointed that my room did not resemble those featured on the website. Mattress was sagging and was probably 15-20 years old;  Hair dryer was dated and didn't work efficiently; Rips in carpet had me tripping over The dirt on the windows and the fridge nearly made me vomit.

review_405880320~“great hotel, tricky address”~Me and my smoking friend wanted a double room with two beds and a balcony during our visit in Sydney. Turned out to be difficult until we found the Arts Hotel. Even then we could not book a room with these requirements online, but could do so by calling to the hotel. We had a fantastic stay: friendly staff, tasteful décor, small room but with everything we needed, and perfect location close to several bus lines in a neighbourhood with lots of lively restaurants and bars.  Only tricky thing was the address: Be aware that there are three locations in Sydney with the street address 21 Oxford Street, just in three different neighbourhoods along the same Oxford Street. This one is in Paddington, in the middle of the very long street.~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_385867800~“A Well Appointed Hotel”~Our third story room had been totally renovated from the rain shower head to new very comfortable beds. We chose this hotel in downtown 'Old Sydney' from reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. The front desk was staffed with welcoming personnel.

review_385402513~“Easy to walk by, but do not be fooled this is a great place to stay.”~Stayed for 3 nights and apart from a bit of wind rustling the trees against the window enjoyed the experience. This place is not for those expecting the Hilton at basement prices, this is for the smart ones amongst you who know a good deal when they see it. Close to everything with transport links just a step away (literally). The staff are very friendly and nothing it seems is too much trouble. Importantly the rooms, including the ensuite are very clean, which I consider important. I had a garden room on the second floor and there was no traffic noise from busy Oxford Street, having a standard room facing Oxford Street may be different. Sure the rooms are not overly spacious, but for a place to rest or sleep between outings they are totally acceptable. Highly recommended. There are plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance with the Paddington RSL just up the road. Oh the free WiFi was great!~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_383297336~“An old fashioned beauty!”~We've stayed at the Arts Hotel 3 times and been very happy with them each time. It has the feel of a small family run business.

It was convenient for me to see my specialist at St Vincent's clinic and although it took a long time, I was able to leave my car there and get free parking for the duration of my doctor's visit. I had already checked out at 10am on 26th May but my appointment was at 1pm yet the staff were just awesome. The room was clean and quiet as well. I had a restful sleep before my appointment the next day. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone in future.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380418461~“Hang on, that was good AND affordable!”~I've been testing out hotels close to Sydney CBD and this hotel rates highly in my experience. The building is close to everything with about half the rooms facing busy Oxford street and the remaining facing into quaint Paddington back streets, forming four sides around a courtyard with pool. It feels homely yet elegant, with many little unassuming touches like a good tea selection and original paintings. It has undercover parking (first come, first served though so I recommend an early check in to be sure of a spot) and is two doors away from the delightful Berkelouw Books Cafe. If you are coming to Sydney and need a spot close to the Eastern suburbs, this has a good feel, friendly staff, its clean and good value for the price.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

Perfect location for the hospital and the city as it is an easy walk or very easy bus ride to the harbour area and city. Rooms are adequate, not fancy, but comfortable and clean.

We chose this hotel for location as we had tickets to the footy, it was easy to get to (for us country folk), had parking at no extra cost, and short walk to the SCG. Lots of great facilities nearby: cafes, restaurants, cinema, parks. Compact and basic rooms, but great if you want a budget room in a top location. Has a nice courtyard and pool area.

The staff is friendly and helpful. But the room was tired. Carpet seemed to be the original. There is no getting to a room without taking stairs. It is clean but very tight quarters.

It is a perfect distance to walk to the SCG, even with 3 eskies full of ice. The place was much nicer than we expected, especially for the price in Sydney.  The staff were really accommodating and friendly - particular thanks to Fred who was as hilarious as he was helpful. Nothing flash in the room, but the beds were brand new and extremely comfortable. Rooms also had new TV and new bathrooms.  When we turned up he said there was an 'issue' with the booking (we had booked a triple room). He then said we could have 2 separate twin rooms, one with a king-size bed, which were connected by a door - amazing upgrade! Bar next door was nice, and gave a discount for those staying at the hotel. Also really close to some good restaurants and clubs.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_357073208~“Very helpful staff, good location and clean room”~This was solo travel. Sometimes a new city can be overwhelming, but the staff at this hotel made me feel comfortable and they were helpful and friendly. There wasn't a thing that I wanted for. My room was very quiet as I asked to be on the 'garden' side. I also needed wifi and the garden room had excellent reception. The central location and being on the bus line contributed to the enjoyment of the location. There are some funky areas nearby, in one direction are independent stores and shops the other direction is entertainment. This all added to an enjoyable stay in Sydney.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_356380393~“Great Location”~Not the grandest of hotels but more than made up for that by the 1st class friendly staff. Mark on reception made us very welcome although we were very early and he gave us valuable information while he had our room prepared for early access. He was even able to direct me to a suitable barber. The hotel also owns the adjoining bar which was not plush and is in need of a makeover but there was a good selection of beers and larger, all cold, and a very adiquate menu. Look out for the specials and dont expect the wait for your meal to take long. There are bus stops virtually right outside and the No 380 will get you to Circular Quay in one direction or Bondi beach and Watsons Bay the other and runapproximately every 15mins. The Hotel staff encourage you to leave your room key when going offfor the day which we found extremely useful and not always available at other hotels.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan

review_350144161~“Great little place ”~We weren't expecting much because this hotel was so much cheaper than the ones close to the city centre but it was really good. The double bed was good, the bathroom clean (albeit small), the aircon was great and it was super quiet (room 122 backing on to little laneway). It's not far to walk into the centre and it's an interesting area with a great vibe. We had dinner next door at the Arts Bar and it was EXCELLENT!!! We met friends there for drinks and dinner and we all enjoyed our meals, the beer was cold and the wine really good. Oh and we received a 10% discount as we were guests at the hotel. All in all, a very pleasant overnight stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343904748~“Does the job - well priced and central location”~I was only staying in Sydney one night and only literally just to sleep, so I was not looking for anywhere fancy but wanted to stay somewhere central and this hotel does the job. It was less than $200 per night which was my budget. Located on the CBD end of Oxford St so close to both Paddington and the city. Easy to find and get to. The biggest positive of staying here were the staff. They were more than helpful with any request we had. It looks like this was an older hotel that has since had a makeover. It is clean enough but you can still see some of the dated fittings and fixtures in the rooms. Rooms and the hallways were a bit musty smelling. I didn't mind as I was not in the hotel for long but it would not be suitable if I was staying longer or with children. Everything in my suitcase came home smelling like the room (and I was only in the room less than 24 hours). Breakfast is affordable at $16 per head and is continental style - does the job if you don't want to head to one of the many local eating options. Don't think it had a gym or many of the conveniences of a business hotel so would only recommend staying here for leisure. Wifi is supposedly offered free in the rooms but the connection was so poor that we were not able to connect. They also offer a 6pm checkout for only another $60. Pretty tempting if you have a late flight. A tip - request a room on the Oxford St side as you get a bit of a view of the city and bridge, especially from the top floor which is level 3. Despite being right on Oxford St we slept like logs as the doors are triple glazed and you cannot hear a peep from the street.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~5~nan
review_343230161~“Not coming back”~We stayed for one night in this hotel, but unfortunately there won't be more. Parking was a real problem. The hotel's car park was full even though we tried multiple times during the day. Finding parking in the area is a huge challenge as parking is highly restricted. We ended up having to walk a fair distance with all our luggage. And then we had to leave at 8am again because parking restrictions kicked in. When we finally got to our room, there was a very unpleasant odour. The fan in the bathroom also made an unusual amount of noise. All in all not a pleasant stay and we'll look for alternative accommodation in the future. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336607595~“A very charming hotel!”~A small and cosy hotel with a fantastic location in Paddington, Sydney. The bus stop was just 40 m outside the hotel that could take you anywhere. The rooms were indeed quite small but perfect for a short term visit. A good internet connection in all the rooms. If you are interested of exploring Sydney and won't spend much time in the hotel room, Arts Hotel is perfect for you. Friendly staff is also a plus. My family and me stayed for 4 nights here and we were all very pleased with the visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335172524~“Very happy here”~We stayed here in January 2015 and were happy with the hotel. We were able to check in early and as we were taking the last space in their on site carpark one of the duty managers helped direct us into the very squeezy spot! The room was not huge but it did the job. It had a small balcony so you could let the air in and the glazing made sure no noise came through when you closed it off. We took our baby with us and the hotel gave us FREE use of a portacot (we had to bring the bedding but no biggie). The location is close to lots of landmarks and the pub downstairs makes good food at a reasonable price. Highly recommend :-)~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_334914377~“Great front desk staff”~This hotel is located on an interesting street. It has an interior garden where you can sit and read. It's easy to walk to the botanical gardens and harbor or there's a convenient bus. The front desk staff are extremely helpful with directions. Rooms are small but had everything I needed.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_334134544~“Great location...”~The location is great! lots to see and do within walking distance of the hotel but the hotel itself left me a little disappointed and here's why. It is weary and needs some attention...It was only on inspection of the 3rd room that is was close to being an acceptable place to stay. The first room had a REALLY bad smell about it. The 2nd room the air-con was completely black on the inside and looked extremely unhealthy to have the air from that blowing into your room. The 3rd room was better...The staff were very accommodating when finding a room that didn't smell and wasn't going to make me ill. I was given a late check out which was also good but they charged me for the breakfast that I was told by the guy at reception was included with the room...so for $16 I had 2 pieces of toast, 1 cold hard boiled egg and a small really bad coffee..if I had known they were going to charge me I would have stuffed my face a little more....The Arts Hotel has a gorgeous courtyard area with swimming pool so its not all bad and if you are there to see the sights you wont be in the room that much anyway..~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_333966672~“Great wee place”~I accidentally book my accomodation for the wrong weekend and when I arrived at my original hotel I discovered this and that they were fully booked. I found the Arts Hotel at the last minute and booked online. I arrived 30 minutes later and they were all ready for me.  Rooms are basic but clean and tidy and surprisingly quiet given the location. Great location with buses outside to head to the city or Bondi. Surrounded by funky shops, great cafes and awesome old school book shops.  Lovely swimming pool and courtyard. Free wifi and all round value for money.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_332794748~“Great Hotel, Fantastic staff”~Tired of spending your trips in large international class hotels, try the Arts Hotel on one of Sydney's most iconic streets. No such thing as 2 pm check-in, if you arrive on an early morning flight your room is immediately put at your disposal, with no questions asked. Breakfast is simple but excellent value and the hotel has a secluded swimming pool to dip in at anytime of the day or night. Excellent value stay~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_332533098~“Easy, convenient, clean and friendly”~Close to the city, friendly staff, and a neat tidy room - couldn't have asked for better for a weekend away with my mom.  Twin room - comfortable beds - huge fluffy white towels. Double glazing kept the worst of the street noise out of the room. Pub next door had great food, fast.  Parking under the building was a bonus.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_329316444~“Arts hotel”~I thought this hotel was ideally suited for getting around good bus routes to circular key and bondi. The rooms were clean and I was in a garden room so very little noise. It has no frills but the bed was comfortable. Tea and coffee provided and a fridge in the room as well. Breakfast was extra $16 buffet lots of choice only boiled eggs as far as cooked breakfast . I would recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonably priced accomadation~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_323761090~“Beyond our expectations”~Terrific location; a simple but stylish and very clean and comfortable room with all we needed, including an unexpected view of gorgeous courtyards and beautiful trees. To top it all off, incredibly welcoming, helpful and really delightful staff. Our stay at Arts Hotel in Paddington played a major part in what was a thoroughly enjoyable weekend in Sydney. We don't want to stay anywhere else in Sydney when we come back!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_319953811~“Small small small”~Very small rooms, tiny bathroom, no hand towels or face washer. Lack of suitable parking. Duty manager quite rude and abrupt when he stopped texting on his phone. Wouldn't bother with return visit. Better places to stay!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_310585397~“Clean and tidy”~Stayed just he one night after arriving late at night. Walked from Musem Station after flight from the UK (20 mins). Check-in was quick and easy, the room was clean, quiet and comfrotable though not over large. Though very late we found plenty of places still open to eat in the area, The shower had plenty of hot water, but no coffee making facilities. Breakfast was offered in the cafe next door, but we opted to find our own further down the street. This is not a reflection on the hotel, as after all it is a budget establishment and indeed does it very well. There is even a small pool in the courtyard. For a few days sight-seeing in Sydney it is ideal.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan

review_309997270~“Another GREAT stay”~I've been staying at this hotel every few months (mix of business and pleasure) for years and have yet to write a review - so here it is - ARTS hotel is a secret gem of a hotel, which this year has been having some fantastic renovations. On my most recent stay I was upgraded to an 'Art' room which had been stylishly revamped with comfortable modern interiors & a fabulous new range of L'Occitane in the shower room ! Treat yourself to an 'Art' room if you choose to stay, they are so peaceful and have great views of the pool & internal courtyard. All of the other room formats are equally comfortable and welcoming so whichever room you book you're sure to be right at home. Other highlights of the hotel include - 1. Complimentary car park in the basement (even although there are limited spaces I have always managed to park) 2. Berkelouw bookstore is downstairs at the front door - for those seeking literary inspiration ! 3. Cinema Verona next door for the movie lover ! 4. Ampersand Cafe across the road - incredible coffee & brekkie & lunch ! 5. 24hr convenience store at the end of the block for midnight snacks ! 6. 15 minute walk into the CBD for the shoppers amongst us ! 7. minutes walk to St Vincent's hospital 8. minutes walk to Taylor Square & Oxford St for LGBT visitors  9. lots of bars/ wine bars/ restaurants/ take aways within walking distance 10. on the main bus route for all destinations within Sydney ie Bondi & a constant stream of taxis means it is easy to get around. Over and above all of the great reasons listed above the thing that keeps me coming back is the fact that it feels like a home away from home - thanks to the front of house team .... Mark, Fred, Ali to name a few, who welcome me so warmly every time I stay ! Keep up the great work & I look forward to seeing you very soon !~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_302050189~“Great location.”~Hotel location is ideal as I was able to walk to the CBD shopping precinct and the Paddington shops and cafes were almost on your door step! Browsing the local book shops only doors from the hotel was fun. The Hotel room -although small was clean and the staff friendly and helpful.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_277449984~“Probably wouldn't go back”~Was missing the basics that normally come in a hotel room like washers, mini bar, shower cap etc. Very average ròom, neat bathroom. Bed was comfy. Aircon didn't work. Would try somewhere else next time~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_273919263~“Hands down the place to stay on Oxford St”~Can anyone find a better deal than what The Arts Hotel offers? We stayed in a twin courtyard room in beds of crisp white linen (my fave), with newly laid plush carpet and free parking? From internet booking to check out, The Arts Hotel was faultless. There was a genuine sense of pride and courtesy from the staff, who cater especially for people like us visiting St Vincent's Hospital. The only slight issue was the noisy air vent in the bathroom. But who leaves these things on for long anyway?! This is Oxford St's best kept accom secret....sshh!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_273473348~“Surprisingly quiet”~Great location being 15 min taxi ride from the airport (I believe they also have an airport shuttle bus), right around the corner from St Vincent's hospital and walking distance to the cbd. On one side you have a great bookshop with cafe above it, and next to that the Verona Palace cinema. On the other side is a little pub serving a decent pub meal (if you book online you get a 10% discount for the pub). I asked for a quiet room at the back and I got 317. No road noise whatsoever so I slept great, however the hotel's free wifi connection (that I needed for work) was too weak back there to connect. Comfy bed, adequate space (really large desk) and big tv.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_273212274~“Safe, clean, good breakfast, good location, and inexpensive”~If you are looking for a quaint hotel that has charm and is located walking distance from downtown, this is he place for you.  Very friendly front desk, good breakfast (work paying extra for it), wifi, and good people. Very helpful staff. They also have a discount at the restaurant and bar next door.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_265398994~“A MUST FOR HOSPITAL VISITORS ... very close”~I will sum up our two nite stay in GOOD & BAD points. GOOD Very close to St Vincents hospital ... it is closer than than google maps make out There are buses that run you to EVERYWHERE from outside the hotel & down a bit. We went to Circular Quay & to The casino & public transport was excellent. The underground parking is a godsend if you can get there early enough to get it. Once we parked our car we never touched it until we went home. .... but you need to check in early The service & professionalism by Mark & his team are excellent. They are courteous and helpful with directions to bus stops, restarants, bars etc. BAD Hot water in the shower is inconsistent, going from ok to cold to very hot without notice. The exhaust fan in the bathroom is louder than a jumbo jet & needs looking at. The standard room is NOT BIG, so dont expect 6 mtrs X 6 mtrs coz it aint. I would say 4 X 3 maybe. Having said that, we only used it to sleep & get showered so it wasnt critical Overall, if i had to visit relatives in St Vincents hospital again, i would stay at the ARTS~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_265333727~“Lovely Boutique Property walking distance to CBD”~We had the pleasure of staying in the Arts Hotel in March and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The hotel is a little out of the hustle and bustle which is what we like as it allows you to see other parts of a city, as well as the main tourist spots. We were lucky enough to get a courtyard room but also managed to get a peak at the city side rooms which had fantastic balcony's and a great view across the city so I would recommend either! Some of the rooms have been upgraded while others are awaiting their upgrade so I would recommend contacting the helpful staff at the hotel to make help you get your room of choice. The hotel serves breakfast but we opted to eat out at one of the many boutique cafe's in the area. Mark and Fred on the front desk were very helpful and made us feel right at home after a long flight, Highly recommended!!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_264202704~“Location & modest charm.”~The Arts Hotel is in the ideal position for all the places I'd like to visit when on a quick trip to Sydney. Situated in Paddington, but on the cusp of Darlinghurst & Surry Hills, it's perfect for a food & culture weekend. A quick & easy bus trip to the City or Bondi; it's the dream spot for any lazy traveller. The rooms are clean & functional with either a view out to the shoppers/traveling revellers in Oxford street, or the pool. (It is in the quieter end of Oxford, but you'll see people trickling home in the early hours or past the amazing Indian takeaway for a late night fix.) The windows are double glazed, so you won't have to worry about noise.  If travelling with a car the parking is first come, first served, which can be tricky. This is not an area you want to be hunting for street parking. Good luck with that. My last stay I ended up in a lovely room overlooking the pool. It had both a king & a single bed, which was fabulous because I was rather sick of the guy I was travelling with.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_264174321~“Pleasant Easter long weekend”~This is a reborn hotel apart from the not unpleasant sprayed concrete ceilings from the early 70's. Compact and clean with newish sheets, towels, carpets, air/con etc. Upgraded free to a garden room, which probably had a more pleasant outlook than non-garden rooms. Other rooms seem to be very near Oxford Street, which might bother some. The hot water in room 310 has a tendency to fluctuate wildly in temperature and pressure and that puts me off from repeat business also exhaust fan comes on with the ensuite light; could be easily replaced and makes quite a racket. Good self serve coffee, iron and board supplied and ample wardrobe space and hangers. Fridge needed a defrost but cooled our drinks well anyway. Family owned and operated with a courteous and efficient front desk. The location was excellent, especially if guaranteed parking is not a requirement.~4~nan~nan~5~3~nan~5~nan
review_260302247~“Right near St Vincents Hospital”~Stayed here whilst my elderly Dad was in St Vincents. Good proximity to cafes restaurants & St Vincents.

review_259534705~“Great location”~The room was clean and comfortable and pretty much just what we expected for the price we paid. Great location, easy walk to some nice eateries and venues.

review_259335980~“New Art Rooms.”~We have stayed at this hotel many times over the past few years and have always been looked after very well by Mark and the staff. This time we stayed in one of the new Art Rooms, what a great surprise, the décor is very modern and the finish is very good. The Arts Hotel is close to everything, a bus stop over the road to Bondi etc, and on the same side to the CBD. A short walk to St. Vincent's hospital. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a holiday accommodation, and especially for anyone visiting loved ones at St. Vincent's. The food in the hotel next door is excellent and well priced. A little extra touch would be a shower cap. Thanks again to Mark and the staff.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_259034822~“Good location and unexpected great customer service”~Bus stop is just round the corner from the hotel entrance. It is in the city-ish but away from the crowd which i enjoyed. Room is pretty standard and I had an usual request and the hotel did their very best to accommodated my request which was outstanding customer service I think. I give 4 instead of 5 because of the standard of the room - they are comfortable enough but can be improved~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_258535448~“Perfect Location and Customer Friendly.”~We stayed here for six nights on our tour to the Cricket World Cup and were very pleased by both the standard of service and the facilities provided. The location is perfect for exploring this wonderful city. The reception staff were really helpful, especially Mark, and we appreciated his help and advice as we set of on a walking tour of the Paddington area. We would strongly recommend this walk through old Paddington to all visitors. The Pub/Restaurant next door is under the same ownership as the Hotel and we were satisfied with the high standard of the food and service there and enjoyed the 10 per cent discount! Well done the Arts Hotel on providing excellent free wifi in the room- a lot of the larger hotel chains could learn from your example. Thank you.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_258449896~“Good for the price”~I stayed there for a week during a business trip. The rooms are small sized with tiny ensuite. If you get a good price, this hotel is not too bad for a few nights sleep. They have free wi-fi, so thats one advantage.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_257361028~“Breathe of fresh air from Darling Harbour”~My husband and I have just had a long weekend at this hotel and have to say can't wait to return. We visit Sydney quite often to get away from Sleepy Hollow (Canberra) but usually stay closer to Darling Harbour in an overpriced hotel and get stung copious amounts of money for parking!!! Not any more. We had a fantastic weekend. Great hotel, compact and bijou but absolutely completely serviceable with a great bed. We had a third floor room overlooking Oxford Street, with a balcony not noisy at all and a perfect location for public transport to Bondi, Circular Quay and the City. The boutiques stretching along Oxford Street are a shoppers paradise, but ladies be warned, leave your credit card at home! We arrived earlier than our check in time and were immediately given the keys to our room. Got a parking spot no trouble at all in the basement and believe it or not, IT IS FREE. There is hardly anywhere on the planet where there is free parking, so huge tick. We loved staying here and next time we visit Sydney we will be staying here without a doubt. The staff are amazing, friendly and so helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Can't recommend it enough.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_257350120~“a nice place to rest”~I enjoyed an overnight stay here to go to a couple of concerts. On arrival the people at reception were very friendly and helpful, and that continued throughout my stay.  The hotel itself shows wear and tear although it is clean and tidy and clearly well looked after. The hallways are dark but inside the rooms there is plenty of light. The rooms are not large. The one I was in had a comfortable queen bed, a good sized wardrobe, table and chair. The ensuite is small, with a basin rather than a vanity, but quite adequate. Big flatscreen TV with cable channels. The room has an individual air conditioner. For somewhere to stay if you're going out (or want to nearby to the hospital) this hotel is easy and comfortable. It is not noisy either. It is not the kind of hotel to book if you want to spend a lot of time in the room aside from sleeping. There is, however, a pretty garden where guests can sit and relax, with a clean pool as well.  It is in an interesting location, with lots of boutique shops nearby, plenty of cafe's and bookstores. A walk around the streets of Paddington is enjoyable and a walk along Oxford Street takes you past cinema's and night clubs and restaurants and trendy shopping, not to mention the gay and lesbian heartland. It is a fairly long walk into the city, and a bit of a hike to get to Circular Quay or Darling Harbour but the area is well serviced by buses and taxis. There is limited free parking underneath the hotel that is easily accessible via a lane way that you enter from Oxford Street.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~5~nan
review_256851630~“Best for the Price!”~I stayed at this hotel in Paddington for 3 weeks. Great value, great location ( I walked into the CBD a few times) and lots of interesting walks. A fairly old hotel, but clean and pleasant, comfortable bed, excellent customer service. Not fussed on the breakfast offerings, but there are many great cafes within walking distance, and very close (about 5 minutes walk) to St Vincents Public and Private Hospitals. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Sydney, as it is not expensive, and close to the city and transport if needed. Great staff!!!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_256796075~“Excellent location if you have loved ones in St Vincent's!”~Stayed here as my husband was having surgery at St Vincent's private hospital last week. You could not get a better location!  Rooms are a little pokey but we really didn't spend any time in it. Hotel is clean, staff are friendly and helpful and the bar next door does a great meal ( also there is a great Thai restaurant 5 min walk down the road which I would highly recommend trying)  I felt safe at all times even though I was on my own and walking to and from the hospital even in the dark.  Bus stop is right out side and the Kings Cross train station is about a 10 min walk.  Thanks again for a great stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_256406803~“Gem for Travellers”~We happily stayed, Feb10-16/2015, in a Garden/Arts room, #316, which over-looks the interior courtyard. The room was of modest size but was comfortable, very clean, completely upgraded and more than we expected for the price. Our greeting by the staff and continued interaction with them was stellar...extremely helpful and friendly. The location well suited our need of being out of the expensive, downtown core but central, never-the-less. Paddington and the major bus routes along Oxford street meant that the core, Circular Key and the ferry terminal were 15 or 20 minutes away. Our 6 days to explore the greater Sydney area using public transport couldn't have been a better choice...buses, ferries and trains are linked with a convenient and inexpensive OPAL card, permitting "top up" as you used it. We used the ferries extensively to all points in the massive harbour plus buses, to visit popular beaches (Bondi and Mannly), tourist sites (great zoo, opera house) and some of outer urban areas, parks and historical/cultural centres.  We met a number of international travellers at the Arts Hotel as well as Australians from other parts of the country. The hotel has found a niche market with France (and presumably Quebec) as French was frequently spoken by the staff and guests. Like many buildings in Sydney and Paddington, the hotel and many other structures along Oxford Street are rehabilitated, older buildings...charming, quirky, chic, whatever...but generally well done. We found great shopping in stylish boutiques, a wide variety of pubs with snacking to dining options and parks within walking distance.  I should mention that the hotel's courtyard was a pleasant surprise for enjoying some of the wine we purchased and speaking with some of the guests. The unheated swimming pool...more of a shallow, plunge pool...was welcomed for a quick dip to cool off in summer's heat. The front desk provided large beach towels.  Many thanks to Mark and the staff for a wonderful boutique hotel experience. Cheers, Richard and Liz.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_254834501~“comfortable convenient”~Sydney is quite expensive and this is the least expensive hotel in Paddington, while still living unto the standards of a hotel.
