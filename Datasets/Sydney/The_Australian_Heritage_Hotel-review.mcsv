review_474191620~“In Need of a Makeover, But a Decent Option for Pricey Sydney”~We spent three nights at the Australian Heritage Hotel a.k.a The Bed and Breakfast at The Rocks. It is a number of rooms on top of an old heritage pub, so people should understand what they are getting for the price. Yes, as with many of the other reviews, the place is in dire need of a makeover. Carpets are worn and old furniture is present in all the rooms. However, if one can overlook those and consider the price they are paying, relative to its location, it does present very good value. Location is excellent - easy walking distance to Harbour Bridge, The Rocks, Opera House and even Darling Harbour. There are very friendly and helpful staff (Lincoln); he helped with booking airport shuttle and helped us print and scan some important documents that we urgently needed to respond to back home in Canada. We were even offered a free welcome beverage from the pub. The washrooms are very clean and come with complimentary toiletries. The beds are made and fresh towels provided daily. The greatest value comes from the complimentary breakfast which is included - toast, peanut butter and jam, corn flakes, muesli, yogurt and oranges, as well as Nespresso coffee from the machine. There is free tea (black, green, herbal) and coffee all day. There is free wifi which was always strong. The pub downstairs is a popular venue for locals and tourists alike with excellent pizzas and great selection of beer. Their sister hotel is only 100m away - The Glenmore - and has one of Sydney's best rooftop bars.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~5~nan
review_472762314~“Stopped in for a beer, returned later for dinner!”~On our city walkmwe stopped by as this pub was reported to be worth a visit due to its unique split level lay out. The pub also has an interesting pressed iron roof. They serve Schafer Brewery beer ( only they do). We had the Bavarian beer which was very nice. We returned later that evening for dinner and to try out their famous pizzas. The place was very busy, but we managed to get a table outside on the verandah. Had shared the peppered kangaroo pizza ( large) and it had a thin base and was very tasty.  All in all a good dining experience!~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470041845~“Friendly, Familiar and a Great Value”~After enduring the rather grueling travel from the USA to Sydney it was truly a needed and welcome assurance and pleasure to be greeted by the staff with informal warmth and familiarity that would extend throughout our stay. The Australian Heritage Hotel is situated within The Rocks, a neighborhood noted for its often stunning historic architecture, facades and walkways annotated by numerous narrative placards imaginatively animating the streets of old Sydney. The Australian Heritage extends the experience through its own seemingly original architecture festooned with an eclectic mix of period furnishings, fixtures and décor. A small number of rooms guarantees little frustration with the shared amenities such as the bathrooms and the gracious common room where a basic continental breakfast is served daily. The popular street level pub always immerses you in the commotion and camaraderie of the neighborhood which is a wonderful way to start or end your day. If you're traveling light, your goal is to explore the local colors and textures of life in Sydney The Australian Heritage provides an excellent value for your dollar. And kudos to the wonderful staff, I look forward to my next stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_469571554~“This place is awesome!”~We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The location is great, the staff treats you better than family and the beds are comfortable. The free breakfast consisted of muesli and/or cornflakes, orange/apple juice, coffee/tea, yogurt, toast and pb/jam, and was certainly sufficient to get us on our way in the morning. We also tried several items from the food menu and a couple from the bar - all were good. Where else do you get a glass of port in the evening? There is no air conditioning but there are fans and big windows which helped us endure the hot muggy weather. If you are walking from the CBD, there is a significant uphill climb near the end of your journey - it just about did us in after walking from the Central Station! If there is one thing I would change about the hotel, it would be the carpets. They are long overdue. But I did enjoy the heritage feel of the building, and would definitely return.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_462572713~“close to circular quay”~the australian had a great feel and super friendly staff,basic rooms with shared bathrooms were ok. short walk to the train and all the attractions of circular quay! breakfast was help yourself and all you need really, so all in all a place i would recommend!~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461865500~“Oasis”~Great place to meet friends for a pint and an pizza in The Rocks. Extensive beer menu from breweries across Australia. Tables outside are great for people watching. Staff prompt and pleasant. Surroundings relaxed and practical, not pretentious. Have the Coat of Arms pizza.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460800867~“Good value for CBD location”~My wife and I stayed for 4 nights before our cruise out of Sydney. The hotel location is very convenient, 5 minutes from Overseas Passenger Terminal and the Circular Quay. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The major drawback is that there is no A/C nor window screens. It was a bit unbearable when we experienced a couple of hot nights with day time temperature in excess of 33C. Bugs flew in and we had quite a few bites. The inside decor, as expected, was very dated and badly in need of updates and cleaning. Bathrooms were relatively clean but you could see bugs crawling around in the middle of the night. Again, it is a function of the age/viintage of the property. Breakfast was reasonable.~2~2~nan~1~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458762378~“Great Location. Bare Bones Lodging”~The Rocks is a great neighborhood to stay in to explore Sydney. The hotel is above the pub. The pub has a great atmosphere and an extensive beer list and also has plenty of outside tables. The staff is friendly and helpful.  The rooms upstairs are not great. If are okay with a small room with bad carpet, basically no amenities, and a shared hallway bathroom; the price and the location might make up for it.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455308929~“Charging a premium to visitors and tourists.”~I have been drinking at this pub since the mid 1980's. It is in a great location and is a very well preserved heritage building.  I have been travelling overseas and returned to Australia last December. I dropped into the Australia for a beer. I was stunned to find that a pint of beer was &12.62.  A couple of day later I returned to the pub. This time the bar attendant recognised me. This time I was charged $9.90 for the same pint of beer.  I questioned the variation in price.  The bar attendant explained that current policy is "to provided a 25% discount to locals".  Another way of looking at that is that 'visitors and tourists' are being hit with a 30% surcharge.  Other pubs in the area like the Lord Nelson do not follow such a policy. Everyone is charged the same price. A pint at the Lord Nelson costs $9.70.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_452974164~“Pros and Cons”~I'll start with the positives: The location is perfect for exploring The Rocks, Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and and easy walk from Wynyard Station, the staff were very pleasant, the shared bathroom was clean, the bed was clean and comfortable, and the hotel has a lot of historic charm.   Now for the negatives: The carpet in my room (room 3) as well as in the hallway and common area was absolutely filthy. I'm sure that even with a thorough cleaning the black areas in the middle and the stains throughout would remain but it was obvious that the edges and corners hadn't been vacuumed in months. If you do decide to stay bring flipflops because you won't want your bare feet to touch the floor. In addition, the cords attaching the light fixtures above the bed to the ceiling were covered in a thick fur-like coating of dust and the paddles of the ceiling fan were edged with back dust. I don't mind simple and basic and I understand the need to preserve the historic integrity of this heritage building but I would hesitate to stay there again simply because of the cleanliness issue.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~3~nan
review_450826079~“Brilliant Auzzie Pizzas”~Visited after completing the bridge climb and we had definitely worked up a appetite. We ordered 2 Auzzie pizzas 1 was the famous coat of arms pizza and a bottle of red. We really enjoyed it, what a lovely pub.  Great location in the Rocks would defiantly recommend, thought it was good value too!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450654105~“Would go again!”~I visited this place with my girl and an another couple (friends of ours). We ordered 3 different pizzas to be shared and they all were very good. We enjoyed our stay and pizzas were quite affordable. There were 2 sizes available and if you're hungry then don't think about the small one because it is more like a snack. We had large ones and they were big enough but could be even bigger if you ask me.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449351580~“Iconic, tasty, historic and just plain Aussie”~We took some friends from overseas here for pizza and beer. The men loved the Kangaroo and emu pizza. I had the nachos which were delicious but we ended up ordering more wedges as they were so vruchy and tasty. We had a large group and so sat outside on a hot afternoon...the vibe and atmosphere was just perfect. The building itself is worth having a look at...if you can get past some of the renovations and look back at the type of building it once was you get a taste of the original beauty. We would go back for a cool ale and those wedges. If you are after a super flash experience then you may be disappointed but if you are after good food and a taste of Aussie atmosphere, this is a great place to start.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448777747~“Delicious pizza with Australian game meats”~I had a half and half large pizza containing half crocodile. The other half was half emu and half kangaroo.  I had never tried these meats before, so the pizza was more of an indulgence for the novelty. The crocodile looked like a stringy version of chicken with a bit less flavour. The emu and beef were both gamey and beef-like with the emu being a bit more flavourful and gamey.  Having tried kangaroo steak, I think spending extra money and having it as a steak is a better way of having the kangaroo, as in pizza form, the kangaroo was very similar to beef, whereas as a steak, it was noticeably tastier than a beef steak. If you're looking for service, this place may not be so much for you. I prepaid for the meal at their bar and my food arrived based on the numbered wooden spoon that I was given, but other than being brought my pizza, staff did not interact with me or follow-up to find out how my meal was, or if I wanted more water or to order a drink.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447690364~“A gem.”~Having visited this pub for the first time over thirty years ago I am delighted to report that in that time it has retained it's character for subsequent visits. It is a true gem in the heart of this vibrant city!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437942546~“The Australian Heritage Hotel”~Stayed for one night prior to a cruise ,cheap , staff were great .Heritage listed, the B& B side of it upstairs (Steep) needs a bit of TLC . Our room double bed was squeezed up against the wall not the best. Shared facilities were adequate  Light breakfast included .But try as we may no normal black tea only the yuppie rubbish  Carpet in lounge /breakfast room had holes in it .could do with a good clean in places.  Canned noise from below (music) permeated the room we were in till late this was a thursday night  Redeeming feature the pub served great Pizzas~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_434623718~“Busy place with great emu pizza”~Extremelly busy place in the evening but great for casual meeting with friends, especially when the weather is good. Don't expect to have free table, rather be prepared to grab a bear and a standing place.  Can recommend coat of arms pizza.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_430926586~“great wedges and pizza”~We got the coat of arms pizza (emu and Kangaroo) and a huge portion of wedges. Pizza was a little small for the price but delicious and something a bit different to try in Australia, wedges were very good value for the portion size. A tour guide had recommended it so we popped in when we were in the rocks area and we were happy enough - good food, good service, nice atmos. - worth a visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418824629~“Cool Aussie Pub”~Dropped in for a pint and pizza - crocodile meat Pizza!!  Neat little place indoor and outdoor seating, tv's inside so got to watch some of the Olympics.  Great selection of drinks and food - some exotic meats, and cool staff. Finding the spot maybe a bit tricky if coming from the circular quay area as there are stairs which lead upwards anyhow sticking to the main roads will be easier.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418309523~“an authentic old gem”~I stayed here with my partner for 2 nites, and so did my 86 year old mum (her birthday), and my sister and her hubby. We all agreed this place is a real old school gem. A particular highlight was the charming old communal breakfast/TV room. It was lovely to be able to share a breakfast with my family, and have lots of coffee and tea, cereals, and endless toast. One night we shared pizzas and watched a movie on telly. (the in house pizzas are incredible!).  The accomodations are basic and not pretensious. What you see is what you get. But the share bathrooms are clean and well maintained. The steep stairs were easily managed by my 86 year old mum.  The location is incredibly handy to the harbor and the rocks. All of our stay was made so much more enjoyable and pleasant because of the generous welcome shown by the manager Tim. He got to know us very quickly and made sure all our baggage was taken care of, and that my mum was looked after. He even brought us up our pizzas from downstairs.  If you want to experience a genuine authentic old aussie hotel experience, without any frills, i heartily commend this place. Chris~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_413431931~“Work trip location location location”~When I travel to Sydney I always stay at the Aussie even tough I could stay 5 star if I wanted to I stay at the Aussie as it is so close to my head office. The rooms are really clean and the brekky is laid out for your convenience. The staff are so friendly and arguably the best pizzas in the Rocks. The toilets are communal pub style but as there are only a few rooms and plenty of bath rooms it has never been a problem. Great if you have a function and plan not to go home. But book ahead online as it is popular at the prices they post.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413354040~“Excellent pizza”~I visited this pub when I was in Sydney 10 years ago and wanted to be sure to return during this latest trip. They still offered the coat of arms pizza (featuring emu and kangaroo meat), and it was as delicious as I remembered. Certainly not something I would find in the States, and it was a real treat.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412952252~“Great food and atmosphere”~Formerly a regular visitor to the Australian Hotel when I worked in the Rocks, it has been a few years since I last visited and I was delighted that the great pizzas and drinks are still as delicious as ever. My favourite is (and has always been) the Peking Duck and Asian Greens with Hoisin Sauce pizza and again last night it was divine. They also have lots of other pizzas with interesting toppings like crocodile, kangaroo and emu as well as the usual favoutites. All washed down with interesting beers and wines. I will be back...soon~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_412317042~“Comfortable, Homely & Friendly”~My partner and I didn't arrive to check in until around 11pm but we were still greeted by 3 staff members who were friendly, introduced themselves and came out to help us bring our bags in. We were shown around the accommodation and explained everything in no rush at all despite the late arrival. The rooms had enough space and were cosy, despite having shared bathrooms the place wasn't too busy so it were as if we had them to ourselves anyway. The hotel has a great lounge area with free port! Exactly what you want to hear after a long day of travel! The next day were greeted again by friendly staff who helped us out with everything we needed for the day.   We returned later to kill some time before travelling again, we were allowed to chill for a while in the lounge area despite having checked out already.  The pub downstairs has a great traditional decor but has an awesome selection of modern craft beers on tap. For the price and the location on top of all this you can't give this place anything other than a 5 star rating!~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_411301720~“Excellent Pizza”~Called in here for lunch before walking over the Harbour Bridge (which is just around the corner)and had the Emu & Kangaroo pizza. Would highly recommend washed down with one of the local Australian ciders.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_411239374~“The rocks classic”~Wonderful old style aussie pub with great atmosphere and lovely bones. Loved the beers and seafood & emu/kangaroo pizza we had there.  Lots of fun being there on trivial quiz night in the middle of winter, rain bucketing done and outside as well! Loved it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410940802~“Great old pub”~Nice pub with good beer  I liked the Modus Pale Ale and the Scharers Lager Good atmosphere and nice bar to sit at while sipping a cool beer  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the beers and they have real cool t shirts. The cockatoo lamp at the end of the bar is a real eye catcher and for a pub built in 1913 it's holding up really well. I'd come back here for a beer and a meal anytime~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_409108026~“Great location, cool heritage experience!”~Lovely old pub, with great young vibe in the bar, yet beautiful heritage style rooms.

review_406086730~“Excellent pub meal”~An excellent choice for a relaxed evening meal. Service at the bar was very good , cheerful and informative of food. The food was tasty and filling. Not gourmet cuisine, but it wasn't meant to be. The beer and wine went down well and overall the cost was reasonable. For a group of 5 it was an excellent evening.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405581277~“Overrated ”~I wanted to try kangaroo before leaving Australia in three days and the quick "where to eat kangaroo in Sydney" Google search returned me several links that all mentioned this place. I thus went to TAHH but ended up leaving wondering what the fuss was all about. The service was average at best, the pizza extremely small for its price, and the pub itself is clearly more old and dirty than quaint and vintage. Thank God at least the pizza was nice. Kangaroo doesn't taste that great, but the peppers were nicely roasted and the cheese just enough to be noticeable but not overpowering.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405191967~“Great Craft beer”~A real interesting pub very popular with local residents and tourists alike. Always a great selection of craft beer and the choice keeps changing.  The pizza choice is also different with a choice of kangaroo or emu pizza as well as crocodile.  The beer is the star here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396436804~“Great Tap Beer & nice pizzas”~A great place to stop for a weekend lunch while cruising The Rocks (and avoiding some of the pricier options). Truly well preserved old world charm, great outdoor seating with heaters, and a fine selection of tap beers, many craft breweries.  LOVED the barkeep letting me try a sip of some weird, wonderful beer: Lightening Bolt i think... a truly floral brew like an IPA made in Port Stephens. Yummo. Cool, eclectic selection of pizzas. Shared the Roast Pork with Crackling Pizza (yes, actual slivers of crackling on top along with matchstick apple bits), very nice. All up, a fine place to sip, sup and relax.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_393549540~“Pizza”~Loved all the unusual meats you can find on their menu it's not too prices pretty average for the area and it's one of the oldest so we hear. Loads of great beers too. We loved the alligator pizza. It's a bit of a hike up to the rocks so if there is anyone with mobility issues then get a taxi but worth it for the view.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390603437~“Food and service terrible”~A good range beers on tap and plenty of food options. Totally inattentive and uninterested staff who care more about chatting amongst themselves than serving the customers that keep thwlem employed. Had the duck pizza. The topping was dry and the pizza base was dry. First and hopefully the last time i have a cheese less pizza. Terrible. No serviette or cutlery provided. Not good value for $21. Drinking here ok if you dont care about the service and like heritage buildings but dont waste your money on the food.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_387580659~“Good lunch spot”~Lots of character. Good food - we had the kangaroo burgers. Also lots of beer on tap. 25 on tap plus another 75 in bottle - all Australian. Try getting a paddle (flight of 5 beers to try a bunch). Service a little slow, but the staff is nice if you take a minute to talk to them. Also this is one of those historic bars, so nice to see the culture.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386867839~“A great option”~For my brief (2 night) flying visit to Sydney I had a list of requirements which included easy access to trains, ferries and busses, close to bars, value for money and definitely not a soulless hotel. The Australian filled the requirements completely. Arriving at 10pm on a Friday the staff found time for a smile, a friendly greeting and escorting me to a clean well proportioned but basic room. Breakfast was again basic but ample and the hotel had enough shared bathrooms and toilets so as not to cause a queue. Location was spot on, ten minutes from central quay, the rocks and opera house. Finally the bar has an outstanding selection of ales and beers~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386820315~“Rustic Charm”~Our stay was very enjoyable the staff so friendly and courteous, the bed was very comfortable. The old girl (hotel) might be a little dated but it certainly makes up with it's location and all the previous mentions above.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_381392112~“Excellent location, religion is a must.”~Overall this is an excellent location to stay whilst in Sydney. Rooms are quite small, so if you're only there for a night or two, it's excellent. Bed is nice and hard, sheets soft, pillow a tiny bit lumpy. Staff are top notch, couldn't ask for a better team! The downside, however, as there is always one would be the highly religious couple in the room next to ours. For 2 hours she was screaming out for "Jesus". Jesus did not respond, so she got louder, and louder, and louder. Jesus still did not answer. We believe at one point she was possessed by the devil as there was banging on the wall, this is maybe the reason she was asking for Jesus as part of an exorcism? Who knows! If this is not an issue for you, or you are able to perform exorcisms then this hotel is a must!~2~2~nan~1~nan~nan~4~nan

Stuck out like a sore thumb & not neccessarily in a good way. Particularly given the suave, affluent area. However pub had an excellent vibe. Food was well priced & "Coat of Arms" pizza was absolutely delicious. Well recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376073626~“Perfect location for exploring the city, bridge, opera house and botanical gardens”~Lovely old hotel/pub in a perfect location. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are tired but clean. Breakfast was a basic DIY affair but perfect to get the metabolism started. Things to note: it's 100% uphill from Circular Quay with many steps so even though it's a short distance, consider a cab if you're not reasonably fit. The bathrooms are shared but we never had to wait because there are only 10 or so rooms. The pub is downstairs and gets noisy on the weekends. Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Hopefully the renovations will be retain the lovely old features but prices presumably will rise significantly.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_375349249~“Ideal as a base for The Rocks”~Five star it is not - but therein lies most of its charm. Friendly staff, seriously comfortable bed, free wifi, good choice of beer, great location. The food menu in the bar is typical pub grub but fills the hole nonetheless in a tasty way. I would have no problems staying here again. Its location makes it a great base to explore The Rocks, Circular Quay and beyond.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan
