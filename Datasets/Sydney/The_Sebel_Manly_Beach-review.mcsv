review_478994741~“Awesome place”~Stayed in the south tower with amazing views across the road to patrolled swimming and surf beach. Shopping and eating are all just a short flat walk from these apartments with something to suit all ages.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475429589~“Excellent position on Manly Beach”~We recently stayed here 2 nights for a wedding and found the Hotel to be very well situated for all the wedding activities. Close to the Corso, Shelly Beach and the Wedding venue at Freshwater. Rooms a little dated but clean and tidy. Serviced daily. The downstairs restaurant was handy for breakfast and food good but not super cheap. Our breakfast was not included in room rate but others of our group were and very happy with that choice! Free wi-fi was great, no problems with speed or buffering. We were in South Tower, quiet but no views. Free laundry facilities on ground floor and a pool in each Tower.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_474375671~“Fabulous location”~We stayed in the south tower and the room was quite comfortable. Fabulous location being able to walk to the corso and restaurants etc. We also did the ghost tour at Quarantine station which was quite different. had lunch at the pub down near the wharf and breakfast at the anchorage hotel up near shelley beach. We didn't eat at the hotel at all but coles supermarket and aldi are all within walking distance. There were no provisions to heat up any food and apart from a bar fridge that is the only kitchen facilities available. We stayed as part of a promotion so the room rate was quite cheap and we were aware that we would not have any ocean views.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_473489030~“OVERPRICED AND DISHONEST”~Booked a very expensive sea view suite. It was nothing like the pictures on the internet. The seaview was only visible from one part of the sitting room. The sitting room had only one two seater couch that was not even big enough for two people. So the additional room was a waste of money. When I complained I get a 10% refund, but only for one day. I paid for two days.  I will not be staying at any Sebel again.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_473339858~“Great location, but a bit dated”~Location is great, 10 minutes from the wharf and across the road from the beautiful beach. Our room in the South tower was nothing like the pictures, and was dated. There was nothing in the fridge besides milk, not even water. The free wifi kept dropping out. But the room was clean and the beds comfortable. The cafe downstairs is convenient but not amazing. All in all I'd say it's ok but not the best value for money at $350-400 a night.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472896553~“Five star luxury and hospitality”~An absolute world class experience in a beautiful setting at the world famous Manly beach. You would be hard pressed to find a more accommodating staff and the rooms are beautifully appointed. Well with paying the extra for the view.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472555567~“Great location otherwise average”~Stayed in a room in the south tower, was raining when we arrived, were taken to the room by a helpful staff member, but no shelter or umbrella available so we were all saturated, including luggage.  As noted in other reviews there is very limited parking so that presents a challenge. Although the staff are good about it, the parking is still grossly inadequate for the facility. The room itself was average, bit musty and a mismatch of decor. The bed was ok, the pillows awful. The fridge absolutely stunk I would not put anything in there even water. The location across from the beach is great but the hotel itself (well certainly the room we stayed in) needs refurbishment and the parking needs to be improved. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472041931~“Great Location”~Stayed here for 5 nights of a touring holiday. The hotel is in a great location right at the end of manly beach by the headland where the road turns inland. The room we had was on the 4th floor overlooking the beach it had a balcony with table and chairs, the room was a good size with decent bathroom with shower only(no bath). A sofa and coffee table + Tv, wifi available. There is limited parking available for $20/day but space is very tight down in the garage. The only negative for us was the room safe in the wardrobe was free standing ie not bolted down,I did mention it to the reception and it was always going to be fixed but never was. Apart from that great staff and a nice short stop Hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471763696~“There are pros and cons”~I stayed The Sebel Manly Beach last week for a couple of nights for an offsite work session. The pros: - Very friendly front desk staff - Cannot beat the location as is across the beach - Nice adjoining restaurant  The cons: - A dated hotel and room with very basic amenities  - I stayed in room 112 in the south building, where there were so many cockroaches - The first night there were noisy people loitering around the hallways. I know this is out of the hotel's control, but the thin walls are the issue. I could hear clearly when people were quietly talking outside my room. My room also opens to the pool where you could hear all the outside noise when people are there too. As I was there for work I was able to tolerate the cons. It might be a nicer experience in a different room. Basic hotel with basic amenities. The staff are great though and location is also an appeal~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_471116948~“It's OK. ”~I visited the Sebel from Singapore in March to attend a friends wedding and found the property to be distinctly average.  The location is without doubt impressive - right on the beach with beautiful views of the Ocean, but the quality of the accommodation was disappointing considering the high nightly room rate. I felt like we paid a 4-5 star price and got 3 star accommodation. The room looked tired, a little shabby and when I called reception for help to steam a dress for the wedding no one was able to help or even locate a steamer. I guess the biggest annoyance here was that no one seemed interested in helping me find a solution.  In the interest of providing a balanced review, the staff in the restaurant were all lovely and the breakfasts were excellent quality ( would recommend the poached eggs and avocado which I believe is pretty 'staple' Australian breakfast fare )  In a nutshell, if you're ok paying a top rate and want a great location this hotel would be a good fit.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468408234~“Relaxing”~The Sebel Manly Beach is located directly across the street form the beach. Also very convenient to the town which is 2 blocks away. I had a room with a balcony overlooking the beach. It was very relaxing to sit on the balcony and enjoy the scenery. The Sebel has 2 buildings. Each has a swimming pool. It is very difficult to find your way between the buildings as you have to go through the restaurant and down the driveway. Both pools are small but nice.~4~2~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_468404412~“Good Location Opposite Manly Beach”~We stayed at the Sebel Manly Beach for two nights in an ocean view deluxe suite on the 6th floor. Our suite consisted of a separate lounge, bedroom, kitchenette, balcony and bathroom. The view was great, the room was spacious and very quiet. The bed was comfortable resulting in a good nights sleep. The kitchenette had a microwave oven and a small fridge. The modern bathroom had a large shower but no bath. The bathroom also held a washing machine and dryer. There were good quality and a good supply of bathroom products. The towels were clean and soft which I always consider a plus. Wi fi is available free to Accor members. Check in and check out was friendly and efficient. Onsite parking is available at a reasonable charge, street meter parking is available but can be quite expensive. The hotel does not have an onsite restaurant for breakfast or dinner but there are a number of nearby quality cafes and restaurants. The only downside to our stay was a maintenance issue resulting in wet carpet nearby the bedroom balcony door leaving the room with a strong musty odour. The hotel attended to the problem and resolved the issue to our satisfaction.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465448828~“Excellent location, Rooms need some TLC”~We booked 3 rooms for a wedding party. firstly the Staff were exceptional, very helpful and accomodating.  Two of the rooms were in the south tower. these rooms were quite big, although are quite dated. They didnt have a view of the beach though. The other room we booked was in the North Tower, and had an amazing view of the beach. The Staff even left a bottle of Champagne and Chocolates which was a nice touch.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462940685~“Simply the best ...”~We stayed for a week in February, at the height of the Sydney heatwave.  With a balcony overlooking the beach, this was a superb hotel to spend a few days in. The nearby ferry (10 minutes walk) meant we could explore Sydney harbour.  Our room was modern and clean, with very comfortable bed (puffy pillows) and large bathroom. Air conditioning good. A very pleasant area for walks with beachside bars and restaurants and good shops. The hotel staff were also very helpful throughout our stay.  We hope to return again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461702542~“Great location good accommodation ”~Perfect location across the road from the beach. Walking distance to the bars, restaurants and the Manly ferry crossing.

review_460765312~“Very nice Hotel”~We booked for 4 nights during in January for the Australia Day holiday through Accor Vacation club. Reception staff were fantastic , very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is nice but in need of some TLC. Our room was great,, comfortable bed, nice Bathroom, and lounge room leading to a balcony. the only thing I didn't understand is why there is a full size kitchen,, heaps of cupboards ,, small fridge,, full benchtop with a sink, but only a jug and cups and glasses ,,,no microwave or cooktop,, overall a nice place to stay~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459481634~“Excellent Service, Probably Best "Mainstream" Option in Manly”~I stayed with The Sebel Manly Beach more than 10 times over the past few years. The location, directly opposite South Steyne in Manly is second to none - if you're in the main property (front), you have a really good chance of beach / sunrise views, which are breathtaking. Although pretty basic (very clean, very functional), the rooms are not inexpensive - you are definitely paying a premium for the location, however, where The Sebel really makes up ground is in the quality of service from the international team. From the room service team to the front desk team, even e-mail interactions are pleasant, prompt and efficient. I have been delighted by complimentary gift hampers, assistance with luggage, booking babysitters - overall awesome.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458411146~“Stroll along the beach, watch the sunrise, if in any back pain at all go see The Happy Body Clinic Manly .”~Hi  We have stayed 3 times now on our anniversary. The last time the porter saw me struggling in pain and kindly recommended I see The Happy Body Clinic in Manly. I googled it and was very impressed at what they do there. JUST GO IF IN PAIN. I only live 1 hour away and I will never go back to chiro. The best place to eat a delicious pizza is about a 15 min walk in Belgrave Street called Jerry's Pizza, charming place, but we got take away and sat on the beach and had a picnic. Location of Sebel is fantastic, Helpful staff and lots of places to choose to eat out.  Didn't like the local Greek restaurant close by, but lovely lunch at Havana's very close.  Enjoy your stay~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_457263041~“Good Hotel, Great Beach Location”~Stayed at this hotel over the Australia Day weekend. The room was comfortable and was reasonably well maintained.  The location opposite Manly beach is ideal and is also close to shops and restaurants in the area. Have also stayed at the Novotel Manly previously, both hotels are of a similar standard, although the rooms a the Sebel have a small kitchenette enabling in room cooking and are probably slightly newer.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456656254~“Best beachside location”~Enjoyed a clean spacious and very comfortable aptmt, with 180 degree beautiful view across from the beach, famous Norfolk pines and promenade. Opposite surf club and flagged swimming area, and very near to the Shelly Beach walk. Jimmy and other reception staff were so friendly and obliging with every request - even volunteered to carry bags to my car free of charge. Security lift, pleasant spa/pool area. Parking underneath a bit tight but cool and secure. Attached is a wonderfully atmospheric and breezy street cafe/bar/restaurant, and its not far to walk to the ice creamery and popular Corso. A rare treat!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_454805223~“Great location ”~Great Location across the road from Manly Beach, shops and restaurants all close by. The staff were lovely, the rooms are spacious and super comfy bed!

review_453462120~“4 nights in Manly”~An excellent stay in a quality hotel.. From the the complimentary coffee in the coffee shop while our room was prepared to the complimentary use of beach towels and beach umbrella during our stay this has been a lovely experience. The staf were always happy friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, quiet and spaciouse with a lovely balcony and beach views. The final surprise was our complimentary parking. I will definitely be returning to the Sebel for our annual Manly stay.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_453302088~“Great location exceptional service”~Manly beach is a wonderful place to stay - 18 mins fast ferry to Sydney but a world away of beaches, snorkelling, surfing and sea side life with a chic edge.  I would highly recommend staying here in the north tower ie fronting onto the beach. We had a lovely room - 404 overlooking the beach which is right across the road from the beach. The hotel supplies plenty of beach towels water, sun cream and boogie boards.  The bar and restaurant are very good. Good cocktails service and delicious fish especially the sashimi starter.  We checked out for one night to go the Blue Mountains when we checked back in our bags were in our favourite room with a sweet welcome back note and chocolates.  The staff helped book various activities for us when the lack of an Oz mobile prevented it - the open air cinema on the harbour and made good recommendations for food.  The travel agents messed up our booking re room type but the hotel sorted it as soon as they could and with no fuss and stood us dinner and drinks our first night.  As you can tell from above, really the best thing about the Sebel is the staff. A wonderful bunch of professional, friendly and fun people. Everyone who works here is a credit to themselves and Accor hotel group but special mention for Monica who looked after us so well and at times above and beyond the call of duty. Also big thanks to all the managers we came across including Jimmy.  We will be back  PS The south/back tower is substandard in many ways especially location, decor and the walk way to it. I know Accor are trying to upgrade but the sooner the better and they should be careful te room classification given the "view ",~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451578816~“Fabulous!”~I really enjoyed the Sebel, although it is not cheap. It is reasonable for Sydney/Manly standards. The hotel is very well managed, clean and very comfortable. My view wasn't great, but it was ok for a 2 day layover through Australia. I love that the hotel was with in close walking distance of the beach, amazing restaurants, and cafes. I was visiting friends, so I didn't explore the area very much, but did enjoy a little shopping. All in all a great place.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450299549~“The South Tower is pretty mediocre”~Why do the reviews for this place vary so much? Presumably it is because the quality of the rooms/apartments are so different. We had a studio room in the South Tower which could best be described as 'utilitarian'. On the positive side: the location of the Sebel is good - (though the South Tower unlike the main building is not opposite the beach). The restaurant and bar attached to the Sebel are very good. The staff were friendly and helpful. The furniture in the studio was very basic - though the room itself was quite a good size. The TV was fine. The bed was OK - though the bedding was stained. The walls were marked. The bathroom was OK - shower no bath, and rather oddly no exhaust fan which meant the bathroom filled up with steam after a shower; there was a warning not to leave the bathroom door open after a shower to avoid the fire alarm being activated! The toiletries were OK but the two towels were pretty threadbare (they do provide beach towels at reception, which is good). I think the problem is the lack of competition in Manly - I'm not sure anywhere else in Manly is much better.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_449051136~“Old, filthy, disgusting”~The bed sheet with a distinct hole right at the top caught my eyes the moment I stepped into the room. Dirty bathroom floor with marks everywhere; no saucer for mugs or no tray for tea spoons - worse than a cheap street cafe. Seriously, are they in their right mind when doing these things? Old, cheap furniture throughout. Malfunctioning TV remote- I gave it up after a few frustrating attempts. Old TV with lagging response and poor picture quality- worse than cheap Chinese TVs found in motels. Dirty kettle with some old water left - did they expect me to drink it or clean the kettle? Dirty old bedside table lamp. No secure wifi access. Revolting smell throughout the hotel. To make matters worse beyond all imagination, there was no running water early in the morning (probably from 5am or earlier) till about 8.30am. Stay away for your sanity.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449037458~“Another great stay @ the Sebel”~This is the third time we've stayed at the Manly Sebel, but the first in the middle of summer. The location just can't be beat - right across the road from the beach (and a quieter end of the beach at that - it's two blocks away from the Corso). We had a great view from the balcony. Rooms are perfectly adequate in terms of facilities (although a microwave would have been handy to have in the kitchenette area - a small gripe only). Staff were always very helpful and cheerful throughout the stay. Looking forward to returning soon.~5~4~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_447366935~“Absolutely amazing Christmas stay!!”~My fiancé and I came from London to visit my 2 sisters in Manly for Christmas and have had the most fantastic stay at The Sebel!  The staff have been so SO friendly and accommodating as my nieces and nephew came to visit and play in the pool (which is brilliant!) and even treated them all to teddy bears when they were with me in the lobby.  I have really high standards and cannot fault them for anything!  Our room (403) had an amazing view of the beach and its own little balcony which was great just to chill out on. The lobby has sunblock in case you run out, cold water and an endless supply of beach towels. Parking is a bit tight but right underneath the building and at $20 for 24 hours is wayyy better than parking on the beach front which is $13 per hour!  Brilliant location and wonderful hotel!  We stayed at the Novotel last time and this has out shone that by a mile! I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again!  Thank you to all the staff on from 23rd - 30th December 2016 - you deserve medals!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_447041499~“Email to Accor complaining about misleading website - avoid the south tower ”~Booked months in advance for family (5) lifetime trip to Oz over Xmas and NYE. Booked the only room (suite!?!?) that took 5 people. We were booked for three nights but checked out after one. Room was in south block away from main hotel accessed by lane. Had seen better days, overlooked a building site and was too small. The website does not show ANY room shots of the south tower.....only of the lovely main hotel sea view suites. Interestingly they will not accommodate 5 in the master sea view suite despite it being far bigger than these hovels in the south block. Ultimately booked into Pullman in Sydney downtown for remainder of the stay....at considerable expense. I will be writing to Accor group recommending they reprimand the owner of this unit and to get their website to a level that allows guests to make an informed choice about their accommodation. Staff couldn't have been friendlier and confided that they constantly have issues like this with the south block.....come on sebel manly....you can do better!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446818505~“Great spot in Manly”~Stayed here over Christmas in an Ocean view studio. Very close to the beach. Waves lulled me to sleep and beckoned me for an early swim, great for surfing. Recommend room 602 for fantastic views, and away from street noise. Reception were helpful and friendly. Didn't use the pool or restaurant, so can't comment on them. Highly recommend if you want a break in Manly.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_445162030~“Really great place to stay”~Stayed here with the family, boys 8 and 12, and really a fantastic hotel. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Great location straight opposite Manly Beach and a 5 minute walk to the wharf and ferries. We stayed in a family room and it was great to have the kids in a separate room. Two small pools, one heated. But you don't need a pool with the beach opposite. Has a laundry room to do your own washing and drying which was really handy. Would definitely recommend and would come back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444737895~“save your money”~I rarely get disappointed with my accommodation choices but this was one of those times. There are two towers the north and the south tower. The north has the possibility of Ocean views which would be nice. The South tower has no such luck. This is where we stayed with views over the dumpsters. To get the reception you had to walk down dumpster lane and go into the north tower from the back, lucky for us it didn't rain. The staff we came across were very nice. The room was a reasonable size and the bed was comfortable but the remote had a very long lag time. This was explained as having something to do with the internet ? My husband wanted to know, the internet in what country... afghanistan ?~2~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_444362331~“Wonderful experience”~We stayed in the family unit at the South Tower. Carpark is right below the rooms but is extremely small. I had to drive around twice to find the entrance to the parking lot as it is not connected to the main building. It'll be helpful if they had a large sign pointing to it. Parking is about $20 ++ per day. The sofa in the room can be extended to become a bed but no bedsheets are provided. We took out the topsheet from the queen bed and used it as a bedsheet for the sofa bed. Also, it's quite flimsy so I wouldn't not recommend the sofa bed to be used for adults.  There is a huge sandpit of unfinished construction where the room was facing so we couldn't eat outside the room. The wind kept blowing some of the dust up. It was a pity we had to keep the balcony door closed all the time and activate the air conditioning. Laundry room at the south tower is free to use with satchets of laundry powder provided. The room is open 7am to 9pm. There are 2 washers and only 1 dryer.  Overall, the unit is very comfortable with more than adequate toiletries provided. The hotel provides free use of beach towels at the main tower and the location is really everything. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend The Sebel for a wonderful experience.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_443700082~“Amazing location”~The SEBEL is in a perfect location.

We have found all the reception staff to be friendly and helpful and totally charming, nothing is too much trouble. They responded to emailed queries before we arrived with speed and efficiency.  We would definitely recommend the SEBEL and would stay here again if we come back to Sydney.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_443651592~“Keep away form the function room”~We were booked on the first floor above the function room, it was like trying to sleep on a base speaker. After complaining we were told that "someone should have informed you when you booked" and that there is functions every Friday, Saturday and sometimes Sunday evening. As i had pre paid for 2 nights and was locked into an Accor Vacation club seminar with penalites for a no show i couldn't up and leave. We were moved to a higher room next evening. Its a good spot just make sure you get as high a room as possible and at the opposite end to the function rooms~2~nan~4~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_443243833~“And this is why we keep coming back!”~This is my third stay at the Sebel Manly...yes the view is unrivalled and the rooms are fabulous, but the reason I keep coming back here for both business and a bit of family fun is purely because of Kyong and his team. Ordinarily I would find it hard to use the word 'team' and 'hotel' in the same sentence BUT I have personally witnessed the respect that Thea Sebel team display towards their manager Kyond but more tellingly and wonderfully, his genuine respect towards his team! As such, it naturally follows that this is a happy and positive environment and that is reflected by every single interaction I have had with each staff member here...every single one going the extra mile to accommodate guests needs and make them happy! Well done team Sebel...impressive and that is why I will continue to come back (that and the brilliantly welcoming personal note written on our mirror! Love it!) Many thanks!

review_442294648~“Pleasantly surprised by location, outlook (Ocean View) & staff.”~Firstly, I should mention that my wife & I are AVC (Accor timeshare) members and that AVC recently (Oct.2016) added some rooms at this property to their list of destinations. As we had some AVC points that were due to expire soon, we used them for a 4 night stay at one of the AVC Deluxe (read Ocean View) Studio rooms at Sebel Manly. As such, there was no issue with the per-night cost of the room, and our expectations were not set too high. From this, we were pleasantly surprised that our room was perfectly located with a balcony that directly looked over Manly's ocean beach. The balcony had double-glazed windows and doors so that you could close the balcony door and enjoy the quiet of the room & its effective air-conditioning, or you could open the balcony door and enjoy the sounds of the ocean waves crashing gently onto the beach opposite (so soothing). This Deluxe Studio room is a "split-level" room with the living area / desk nearest the balcony with the bed slightly elevated (one step up) With a safety rail between the two and the TV centrally located in the mid-point near the step. Its like two half-rooms in one Studio room. I have found from our experience that AVC properties have typically not been overly central to the main attractions of the area (ie. They can be up to a few kilometres out of town). However, if the Sebel Manly was any more centrally located, you would require a pair of googles and a snorkel to check in! In this respect. this is the best AVC property I have stayed at since joining many years ago.  The room and location was also well complemented by enthusiastic and attentive staff who were keen to help us with any questions that we had during our stay. Overall, we had a very enjoyable and relaxing break in our first (but not our last) visit to Manly.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_441783756~“Please update TVs”~Greetings. After my last stay at Sebel Manly i decided to stay once again and was totally impressed once more. Room 506 was big,spacious with a balcony looking over the beach and another in the bedroom looking towards Sydney cbd. Was happy with laundry facilities and bathroom amenities. No mini bar but a fridge and coles supermarket just up the road.  The only minor negative part was the tvs,please update these. Thanks Sebel Manly beach.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
