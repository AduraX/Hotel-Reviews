review_479000437~“Worst stay ever”~This was about the 6th or 7th time we have stayed at the Novotel Sydney Central and by far the worst stay that we have experienced.  The standard from both Hotel and Restaurant has dropped significantly and what drew us to staying at the Novotel Sydney Central has now been eroded.~1~nan~4~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_478702974~“Felt like coming home each night”~It was a trip to Sydney for some medical treatment and so it was tough going, but returning each night to the Novotel felt like coming home. It was comfortable, clean and the staff made us feel so welcomed.  The location was perfect - close to Central Train Station, and Chinatown.  The room was super comfortable with everything you could need: a great bed, lovely toiletries and space! The air conditioning was also faultless - just what we needed given Sydney was going through a heat wave! The breakfast buffet did not disappoint. Hot and cold temptations, and a "make your own juice" machine that actually worked!  It might not be the cheapest place to stay in Sydney but for us, it was definitely value for money. Highly recommend!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan

review_478098363~“Good value hotel with handy location”~Our family has stayed in this hotel through the years from when it was still known as Carlton Crest, mainly due to the size of its rooms where 2 QS beds comfortably sit, to its handy location to Chinatown, Darling Harbour, Paddys, Central station, George St, etc. Has heaps of parking with really cheap rates. Buffet breakfast is great to start the day and the staff are so friendly, nothing is a problem. A hidden gem in Sydney I say!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan

review_473732568~“Convenient and quiet location despite being in the heart of Chinatown.”~We stayed in a king room with a balcony for 5 nights. It is located in a super convenient area with groceries, markets and fantastic asian restaurants all within walking distance. We also had a car, so having the carpark next to it helped alot. The carpark is not a Novotel carpark, so people who stay get a discounted rate as well as multiple exits and entries at a flat rate per day. Our room was nice and clean and you can tell they updated the rooms a few years ago. The balcony was a bit smaller than I expected but still was nice to just sit outside. The washroom was clean and updated too, but the ceiling showed it's true age. All the staff, including cleaning staff were nice. The only minor negative is that the buffet breakfast was the same each day with very little change in variety. Overall, I'd stay again purely because of the reasonable price, the location and cleanliness of the room.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_468477545~“Novotel experience”~This was my first stay at the Novotel in Haymarket in Sydney. I stayed for one night on a business trip. I have stayed at a few Novotel properties in Australia and Europe and this one lived up to the standards. Not five star but comfortable, clean and with all of the services you expect from a Business Hotel. My stay was short so I didn't have a chance to try out any of the nearby restaurants but there are plenty to choose from. The hotel is centrally located to both Darling Harbour and the CBD and Central Station is a short walk away. Room service was great including some poached eggs on toast for a bite to eat after arriving late from the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_468413898~“Comfort in the city”~The Novotel Sydney Central is clean, comfortable, quiet and perfect for a business visit to Sydney. A few simple strides to Central Train Station and the light rail. Close to restaurants and the CBD.  Staff are very friendly. The room service menu is well thought out and the food has been consistently good.  The bathroom in 1022 is luxurious in look but VERY small.  The beds are very comfortable and the room is super quiet.  The views are nothing but if your looking for somewhere to stay that's clean and comfortable then Novotel Sydney Central is the place for you.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468395004~“Comfortable hotel”~I recently stayed overnight at this hotel, and found it to be pretty good. The location is very convenient to Central Station (especially as it's next to the Goods Line which connects with the Devonshire Street Tunnel), but as the hotel is on a back street it's not affected by street noise. My room was large and well equipped, and had an OK view. There are some ways the hotel could improve though. Most notably, the rooms should really have light curtains as well as the main ones so that you can let some light in without the people in the office building next door looking straight into the room. The noisy and non-stop fan in the bathroom was also annoying, but closing the bathroom door blocks almost all its noise from the room.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_467123403~“One Night, one day Sydney Stopover”~Great Hotel, Great friendly Staff, quality check-in service, well appointed rooms, although views not great, wonderful lobby bar, again attentive staff even though very busy at times, wonderful lobby restaurant elegantly separated from the Main reception Lobby and Bar by what appears to be a chainmail dividing curtain. Dinner was superb, tasty quality food, steaks, oysters, seafood all very tasty with a good selection of deserts and good service. Bar and Restaurant staff knowledgeable about the wines they were serving. Not hesitant to make dish and wine recommendations. Breakfast was a huge buffet selection and was excellent. Could not fault this hotel and again we received the courtesies of being ACCOR CLUB members. A hotel to be recommended for both business and stopover or stay over in Sydney as very centrally located to trains, both city train and regional trains, which we used both and also within walking distance to the free bus in George street that goes to Circular Quay. But we used the train just a couple of minutes. NOVOTEL CENTRAL is a great 4.5 star property and ticks all the right boxes for us. Ser~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465577358~“NIce and central location”~Wanted an early check-in (which i'd already emailed about) but no rooms available unless we paid for an upgrade.

Overall very good, very friendly, some issues with housekeeping but they were dealt with as you'd expect.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464663276~“Review for a function - great food and service”~I had to book a location for a conference dinner for 35 people. After getting several quotes I decided on the Novotel Sydney Central due to their flexibility on meeting my requirements and menu choice. They also reduced their initial quote to fit in with my budget - something they didn't have to do. The function room on the first floor above the foyer was very nice. The staff were flexible and assisted me in setting up the room the way I need it. The provided drinks package was a good mix of drinks which kept the participants well watered. And the food was very good, well above what you would expect for a banquet meal. The hotel was also very flexible in catering for dietary requirements. Overall they did a fantastic job, and I can't fault them in any area. Highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464399538~“Nasty surprises can happen at Accor”~Accor have a current TV Advertising campaign suggesting you can avoid "nasty surprises" by staying at hotels in their group. Not true I say, because Novotel Sydney Central gave me a very nasty surprise on March 1st when they charged me $600 instead of $50 on my credit card at check in without telling me. I had to tell them they'd made a mistake, but the real issue is they haven't sorted it out yet. This stay came no where near "exceeding my expectations" as the ad campaign suggests. The GM of this hotel owes me an apology and also I haven't got the $600 back yet either - almost 2 days after checking out and almost 4 days since alerting them to this self admitted error. So yes "nasty surprises do happen at Accor Hotels" and it's not good enough! Don't believe the TV Ad, hopefully Accor can bring Novotel Sydney Central up to standard.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461287394~“sleepover”~The Novotel Sydney Central is in an excellent location for travellers like us, who arrive in Sydney by train and catch another to the airport.

review_460869469~“Pleasant Stay Experience”~Love my stay at Novotel Sydney Central.  The room was neat, clean and spacious and the room service was prompt. Was here for about 10 days and there wasn't much variation in the service quality. They do have a microwave in the room if you wish to get some ready to eat / frozen food. the swimming pool is kind of small, but it's somewhat understandable, given the location and space availability. Breakfast at it's restaurant Fieldhouse, was nice. the staff was very courteous and helpful. The breakfast menu is kind of fixed, but it is elaborate, so i personally didn't find it monotonous.  Proximity to Darling Harbour was an added advantage. Central Station is a comfortable 10 minute walk from the hotel. A lot of dining out options close by. Saw a lot of airline staff at the hotel,even though it is not very close to the airport. for me it was kind of a proxy indicator that it is a good option for stay ;) Getting a cab is also easy a few cabs are always available right outside the hotel. p.s. avoid exploring the fire exit, they kind of get locked from the inside :|~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458356331~“Poor poor poor ”~Location ok, lobby looks good. But this is again one of those old hotels that have been renovated to charge higher... 10 stairs to reach the lobby (convenient when you carry luggage...) room was old style, bathroom ventilation system can't be turned off and is so loud... shower with little water pressure, female hair in my bathroom (I am a male). Very poor TV channel choices. No restaurants nearby so I ended up in the hotel restaurant which is equally poor... stay away ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458029749~“nothing great”~we stayed here as a family of 4 in the twin room accomodation for 2 nights, both the nights the AC was not cooling, only on the first day it worked after we checked in the afternoon for a few hours, after which the compressor gas was very minimally functioning despite keeping the room at 20 degress which was giving off an ambient inside temp of 25 degrees as noted on the ac gauge. Also there were hardly any teabags for 4 people, and such little milk packets, i had even left a message for the cleaner to leave more breakfast teabags and milk as we are a family of 4 staying there and there was just 2 left. i dont understand why is the reason for such minimalist attitude when a charge of 1000 dollars for 2 nights ! The only decent thing was the buffet breakfast. we wont be coming back here again~2~nan~5~nan~nan~4~2~nan

My father had just arrived from the UK, and suffers from bad knees so location and comfort was crucial. Thankfully, this Novotel provided it! The rooms were nicely decorated, large, comfortable and spacious. We were on the sixteenth floor, so we had nice views looking towards Darling Harbour. The proximity to Central Station was excellent, especially with my father. Equally, you can easily walk into the CBD too. Breakfast had a large variety and great coffee.

review_456295753~“Location, beds and great staff”~This hotel is tucked behind a wonderful building facade near the historic goods line rail in inner Sydney. It is a 5 minute walk from Central Station and approx 15 mins from the Airport via the Airport train to Central (3 stops). It has a lovely bistro housed in the old fairhaven goods wharehouse attached. They do great breakfast and dinner is simple good quality fare with a very decent wine list. The location is right next to the George Street access into China Town, Korea Town and quick buses to Circular Quay and outer suburbs. The rooms are typical simple tasteful uncluttered Novotel decor, they have superb beds for restorative sleep after a day's travel or activity and are incredibly quiet, considering the location. For families, there is a delightful pool, outdoor bar and snacks area on the 8th floor where you can swim off the day's running around and have a cold one as the fairy lights come on amongst the trees, or simply kick back with a picnic and a book and a siesta in the afternoon rays after a hectic morning. The furnishings are not pristine, in fact the decor is getting worn and at some point will no doubt be upgraded and replaced, but it is clean, all facilities work well and those beds are worth the night's stay. In particular, staff are wonderful, Peter and the front of house team are fantastic, friendly and knowledgable. The restaurant manageress and her team are kind, and professional and can help with food and wine matching if you feel like trying a glass of something different. The lamb and Waygu beef we had was high quality product, cooked beautifully with a crisp, zesty salad and superb thick cut chips, just the thing. Check in and Check out were a breeze and there is a wonderful cool calmness about this establishment and you can see why many international pilots and air crew teams choose to stay here. We spoke to them and they said it was location, beautiful beds to support optimum sleep, and access to great shopping in a limited time frame, so if you had more time to spare imagine how much you could explore. There is a great little hairdressing salon in the arcade across the road, run by a handsome japanese dude who does wonderful wash/steamcondition/ head massage/ blowdry treatments for very reasonable prices if you want a quick pamper before dinner out on the town and they accept 'walk ins'. The chinese gardens are nearby and are of beautiful design, with waterfalls, pagodas, a fantastic chinese teahouse for cuppas and pastries, and the fun bonus of being very family friendly with childrens treasure hunt activities and dress ups to hire for fun photos ($5, $10) at very reasonable prices. The history and donated artworks alone make this charming, beautiful garden a must for a morning stroll prior to lunch on the harbour and a ferry trip to Manly to swim for the afternoon. We had an excellent stay at this hard working little hotel and would definately come back - congratulations Novotel Sydney Central, you are up there with the big guns, only with a more personalised service in many ways. We used this hotel as a base for a short stay 3 nights and a concert at the Opera House we attended - it was perfect.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan

review_478087388~“Could be better”~Went to Sydney for a quick visit and decided to stay at Novotel, I mean what could go wrong with Novotel right? Location was great, room was excellent, check in was good. Other staff members we have came across with at the front desk were not very friendly. I especially have to mention our check-out experience, perhaps she was in a bad mood but there were no basic greetings, no "how are you?/how was your stay?", just a blank face asking me if we've used the Internet or had anything from the minibar, that was it. I don't think she knew the basics of building rapport with customers. Also, another issue we had on the last night of our stay was that house keepers have left clean towels on the luggage stand on top of a suitcase when there were empty spaces in the bathroom. Not sure what happened there. Overall, it was an average stay. Quite disappointing as we've stayed at other Novotels overseas and have always been extremely happy.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472248126~“Horible Experience of Hotel Facilities (Pool, Laundry)”~I stayed in Novotel Sydney Central from 23rd to 25th March 2017 in room 1514. I was with my aged parents and wife. I had checked over phone of the pool facility and was told it had a jaccuzi. My parents wanted to relax at the hot water pool on 24th March. When I went to the pool, it was freezing cold. I reported the same to the reception, manager in charge . All that I got was a lame answer-"We did all we could. turned on the thermostat and checked with service engineer, but could not fix it". We (Parents, wife,myself) waited for 1.5 hours with the hope that the water heated up over time. However it was all futile and my parents who are tourists to Sydney, could not enter the water and my wife caught cold post that. When I returned to my room, the manager in charge called and informed me that I would not be compensated in anyway as they had tried everything. The least I was expecting(considering Novotel being a big brand)was something in return so that my parents who were tourists went back with happy memories from Sydney. However, we were treated extremely poorly and the responses was-"we can write anything on social media and hotel did not care". Adding on to our woes- when my wife called up to find out the charges for laundry facility- she was informed of an incorrect amount for the automatic wash and dry. She went couple of floors below for the facility and had to call me back to get additional cash as she had been misinformed by facilities on the charges. Overall , we have come back with a poor experience. I have visited Novotel accross North America, Canada and Australia and hope that someone listens and does more than just -"sorry , we tried our best"~2~2~3~3~3~3~2~nan

We saw a show at the Lyric Theatre and it was an easy light rail trip back to the hotel. We were able to enjoy a discount promotion for breakfast, adults $20 and children ate free. The breakfast buffet was delicious. They also had a happy hour 5-7pm in the bar with a range of drinks being $5, and cocktails were 2 for the price of one.

A few simple strides to Central Train Station and the light rail. Close to restaurants and the CBD.  Staff are very friendly. The room service menu is well thought out and the food has been consistently good.  The bathroom in 1022 is luxurious in look but VERY small.  The beds are very comfortable and the room is super quiet.  The views are nothing but if your looking for somewhere to stay that's clean and comfortable then Novotel Sydney Central is the place for you.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468395004~“Comfortable hotel”~I recently stayed overnight at this hotel, and found it to be pretty good. The location is very convenient to Central Station (especially as it's next to the Goods Line which connects with the Devonshire Street Tunnel), but as the hotel is on a back street it's not affected by street noise. My room was large and well equipped, and had an OK view. There are some ways the hotel could improve though. Most notably, the rooms should really have light curtains as well as the main ones so that you can let some light in without the people in the office building next door looking straight into the room. The noisy and non-stop fan in the bathroom was also annoying, but closing the bathroom door blocks almost all its noise from the room.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

review_467448975~“Arctic”~Recently attended a conference and the rooms were arctic. While there was temperature cintril, the only way we were able to control conditions was to turn it off. We had wifi problems, staff attended promptly but couldn't address the issue - indicating it was the user machines in error - not great in customer service.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467123403~“One Night, one day Sydney Stopover”~Great Hotel, Great friendly Staff, quality check-in service, well appointed rooms, although views not great, wonderful lobby bar, again attentive staff even though very busy at times, wonderful lobby restaurant elegantly separated from the Main reception Lobby and Bar by what appears to be a chainmail dividing curtain. Dinner was superb, tasty quality food, steaks, oysters, seafood all very tasty with a good selection of deserts and good service. Bar and Restaurant staff knowledgeable about the wines they were serving. Not hesitant to make dish and wine recommendations. Breakfast was a huge buffet selection and was excellent. Could not fault this hotel and again we received the courtesies of being ACCOR CLUB members. A hotel to be recommended for both business and stopover or stay over in Sydney as very centrally located to trains, both city train and regional trains, which we used both and also within walking distance to the free bus in George street that goes to Circular Quay. But we used the train just a couple of minutes. NOVOTEL CENTRAL is a great 4.5 star property and ticks all the right boxes for us. Ser~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465577358~“NIce and central location”~Wanted an early check-in (which i'd already emailed about) but no rooms available unless we paid for an upgrade. It was a nice room with a small balcony so no complaints. Used the restaurant for an evening meal and one breakfast but pricy.  Overall very good, very friendly, some issues with housekeeping but they were dealt with as you'd expect.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464663276~“Review for a function - great food and service”~I had to book a location for a conference dinner for 35 people. After getting several quotes I decided on the Novotel Sydney Central due to their flexibility on meeting my requirements and menu choice. They also reduced their initial quote to fit in with my budget - something they didn't have to do. The function room on the first floor above the foyer was very nice. The staff were flexible and assisted me in setting up the room the way I need it. The provided drinks package was a good mix of drinks which kept the participants well watered. And the food was very good, well above what you would expect for a banquet meal. The hotel was also very flexible in catering for dietary requirements. Overall they did a fantastic job, and I can't fault them in any area. Highly recommended.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464399538~“Nasty surprises can happen at Accor”~Accor have a current TV Advertising campaign suggesting you can avoid "nasty surprises" by staying at hotels in their group. Not true I say, because Novotel Sydney Central gave me a very nasty surprise on March 1st when they charged me $600 instead of $50 on my credit card at check in without telling me. I had to tell them they'd made a mistake, but the real issue is they haven't sorted it out yet. This stay came no where near "exceeding my expectations" as the ad campaign suggests. The GM of this hotel owes me an apology and also I haven't got the $600 back yet either - almost 2 days after checking out and almost 4 days since alerting them to this self admitted error. So yes "nasty surprises do happen at Accor Hotels" and it's not good enough! Don't believe the TV Ad, hopefully Accor can bring Novotel Sydney Central up to standard.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461287394~“sleepover”~The Novotel Sydney Central is in an excellent location for travellers like us, who arrive in Sydney by train and catch another to the airport. All we need in food and entertainment is within a short distance from the hotel, as is Central Station. The hotel staff are efficient and the rooms comfortable. What more could you ask for?~4~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_460869469~“Pleasant Stay Experience”~Love my stay at Novotel Sydney Central.  The room was neat, clean and spacious and the room service was prompt. Was here for about 10 days and there wasn't much variation in the service quality. They do have a microwave in the room if you wish to get some ready to eat / frozen food. the swimming pool is kind of small, but it's somewhat understandable, given the location and space availability. Breakfast at it's restaurant Fieldhouse, was nice. the staff was very courteous and helpful. The breakfast menu is kind of fixed, but it is elaborate, so i personally didn't find it monotonous.  Proximity to Darling Harbour was an added advantage. Central Station is a comfortable 10 minute walk from the hotel. A lot of dining out options close by. Saw a lot of airline staff at the hotel,even though it is not very close to the airport. for me it was kind of a proxy indicator that it is a good option for stay ;) Getting a cab is also easy a few cabs are always available right outside the hotel. p.s. avoid exploring the fire exit, they kind of get locked from the inside :|~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459974000~“Overnight stay”~Overnight stay for a concert. Had previously stayed at the hotel and was impressed at the staff and rooms (was upgraded through Le club). This time the first room was very noisy (ventilation) and had a large iron burn in the carpet. Much less than what we expected. A quick chat with the friendly staff had everything resolved for a pleasant stay~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_459823882~“good family holiday stay option”~The room was comfortably sized and clean and comfortable. We had a view over office buildings which was good - better than the other side which is looking over messy apartment blocks. Staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast was great - lots of options and choice. Go early to avoid the rush as it gets very busy.  Pillows were a bit lumpy but other than that, all great. Close to all we needed, and close to Central.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_459396635~“Horrible mistake I have ever made”~I prepaid 11days hotel fee for this hotel, the room that I booked balcony and a kind size bed. Before I pay it I check the room from their website picture, the picture looks really good, but the truth is the room does not look like they showed in their picture. Half of the room is empty and the sheet is not clean at all. So I ask for check out second day, they denied it, I am so disappointed and so regret to choose this hotel. It ruined my trip! So I would like to recommend you do not make same mistake as I do. And hope you enjoy your trip in other hotel! Do not choose this hotel.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458784498~“Second stay, second upgrade! ”~My husband and I have stayed here twice, both times just as a bit of an escape from a crowded house.  Both time we have stayed we have been upgraded to the executive floor and a suite.  Sure the hotel rooms could probably do with an update but they very clean, very comfortable and facilities are great. For the price you pay this is a good standard of hotel, close to everything and the staff are alway great.  We like it here and when we need to escape our crowded house and get some us time we will be back. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458576746~“We needed a break from the heat and found the right place”~After working all week in 43 Deg heat on the NSW Central Coast, we needed a break from Sydney's heatwave to catch up on lost sleep at the weekend. We found exactly what we were looking for in this hotel - aircon was very cooling, a pool to jump into, eating and coffee places nearby and a comfortable king room on the executive level at an affordable price. We chilled out and had a quiet time together catching up on reading and just doing nothing for a change.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_458029749~“nothing great”~we stayed here as a family of 4 in the twin room accomodation for 2 nights, both the nights the AC was not cooling, only on the first day it worked after we checked in the afternoon for a few hours, after which the compressor gas was very minimally functioning despite keeping the room at 20 degress which was giving off an ambient inside temp of 25 degrees as noted on the ac gauge. Also there were hardly any teabags for 4 people, and such little milk packets, i had even left a message for the cleaner to leave more breakfast teabags and milk as we are a family of 4 staying there and there was just 2 left. i dont understand why is the reason for such minimalist attitude when a charge of 1000 dollars for 2 nights ! The only decent thing was the buffet breakfast. we wont be coming back here again~2~nan~5~nan~nan~4~2~nan
