review_472102328~‚ÄúNot the best choice üëé‚Äù~We wanted a cheap clean hotel room for the night before heading off on a cruise that left from Sydney . 2 adults and 2 kids .. this would probably be the worst place we've ever stayed at .. we arrived late evening , took 20 min to find someone to check us in , no elevator so we had to drag our luggage up stairs , the room had a really bad damp smell and it was that bad we dropped our luggage off and had to leave ...  rooms have no facilities at all , and bathrooms are shared rooms with no working locks on toilets or full doors on showers ... only good thing was the bedding was nice and clean , and the staff was very friendly .. but never again ...~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_445964151~‚ÄúBetween a backpackers place and a hotel‚Äù~I stayed there for 2 nights. It was ok. The hotel is perfectly located. The room is very basic and the bathroom a bit out of date. (There were two bathrooms on my floor) Lots of noise from trafic and squeaky floors. I found it expensive for what it is, but then, I guess, it's the price to pay to be in the center of Sydney... very narrow staircase, not ideal to go up with a suitcase (and no one to help you carry it up). It's definitely a step up from your usual backpackers hole, but not quite a comfy hotel....~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428132079~‚ÄúBar & Breakfast‚Äù~Once I figured out how to check in the hotel was quirky but fine for short stay. Check in at the bar at street level. Bartender will check you in and give you directions to the room and where breakfast room is located. A bit quirky but cool expereince~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_426707590~‚ÄúBig mistake‚Äù~This hotel is very tired. Paint peeling off the walls and tiles missing off the walls of the shared bathroom. The shower curtain rail just staying in place. No desk of any sort in the bedroom. Very noisy room due to traffic.~1~nan~4~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_423964887~‚ÄúCentral Sydney Accommodation‚Äù~Location, location, location! This is probably the the best-priced accommodation in the centre of the financial district of Sydney. It is walking distance the Wynyard Railway Station, Barrungaroo and most central areas. That is the good news - the bad news is that the accommodation is fairly basic. It is like a country-pub accommodation room in the city. It is rough-around-the-edges, with accommodation at first and second floor via stairs and with communal toilets and showers. The bar provides food which is actually very good. But the room is somewhat noisey from the bar, but the double glazed windows cuts out just about all the road noise. Breakfast is of the all-day, bread with butter/margarine and jam plus coffee and tea in the communal kitchen variety. The room has single beds including bunk-style, TV and is air-conditioned. Would I go back - most likely if I was staying in the city overnight. This is a good option worth considering if all you want is a room for the night in the centre of Sydney, if you prefer to pay $125.00 per room for the night instead of $325.00!~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_420012872~‚ÄúGood Choice‚Äù~I loved this hotel as it was clean, safe and offered good service. The room was clean and safe. They have a kitchen on the second floor, and they reload the food and drinks everyday. The toilets and bathroom was very clean. Since it is located at town, it is easier for tourists to move around.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_369148852~‚ÄúExcellent location but not good service‚Äù~Centrally located in Sydney CBD walking distance to Wynyard station. Easy access to all the attractions in Sydney. Very old building and located above the bar. It was busy and noisy and sleep was extremely disturbed. Bathroom doors were not possible to lock and need refurbishment in all areas. Apart from the location there is nothing worth mentioning. Unless you do want to stay in CBD I do not recommend.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367150108~‚ÄúWas a delight‚Äù~This self-contained apartment did exceed my expectations, I stayed in the presidential suite one of the finest Wynyard had to offer, It was very spacious and had fantastic facilities, such as the gym down stairs and your own heated spa bath, it was a double bedroom, the cost was slightly high, though The service was outstanding couldn't fault it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_366762283~‚ÄúMotel close to CBD‚Äù~Nice motel, Location close to train station. The bed was good and surprisingly little noise from bar below and outside traffic.Only issue is, could do with attached shower room and hooks or hangers in the room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_344926123~‚ÄúBasic, budget accomodation‚Äù~We had a medium bedroom with a double bed, bar fridge, freestanding clothes rack, towels and toiletries.

review_260016059~‚ÄúMore like a hostel than a hotel‚Äù~Good location for the harbour district and Wynyard Station; . Small but atmospheric bar. Very basic room with comfy bed and clean, good quality sheets. Neither TV nor bed side light worked. Luckily it was a cool night as the ceiling fan went off with the main light.Good shower in the "shared bathroom" but tiling badly in need of repair. All the makings of an adequate breakfast in the communal kitchen but you need to supply your own milk and butter. We were not told about this on check-in. The bar closed at 11pm and we returned after closure. The place was closed the next day so no reception staff to complain to. There is a convenience store across the street but we were leaving early so gave up on breakfast. If you don't mind roughing it this is a reasonable place for a short stay. Very steep flights of stairs to the rooms. You get what you pay for!~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_242355038~‚ÄúSydney trip with my daughter‚Äù~The room was absolutely terrible, the TV did not work, there was no airconditioning, the electronic room key did not work and when we booked, in we were requested to pay $20 for the room key - I DID NOT, in any event it did not work. The share bathroom was disgusting, there was cracks on the floors and leaks from the shower and hand basin. I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN.  ~1~3~3~2~1~1~2~nan
review_240128863~‚Äúlocation‚Äù~right in the heart of Sydney, 5 mins walk to the rocks and the opera house. Very friendly staff. Has a small rooftop to have a few take away beers before you head out for the night.  Rooms could do with a paint, pillows if you could call them that could be replaced. showers and toilets of pub quality. Bed linen was fresh and clean. tv didn't work. The pub downstairs is small but awesome. Lets face it, your only using the place to sleep in after spending a night out on the town or seeing a show at the opera house than for around $100 this is the place to be. will stay hear again next time.~3~5~5~3~3~3~5~nan

review_194218328~‚ÄúGood location, NOTHING ELSE! PS- It's a hoStel, not hotel!‚Äù~I booked this hotel due to its location (good) and price (too much for what it is), but also by filtering results by taking out HOSTELS. Turns out this place is nothing else but a hostel, regardless of its name. And not even a good one! The shared bathrooms are below hostels standards, the rooms are small, old, smelly... The light on our room would turn itself off and on all the time, at any time. Including during the night! The TV wouldn't work... NO WINDOWS! Nobody cleaned the room every day. As in, not even making the bed...  Staff is beyond careless, but can't really be held accountable. It's not like they have anything to work with in the first place... Checkout was "lock your door and leave the key inside the room anywhere you want." FOR REAL!~1~2~4~1~1~1~2~nan
review_188331442~‚ÄúFelt unsafe...better off staying somewhere else‚Äù~Never before have I felt so unsafe in a hotel. My friend and I, being two young females just staying for one night, felt the need to push the hanging wardrobe rack and the bedside table up against the door. The place smells like old detergent, and we used the bathrooms at the bars we were at before we stayed at the hotel because we didn't want to use the bathrooms.  What scared us the most was that at the start of the night, the door of the room next to us was normal and like every other door. When we came back after a night out, the door was ruined. There were wood chips all over the floor and huge scratch (knife) lines carved into the door. Also, prior to staying, I asked a lady who was checking out how it was. She genuinely seemed freaked out and warned us not to stay there. She told us about how dingy it was and how she carried a knife to take a shower because she was so scared. I wouldn't recommend this place, pay a little extra and sleep with comfort.~2~2~3~2~2~2~3~nan
review_180574024~‚Äúgreat location & convenient to Wynyard Station‚Äù~Ok, this is a basic hotel which has been acquired by Merivale, perhaps deliberately running the place down before future a development plan ???  - but it did have character, there were actually things we liked: 1. great central location 3. friendly helpful staff 3. old fashioned opening windows 4. roof top area 5. laundry & self serve kitchen with plenty of breakfast cereals & toast available. 6. clean bed and linen So yes, the bathroom area was a bit like camping, but we already knew this when we booked the place. Unlike the other reviewer, we didn't try our key on any other rooms - or have anyone try their key on our room which seemed very private. I do agree with this reviewer though that it is a possible serious problem if all keys open all rooms, this issue should definitely be rectified a.s.a.p. Would I stay there again ? No, but Maybe ... perhaps for a better price .. I would like to say we stayed there because it was cheap, but for around $100 per night, maybe I'd find somewhere else next time.~2~3~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_179878610~‚ÄúNever Again‚Äù~I just spent 3 god awful days at the Wynyard.  The "continental" breakfast is an exaggeration and a half. Cereal, toast and milk are available in the kitchen area. There is absolutely no service. The room, toilets and bathroom are basic and there is no elevator. All this I could deal with.  What was horrible is that they have magnet keys that open the room doors. All the keys open the rooms. It is terrifying for a single female traveller to be sleeping and having 2 men opening the door to their room. They told me that their key opened every door. I was assured that they somehow had a master key, however, when I tried to unlock another door with my key, it opened the room.  This hotel is unsafe.  Also, it closes on Sunday so if you have a flight later in the day, they will not hold your bag for you.  I recommend paying the extra money to stay at an actual hotel.  ~1~2~3~nan~1~2~1~nan
review_178557140~‚ÄúPrime location, friendly staff, bar downstairs :)‚Äù~Excellent place. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in early (10:30 am) and they upgraded our room to family room (much larger). They also let us keep our room on the day of checking out, until 5 pm (to store our luggage). Please ignore the negative feedback regarding this hotel because I genuinely think it is a great place to stay. I've stayed in five star resorts and not enjoyed myself because the staff have been rude - that's the most important thing at the end of the day. The staff are super cool and I'd recommend staying here - especially if you're young and enjoy the nightlife; it's less suitable for families. Despite the place being old, the shared kitchen and bathroom facilities were always exceptionally clean and we didn't mind using them. We stayed there for six nights and don't have anything negative to say about the place, apart from the fact the wireless signal is pretty weak. The beds were very comfortable and the linen and towels fresh and clean. The bar downstairs means you'll never have to go far for a drink! The rooms also have fridges to store your own too, so overall it pretty much has everything you need. If you don't require absolute luxury at all times, then give it a chance! Otherwise, pay 2 - 3 times the price elsewhere :) Its general location and proximity to the Wynyard station is just awesome.~4~2~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_176917385~‚ÄúCheapest in central Sydney, but very basic‚Äù~Tiny rooms with almost no furniture. Kitchen is too small to properly cook. The place is not so clean, but nothing worse than old pubs when we were there. Very little staff , so not Much service.

review_170632711~‚ÄúGood location and cheap overnight stay‚Äù~Hotel was in a great location, just a short 5 min walk to Darling Harbour and 10 minute walk to Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. For one guy that was out from 7am through 10pm one night, it was perfect, because low cost, clean bed and close to everything. If you plan on spending anytime in your hotel room other than shower and sleep, this place is not for you, and you could go pay three times that to stay in location to have shower in room and tea/coffee facilities in room. But for me, that likes to see destination attractions, it was perfect.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_162349871~‚ÄúForget the ratings, this place is the pits but in a great location‚Äù~If you don't mind grubby shared bathrooms with doors that don't close and nothing in your room except 1 wooden chair, a fridge and an old TV sitting on top of the fridge, then you might consider this place.  The location is fantastic, just a few minutes to rail, buses and ferries.  The rest is very substandard.  We dropped off our bags so we could go sightseeing and they were left in the bar downstairs because our room wasn't 'ready'. If we had looked in the room we would have cancelled and demanded a refund. One thin blanket with no cover, nowhere to put anything except on the floor and a shared kitchen that also had the washing machine and ironing board. After complaining the the manager, she produced a rollaway hanger with some pockets to put stuff. We were tired, it was late, we decided to just put up with it. If the tarrif was $20 I would understand, but we paid A$100 per night and feel we were thoroughly ripped off. Our advice - stay away. There are other central hotels that are old but also clean and tidy. Stay there.~1~1~5~1~1~2~2~nan
review_162259793~‚ÄúGood action ONY‚Äù~Terrible place, very old, reception not good, bathroom dirty, room not comfortable, TV had 1 channel only which was controlled by the caretaker. We asked a place to store our luggage after the check-out and we were told to leave them in the middle of the pub downstairs which is open to the public. The location is the only good thing about it.~2~2~5~2~2~2~2~nan
review_161115916~‚ÄúWhat a joke‚Äù~I arrived here and could not believe what I was seeing. The website is so deceiving, I can't even begin to explain. The pub is so old, and has an eery feel. We walked in and it smelt like dirty washing liquid.  The room was actually just one small room. Extremely disappointing as there was no heating. We only stayed for about 30min, walked round the city, came back, and booked another hotel because Wynyard hotel was so small. The twin room is like a shoebox, we began to feel claustrophobic. The TV is old, the hanging wardrobe is actually a piece of material with 4 compartments hanging.  The communal facilities looked disgusting. I would definitely not recommend this even though its cheap. The room was so cold, I can't even imagine how cold it would be at night. Spend an extra bit more and you'll get something a million times better.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_158017632~‚ÄúEarly Arrival‚Äù~Arrived at Hotel of the plane from Heathrow rather early - but very helpful receptionist found a room as quickly as possible - most grateful after long flight - Excellent location for exploring the city being near the harbour bridge and all the sites of interest, together with very good transit facillities.  Accommodation comfortable and as you would expect from a hotel of this nature~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_154325460~‚ÄúIt's not so bad, it's a nice place.‚Äù~The Wynyard is an old pub dead set smack in the middle of Sydney and on the cusp of the busiest junction in the COUNTRY.  It's not flash, but is not Poo either. Stairs yes, but old creaky stairs full of character. linen and towels clean fresh and laundered. Shared bathrooms yes, but they were hot and quirky and gave us loads of amusing anecdotes after each use. Staff were fine, mute in all the right places and helpful on approach. $20 key deposit, even if you have payed upfront. Never went to the top floor laundry. Def would stay again.~3~4~5~4~3~3~3~nan
review_153747070~‚ÄúGive it a MISS.....‚Äù~Room had no window or ventilation. Had to climb 45 stairs to room. Bathroom mouldy and no exhaust fan - stinking and stale! Room too small for double bed, one side jammed against wall. TV reception terrible. Continental breakfast was included but when we went to have breakfast there was no bread for toast and cereal was stale....~1~1~5~1~1~1~1~nan
review_152781021~‚ÄúThey don't want normal people's business‚Äù~Was just walking past with my father, 63, after dinner with one shared bottle of wine. The barmaid asked us if we'd had a lot to drink and we said no, just a couple of glasses of wine.  She then said she couldn't serve us as she thought we had had too much to drink. She seemed to not be able to accept an older guy can't walk as fast as a 20 year old. My dad can take his time but was in no way drunk... Don't bother with this place if you can't bound in to the bar. We went up the road to the occidental and they were great.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_151784781~‚ÄúGreat location , friendly staff, clean linen, needing some TLC‚Äù~The location of the pub is perfect spot with easy walks to the train station and a short wall to Pitt street, darling harbour and circular quay. The linen is fresh and they have new carpet. The kitchen is ok. The cereal is stale but the toast was fine. They were out of a few items but when asked for tea bags I was given them right away. The bathrooms / showers are very old and hard to tell if they are clean and all shared. The kitchen is basic but u can cook your own meals there. Again not terribly clean and all the crockery is washed up by the guests so you need to re wash yourself before use in case. This place is ok if all you want is a bed. If u are a clean freak this place is not for you. The rooftop deck is Not very inviting but still somewhere u could go for some fresh air. There is a free laundry up there also. Tv did not have a set top box so could on,y watch Chanel 9.  A lot of things (furniture ) seemed a little rickety. The room would be hot in summer. The beds are comfy.~3~4~5~4~3~2~4~nan
review_148122513~‚ÄúGood value for money!‚Äù~If you're accustomed to 4 or 5 star accomodation this is not the place for you but if you are happy with traditional "pub" style accomodation you'll love it.......we did! My partner and I stayed 7 nights, it is in a good central location, close to Wynyard train station and walking distance to all the well know sights of Sydney. Accomodation is basic, no lifts, no air conditioning, no room service, no ensuite bathroom BUT comfortable bed, clean sheets, clean towels and great atmosphere. The staff were friendly and helpful, we enjoyed having the shared kitchen facilities to be able to make tea and coffee as required....we ate out all the time but you could cook a meal there if you wanted to. We didn't find the shared bathrooms to be a problem, never had to wait.  Considering we were staying above a bar it was suprisingly quiet at night too! Definately good value for money!~4~5~5~4~3~3~3~nan

Not perfect or modern, but updated, pretty clean and has all the facilities you need (shared bathrooms, but didn't have to wait). Downstairs bar was good too, happy hour drink prices were more than reasonable.~4~5~4~4~3~3~4~nan
