review_479000181~“Overnight stay to attend a wedding”~Good value for money - clean and comfortable apartment with very helpful and friendly staff. We were on the seventh floor so the view was great - however friends on the first floor were disturbed by the noise of pedestrian signals at the traffic lights outside. I recommend paying the little bit extra for a higher floor!~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_478719140~“Great location”~Great location for concert at the icc in darling harbour. The rooms were clean and had comfortable beds. The staff were also friendly. We could hear traffic slightly throughout the night but not too much.~4~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_478715980~“Great value family accomodation”~Great value and location for family with quick walking access to Darling Harbour. Mezzanine style room meant plenty of space for family too. All basic amenities were provided. Street noise was a bit loud on Saturday night but perhaps double glazing or thicker blinds could help this.~4~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_478395651~“Average location for the price”~Location is terrible especially on a busy night in the hotel across the road. Our room was directly opposite the hotel where patrons were very loud for most of the night. Not much sleep was had by my husband and I because of the noise.~3~3~2~1~4~4~4~nan
review_478155983~“Great location”~Great location right next to Darling Harbour however the convenient location comes at the expense of your sleep due to the noise from the motorways and foot traffic. Motel is in need of double glazing to muffle the sound.~3~3~5~1~3~4~4~nan
review_476225026~“Good location”~Rooms were a good size and comfortable, awesome location 5 minute walk across to restaurants and darling harbour. Like that it is self contained. Friendly staff. Clean and roomy for a one night stay. Nice.~4~4~5~4~5~4~5~nan

review_475700615~“Good location”~Location of hotel was good, easy walk to Darling Harbour and aquarium.

review_475395114~“Good family room, great easy location!”~We were able to walk to all the main sights of Sydney from our hotel room. We stayed in the family apartment, had kitchen and laundry facilities in the room which was very convenient! Friendly staff!!~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_474852205~“Great location”~The apartment was a good size and a short walk to the hub of Darling Harbour. Unfortunately located on a busy intersection meant a lot of street noise in our room on Level 1. Very helpful staff! Excellent kitchen.~4~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_474817636~“Great Location, Great Views.”~My family and I (2 children 7 and 6) stayed at Metro Apartments for an overnight stay. Check in was very pleasant. The apartment met our needs for the short stay and we would book again for a longer stay. Walking distance to public transport and Darling Harbour a short stroll across one road then straight onto the walk way.~5~5~5~3~4~4~5~nan
review_474378863~“Convenient Location”~Smells a little musty in the hallways, bathroom a little tired and shower was the worse I have ever had it felt like tiny needles on my skin . But otherwise ok.

review_474361731~“Great Location with Fantastic views”~We were assisted by helpful staff. It was a great location with fantastic views. It is central to everywhere in Sydney and only a short walk to Darling Harbour and the ferries you can catch from there.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474341705~“Great location, great price!”~Walking distance to variety of shopping and restaurants. Possible to walk to circular quay towing bags if you wish (10 mins or so). Nice rooms with impressive views. Bathroom/laundry and Main sleeping area up stairs in loft type area overlooks lounge with fold out bed. Shower over bath. Only drawback is carrying bags up steps to hotel entry on corner. Taxi must drop off round corner, so cant help. Reception staff willing to help with bags if you ask. Free wifi is great!!~4~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_473748668~“Perfect location with great views!!”~We loved the location and had amazing views from the sixth floor. Would highly recommend for families with older kids just because of the loft style accommodation. We could walk everywhere and watched the lights each night!~5~5~5~3~4~4~5~nan
review_473681814~“Comfortable, great location”~Rooms are comfortable enough, but a little tired looking. Not quite what we were expecting, but was clean and had a great location. One thing not so great was having to lift all our luggage up stairs to reception as no outside lift or ramp.~3~3~4~3~3~3~4~nan
review_473250808~“Short but shiney”~Needed a place close to wharf prior to a cruise and apart for stairs at front with lots of bags , great stay for family . Get to do lots of sights and attractions prior to departure as very central. Would stay again~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

review_471323074~“Friendly staff, Brilliant view: location”~Have been here a few times. As is perfectly situated when needing to do things in city of Sydney. Easy walk to ferries, bars very close by. Room is comfortably appointed. Staff : I think I have met a few of them over time, always smiley friendly and welcoming. Very handy if needing to do a quick washing load, a dryer also is so helpful especially with all the rain encountered this week! The bed- for me this is a big point.......SUPER COMFY!!!!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471269291~“Metro DH”~Very handy location if in the CBD or Darling Harbour areas. The lounge room and bathroom are dated but functional. Liked the layout of the room but some street noise was evident at night. Very friendly and helpful staff and would utilise this property if staying in Sydney again.~4~3~5~3~3~3~5~nan
review_470987301~“Not a pleasant experience.”~Old, tired room, first floor, very noisy and quite hot and I checked out immediately due to this as there was not an option to move to another room. The location was good as I was attending a meeting at a nearby hotel, but I did not like the room I was allocated at all.~2~2~4~1~2~3~3~nan
review_470411185~“Average”~The hotel was clean and well presented. A stay for three people was easily accommodated. The check in attendant actually changed our floors when our friends arrived so we could all stay together. As advice to other travellers, check on the holding fee amount, as mine was quite high and left me with little money left to enjoy my weekend plans.~3~3~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_470172300~“hmmm”~Parking is way down the street. Staff watched while 2 grannies struggled with huge suitcase up the stairs. Maybe they could offer help with luggage to and from the car. Parking cist twice the amount quoted even after validation. Stairs in the apartment may not be great for grannies. Good location and views.~2~4~5~3~2~2~2~nan
review_469986271~“Great find”~Metro was a great find. In the past I have stayed in Harbor side Marriott or Sofitel Wentworth which are very upmarket and priced accordingly The location of the Metro on the corner of King st. and Sussex is excellent for access to both the CBD and tourist attractions.  The apartments have everything including a small kitchenette with microwave fridge cutlery etc. I found the loft type layout really nice. Free WIFI was a plus and the speed was acceptable. TV was FOXTEL which provided a lot of variety. The apartment was neat and clean with nice towels. The carpets and furnishings were a bit worn and tired but served their purpose.  The view of the harbor from the sixth floor was nice, especially at night. The only drawback is the lack of double glazing or soundproofing. The noise from several large roads in front of the hotel in addition to bars with late night revelers was a bit off putting.  Overall a great place and good value for the location if you don't need all the trappings of a full service hotel and can put up with a bit of noise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469758220~“Great position and good value”~This was a good stay and I would stay again. The shower rose was a water saver type and not a pleasant experience! The road outside was a bit noisy at times, but that is to be expected with the excellent position. My room had a lovely view.~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_469298024~“Convenient Location”~We had a great stay recently. Fabulous location, so close to Darling Harbour, Pyrmont Bridge area. Close to restaurants and ferry services. Staff were helpful and friendly. The bed was comfy, towels fluffy, the ensuite a little small but adequate. Great facilities if you are staying a few days, mini mart next door. Great views from Executive suits.~4~4~5~4~3~4~5~nan
review_468973109~“Intro to Sydney”~Location good,friendly helpful staff,kitchens.Would ask for room on higher floor next time as first floor very noisy and bright from street and car lights. Double glazing would benefit this apartment.~4~5~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_468448256~“Good location and comfortable ”~Needed to stay centrally and this was a good price for the position. It's clean and well equipped and very comfortable with a view as well. Staff at front desk were helpful and friendly. I will come again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468397530~“Fwy in the room”~Sounds like the fwy is in your room. Room is dirty, carpet dirty, toilet doesn't flush, bathroom dirty. This hotel could do with double glaze windows and a new cleaner. Lucky the room is located ideally otherwise you can forgive it. Rollout sofa is terrible. No TV upstairs very inconvenient if you have kids and the are sleeping downstairs.~1~1~5~1~1~1~3~nan
review_467770841~“Trip to Sydney”~My mom, her aunt and I went to Sydney 6days. The location of this hotel was pretty good. You can go easily anywhere you want to go. You can cook anything good yourself in a nice kitchen use delicious seafood in your room. It was not so highgrade this hotel but I'm sure that you can stay comfortably and your trip will be special one! ~5~5~5~5~5~3~4~nan
review_467756360~“Metro Darling Harbour not so happy”~Location excellent. Apartments getting old and in desperate need of renovation particularly the bathrooms.Definitely not worth the $324 per night we paid for the weekend.Staff were friendly. Loft room was provided however we booked a 'one bedroom' apartment. Good walking distance to a lot of attractions.~2~1~5~2~1~2~4~nan
review_467669402~“Darling Harbour”~We stayed post cruising holiday. Location was awesome. Walking distance to areas we wanted to be. Found the room a bit dated, new paint would be great.

review_466407083~“Happy stay”~very good ...enjoyed the view from the apartment facing Darling Harbour. The room is spacious and suitable for a family with children. Kitchen is fully equipped with the basic necessities.. The free wifi helps you stay connected worldwide...~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_466155662~“Don't stay here if you want to get a good night's sleep.”~It might be a central location but the noise from outside is terrible. Bathroom was very tired. Renovation is required ASAP. I was supposed to get breakfast included but the business they had an arrangement with was unaware due to new management.~2~3~3~1~2~3~3~nan
review_465936519~“Lovely accommodation. Great Location”~Comfortable clean accommodation. Everything you need for your stay. Bed very comfortable. Friendly staff. Unfortunately, the only let down was the noisy road outside. It is right on an intersection and the traffic is unrelenting, and went on all night, so no sleep for us.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_465454611~“Comfortable”~These apartments are comfortable, they have a queen size bed upstairs, sofa bed downstairs, kitchen, washer and dryer and aircon. They need a revamp, carpets had stains, could do with a paint and they blinds very worn. Our cousins sofa bed mattress was in poor condition and they could feel all the wires underneath. These apartments are within a 2 minute walk to amazing restaurants. It is on a corner and during they day very noisy from traffic.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_464646210~“Great location, unhelpful staff”~As above. Great location and affordability. Great views. One very unhelpful staff member who sadly seemed to be on during most of my stay. There was an issue with my room which he completely dismissed and made no attempt to fix (or st least pretend to care)~3~4~5~3~3~3~1~nan
review_464189133~“Enjoyable stay”~Absolutely enjoyed our family stay for four nights - perfect location!! Kids loved the loft and the balcony overlooking Darling Harbour. The staff were very obliging and friendly giving us great service and very helpful.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_464182014~“Great location and staff”~Older but well-kept apartment building located in the centre of everything; short walks to Darling Harbour attractions, CBD and shops, Wynyard Station and King St Wharf. Friendly staff were happy to store or baggage both ends of our stay as we arrived early in Sydney and left mid afternoon; even vacuum bagged a pillow for us! Our unit was two storeyed, with well-equipped kitchen for those wishing to self-cater (but could be brighter) and a good bed. Stair access outside and within unit makes this unsuitable for the infirm or very young however, as only two rails on the stair and upstairs balustrades.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_463919881~“Location”~The rooms were clean & tidy, very close to the CBD shopping and exploring Darling Harbour restaurants and cafes. Very helpful staff that made the stay good. However, high traffic area and late night construction works made it difficult to sleep.~3~3~4~2~3~3~4~nan
review_463131753~“Staff and place”~I was amazed at how helpful the staff was, even to coming out and helping us with our luggage as we were struggling. The room and cleanness of the room was above average. Where we were sistuated in Sussex street was handy to everything.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_462853284~“Good location, nice apartment”~Nice location, but noisy during the nights due to traffic and construction work. Good cleaning service. Most of the staff were friendly except one grumpy receptionist. The apartment itself was perfect, bigger than we expected. Beds were good and everything we needed was present.~4~5~5~4~5~5~3~nan
review_462564457~“great location”~Bigger than I needed apartment close to Darling Harbour. Great for a family. Room was clean, tho a little dated. Staff were helpful and friendly.

review_462382252~“Tanya perth”~Clean rooms so close to darling harbour good value for money there is some traffic noise early in the  Morning but then it is in the CBD Staff are polite and helpful allowed us to check out at 11 which was great because we had a afternoon flight home this is our second stay at metro and will stay again on our next visit to Sydney~4~4~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_461641600~“Great location”~Great location, an update would make this place fantastic! Front steps were a little off putting, especially with heavy luggage. Noisy of a night time coming from surrounding bars. Great for a basic, apartment for a family stay.~3~4~5~2~3~3~5~nan
review_461566713~“Value for money, clean rooms and excellent location. Staff very friendly and helpful”~clean rooms. we had amazing view of darling harbor and really appreciate the loft style apartment as we had 2 children. very spacious and the location if fantastic. Steps to all the attractions and restaurants in Darling Harbour. Paige on reception went out of her way to help us settle in with two young children. I really don't have any negatives. Parking would be a problem if you had a car, but in this location - you don't really need one!~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_461386623~“Great customer service. Clean rooms”~Highly recommend staying here, yes it can be a little noisy but you get that when your room are on a main road, Fantastic staff (Paige, Daniel & Michael) were willing to help at all times. Especially when our flights were cancelled and at very short notice we were able to be supplied with a room. Brilliant views from the balcony both day & night. Location was excellent 10mins. from CBD, Darling Harbour, ferries. Couldn't ask for anymore.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460844035~“Pleasant enough but could do with a refurbishment, carpets & painting”~The apartment was suitable, but it could do with a re-paint, and brightening up. The location was excellent, although we had an issue with the noise factor in the area, busy roads, a lot of traffice noise as well. Overall for the price, is was satisfactory.~4~4~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_460800355~“Nice Location”~The apartments are only a short stroll from Darling Harbour.  They are, however, are a little tired looking and are in need of refurbishment. With some tlc they could be stunning. Carpets were stained in places, and the stuffing was hanging out of one of the sofa cushions. The lady on reception was extremely friendly and helpful. You have to carry your case up a steep flight of steps - there is no other access. Taxis cannot wait outside so you have to walk down the road to the taxi rank. Our biggest problem was a large cockroach in the bathroom on two of our three nights. Not pleasant. We reported it after the first night and the lady on reception reported it to housekeeping. No one did anything about it or spoke to us. Despite being on the 7 th floor, the traffic noise was bad, from 5 am. We would not stay here again.~2~nan~4~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_459059522~“Great duplex appartments overlooking the harbour”~The appartments are in a fantastic location one street back from the harbour.

Loft room was provided however we booked a 'one bedroom' apartment. Good walking distance to a lot of attractions.~2~1~5~2~1~2~4~nan
review_467669402~“Darling Harbour”~We stayed post cruising holiday. Location was awesome. Walking distance to areas we wanted to be. Found the room a bit dated, new paint would be great. Stairs to the bed and bathroom a problem if an aged couple or someone with a disability. Otherwise was great. Staff friendly.~4~3~5~3~3~4~5~nan
review_466407083~“Happy stay”~very good ...enjoyed the view from the apartment facing Darling Harbour. The room is spacious and suitable for a family with children. Kitchen is fully equipped with the basic necessities.. The free wifi helps you stay connected worldwide...~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_466155662~“Don't stay here if you want to get a good night's sleep.”~It might be a central location but the noise from outside is terrible. Bathroom was very tired. Renovation is required ASAP. I was supposed to get breakfast included but the business they had an arrangement with was unaware due to new management.~2~3~3~1~2~3~3~nan
review_465936519~“Lovely accommodation. Great Location”~Comfortable clean accommodation. Everything you need for your stay. Bed very comfortable. Friendly staff. Unfortunately, the only let down was the noisy road outside. It is right on an intersection and the traffic is unrelenting, and went on all night, so no sleep for us.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~4~nan
review_465454611~“Comfortable”~These apartments are comfortable, they have a queen size bed upstairs, sofa bed downstairs, kitchen, washer and dryer and aircon. They need a revamp, carpets had stains, could do with a paint and they blinds very worn. Our cousins sofa bed mattress was in poor condition and they could feel all the wires underneath. These apartments are within a 2 minute walk to amazing restaurants. It is on a corner and during they day very noisy from traffic.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_464646210~“Great location, unhelpful staff”~As above. Great location and affordability. Great views. One very unhelpful staff member who sadly seemed to be on during most of my stay. There was an issue with my room which he completely dismissed and made no attempt to fix (or st least pretend to care)~3~4~5~3~3~3~1~nan
review_464189133~“Enjoyable stay”~Absolutely enjoyed our family stay for four nights - perfect location!! Kids loved the loft and the balcony overlooking Darling Harbour. The staff were very obliging and friendly giving us great service and very helpful.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_464182014~“Great location and staff”~Older but well-kept apartment building located in the centre of everything; short walks to Darling Harbour attractions, CBD and shops, Wynyard Station and King St Wharf. Friendly staff were happy to store or baggage both ends of our stay as we arrived early in Sydney and left mid afternoon; even vacuum bagged a pillow for us! Our unit was two storeyed, with well-equipped kitchen for those wishing to self-cater (but could be brighter) and a good bed. Stair access outside and within unit makes this unsuitable for the infirm or very young however, as only two rails on the stair and upstairs balustrades.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_463919881~“Location”~The rooms were clean & tidy, very close to the CBD shopping and exploring Darling Harbour restaurants and cafes. Very helpful staff that made the stay good. However, high traffic area and late night construction works made it difficult to sleep.~3~3~4~2~3~3~4~nan
review_463131753~“Staff and place”~I was amazed at how helpful the staff was, even to coming out and helping us with our luggage as we were struggling. The room and cleanness of the room was above average. Where we were sistuated in Sussex street was handy to everything.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_462853284~“Good location, nice apartment”~Nice location, but noisy during the nights due to traffic and construction work. Good cleaning service. Most of the staff were friendly except one grumpy receptionist. The apartment itself was perfect, bigger than we expected. Beds were good and everything we needed was present.~4~5~5~4~5~5~3~nan
review_462564457~“great location”~Bigger than I needed apartment close to Darling Harbour. Great for a family. Room was clean, tho a little dated. Staff were helpful and friendly. Woken up VERY early by jackhammers in the street. Windows weren't sound proofed. Easy walk to many attractions.~4~3~4~3~3~3~4~nan
review_462382252~“Tanya perth”~Clean rooms so close to darling harbour good value for money there is some traffic noise early in the  Morning but then it is in the CBD Staff are polite and helpful allowed us to check out at 11 which was great because we had a afternoon flight home this is our second stay at metro and will stay again on our next visit to Sydney~4~4~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_461641600~“Great location”~Great location, an update would make this place fantastic! Front steps were a little off putting, especially with heavy luggage. Noisy of a night time coming from surrounding bars. Great for a basic, apartment for a family stay.~3~4~5~2~3~3~5~nan
review_461566713~“Value for money, clean rooms and excellent location. Staff very friendly and helpful”~clean rooms. we had amazing view of darling harbor and really appreciate the loft style apartment as we had 2 children. very spacious and the location if fantastic. Steps to all the attractions and restaurants in Darling Harbour. Paige on reception went out of her way to help us settle in with two young children. I really don't have any negatives. Parking would be a problem if you had a car, but in this location - you don't really need one!~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_461386623~“Great customer service. Clean rooms”~Highly recommend staying here, yes it can be a little noisy but you get that when your room are on a main road, Fantastic staff (Paige, Daniel & Michael) were willing to help at all times. Especially when our flights were cancelled and at very short notice we were able to be supplied with a room. Brilliant views from the balcony both day & night. Location was excellent 10mins. from CBD, Darling Harbour, ferries. Couldn't ask for anymore.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460844035~“Pleasant enough but could do with a refurbishment, carpets & painting”~The apartment was suitable, but it could do with a re-paint, and brightening up. The location was excellent, although we had an issue with the noise factor in the area, busy roads, a lot of traffice noise as well. Overall for the price, is was satisfactory.~4~4~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_460800355~“Nice Location”~The apartments are only a short stroll from Darling Harbour.  They are, however, are a little tired looking and are in need of refurbishment. With some tlc they could be stunning. Carpets were stained in places, and the stuffing was hanging out of one of the sofa cushions. The lady on reception was extremely friendly and helpful. You have to carry your case up a steep flight of steps - there is no other access. Taxis cannot wait outside so you have to walk down the road to the taxi rank. Our biggest problem was a large cockroach in the bathroom on two of our three nights. Not pleasant. We reported it after the first night and the lady on reception reported it to housekeeping. No one did anything about it or spoke to us. Despite being on the 7 th floor, the traffic noise was bad, from 5 am. We would not stay here again.~2~nan~4~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_459059522~“Great duplex appartments overlooking the harbour”~The appartments are in a fantastic location one street back from the harbour. The duplex appartments have floor to ceiling windows and you can lie in bed and watch the boats sail past! There are plenty of restaurants and bars close by, we bought food locally to prepare breakfast in the appartment kitchen each morning.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
