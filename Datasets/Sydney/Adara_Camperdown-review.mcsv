review_474868777~“Pleasant stay”~We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment. Which we found to be very clean and quite large it consisting of a lounge/dining, bathroom, separate toilet, laundry large utility cupboard & full size kitchen. It is very convenient to RPA Hospital within 3 min walking distance. Close to Newtown & the university. Unfortunately the shower was over the bath so anyone with mobility problems might need to think about this. Plenty of cafe's pubs near by with a convenience store in the next block. Staff on front desk were pleasant enough. We did have to pay $25 per night for parking. The unit was reasonably clean but did notice the ceiling fans had a lot of dust on them ...maybe not good for allergy sufferers. Free Internet but very slow & I had to sign in every time when using it & lots of drop outs. We were next tot he lift & found it quite noisy during day & early evenings.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473512208~“Adara Camperdown Sydney ”~Located in a nice area, close to Newtown and many good shops and the university. The 2 bedroom apartment had a strong damp smell and I noticed the amount of dust and grime everywhere. Dust on the ceiling fan was 2 cm thick. The paint job is shockingly bad with wall whites all over grey doors the and dirty brown marks all over the walls. Shower has no shower curtain and it went cold during my shower.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473009491~“Stopover in Sydney”~There was no one on the front desk when we arrived to check in, so we had to lug our baggage about 300 metres down the road to another building to do so. The lady there was very pleasant though. From our room we could hear people next door moving their coat hangers in their wardrobe and could also hear the lifts go up and down through the night.  The ash tray hadn't been emptied on the table of our balcony and we discovered several long hairs left on the floor.  The bathroom did not have an extractor.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_471275824~“Over priced, over rated”~I recently stayed here for 3 nights for a work course that was being held at the nearby Sydney university.  Location was fantastic with plenty of food and drink options nearby! The cafe directly across the road is a must!  Staff were lovely at check in and when ever coming past front reception they always greeted you warmly, but sadly that's where the good stuff about this hotel ends. I fail to see how this hotel can possibly be rated 4 stars - 3 stars would be a stretch in my opinion! Room was disgusting, smelt of cigarette smoke, mattress was hard and crunchy with springs creeping and cracking under you, pillows were lacking Shape or form making for uncomfortable sleeping at best. Bathroom was filthy, stank of mould and was clearly leaking into nearby skirting boards making the room, once the cigarette smell left reeking of musty, mildew smell. Plus the floor looked like it hadn't seen a mop in years!  Wardrobe cupboard space had drawers which were taken up with spare house keeping items - cushion covers, valance and mattress protector meaning I couldn't utilise.... seems pointless to provide drawers then render them useless!  In all this hotel was overpriced and not worth the $$$ paid. I had other colleagues who paid slightly more for much better accomodation nearby - so do your research.  Please see attached photos of bathroom mould, water leaks, useless drawers and quite possibly the most amount of dust around a table I have ever seen!!! YUK!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470718679~“I night stay”~Rather tired apartment, kitchen very dated, stove top around hot plates burned. Toilet bowl outside long black hair. Overpriced for dated acommadation. Staff friendly. Noisy as to be expected as on busy street.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_470119749~“Easy check in”~I stayed at Adara in a one bedroom apartment for one night. Denise at check in was very friendly and accommodating. She even called me to let me know my room was ready well before the agreed time. The apartment was spacious and had everything I needed. The TV wouldn't work on all channels. Staff tried to fix it and I was offered to be moved to a different room. Spacious kitchen, washing machine and balcony were a bonus. Noise was a bit of an issue, however not enough to deter me from returning to Adara. Value for money a plus.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468830997~“Front staff Always disappear but very friedly”~Front staff Always disappear but very friendly and helpful.

review_466146095~“Great location ”~So this was our first visit to Sydney #Lovedit! And we were pleasantly surprised at the accomodation provided here, for the price!

review_465044759~“Just the job!”~We stayed here for nine nights in a deluxe king room with kitchenette. We weren't sure that we'd be there in time for check-in before 10pm so arranged for my locally living friend to check in and get the key for us earlier in the day. This was done without fuss. The room (222 at the back of the hotel) was great. Compact but had a huge bed, a sofa, a desk and chair, a kitchen with fridge, sink, kettle and cutlery and crockery and a toaster. A microwave might have been nice but it wasn't a deal breaker. The bed was comfortable and our room was serviced every day. The windows had blackout blinds which were very effective. There's a free laundry room for guests use on the 1st floor which we used a couple of times. The bus stop right outside the hotel has a myriad of buses into the city, Newtown is a 10 minute walk and the hospital even closer. We had one small problem with a slowly draining sink that we had to chase a couple of times but it was fixed before we left. For the price, this was a bargain and we'd use the hotel again. For clarity, this review is for the site on the corner of Paramatta Road and Lyons Road.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_453697464~“A Bit Too Far from the City Centre”~The apartment was quite dated, not that clean and the dishes in the cupboard and drawer were dirty! Needless to say we didn't bother to eat in our room. Mentioned to the staff and was told the management were using contract cleaning staff...well I suggest they revisit their hiring standards and consider full time trained housekeeping staff.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~1~3~nan
review_450602607~“Average accommodation but great location”~These apartments are in desperate need of refurbishment. The oven was unusable as when you turned it on, black smoke poured out of it and we were worried about setting off the fire detectors (we were told we would be responsible for fine for setting off fire detector). The refrigerator was old and kept leaking as did others that we were told about. We were there for a wedding and had booked out several apartments. On the plus side, it is great having a washing machine and dryer. Undercover parking is good. There is a mini supermarket just 1minute walk away and also excellent Thai restaurant. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was big. There were not enough pots or pans to cook with and that was very annoying. Broadway Mall is just 1.5k drive away which is very handy. Staff at front desk only spoke to you when they wanted to. I always think it is good to say Good morning or good afternoon when guests are passing the front desk. They have a lovely swimming pool and covered bbq area.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_449256277~“Small Room but Adequate”~Booked a Studio apartment for a weeks stay over Christmas. The room itself was adequate if a bit small. The Kitchen was tiny and only came with a microwave (Normally booking a kitchenette you at least get a 2 ring hob) but this may be me not reading the booking info correctly. Location wise the apartments are great just a 20min walk to Newmarket and a short bus ride into Sydney itself. was very easy to get around. Staff were helpful and friendly. It was pretty noisy due to main road next to room and it didn't seem like the windows were keeping to much noise out (might not be double glazed) but overall completely adequate for a week stay.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_429002654~“Good Location for Short Stay Close to RPA Hospital”~Good sized apartment, separate queen size bedroom (with a roll-out bed if needed in the loungeroom), kitchenette (didn't need it as we only boiled the jug for tea and coffee), separate laundry and bathroom. Modern building, clean and comfortable and handy to RPA Consulting Rooms. Try to get a side room - we overlooked the lane-way - it is much quieter. Staff were very helpful. We arrived after7pm (after hours reception is normally at their Hotel on {Parramatta Road (a short walk away), however Joann? met us at the Apartment building. Would recommend for short stays if you need to stay in the area. Their associated Hotel on Parramatta Road is a bit cheaper if cost is an issue.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_428201607~“Decent hotel in good location”~We had an overnight stay at the Parramatta Road building and found it to be clean and comfortable. The reception staff were very friendly and checkin was easy. Our room was small but it wasn't hard to move about in, and given it was only a short stay didn't feel cramped. We didn't use the kitchenette so can't comment on it, and found the bathroom to be an adequate size. Parking was around $25 (not included in room fare) and located under the other building on Missenden Road; only a few hundred metres but quite a long way to carry luggage. Wifi didn't work the night we were there and wasn't able to be fixed, which was a shame. The apartments are within walking distance of a couple of different shopping districts, and we went to dinner in Newtown. Things that could be improved: - There was a lip in the floor that was the right height to catch your toe on; it would be a good idea to fix this. - Wifi and often parking are included when booking at most other hotels now; doing the same would bring Adara in line with the rest of the industry. - It would be good to have a second bin in the room marked for recycling. Overall a great place for a short stay, in a good location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422191373~“Everything you need for a short trip ”~Quite enjoyed my stay at Adara. The staff were friendly and the rooms were well kept and pretty much had everything you need!  However, there's not much around to do and see (except Sydney uni) so to get to more popular areas you'd need to take a bus/hitch a ride.  My only fault with my experience (although it's not really the hotels fault) was the traffic noise. I slept in a room next to the main road so it was constantly noisy the entire night! Not good for a light sleeper like me!  Also another thing to keep in mind is that wifi costs $10/device. Luckily I didn't have to use the Internet much.  Overall, lovely little hotel. But due to the traffic noise I'm not sure if I'll be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_411646848~“Clean and comfortable”~Clean comfortable hotel, great location if you need to get the the RPA, close to some restaurants and bars in walking distance. I have an internal room which was a bit dark, but was very quiet despite being on busy parramatta road.~4~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_409961516~“Excellent, clean quiet room located close to RPA Sydney”~My husband and I recently travelled to Sydney for my consultation with a Specialist near the RPA. As I have several health issues, it was imperative I stay in a clean, warm room. From the time I booked though Sonia, many months ago, (who was extremely helpful), to when I contacted Ben the day prior to arriving, to make certain the room was warm, and I had extra blankets, I was impressed by the customer service I received. Ben advised me to contact reception when we were 1/2 an hour away, as we would be arriving after reception hours which was around 5pm to 5.30pm, and the reception is not manned after hours. Reception was a little difficult to get a hold of, and I called a few times, however soon enough a lady by the name of Joanna answered and assured us that she would be there to let us in, and she was there when we arrived around 5pm, and greeted us with a huge friendly smile. Joanna was delightful, and assured me the room would be suitable. She also told me to call her immediately, should the room not be up to my expectations. The room was more than what we expected. It was amazingly clean, large, comfortable, and although I was told by Ben there was only one reverse air conditioner in the lounge, which would warm up the bedroom, he had made certain an additional small heater was provided for the bedroom, in case the bedroom was not warm enough, as well as a supply of extra blankets and pillows which I had requested. Once I turned on the main large air conditioner, and the little heater provided in the bedroom, the rooms became warm enough for me to turn the little portable heater off for the night. I called reception to tell Joanna the room was lovely, but she had left for the day, and I spoke to a lady called Pranita. Pranita was as caring as all the other staff I had encountered, and assured me that if there was anything else she could do, to let her know. I explained I had a Specialist appointment at 10.15am the next day, and asked if it were possible to have a later checkout, and she confirmed I could do this till 12pm, under the circumstances, and I was not charged an additional fee. The next day, it was pouring with rain, and although we had bought one little umbrella, it was not suffice, and when Joanna greeted us, I told her our predicament. Joanna went on a search for an umbrella we could borrow. I was extremely grateful, as I would have been soaked for my appointment. The customer service of all these people is a reflection of the state of the room we stayed in. It was exactly what I required, and very comfortable. I would recommend room 206 to anyone, and hopefully I will be able to stay in this room again, on my next visit to my Specialist. I cannot comment on any of the other rooms, as this room was situated away from the main street, so it was very quiet, clean, and had a kitchen with all utensils provided, and a little veranda. Thank you to all the wonderful staff who made my stay comfortable and especially to the cleaning staff of the rooms, as the sheets were crisp and clean, as was the room, also the bed was amazingly comfortable, and the only thing I can fault were my pillows were a little lumpy. With saying this, I slept extremely well. Thank you to Adara Camperdown management and staff. My husband and I hope to stay in room 206 again. Kind regards, Jane~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_408059572~“A quiet and clean place to stay”~A really nice place to stay. It's clean and quiet and is only a $15 uber ride into the city. The people at reception were really lovely and helpful.

review_406805479~“Great location with Parking, a must in inner Sydney”~Apartment style with good equipped Kitchen, open plan to lounge, Laundry, good size bathroom, very well set out and comfortable. Stayed in 201A, having generous balcony overlooking the pool, this was good compensation as the rest of the views are mainly high rise apartment's and hotels. Staff were very helpful and ice trays were full in the freezer. With a little grocery store a few doors down, this was very handy to get supplies for cost effective breakfast, drinks, milk etc. Also the Alfred Hotel in the next block does take away meals, so after a big day also very handy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Access to the building was problematic for arrivals after 6:00pm where checkin is at the Business site at 108 Parramatta Road Camperdown with a 400 m walk up Missenden Road to the apartment.

review_396014977~“Great place to stay if you want to visit USyd or RPA”~The good: Great location (note - this is the property on Missenden Road, not Parramatta Road). Easy walk to Newtown, RPA, the University, Broadway, Glebe etc Great views of the city (our room was on the 5th floor on the Missenden Road side) Very quiet, despite facing the main road Very spacious, well-equipped and maintained 2 bedroom apartment Under-cover parking(extra $25 per day but worth it) Helpful, pleasant staff The not-so good: Nothing from our perspective.

review_395654501~“All I can say is WOW ! ”~It was like I didn't leave home!, being 7 hours away from home due to my father illness we didn't care about anything else just wanted and had to be close to him no matter what. My father had to stay longer and Adara apartments came up, I gave them a call, and it was like my call was answered by an Angel ! She was a lovely ladie and so caring and so kind hearted. To the duty manager think her name is spelt firniece (sorry if I have misspelt your name) but I just want to say a big thank you ! I know the good lord will bless your heart and kindness you have shown upon my family, as we are facing a difficult moment in life, you have been a blessing ! Doesn't end here, we go up to the room and OMG ! We loved it ! So spacious clean and the apartment sure does make you feel like your at home. The highlight of adara's is that it's close to the hospital and has everything you need close by and in the apartment. ALL GLORY TO GOD HE IS AWESOME and already has angels like Firniece I do apologise if I have spelt your name wrong. But from me and my family just want to say thank you thank you for having us and we already love the place !  Definitely been coming back here again next visit.  Kind regards.

review_392843898~“Nice Serviced Apartment”~Stayed for 3 nights in a 2-bedroom apartment with my family. Very nice, spacey apartment to say the least. We got 2 bathrooms and the unit was reasonably clean too. Although signs of wear-and-tear appeared in some spots, yet ultimately still within acceptable condition. Service was nice and friendly. Location is very good, in Missenden Road, located near University of Sydney and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. 412 Bus stop to City is nearby but for more options can walk a bit to Parramatta Road (near the other Adara Hotel). 7-11 is located nearby, next to the hospital. BP station is around the corner of Parramatta Road and Missenden Road and Nando's is also there.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_390221255~“Great location close to RPA”~My daughter had surgery at the RPA and the Adara was the perfect location for me to stay during this time. We had a one bedroom apartment with 2 single beds. The apartment was very clean and staff were eager to clean the room each day to maintain the cleanliness. Some of the appliances are getting a little old - all the knobs on the fridge were broken and the dishwasher was very old, but all still in working order. Reception staff were very pleasant and accommodating with any request. Our room was at the back of the building and was very quiet - only the occasional ambulance siren could be heard. Sunset views from the balcony were beautiful. If you need to be close the RPA, then this is the place to stay.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_385699489~“Perfect for a night away”~My husband was lucky enough to win a complimentary nights stay here which he gifted to me and a friend. Whilst we initially had some trouble finding a park to check in (there is on site parking but you need an access card) everything after that was smooth sailing. The apartments are spotless, fitted with everything you would need, the location was great and it was extremely quiet. The bed was big and comfortable, the bath was amazing with super hot water, there was a shower too but I'm a bath girl. A fabulous balcony, with a view of their outdoor pool, which being the middle of winter we declined to use. The staff were friendly and held the reception open for us until we arrived (after 6pm). They also made sure we knew the numbers to call if we needed anyone. All up, yes I'd stay here again and yes I'd recommend you do too!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_374759214~“Great Apartments & Friendly Staff”~I stayed at the Adara Camperdown in January and April while staying in Sydney with my family to support my sick son staying in the RPA. We had to make several changes to our booking at short notice due to changing circumstances with my son and the staff were really understanding and accommodating.

review_365270495~“Staff very friendly and welcoming....:-) Rooms tiny...”~We stayed at Adara Parramatta Road, the staff here are lovely, they are a credit to Adara. The rooms however although clean are very small and I think overpriced (we paid $189.00 per night), although we were there on Mardi Gras weekend so maybe it was more expensive. We had a double room with balcony and the balcony was also teeny tiny. It was difficult for two people to move around in the room at the same time, luckily we did not spend much time in our room. Although, public transport (bus stop) is conveniently right outside the door, I think staying in the city and walking to attractions is a much better option. Bustling King Street Newtown is over a km walk away and there are cool shops and plenty of restaurants here. Camperdown pub is just down the road and a nice place to relax with a drink or meal.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362929175~“Too expensive!”~"Executive double balcony" $179 per night! I'm not sure what was executive about it? Tiny room with kitchenette..with a weird raised tiled area for kicking your toe on, there was barely space for bed let alone kitchenette, balcony pfft - maybe a window platform..looking directly into other rooms, no natural light. Just seemed like a total waste of money. Take the kitchenette out, put in a queen bed or king even maybe a lounge to put your stuff on might have made it ok...but there's no excuse for a mouldy bathroom. Shower had good water pressure! To me this is a $100 a night room, not that you get that these days. Second try of the Adara, don't think we'll try again...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_354961504~“Good Value”~We stayed 4 nights here as it was close to our in-laws who did not have room to fit us in. The room was fine but in need of some TLC. The shower door was loose, the shower taps dripped (new washers needed) and a couple of light-bulbs had failed. The staff were were friendly and helpful.

review_351458329~“Tiny, Loud, and Not the Best Part of Town”~This is the first time I have ever been to a hotel that does not have 24 hour front desk staffing. The hotel is located on a busy street with traffic into the wee hours of the morning. It is also around the corner from a busy hospital emergency room. The room was not at all soundproof! The window shades did not completely block the abundant light coming from the street. The foyer, the elevator and the room were all SMALL. It was difficult for two people to both move in the room at the same time. The drain in the bathroom ran extremely slowly. While it is close to the University, it is not close to anything else, including restaurants.(We grabbed breakfast from the BP across the street.) The room felt close and muggy.~2~nan~nan~1~2~nan~3~nan
review_346024309~“Good little hotel”~Stayed for two nights with wife and baby in the King room with cot. Had to park up the road and walk down. Hall ways are narrow if you want to carry everything all at once. Room is very small and kitchen facilities sparse. However for the price I think it was good value. The staff were very friendly and professional, facilities clean and modern. The location is perfect for a trip into the city or hospital.

review_340388797~“Poor hotel, poor location, good staff-overpriced. ”~This is the strangest hotel that we have ever stayed in.  Firstly, we were aware we had to pay $25 for parking, but we were unaware the parking facilities were at another hotel, further up the street. Not helpful when you are traveling with enough luggage to last 4 weeks.  Secondly, I have never stayed at a hotel where reception closes. It was only staffed between 9am and 10pm so when we realized on the first night, we only had 1 pillow each, there was no way of getting any extras.  Thirdly, house keeping- very bizarre! It did say that house keeping was weekly, we understood this to mean, if you were staying a full week, your room would get the bedding changed once in that week. It actually means, that if you stay 5 nights like we did, you get no service!!!! No bin emptied, no fresh towels, no hovering of the carpet!!!! You are responsible for refilling your room your self from a trolley that is left in the hallway!  The rooms are very very small. There was no where to put luggage. We were supposed to have an executive room with a balcony, but were not given one. The room smelled fusty (we are not surprised though with the lack of cleaning) and the fridge and freezer were disgustingly dirty, to the point where it made me heave so we refused to use it. You could not turn the shower on without being in it so either had to freeze or burn before you got the temperature right. We also believe there was a problem with the air conditioning, as for the 5 nights we were there, I developed a cough and breathing difficulties that vanished as soon as we checked in to another hotel.  We paid $50 for wifi for the duration of of our stay witch was unbelievably slow and would log you out every 20 minutes. Was not worth the money.  The location of the hotel for tourists is rubbish. It cost us between $20 and $25 for a taxi between the hotel and circular quay and then back again so it is a long way. The hotel says it is walkable but we certainly didn't feel it was. The hotel is on the same street as a hospital, so you can hear ambulance sirens all night, it is on a busy cross roads so you can hear people and traffic all night and the bin Lorry called every morning at quarter to five and woke us up. I would describe the area the hotel is in as questionable!  The worst thing was that on the morning we left, the other couple we were traveling with were sharing with a cockroach! If we wouldn't of been checking out that morning already, we would of been after that.  There saving grace is the reception staff, they were always friendly, polite and tried to be as helpful as they could.

review_336328459~“Lovely stay”~We were impressed with our stay at Adara. Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Our room was modern and had everything we needed. We would definitely visit again and would recommend to others. Bus Stop directly out the front and car parking was just a short walk away.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_474868777~“Pleasant stay”~We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment. Which we found to be very clean and quite large it consisting of a lounge/dining, bathroom, separate toilet, laundry large utility cupboard & full size kitchen. It is very convenient to RPA Hospital within 3 min walking distance. Close to Newtown & the university. Unfortunately the shower was over the bath so anyone with mobility problems might need to think about this. Plenty of cafe's pubs near by with a convenience store in the next block. Staff on front desk were pleasant enough. We did have to pay $25 per night for parking. The unit was reasonably clean but did notice the ceiling fans had a lot of dust on them ...maybe not good for allergy sufferers. Free Internet but very slow & I had to sign in every time when using it & lots of drop outs. We were next tot he lift & found it quite noisy during day & early evenings.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473512208~“Adara Camperdown Sydney ”~Located in a nice area, close to Newtown and many good shops and the university. The 2 bedroom apartment had a strong damp smell and I noticed the amount of dust and grime everywhere. Dust on the ceiling fan was 2 cm thick. The paint job is shockingly bad with wall whites all over grey doors the and dirty brown marks all over the walls. Shower has no shower curtain and it went cold during my shower.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473009491~“Stopover in Sydney”~There was no one on the front desk when we arrived to check in, so we had to lug our baggage about 300 metres down the road to another building to do so. The lady there was very pleasant though. From our room we could hear people next door moving their coat hangers in their wardrobe and could also hear the lifts go up and down through the night.  The ash tray hadn't been emptied on the table of our balcony and we discovered several long hairs left on the floor.  The bathroom did not have an extractor.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_471275824~“Over priced, over rated”~I recently stayed here for 3 nights for a work course that was being held at the nearby Sydney university.  Location was fantastic with plenty of food and drink options nearby! The cafe directly across the road is a must!  Staff were lovely at check in and when ever coming past front reception they always greeted you warmly, but sadly that's where the good stuff about this hotel ends. I fail to see how this hotel can possibly be rated 4 stars - 3 stars would be a stretch in my opinion! Room was disgusting, smelt of cigarette smoke, mattress was hard and crunchy with springs creeping and cracking under you, pillows were lacking Shape or form making for uncomfortable sleeping at best. Bathroom was filthy, stank of mould and was clearly leaking into nearby skirting boards making the room, once the cigarette smell left reeking of musty, mildew smell. Plus the floor looked like it hadn't seen a mop in years!  Wardrobe cupboard space had drawers which were taken up with spare house keeping items - cushion covers, valance and mattress protector meaning I couldn't utilise.... seems pointless to provide drawers then render them useless!  In all this hotel was overpriced and not worth the $$$ paid. I had other colleagues who paid slightly more for much better accomodation nearby - so do your research.  Please see attached photos of bathroom mould, water leaks, useless drawers and quite possibly the most amount of dust around a table I have ever seen!!! YUK!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470718679~“I night stay”~Rather tired apartment, kitchen very dated, stove top around hot plates burned. Toilet bowl outside long black hair. Overpriced for dated acommadation. Staff friendly. Noisy as to be expected as on busy street.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_470119749~“Easy check in”~I stayed at Adara in a one bedroom apartment for one night. Denise at check in was very friendly and accommodating. She even called me to let me know my room was ready well before the agreed time. The apartment was spacious and had everything I needed. The TV wouldn't work on all channels. Staff tried to fix it and I was offered to be moved to a different room. Spacious kitchen, washing machine and balcony were a bonus. Noise was a bit of an issue, however not enough to deter me from returning to Adara. Value for money a plus.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465044759~“Just the job!”~We stayed here for nine nights in a deluxe king room with kitchenette. We weren't sure that we'd be there in time for check-in before 10pm so arranged for my locally living friend to check in and get the key for us earlier in the day. This was done without fuss. The room (222 at the back of the hotel) was great. Compact but had a huge bed, a sofa, a desk and chair, a kitchen with fridge, sink, kettle and cutlery and crockery and a toaster. A microwave might have been nice but it wasn't a deal breaker. The bed was comfortable and our room was serviced every day. The windows had blackout blinds which were very effective. There's a free laundry room for guests use on the 1st floor which we used a couple of times. The bus stop right outside the hotel has a myriad of buses into the city, Newtown is a 10 minute walk and the hospital even closer. We had one small problem with a slowly draining sink that we had to chase a couple of times but it was fixed before we left. For the price, this was a bargain and we'd use the hotel again. For clarity, this review is for the site on the corner of Paramatta Road and Lyons Road.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_453697464~“A Bit Too Far from the City Centre”~The apartment was quite dated, not that clean and the dishes in the cupboard and drawer were dirty! Needless to say we didn't bother to eat in our room. Mentioned to the staff and was told the management were using contract cleaning staff...well I suggest they revisit their hiring standards and consider full time trained housekeeping staff.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~1~3~nan
review_450864239~“Underwhelmed”~I was glad of the wheels on my suitcase and that I had packed light because on arrival at the (locked, unmanned) building at the address provided, I was directed by phone to its sister establishment down the road. My room was clean and the fit out was recent; good shower and comfy bed. It was dark though, nowhere to put a suitcase and a strange t-shape which made half the room practically unusable because the bed almost ran wall to wall. Looked like the cleaners had been interrupted when I returned on might 2 - cupboards left open and dirty bath towel on the kitchen bench, although they had been replaced in the bathroom. Overall - awkward rather than terrible.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450602607~“Average accommodation but great location”~These apartments are in desperate need of refurbishment. The oven was unusable as when you turned it on, black smoke poured out of it and we were worried about setting off the fire detectors (we were told we would be responsible for fine for setting off fire detector). The refrigerator was old and kept leaking as did others that we were told about. We were there for a wedding and had booked out several apartments. On the plus side, it is great having a washing machine and dryer. Undercover parking is good. There is a mini supermarket just 1minute walk away and also excellent Thai restaurant. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was big. There were not enough pots or pans to cook with and that was very annoying. Broadway Mall is just 1.5k drive away which is very handy. Staff at front desk only spoke to you when they wanted to. I always think it is good to say Good morning or good afternoon when guests are passing the front desk. They have a lovely swimming pool and covered bbq area.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan

review_449256277~“Small Room but Adequate”~Booked a Studio apartment for a weeks stay over Christmas. The room itself was adequate if a bit small. The Kitchen was tiny and only came with a microwave (Normally booking a kitchenette you at least get a 2 ring hob) but this may be me not reading the booking info correctly. Location wise the apartments are great just a 20min walk to Newmarket and a short bus ride into Sydney itself. was very easy to get around. Staff were helpful and friendly. It was pretty noisy due to main road next to room and it didn't seem like the windows were keeping to much noise out (might not be double glazed) but overall completely adequate for a week stay.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_447935547~“Lovely skyline apartment”~We stayed at the Missenden Road site. Our apartment was spacious with a large balcony looking towards central Sydney. Although outside of the city, it's on a major bus route and a nice place to escape to after a hectic day of sightseeing. It's in a quiet leafy neighbourhood close to the hospital and has some nice coffee shops within reach. The staff were very accommodating and made our stay really easy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447654423~“Two night stay”~Brother and i stayed in the 1 bedroom apartment for 2 nights. It was huge and well equipped. The place itself is very tired and could do with some much needed renovations. Price was good for the size and it was also clean.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_443887116~“Good accommodation handy to RPA and Sydney attractions. Great staff.”~Stayed at both Adara apartments, Missenden Rd and Parramatta Rd (same management) while grandson was in RPA.

Far better than nearby Rydges.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439637221~“Two week stay”~I stayed here for almost two weeks and was quite pleased and satisfied. My room was clean. The staff were very friendly. I could grab a bus right outside front door that had me downtown in no time. The area around the hotel had many places to eat and a convenience store just across the street. There was a washer and dryer available for guests to use free of charge. If you are a light sleeper there is some street noise outside that might disturb you. It did not bother me. My room was small so if you want to spend alot of time in your room you may want more space. But it worked quite well for me. And there is a lounge upstairs that you can use as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432783210~“Going down in service and cleanliness ”~I have stayed here 4 times for business trips and I have to say that this time was beyond disappointing. Even tough this place is basic, it has always been comfortable and clean and I chose it because it was close to my meetings as well as spacious. The cleanliness has gone down the drain ( sorry my pun), in my 7 day stay my room was only vacuumed once, while I met the cleaning crew and asked them to clean. The only cleaning they did was replacing fresh towels every day. No kitchen cleaning,dishes were left in the sink for 2 days. Cupboards left open, personal items pushed down on the floor, no sweeping, cleaning of surfaces etc. the manager although friendly did not want to hear my complaints and literally said to me " I don't want to hear it", she then went on to complain about the Managern turnover that was about to happen and how she used to run this place in the past. Zero customer service! I will reconsider if I stay there in the future as I liked the location and before their staff fiasco enjoyed staying there. Right now take your money and stay somewhere else.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429002654~“Good Location for Short Stay Close to RPA Hospital”~Good sized apartment, separate queen size bedroom (with a roll-out bed if needed in the loungeroom), kitchenette (didn't need it as we only boiled the jug for tea and coffee), separate laundry and bathroom. Modern building, clean and comfortable and handy to RPA Consulting Rooms. Try to get a side room - we overlooked the lane-way - it is much quieter. Staff were very helpful. We arrived after7pm (after hours reception is normally at their Hotel on {Parramatta Road (a short walk away), however Joann? met us at the Apartment building. Would recommend for short stays if you need to stay in the area. Their associated Hotel on Parramatta Road is a bit cheaper if cost is an issue.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_428201607~“Decent hotel in good location”~We had an overnight stay at the Parramatta Road building and found it to be clean and comfortable. The reception staff were very friendly and checkin was easy. Our room was small but it wasn't hard to move about in, and given it was only a short stay didn't feel cramped. We didn't use the kitchenette so can't comment on it, and found the bathroom to be an adequate size. Parking was around $25 (not included in room fare) and located under the other building on Missenden Road; only a few hundred metres but quite a long way to carry luggage. Wifi didn't work the night we were there and wasn't able to be fixed, which was a shame. The apartments are within walking distance of a couple of different shopping districts, and we went to dinner in Newtown. Things that could be improved: - There was a lip in the floor that was the right height to catch your toe on; it would be a good idea to fix this. - Wifi and often parking are included when booking at most other hotels now; doing the same would bring Adara in line with the rest of the industry. - It would be good to have a second bin in the room marked for recycling. Overall a great place for a short stay, in a good location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422191373~“Everything you need for a short trip ”~Quite enjoyed my stay at Adara. The staff were friendly and the rooms were well kept and pretty much had everything you need!  However, there's not much around to do and see (except Sydney uni) so to get to more popular areas you'd need to take a bus/hitch a ride.  My only fault with my experience (although it's not really the hotels fault) was the traffic noise. I slept in a room next to the main road so it was constantly noisy the entire night! Not good for a light sleeper like me!  Also another thing to keep in mind is that wifi costs $10/device. Luckily I didn't have to use the Internet much.  Overall, lovely little hotel. But due to the traffic noise I'm not sure if I'll be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_409961516~“Excellent, clean quiet room located close to RPA Sydney”~My husband and I recently travelled to Sydney for my consultation with a Specialist near the RPA. As I have several health issues, it was imperative I stay in a clean, warm room. From the time I booked though Sonia, many months ago, (who was extremely helpful), to when I contacted Ben the day prior to arriving, to make certain the room was warm, and I had extra blankets, I was impressed by the customer service I received. Ben advised me to contact reception when we were 1/2 an hour away, as we would be arriving after reception hours which was around 5pm to 5.30pm, and the reception is not manned after hours. Reception was a little difficult to get a hold of, and I called a few times, however soon enough a lady by the name of Joanna answered and assured us that she would be there to let us in, and she was there when we arrived around 5pm, and greeted us with a huge friendly smile. Joanna was delightful, and assured me the room would be suitable. She also told me to call her immediately, should the room not be up to my expectations. The room was more than what we expected. It was amazingly clean, large, comfortable, and although I was told by Ben there was only one reverse air conditioner in the lounge, which would warm up the bedroom, he had made certain an additional small heater was provided for the bedroom, in case the bedroom was not warm enough, as well as a supply of extra blankets and pillows which I had requested. Once I turned on the main large air conditioner, and the little heater provided in the bedroom, the rooms became warm enough for me to turn the little portable heater off for the night. I called reception to tell Joanna the room was lovely, but she had left for the day, and I spoke to a lady called Pranita. Pranita was as caring as all the other staff I had encountered, and assured me that if there was anything else she could do, to let her know. I explained I had a Specialist appointment at 10.15am the next day, and asked if it were possible to have a later checkout, and she confirmed I could do this till 12pm, under the circumstances, and I was not charged an additional fee. The next day, it was pouring with rain, and although we had bought one little umbrella, it was not suffice, and when Joanna greeted us, I told her our predicament. Joanna went on a search for an umbrella we could borrow. I was extremely grateful, as I would have been soaked for my appointment. The customer service of all these people is a reflection of the state of the room we stayed in. It was exactly what I required, and very comfortable. I would recommend room 206 to anyone, and hopefully I will be able to stay in this room again, on my next visit to my Specialist. I cannot comment on any of the other rooms, as this room was situated away from the main street, so it was very quiet, clean, and had a kitchen with all utensils provided, and a little veranda. Thank you to all the wonderful staff who made my stay comfortable and especially to the cleaning staff of the rooms, as the sheets were crisp and clean, as was the room, also the bed was amazingly comfortable, and the only thing I can fault were my pillows were a little lumpy. With saying this, I slept extremely well. Thank you to Adara Camperdown management and staff. My husband and I hope to stay in room 206 again. Kind regards, Jane~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_406805479~“Great location with Parking, a must in inner Sydney”~Apartment style with good equipped Kitchen, open plan to lounge, Laundry, good size bathroom, very well set out and comfortable. Stayed in 201A, having generous balcony overlooking the pool, this was good compensation as the rest of the views are mainly high rise apartment's and hotels. Staff were very helpful and ice trays were full in the freezer. With a little grocery store a few doors down, this was very handy to get supplies for cost effective breakfast, drinks, milk etc. Also the Alfred Hotel in the next block does take away meals, so after a big day also very handy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_395654501~“All I can say is WOW ! ”~It was like I didn't leave home!, being 7 hours away from home due to my father illness we didn't care about anything else just wanted and had to be close to him no matter what. My father had to stay longer and Adara apartments came up, I gave them a call, and it was like my call was answered by an Angel ! She was a lovely ladie and so caring and so kind hearted. To the duty manager think her name is spelt firniece (sorry if I have misspelt your name) but I just want to say a big thank you ! I know the good lord will bless your heart and kindness you have shown upon my family, as we are facing a difficult moment in life, you have been a blessing ! Doesn't end here, we go up to the room and OMG ! We loved it ! So spacious clean and the apartment sure does make you feel like your at home. The highlight of adara's is that it's close to the hospital and has everything you need close by and in the apartment. ALL GLORY TO GOD HE IS AWESOME and already has angels like Firniece I do apologise if I have spelt your name wrong. But from me and my family just want to say thank you thank you for having us and we already love the place !  Definitely been coming back here again next visit.  Kind regards.

We got 2 bathrooms and the unit was reasonably clean too. Although signs of wear-and-tear appeared in some spots, yet ultimately still within acceptable condition. Service was nice and friendly. Location is very good, in Missenden Road, located near University of Sydney and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. 412 Bus stop to City is nearby but for more options can walk a bit to Parramatta Road (near the other Adara Hotel). 7-11 is located nearby, next to the hospital.

review_390221255~“Great location close to RPA”~My daughter had surgery at the RPA and the Adara was the perfect location for me to stay during this time. We had a one bedroom apartment with 2 single beds. The apartment was very clean and staff were eager to clean the room each day to maintain the cleanliness. Some of the appliances are getting a little old - all the knobs on the fridge were broken and the dishwasher was very old, but all still in working order. Reception staff were very pleasant and accommodating with any request. Our room was at the back of the building and was very quiet - only the occasional ambulance siren could be heard. Sunset views from the balcony were beautiful. If you need to be close the RPA, then this is the place to stay.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_385699489~“Perfect for a night away”~My husband was lucky enough to win a complimentary nights stay here which he gifted to me and a friend. Whilst we initially had some trouble finding a park to check in (there is on site parking but you need an access card) everything after that was smooth sailing. The apartments are spotless, fitted with everything you would need, the location was great and it was extremely quiet. The bed was big and comfortable, the bath was amazing with super hot water, there was a shower too but I'm a bath girl. A fabulous balcony, with a view of their outdoor pool, which being the middle of winter we declined to use. The staff were friendly and held the reception open for us until we arrived (after 6pm). They also made sure we knew the numbers to call if we needed anyone. All up, yes I'd stay here again and yes I'd recommend you do too!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_365270495~“Staff very friendly and welcoming....:-) Rooms tiny...”~We stayed at Adara Parramatta Road, the staff here are lovely, they are a credit to Adara. The rooms however although clean are very small and I think overpriced (we paid $189.00 per night), although we were there on Mardi Gras weekend so maybe it was more expensive. We had a double room with balcony and the balcony was also teeny tiny. It was difficult for two people to move around in the room at the same time, luckily we did not spend much time in our room. Although, public transport (bus stop) is conveniently right outside the door, I think staying in the city and walking to attractions is a much better option. Bustling King Street Newtown is over a km walk away and there are cool shops and plenty of restaurants here. Camperdown pub is just down the road and a nice place to relax with a drink or meal.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Tiny room with kitchenette..with a weird raised tiled area for kicking your toe on, there was barely space for bed let alone kitchenette, balcony pfft - maybe a window platform..looking directly into other rooms, no natural light. Just seemed like a total waste of money. Take the kitchenette out, put in a queen bed or king even maybe a lounge to put your stuff on might have made it ok...but there's no excuse for a mouldy bathroom. Shower had good water pressure! To me this is a $100 a night room, not that you get that these days. Second try of the Adara, don't think we'll try again...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_354961504~“Good Value”~We stayed 4 nights here as it was close to our in-laws who did not have room to fit us in. The room was fine but in need of some TLC. The shower door was loose, the shower taps dripped (new washers needed) and a couple of light-bulbs had failed. The staff were were friendly and helpful. Astonishing that one had to pay for wi-fi in this day and age.~4~nan~nan~5~3~nan~5~nan
review_351458329~“Tiny, Loud, and Not the Best Part of Town”~This is the first time I have ever been to a hotel that does not have 24 hour front desk staffing. The hotel is located on a busy street with traffic into the wee hours of the morning. It is also around the corner from a busy hospital emergency room. The room was not at all soundproof! The window shades did not completely block the abundant light coming from the street. The foyer, the elevator and the room were all SMALL. It was difficult for two people to both move in the room at the same time. The drain in the bathroom ran extremely slowly. While it is close to the University, it is not close to anything else, including restaurants.(We grabbed breakfast from the BP across the street.) The room felt close and muggy.~2~nan~nan~1~2~nan~3~nan
review_346024309~“Good little hotel”~Stayed for two nights with wife and baby in the King room with cot. Had to park up the road and walk down. Hall ways are narrow if you want to carry everything all at once. Room is very small and kitchen facilities sparse. However for the price I think it was good value. The staff were very friendly and professional, facilities clean and modern. The location is perfect for a trip into the city or hospital. Wheel chair/stroller friendly too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_340388797~“Poor hotel, poor location, good staff-overpriced. ”~This is the strangest hotel that we have ever stayed in.  Firstly, we were aware we had to pay $25 for parking, but we were unaware the parking facilities were at another hotel, further up the street. Not helpful when you are traveling with enough luggage to last 4 weeks.  Secondly, I have never stayed at a hotel where reception closes. It was only staffed between 9am and 10pm so when we realized on the first night, we only had 1 pillow each, there was no way of getting any extras.  Thirdly, house keeping- very bizarre! It did say that house keeping was weekly, we understood this to mean, if you were staying a full week, your room would get the bedding changed once in that week. It actually means, that if you stay 5 nights like we did, you get no service!!!! No bin emptied, no fresh towels, no hovering of the carpet!!!! You are responsible for refilling your room your self from a trolley that is left in the hallway!  The rooms are very very small. There was no where to put luggage. We were supposed to have an executive room with a balcony, but were not given one. The room smelled fusty (we are not surprised though with the lack of cleaning) and the fridge and freezer were disgustingly dirty, to the point where it made me heave so we refused to use it. You could not turn the shower on without being in it so either had to freeze or burn before you got the temperature right. We also believe there was a problem with the air conditioning, as for the 5 nights we were there, I developed a cough and breathing difficulties that vanished as soon as we checked in to another hotel.  We paid $50 for wifi for the duration of of our stay witch was unbelievably slow and would log you out every 20 minutes. Was not worth the money.  The location of the hotel for tourists is rubbish. It cost us between $20 and $25 for a taxi between the hotel and circular quay and then back again so it is a long way. The hotel says it is walkable but we certainly didn't feel it was. The hotel is on the same street as a hospital, so you can hear ambulance sirens all night, it is on a busy cross roads so you can hear people and traffic all night and the bin Lorry called every morning at quarter to five and woke us up. I would describe the area the hotel is in as questionable!  The worst thing was that on the morning we left, the other couple we were traveling with were sharing with a cockroach! If we wouldn't of been checking out that morning already, we would of been after that.  There saving grace is the reception staff, they were always friendly, polite and tried to be as helpful as they could.  We also appreciated the use of the free laundry facilities that this hotel offered.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336328459~“Lovely stay”~We were impressed with our stay at Adara. Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Our room was modern and had everything we needed. We would definitely visit again and would recommend to others. Bus Stop directly out the front and car parking was just a short walk away.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
