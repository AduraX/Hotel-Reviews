review_469235216~“Never disappoints...magnificent view.”~Although the weather was dreadful, the view from the hotel room didn't disappoint. Staff at the checkin desk were super efficient and friendly. So many bars and restaurants to choose from ...most more than reasonably priced. I first stayed at this hotel when it first opened and although it has dated a little, the rooms are meticulously clean and great value for a stay in Sydney. Central to everything...light rail, ferry and parking stations. Highly recommend a stay here...for me, I'm a Sydneyite but often just like to explore my beautiful city. Breakfast was awesome!~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_478402569~“great clean modern and location great”~Well were do I start the location is the best and check in and check out was very good the staff are very helpful and well mannered.The breakfast was good and there was lots to choose from. The Bar was also well runned the staff there were very good and I can not get over the politeness of the staff. The rooms are big and the beds are so amazing i did not want to get up. Nice and soft and the Linen was fresh Bathroom was good and clean. just one thing was our chair and leg rest are getting dirty and old. The lift were very clean and the entrance and Foyer also very clean with a nice smell. I was happy I chose to stay there and will stay again. Public transport every where but the carpark is right there and a big car park but the charges are very bad as for $55.00 per 24hrs is a bit to much~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477909859~“Concert Night”~Location was great for our stay due to attending concert at the Sydney ICC Theatre. Hotel reception staff were lovely. We were lucky enough to receive an upgrade to our room & were put into a room on the 6th floor overlooking Darling Harbour. Parking at Harbourside car park was easy & the hotel staff validated our parking ticket for the hotel parking price. Room was clean & modern. Bought takeaway cappuccinos, banana bread & bacon & egg muffin from Cafe for brekkie was reasonably priced & delicious. We enjoyed our brief stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477562102~“Exceptional Hotel”~Staff were incredibly helpful, from reception, housekeeping to the staff at the restaurant at breakfast who went out of their way to make my friend and all of us feel very special on her birthday. The Ternary restaurant staff esp Tim and manager Andrew really blew us away with their kindness and so very unexpected. The rooms were very comforfortable and well worth paying that little extra for a fabulous view of the city. This hotel has it all from location, to facilities and cleanliness and comfort. They were great with all the children which made our visit even more relaxing. Really pleased we booked this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Would definitely recommend .~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_477100298~“Wifi is not working”~Worst 5-star hotel ever. It's considered quite pricey but it's not worth the money. The wifi is the worst, practically it's not even working. You even have to pay 55bucks for the parking lot, like there is no complementary parking space even for in-house guest.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477063219~“Highlights and lowlights of a Darling Harbour icon”~This 3 night stay with my teenage son and his friend was a last minute decision. We usually stay in the Darling Harbour precinct and Novotel was a little indulgence over the usual apartment style experience of the past few visits. Upon arrival, there was an efficient porter service for our luggage. Up to reception where we were quickly checked in. Staff were efficient and friendly on this very busy Easter weekend. The room we booked was a Executive Darling Harbour view however I was very disappointed with room 732 which had an impeded view due to a wall jutting out beside our window and a new building being constructed nearby. I requested a room change and was moved the next day to room 735 which was everything we had anticipated. A beautiful large panoramic window revealed a glorious expansive view of the city which was especially beautiful at night. Our first room was spacious with wonderfully comfortable beds and a day bed however, the bathroom was showing its age with dated tiling and fittings and mould well inground into the grout, tiles and silicone sealant. A cold shower in the morning was also very disappointing. The hotel was full so this may have been a contributing factor in lack of hot water at 8am. The second room seemed a bit sparce but was adequate and spacious. The bed was not as soft but the bathroom had no mould. Again, the hot water was non existent with only tepid water for our showers in the morning. What lacked in the rooms was compensated for in the buffet breakfast. A magnificent selection available from bircher muesli, pancakes, fruit, pastries, hot selections, fresh cooked to order omelettes and barista made coffee to name a few. The staff in all areas; reception, bar, restaurant, porters etc were all very welcoming and genuinely friendly and willing to assist in making our stay pleasant The swimming pool does not have the view that is shown in the photos on the website due to the new building nearby so the photo should be updated. Parking was extra at $55 per day. The location on Darling Harbour is fantastic. A covered walkway to the shops and Darling Harbour opens up lots of shopping and dining options and its only 10 - 15 minutes walk across the bridge to the city or ferry wharf, The light rail is directly beside the hotel which goes to China Town (and through to Central). Lots of convenient options. I found the lack of signage to the swimming pool area a bit odd and the official website lacking in information and photographs. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour and would recommend this hotel, but only if you don't mind a cool shower.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan

review_476732252~“Awesome spot for family holiday”~Ticked all the boxes for a fantastic trip with a 7yr old & 5 year old plus 2 adults.  Pool, gym, huge selection for breakie (catering for even the fussiest eaters), barista coffee with breakfast, entertainment station in the foyer for kids, kids colouring and activity pack on arrival, pool and gym towels supplied, quick access to the harbourside shopping centre including a great food court and our fave Rashay's grill house.  We booked our car in the carpark independently of the hotel due to a special coupon code we found online- so check with the hotel and carpark directly to work out the best deal for you.   The public transport and taxi access is perfect- you have 2, 24 hr convenience stores within 200m of the front door.  We will probably look at a roll away bed next time to give ourselves some extra sleep space, i think if your kids were much older (or if you had 3 adults) you would definatley need the extra room - that said the beds were super comfy as were the pillows, the room was comfortable in temp so we didn't need the air con, the room was quiet and we only heard other guests when the excited kids ran along the hall talking about the Easter bunny (we were 6th floor back of the hotel). Staff are amazing, rooms clean, we felt welcome and really enjoyed our stay, hope you do too!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_476660562~“Novotel at its best”~2 nights at this hotel was perfect. The hotel room overlooked the harbour. It was a spacious room with the most comfortable bed. The staff were so friendly and as soon as you step through the revolving door the fresh smell in the air is very welcoming. The hotel is located in a great spot. Close to the casino and the ferry terminal is just a short walk over the pyrmont bridge. Loved everything about our short stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476631486~“Amazing, exceptional service”~We stayed at the Novotel Darling Harbour and had the most exceptional service I've ever had at a hotel.  Upon checking in we were greeted by the kindest, most personable employee, Andrew Austen, the guest experience manager. He made sure our room was perfectly suited and that we had everything we needed.  Upon checking out he personally saw to helping us arrange transfers to the airport.

review_476323066~“loved the room and the view”~We had a room overlooking the harbour. What a fantastic view and I would recommend paying the extra to have a room with a view. The location was excellent as you could walk anywhere around Darling Harbour and into the city. The beds were so so so comfortable. The room was spacious and the bathroom was a good size. We slept with the curtains open so we could enjoy the view every time we woke up. We had breakfast included in out rate. Breakfast was amazing. I enjoyed have an omelette freshly prepared for me and it was also good to have a coffee machine with decent coffee. I don't think anyone could have complained about the range of choice for breakfast. There was a power outage between midnight and 4am which they made us aware of and provided us with a torch. This meant that we wouldn't have air conditioning or TV which was inconvienent. However, they gave us free parkling and complimentary wine and beer from room service to make up for it which was nice!! So pleased I stayed at the Novotel and paid the extra for the view!!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476287883~“Overpriced ”~Stayed here 2 nights. Conveniently accessed by light rail from central, get off at "convention " stop. However no signage is visible.  Access is through the commercial car parking station.  When you walk down towards the pedestrian entrance to the car park there is a small sign on the wall which cannot be seen from the light rail stop. This requires immediate improvement. There needs to be a larger sign which can be immediately seen on alighting from the light rail.  Otherwise the hotel is conveniently located.  We had a large room overlooking Darling Harbour (which is overrated). The room was dated with tired and faded furnishings, although the bed was comfortable and breakfast was excellent.  The free wifi was so slow it was almost useless.  At more than $900 for two nights, very overpriced.  Around 7am on one morning there was an announcement over the loudspeaker in the room about a fire alarm on another level and for guests to "stand by". We waited more than an hour with no further announcement. Rang reception for information but call was not answered. There was never any further announcement or all clear given.  There needs to be some serious improvement in their fire alarm protocols.  Probably would not stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475575528~“Disorganised Staff but Nice views”~Stayed here for 4 nights whilst on route to visit family. Paid for breakfast each day prior to our stay and had the same carry on each and every morning with the incompetent staff. I had to show my booking confirmation the first 2 days to prove we where entitled to breakfast. On the third day I refused to show them my paperwork and just sat down and ate breakfast. The forth day I again refused to show proof and the duty manager was called. He was belligerent and totally unprofessional, virtually calling us liars. I flat refused to show and proof and told him to ask the young girl at the desk what had happened on previous days. He did and then came back and told us he would allow us in to eat, no apology for hotels ineptitude or anything.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_475120420~“People make all the difference”~Novotel has a great location, 10 min walk from shopping and close to conferences and right in the Harbour. The intention of this review is not to discuss rooms or property, or niggle over any complaints; nearly all hotels have their faults and mistakes, but... what this hotel excels in, is its people. From as soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by a commitment to warmth and professionalism. A full bus load of passengers from a delayed flight had arrived before us, so their was a check in queue 30 people long. We were immediately greeted by the GM, who saw to it that us, and any other guests with reservations were checked in promptly, given drinks, and looked after.  Due to a booking mistake on our end, we did not sleep the first night (ever tried to share a small double bed with a 6 year old who likes to kick in her sleep?) staff were amazing the next morning and facilitated a room upgrade that better suited our needs at no cost. Any error or misstep, either by us, or 'typical big hotel logistics' was fixed promptly and professionally... the front desk staff deserve a particular mention for their high professionalism, generosity and dedication to guest service. Well done Novotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474845678~“Outdated and over priced”~I stayed at the Novotel on Saturday night with a couple of my friends for a night out in Sydney city. When we arrived, the man at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful but unfortunately that's were most of the positives ended. When entering our room we noticed immediately that the view we thought we were going to have of Darling Harbour was actually the view of buildings and a construction site.  The shower felt like dribble and took almost forever to heat up, the beds were lumpy and on unlocked wheels, and the toilet paper felt like it was bought from a discount store.  Then on Sunday morning at 6:30am a man announced over the PA system that an alarm was going off on level 6 and there may be an evacuation to come so we all had to stand by for further instruction... there were no further instructions. I waited and waited until finally I went back to sleep.  The breakfast however was pretty good, just like a normal buffet style breakfast with lots of options and you can even have an omelette made on the spot for you. I don't drink coffee but my friends liked the fact that you could have a barista style coffee with your breakfast.  When heading back to our room after breakfast our access card no longer worked and we were locked out of our room. So we had to trek it back down 9 floors to fix the problem. At reception it was busy and a little chaotic. We had half an hour to pack our bags and check out but it seemed as if we would be standing in line for half an hour. At first we were rudely dismissed by one of the staff members however when another staff member saw this she immediately sorted out our issue.  A few days on I have now checked my bank account and noticed they charged my account twice. I called to ask why and was told one is a deposit that will be refunded and one is the actual payment. I wish I was told this previously as due to this it caused me to overdraw my bank account and now I will receive an overdraw fee from my bank.  Overall for a room costing almost $500 for the night, we expected a lot more. I wouldn't recommend it.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474464781~“tired & overpriced & disappointing”~stayed for a week as part of a conference at Darling Harbour. From check in to check out the service was poor and the reception staff did not seem to care. as an accor member I would expect some recognition and welcome but it seemed like the staff were to busy for that. Was given a room next to the lift & service room which resulted in an engine noise through the walls at all hours of the day & night or it could have been an air conditioning duct. Strong musty smell hits you as soon as you get off the lift, the room was small, outdated furniture that was chipped and scarred, the bathroom was old and the shower had no water pressure. Housekeeping arrived at 5pm one day to clean the room, the reception and restaurant area looks new and inviting but the bar service was dismal, serving drinks in cracked glasses and when shown the problem they don't care. There was a general feeling of charging as much as they can because they have a captive market being close to the convention centre.  The only positive was the beds which were quite comfortable.  Left feeling like I had been ripped off, would happily pay the amount charged if it was worth it but it wasn't. No thank you for staying or any inquiry about my stay on check out, just how are you paying the bill.~1~nan~nan~3~nan~2~2~nan
review_474407235~“Great hotel let down by room service”~Am staying at Novotel darling harbour for 4 days. Its a fabulous hotel and a great location. Staff are very friendly and helpful and in general I would have provided a 5 star rating on this. However the room service on first night left a lot to be desired. In defense of the hotel, I was told in advance of delays in the kitchen due to high volume which was fine. However it appears there was no delay in the kitchen but in the delivery. My food must have just sat there for an hour before being delivered. It was stone cold. You get free wifi if you join their loyalty program which is fine.~3~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_474363418~“Amazing accommdation”~Stayed here for two nights with my partner and the view was amazing. Rooms were clean and furniture was modern. The bed was big and comfortable to sleep in. So close to the wharf to catch the ferry and tram. Walking distance to the casino or you can catch the tram for 5min. Staff was helpful and accomodating. Breakfast buffet was incredible with all things you want for breakfast Would definitely stay there again!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473742461~“Underwhelming”~I stayed on a Saturday and Sunday prior to a Monday conference. I asked about the free WiFi offered on the sign at the counter. Turns out the free WiFi costs $10 per day! There was some confusion as to who was paying for the room (it was a group booking). Eventually, I made my way down a long sad hallway with stained and worn carpet to my room. The room itself was OK, but the shower was tepid and barely flowing. On the Sunday morning I was awoken at 6:45 by the PA. There was apparently a fire alarm indication on the sixth floor. Wardens were called to their stations and guests asked to stay in their rooms while the alarm was investigated. I quickly got dressed and waited to see if I would be evacuated. Then....nothing! I fell asleep fully clothed after waiting to see what would happen. This is poor form. I am a seasoned traveler and not one to panic. However nervous guests could have been left in a state of distress. That afternoon I decided to go to the bar and grab one of the $5 beers advertised between 5 and 7PM. Turns out they are $6. Not a major deal, but yet another reason if only give this hotel 3 stars.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473699862~“Pretty average. Very over priced!”~Last night I stayed here with 2 friends and we weren't overly impressed. The room had no view of the darling harbour waterfront, the shower took 10 minutes to heat to a bearable temperature instead of freezing and when we went back to our room after breakfast, we were locked out of our room even though we had a late checkout. When we went down to tell them about our room key, all the staff were busy (which is understandable). I asked a lady but she dismissed us as she was checking out airport crew. My friends weren't happy with the beds and just to be picky for a supposedly 4.5 star hotel, the toilet paper was 1 ply. The staff overall were good and the $35 breakfast was impressive with a barista coffee.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472314728~“Superb”~We stayed here for four nights when we were in Sydney and I must say this hotel, although expensive, is fantastic. The room had stunning views of the harbour and when lit up at night was magical. The staff are friendly, efficient and very approachable.

review_472234218~“Perfect spot to take on Sydney”~Darling Harbour is one of the joys of Sydney and IMO a better tourist stay than the CBD or North Sydney. This hotel has all of the amenities you want inside and its location is about perfect outside.  - Footbridge to the Harbourside Shopping Centre and Harbour promenade - Restaurants of all types within 5 mins - IGA Supermarket across the street to keep your minibar affordable - 10min walk across Darling bridge to downtown if you want to venture~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_472128908~“Weekend stay ”~Location is very ideal, next to the shops on darling harbour and a quick walk away from the CBD where qvb, Martin Place etc. are. The rooms are clean but a bit outdated; the carpet in our room had a huge stain on it but looks like hotel management doesn't care whether we notice it or not as they did not even bother to cover it up (with some sort of furniture, for example) Anyway, the rooms are still pretty spacious anyway and the beds, like in most Accor group hotels, were very comfortable and cozy.  The food in their only restaurant was surprisingly reasonable and most dishes we ordered one dinner were amazingly good. Coffee and pasties in their coffee shop were good as well.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471832574~“Does the trick”~The Novotel on Darling Harbour is located well being around a ten-fifteen minute walk from Pitt Street (shopping!) It is clean and tidy, lightly funny smelling.

review_471785463~“First time in Sydney”~We made a very last minute decision to visit my son who has been living here the past 2 years. The location was superb. Close to the harbour, a bridge away from the City, & opposite the water taxi to Manly. The room was a tad small but perfectly function able. Tea & coffee making facilities, tv, Internet. Bathroom with both shower & bath. Check in staff were very helpful and knowledgable. Breakfast was Buffett style & ok, although some of the pastries were dry or stale.  I'd definitely return, just due to the location itself.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471493545~“Noisy hotel in need of a refurb.”~Booked here for 3 night stay for a conference. Paid extra for an earlier flight and accommodation for the night before the conference thinking I'd have a good nights sleep and awake refreshed for the long day ahead. Not at this hotel! In summary; - hotel prioritises revenue from hosting functions over needs of paying sleeping guests - at least three (of the four I was put in) rooms were tired and in need of modernisation - hotel services after hours are poor eg. telephones are not answered and there are very minimal staff available - charges a premium price for it's location and then fails to deliver a premium service First room (5th floor) faced onto the central atrium and was instantly aware of loud music coming from what I was told was a function. When asked staff reassured me that the bar shut at 10 so noise would ease then. On this basis I tried to settle for the night. Suffice it to say music and crowd noise continued past 10pm so I packed back up and went back to request to be moved to a quieter room. Moved to a room on the third floor and this was worse. A very scruffy room and very noisy. Felt like a room above a disco!  There seemed to be little or no acoustic insulation for the function room from sleeping accommodation. I tried to call front desk - no answer. Same story from all the hotel contact numbers but eventually got through to room service - they stated that the function was due to finish at 10.30PM (it was then 10.40) but although it had overrun it would quieten soon. 20 minutes later the 'disco' was still going strong (I was by then not in any mood to take up Whitney Houston's offer of a dance with somebody!). Once again I packed up and resolved that I'd give up on this hotel and find one I could actually sleep at. Man at front desk was apologetic but stated that he could not refund me for tonights stay as it was 'too late'. This was the point I'm afraid I lost my patience and became the 'angry man at the desk'. We eventually agreed that he could find me room he would guarantee would be noise free - 10th floor and one of their suites. It was indeed quiet enough to sleep in but now after midnight and seething I did not have a restful night. I was told this room was booked out for the next day and would have to vacate the room again so spent the day carrying around all my possessions and exhausted. Instead of feeling refreshed there were a couple of points in the day I could have easily nodded off (the opposite of what I planned for). By then I was sick of having spent so much of my time moving from room to room and resolved to just put up with whatever the hotel provided me with so long as it was quiet. I was given a room on the 9th floor which was tired, in need of redecoration but just about quiet enough to sleep in. The hotel has a good location (particularly for the conference centre) and the dining room downstairs is modern and pleasant. I would not stay in this hotel again and would not recommend it to others; - it does not give enough priority to the comfort of it's guests - it has not invested in maintaining the standard of it's rooms - it is trying to get away with minimal staff and hence the service of the hotel suffers.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~2~2~nan

My room was upgraded to a corner suite with a view of a harbour, and it was very clean and comfortable. I spent many hours each day walking for the convention, so was so thrilled to come back to the room to put my feet up and relax! The bed was very comfortable - plenty of pillows, lovely soft linens, and best of all the room was quiet! I didn't hear any noise from the street, hallway or other rooms. This is a big plus for me. Breakfast was delicious, with many options to choose from (buffet style). Seating was comfortable and the dining area was well lit by ambient light, and had a harbour view. I would have no hesitation in recommending this property and would stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_470430328~“Great hotel - great location”~Great hotel for staying in Sydney. Close to many amenities and sites. Enjoyed the 50% happy hour from 17h00 to 19h00. Bar, restaurant and reception staff are incredibly helpful. Rates do not include breakfast and I found that to be expensive. Wifi was not good at all.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470421698~“A weekend conference”~I recently attended a weekend conference of around 200 people at this hotel, two days of conference and a Saturday night function in the same room. The room was set up well, comfortable chairs, and was tidied at every break. The hot and cold water stations outside were kept amply supplied by pleasant and attentive staff.  The access was through the restaurant but no problem to us and it didn't seem disturb the diners. The buffet breakfast looked very tempting as we walked through to an 8am start.  There was a large deck overlooking Darling Harbour area and a pleasant lounge at the far end of the dining area to enjoy during our breaks.  Our evening function was extremely well catered, healthy and tasty finger food and very attentive and pleasant staff. All deserve to be complimented, especially Jennifer who responded to several requests pleasantly and efficiently. There was a dance area and good music at an acceptably loud volume. I was not an organiser, just an attendee so can't comment on the cost per head, but it was an extremely well run, enabling participants to concentrate on the content of the weekend. The only drawback was the ladies loo beside the conference room only had three cubicles, not enough! Though there was a much larger facility a short walk away at the other end of the dining area.  But a very pleasant experience overall.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470226929~“Nice View but ...”~Maybe it's just me but I expect hot water for my morning shower. Stayed here for 3 nights in an expensive room with a nice harbour view. However the water was like warm at best, simply cold one morning. The low volume shower head was also one of the worst I've experienced. The floor of the bath/shower was worn and grubby looking. Staffing of the reception desk was poor (nice staff but too few). The expensive breakfast was run of the mill and with many eateries nearby not good value. Having stayed in a variety of places all over the world I wouldn't class this as 5, 4, or even 3 stars. Certainly not worth the relatively high cost, even with the view.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470022209~“Great location and Breakfast!”~I loved their breakfast and it is walking distance from Darling harbour. The rooms have a great glass view but it is covered.

review_469930362~“Absolutely right there- brilliant views- Excellent!”~You can get reasonable price deals by booking online- and as its a Novotel you get the great breakfast smorgasbord of excellent food and drinks- even fresh juice! You overlook Darling Harbour- are linked by nearby walkway in the famous shopping centre and attractions. Shopping is pretty good here for souvenirs as well. You can walk through the gardens then into City itself or go the Chinatown eateries. You might be surprised how reasonable prices can be- excepting when there are any big events on.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_469890273~“Comfortable bed and quiet”~Stayed for business with two nights added for personal time. Bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and made for great nights sleep. As per previous reviews they are upgrading the Hotel so if you want to stay in the new part ask when booking and Level 5 is not it. Also if you want a view of Darling Harbour make sure you ask for it for a room with it as there is a new 34 story Hotel going up that blocks the view from parts of the Novotel.  The in room meals were beautifully cooked and presented, and were good value - a bonus when female and travelling alone. The room was a good size as was the bathroom. Shower doesn't have a huge amount of pressure but you often get that in Hotels.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_468214713~“Ultra-convenient”~This is the hotel that features in most travel brochures of Darling Harbor. From here you can walk to all the restaurants and shops and the Convention Centre. For less than twenty dollars you can catch a ferry outside the hotel and have the best views of Sydney - under the Bridge, alongside the Opera House and across to Manly. Unbelievably beautiful.  The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Make sure you get a room with views to the city centre. The breakfast restaurant also has beautiful views across to the city. Rooms were generally clean. We were missing a remote for the TV (which the staff brought up quickly when asked) and, in looking for the remote, found some old empty wine bottles under the bed.  If you want a really healthy cheap meal, there is a Grill'd restaurant in the adjacent Harbourside complex, just next to the bridge.~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_468099098~“Great Location”~Spacious room with good lobby restaurant. Hotel located just beside the harbour with lots of restaurants to choose from, a small mall with basic stores and a foodcourt. Monorail located below to access other parts of the city. Mini stores nearby and a Coles supermarket just 5 mins walk away.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467692355~“Disapointing”~I just really feel they took advantage of me and cheated me of $100. The pizza was not that good, the room was stuffy and hot and the airconditioning did not work properly. Great view, and some of the staff were really good, hopefully they apply at tge Ritz Carlton when it opens in Sydney. Unlikely, i will stay at another Novotel again.~1~1~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467679953~“Great location, very affordable”~So close to everything - the Rocks, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour itself, light rail station downstairs too. I recommend the view over DH!  The fittings were a little tired and aged, but not to the point of being a problem - but for the good price, really good service and the location, it's not really noticeable. I'll be back there.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467640280~“Best customer service.”~My mum and i had the most fantastic experience. We where upgraded to harbour views our first night.Thanks to the lafy who served us. We decided to see if we could, stay the second night because we had such a great time. Our flight wasnt until the next day. We asked the prices, they were huge double what we payed months ago. Due to adele being in sydney. We then explained to the staff Andrew Austen we werent planning on staying the second night because we were staying with mums sister in the suburbs and our situation. He didnt hesitate to help us. He did what he could to give us a close price and upgraded us. His service was just fantastic. The best i have ever recieved. The views are amazing, the restautant breakfast is just amazing. Anything you can think of they have. The dinner menue is to die for, the asian stir fry was so authentic and bursting with flavour. The happy hour $5 drinks include spirits. The beds are comfortable. The gentelmen that greet etc. Have a great knowledge of the transport and were happy to help. To the young man that was outstanding, im sure his name was Tom, thankyou. The light rail is just a 2 minute walk. It takes you most major destinations and to central station. So in conclusion wow a must stay and definatley see Andrew for resevations he will make your stay outstanding. Photo is theview from our room. Thank you team ☺~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467432960~“Very dissapointing”~Expected more from this hotel being it is in a prime position and isn't cheap. Check in staff were very friendly & efficient. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready but they hurried things along & after a coffee in the bar we were able to use our room. The public areas are nice, modern & clean. The rooms however are well in need of some attention, the carpets were worn & dirty and decor generally very basic & unwelcoming. I was trying to call reception & Concierge for a good hour with no response which is extremely worrying for anyone with an emergency as outside calls are also 'not available'~2~nan~4~nan~1~nan~2~nan
review_467101888~“Perfect family getaway”~To celebrate our sons birthday, we recently stayed in an Executive room on the tenth floor at the Novotel with fantastic views sweeping over Darling Harbour. We had stayed at the Novotel many years before, but had forgotten how convenient it was to get to by car (a two hour country trip for us), with parking right on site. The hotel itself couldn't be in a better location for all the attractions that bring families to the Darling Quarter, with countless shops and food at Harbourside, cafes, bars and restaurants at Cockle Bay and the nearby newly developed entertainment strip at Barrangaroo. Chinatown is probably around ten minutes walk away too. It's an easy stroll across to the Darling Harbour Aquarium, Madame Tussaud's, boat cruises and less than ten minutes walk into the city centre where you can wander through the historic QVB building with all its speciality stores, food and magic architecture. The kids loved the city lights and reflections at night time, although the only minor complaint about our room was that we weren't offered a bed configuration so our two young children shared a double bed. We also had a little noise one night from an adjoining room, but it was the Mardi Gras weekend, so quite a few people were celebrating. The breakfast deal was discounted for our stay which was generous and the kids ate free. The hotel restaurant/lobby space is so open and full of light and space with tremendous views, tasteful decor that we also dined one night and found the food and attention from staff was most acceptable. Hotel staff were extremely attentive and had wonderful customer service skills. Very happy we chose the Novotel and would definitely go back based on this experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467092707~“Perfect in every way”~A beautiful, clean hotel in an amazing location. Pay a bit extra for a harbour view room - it is worth every dollar. There's really nothing negative. We had a pleasant check in and check out experience, great room service, and the restaurant downstairs is brilliant. Not to mention the cute young bartenders who make a brilliant old-fashioned.  The location is great - just a short walk from the tunnel to the Darling Harbour mall and the harbour itself. Many restaurants and coffee shops nearby.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467084364~“Great location”~I originally booked accomodation via an online booking app then a few days out I rechecked the prices and saw that the Hotels own rewards program had a much cheaper price. After confirming that online booking would cancel (they had to check with hotel) the Hotel agreed to rebook at their price. Very happy with the Hotels attitude to this and surprised they were so obliging.  The restaurant was a pleasant dinner with children receiving a great backpack and colouring in set each. The breakfast time was very busy but again a good meal. The coffee line was far too long to utilise the free coffee slip per adult. The children ate breakfast free in the room deal which was great because kids don't eat that much to justify the cost. There was a small kids corner on reception level where there seemed to be a video game set up, unfortunately 2 kids hogged this and did not share with the growing group of kids waiting patiently. This was near to where happy hour with cheese platters available for purchase was located on reception level and a few more kids games/tv available here would have been perfect. We had easy parking and a very close walk into the Darling Harbour shopping precinct where attractions, shops and restaurants were plentiful. Easy walk to Aquarium, Maritime museum etc. The rooms were a little dated but the price and location made up for it. Toiletries supplied in bathroom also.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_466664463~“Really bad experience!”~Firstly, the hotel is old, the facilities are old and worn out and need a renovation. Secondly, they seem to lack pest control as there was a cockroach in the room on the second night I stayed there.  Thirdly and most importantly, I used the express checkout service for convenience and received an invoice in my email charging me $61.79 on my credit card from the mini-bar even though I did not touch anything from the mini-bar whatsoever. Called up the hotel to resolve this issue and told me that I will be expecting a call back on the day. Sent 3 follow up emails to resolve this issue and no reply whatsoever. If you want to experience cockroaches in your room and be charged on unauthorized transactions on your credit card for unused mini-bar consumption, and not receive ANY response when trying to resolve the matter from the hotel, then this is the hotel for you. I am very disappointed and I've never had such an experience at any hotel. I am going to give it a couple more days before I raise this with my credit card company and will be filing a formal complaint.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan

We geo the Go Wild package and it was the most value for money deal I have ever come across. Joshua at the front desk was looked after us from there he was delightful and once again went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and made this a wonderful experience for all of us.

We were then offered an upgrade which was unexpected but very nice. Our room was large and very clean also had a bath in the bathroom. The restaurant area very modern and tastefully decorated. A great coffee shop on level one which served good coffee and we sat on the balcony outside and read the paper in the morning sun, just so relaxing. Location you just cant bet it, a hop skip and a jump to  Darling harbour and the light rail down stairs which takes you to central station.  From concierge, reception , through to bar staff, Thank you :)~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_465688151~“Overnighter for Business”~Just an observation but the check in desk wasn't exactly easy to locate or stand out as you arrive. It's located on the second floor up the escalators around to the left. The location was marvellous. Right on the harbour so plenty to see and food options to choose from. I was awoken by next door occupants during the early hours of morning who seemed to be enjoying an encounter of sorts if you know what I mean. Then at 6am there was industrial works outside which I woke to as well. So it wasn't the best of nights sleep.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_463366153~“INCOMPITANT AND LACK OF CARE”~Our rooms where not available at the time we agreed on. Which was reconfirmed only 2 days earlier direct with a hotel. We where coming from a wedding ceremony to change for the reception and timing was crucial. Once we got 1 out of the 2 rooms we where confronted with very tied and old rooms. On complaining about this we where offered to come back another time with an upgrade offer and breakfast and dinner to truly experience the hotel. I tried to book this recently and was told I misunderstood. Its a shame as Novotel around the world are great but Darling Harbour just doesn't seem to care as they rely on its great location. If you can book another hotel. I am a travel agent.~1~nan~nan~2~nan~3~1~nan

review_462110530~“Perfect location”~We enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Novotel. The room was perfect for the 3 of us. Ideally located far enough away from the CBD to ensure a more relaxed holiday feel, yet only a short (and pleasant) walk across Pyrmont Bridge into the heart of the city. Every staff member we encountered at the Novotel were friendly and helpful. Special mention to the barista single-handedly handling a very busy breakfast rush with politeness and good cheer (and no compromise to the quality of the coffee!). We were spoilt for choice with restaurant options only 5 minutes walk away across the covered walkway which took you through the shopping centre and out to the waterfront. We would definitely return to the Novotel next time we are in Sydney.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461636049~“Exceptional food and service ”~I stay in Sydney a lot for business, and can't rate any higher the experience I've had at the Novotel. The interior is modern (a bit lush) and grand, with views of Darling Harbour from their atrium and balcony. Rooms are clean, modern, and well maintained. The service from the staff is friendly and attentive, but not OTT, which I personally appreciate. The restaurant is by far their greatest draw card. A lot of excitement and theatre, including fusion Asian dishes and classic hotel menu choices. The opportunity to sit and watch the chefs prepare your food at the single seated bar is excellent for people like myself, travelling alone, who enjoy good food, wine and a bit of panache.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The Ternary restaurant staff esp Tim and manager Andrew really blew us away with their kindness and so very unexpected.

review_477063219~“Highlights and lowlights of a Darling Harbour icon”~This 3 night stay with my teenage son and his friend was a last minute decision. We usually stay in the Darling Harbour precinct and Novotel was a little indulgence over the usual apartment style experience of the past few visits. Upon arrival, there was an efficient porter service for our luggage. Up to reception where we were quickly checked in. Staff were efficient and friendly on this very busy Easter weekend. The room we booked was a Executive Darling Harbour view however I was very disappointed with room 732 which had an impeded view due to a wall jutting out beside our window and a new building being constructed nearby. I requested a room change and was moved the next day to room 735 which was everything we had anticipated. A beautiful large panoramic window revealed a glorious expansive view of the city which was especially beautiful at night. Our first room was spacious with wonderfully comfortable beds and a day bed however, the bathroom was showing its age with dated tiling and fittings and mould well inground into the grout, tiles and silicone sealant. A cold shower in the morning was also very disappointing. The hotel was full so this may have been a contributing factor in lack of hot water at 8am. The second room seemed a bit sparce but was adequate and spacious. The bed was not as soft but the bathroom had no mould. Again, the hot water was non existent with only tepid water for our showers in the morning. What lacked in the rooms was compensated for in the buffet breakfast. A magnificent selection available from bircher muesli, pancakes, fruit, pastries, hot selections, fresh cooked to order omelettes and barista made coffee to name a few. The staff in all areas; reception, bar, restaurant, porters etc were all very welcoming and genuinely friendly and willing to assist in making our stay pleasant The swimming pool does not have the view that is shown in the photos on the website due to the new building nearby so the photo should be updated. Parking was extra at $55 per day. The location on Darling Harbour is fantastic. A covered walkway to the shops and Darling Harbour opens up lots of shopping and dining options and its only 10 - 15 minutes walk across the bridge to the city or ferry wharf, The light rail is directly beside the hotel which goes to China Town (and through to Central). Lots of convenient options. I found the lack of signage to the swimming pool area a bit odd and the official website lacking in information and photographs. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour and would recommend this hotel, but only if you don't mind a cool shower.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan

review_476961140~“AMAZING! ”~Fantastic! Beautiful room with darling harbour view for good price. Nice big bath! Serviced room while out for day. Amazing breakfast for extra $2.50 each per day.

review_476732252~“Awesome spot for family holiday”~Ticked all the boxes for a fantastic trip with a 7yr old & 5 year old plus 2 adults.  Pool, gym, huge selection for breakie (catering for even the fussiest eaters), barista coffee with breakfast, entertainment station in the foyer for kids, kids colouring and activity pack on arrival, pool and gym towels supplied, quick access to the harbourside shopping centre including a great food court and our fave Rashay's grill house.  We booked our car in the carpark independently of the hotel due to a special coupon code we found online- so check with the hotel and carpark directly to work out the best deal for you.   The public transport and taxi access is perfect- you have 2, 24 hr convenience stores within 200m of the front door.  We will probably look at a roll away bed next time to give ourselves some extra sleep space, i think if your kids were much older (or if you had 3 adults) you would definatley need the extra room - that said the beds were super comfy as were the pillows, the room was comfortable in temp so we didn't need the air con, the room was quiet and we only heard other guests when the excited kids ran along the hall talking about the Easter bunny (we were 6th floor back of the hotel). Staff are amazing, rooms clean, we felt welcome and really enjoyed our stay, hope you do too!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_476660562~“Novotel at its best”~2 nights at this hotel was perfect. The hotel room overlooked the harbour. It was a spacious room with the most comfortable bed. The staff were so friendly and as soon as you step through the revolving door the fresh smell in the air is very welcoming. The hotel is located in a great spot. Close to the casino and the ferry terminal is just a short walk over the pyrmont bridge. Loved everything about our short stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476637191~“All class, amazing location”~Great hotel, friendly staff, amazing facilities, PERFECT location. We had an issue with aircon in the room not working, however we were given free car parking to make up for the inconvenience ($55 per night!). Absolutely loved this place.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_476631486~“Amazing, exceptional service”~We stayed at the Novotel Darling Harbour and had the most exceptional service I've ever had at a hotel.  Upon checking in we were greeted by the kindest, most personable employee, Andrew Austen, the guest experience manager. He made sure our room was perfectly suited and that we had everything we needed.  Upon checking out he personally saw to helping us arrange transfers to the airport.  Thank you again Andrew​!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476414818~“Easter stay”~Very good service. Rooms great and location excellent. Concierge very helpful. Will definitely stay with the kids again. Breakfast very good and great value with Accor membership. Kids eat free and 50% discount for adults.~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_476323066~“loved the room and the view”~We had a room overlooking the harbour. What a fantastic view and I would recommend paying the extra to have a room with a view. The location was excellent as you could walk anywhere around Darling Harbour and into the city. The beds were so so so comfortable. The room was spacious and the bathroom was a good size. We slept with the curtains open so we could enjoy the view every time we woke up. We had breakfast included in out rate. Breakfast was amazing. I enjoyed have an omelette freshly prepared for me and it was also good to have a coffee machine with decent coffee. I don't think anyone could have complained about the range of choice for breakfast. There was a power outage between midnight and 4am which they made us aware of and provided us with a torch. This meant that we wouldn't have air conditioning or TV which was inconvienent. However, they gave us free parkling and complimentary wine and beer from room service to make up for it which was nice!! So pleased I stayed at the Novotel and paid the extra for the view!!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476287883~“Overpriced ”~Stayed here 2 nights. Conveniently accessed by light rail from central, get off at "convention " stop. However no signage is visible.  Access is through the commercial car parking station.  When you walk down towards the pedestrian entrance to the car park there is a small sign on the wall which cannot be seen from the light rail stop. This requires immediate improvement. There needs to be a larger sign which can be immediately seen on alighting from the light rail.  Otherwise the hotel is conveniently located.  We had a large room overlooking Darling Harbour (which is overrated). The room was dated with tired and faded furnishings, although the bed was comfortable and breakfast was excellent.  The free wifi was so slow it was almost useless.  At more than $900 for two nights, very overpriced.  Around 7am on one morning there was an announcement over the loudspeaker in the room about a fire alarm on another level and for guests to "stand by". We waited more than an hour with no further announcement. Rang reception for information but call was not answered. There was never any further announcement or all clear given.  There needs to be some serious improvement in their fire alarm protocols.  Probably would not stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476253680~“1 night stay”~My family and I had a 1 night stay at the novatel darling harbour. Location is fantastic, family room was very large with 2 queen beds and 1 single.staff were all polite and helpful. The Buffett breakfast was also great.the pizza at Criniti's which very close was magnificent. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475575528~“Disorganised Staff but Nice views”~Stayed here for 4 nights whilst on route to visit family. Paid for breakfast each day prior to our stay and had the same carry on each and every morning with the incompetent staff. I had to show my booking confirmation the first 2 days to prove we where entitled to breakfast. On the third day I refused to show them my paperwork and just sat down and ate breakfast. The forth day I again refused to show proof and the duty manager was called. He was belligerent and totally unprofessional, virtually calling us liars. I flat refused to show and proof and told him to ask the young girl at the desk what had happened on previous days. He did and then came back and told us he would allow us in to eat, no apology for hotels ineptitude or anything.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_475144446~“couple of days away”~We had two rooms beside each other with 7 family members on a family holiday.

review_475120420~“People make all the difference”~Novotel has a great location, 10 min walk from shopping and close to conferences and right in the Harbour. The intention of this review is not to discuss rooms or property, or niggle over any complaints; nearly all hotels have their faults and mistakes, but... what this hotel excels in, is its people. From as soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by a commitment to warmth and professionalism. A full bus load of passengers from a delayed flight had arrived before us, so their was a check in queue 30 people long. We were immediately greeted by the GM, who saw to it that us, and any other guests with reservations were checked in promptly, given drinks, and looked after.  Due to a booking mistake on our end, we did not sleep the first night (ever tried to share a small double bed with a 6 year old who likes to kick in her sleep?) staff were amazing the next morning and facilitated a room upgrade that better suited our needs at no cost. Any error or misstep, either by us, or 'typical big hotel logistics' was fixed promptly and professionally... the front desk staff deserve a particular mention for their high professionalism, generosity and dedication to guest service. Well done Novotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474845678~“Outdated and over priced”~I stayed at the Novotel on Saturday night with a couple of my friends for a night out in Sydney city. When we arrived, the man at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful but unfortunately that's were most of the positives ended. When entering our room we noticed immediately that the view we thought we were going to have of Darling Harbour was actually the view of buildings and a construction site.  The shower felt like dribble and took almost forever to heat up, the beds were lumpy and on unlocked wheels, and the toilet paper felt like it was bought from a discount store.  Then on Sunday morning at 6:30am a man announced over the PA system that an alarm was going off on level 6 and there may be an evacuation to come so we all had to stand by for further instruction... there were no further instructions. I waited and waited until finally I went back to sleep.  The breakfast however was pretty good, just like a normal buffet style breakfast with lots of options and you can even have an omelette made on the spot for you. I don't drink coffee but my friends liked the fact that you could have a barista style coffee with your breakfast.  When heading back to our room after breakfast our access card no longer worked and we were locked out of our room. So we had to trek it back down 9 floors to fix the problem. At reception it was busy and a little chaotic. We had half an hour to pack our bags and check out but it seemed as if we would be standing in line for half an hour. At first we were rudely dismissed by one of the staff members however when another staff member saw this she immediately sorted out our issue.  A few days on I have now checked my bank account and noticed they charged my account twice. I called to ask why and was told one is a deposit that will be refunded and one is the actual payment. I wish I was told this previously as due to this it caused me to overdraw my bank account and now I will receive an overdraw fee from my bank.  Overall for a room costing almost $500 for the night, we expected a lot more. I wouldn't recommend it.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474464781~“tired & overpriced & disappointing”~stayed for a week as part of a conference at Darling Harbour. From check in to check out the service was poor and the reception staff did not seem to care. as an accor member I would expect some recognition and welcome but it seemed like the staff were to busy for that. Was given a room next to the lift & service room which resulted in an engine noise through the walls at all hours of the day & night or it could have been an air conditioning duct. Strong musty smell hits you as soon as you get off the lift, the room was small, outdated furniture that was chipped and scarred, the bathroom was old and the shower had no water pressure. Housekeeping arrived at 5pm one day to clean the room, the reception and restaurant area looks new and inviting but the bar service was dismal, serving drinks in cracked glasses and when shown the problem they don't care. There was a general feeling of charging as much as they can because they have a captive market being close to the convention centre.  The only positive was the beds which were quite comfortable.  Left feeling like I had been ripped off, would happily pay the amount charged if it was worth it but it wasn't. No thank you for staying or any inquiry about my stay on check out, just how are you paying the bill.~1~nan~nan~3~nan~2~2~nan
review_474407235~“Great hotel let down by room service”~Am staying at Novotel darling harbour for 4 days. Its a fabulous hotel and a great location. Staff are very friendly and helpful and in general I would have provided a 5 star rating on this. However the room service on first night left a lot to be desired. In defense of the hotel, I was told in advance of delays in the kitchen due to high volume which was fine. However it appears there was no delay in the kitchen but in the delivery. My food must have just sat there for an hour before being delivered. It was stone cold. You get free wifi if you join their loyalty program which is fine.~3~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_474363418~“Amazing accommdation”~Stayed here for two nights with my partner and the view was amazing. Rooms were clean and furniture was modern. The bed was big and comfortable to sleep in. So close to the wharf to catch the ferry and tram. Walking distance to the casino or you can catch the tram for 5min. Staff was helpful and accomodating. Breakfast buffet was incredible with all things you want for breakfast Would definitely stay there again!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473742461~“Underwhelming”~I stayed on a Saturday and Sunday prior to a Monday conference. I asked about the free WiFi offered on the sign at the counter. Turns out the free WiFi costs $10 per day! There was some confusion as to who was paying for the room (it was a group booking). Eventually, I made my way down a long sad hallway with stained and worn carpet to my room. The room itself was OK, but the shower was tepid and barely flowing. On the Sunday morning I was awoken at 6:45 by the PA. There was apparently a fire alarm indication on the sixth floor. Wardens were called to their stations and guests asked to stay in their rooms while the alarm was investigated. I quickly got dressed and waited to see if I would be evacuated. Then....nothing! I fell asleep fully clothed after waiting to see what would happen. This is poor form. I am a seasoned traveler and not one to panic. However nervous guests could have been left in a state of distress. That afternoon I decided to go to the bar and grab one of the $5 beers advertised between 5 and 7PM. Turns out they are $6. Not a major deal, but yet another reason if only give this hotel 3 stars.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473725758~“Very comfortable stay”~We stayed at the novotel while we were in Sydney for my husband conference and we found it excellent  Beds were comfortable, room clean and it was quiet and relaxing I like the harbour view at night and the proximity to shopping and convention centre and transport Check in and check out was quick  Staff was professional and friendly ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473699862~“Pretty average. Very over priced!”~Last night I stayed here with 2 friends and we weren't overly impressed. The room had no view of the darling harbour waterfront, the shower took 10 minutes to heat to a bearable temperature instead of freezing and when we went back to our room after breakfast, we were locked out of our room even though we had a late checkout. When we went down to tell them about our room key, all the staff were busy (which is understandable). I asked a lady but she dismissed us as she was checking out airport crew. My friends weren't happy with the beds and just to be picky for a supposedly 4.5 star hotel, the toilet paper was 1 ply. The staff overall were good and the $35 breakfast was impressive with a barista coffee.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472511963~“Good location ”~I love location that close to Tram (Convention station). Room is clean & sizable. Razor, toothbrush, cotton buds and pads are available but need to asking for.

review_472314728~“Superb”~We stayed here for four nights when we were in Sydney and I must say this hotel, although expensive, is fantastic. The room had stunning views of the harbour and when lit up at night was magical. The staff are friendly, efficient and very approachable. The food in the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner was first class. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a luxurious and special break.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472234218~“Perfect spot to take on Sydney”~Darling Harbour is one of the joys of Sydney and IMO a better tourist stay than the CBD or North Sydney. This hotel has all of the amenities you want inside and its location is about perfect outside.  - Footbridge to the Harbourside Shopping Centre and Harbour promenade - Restaurants of all types within 5 mins - IGA Supermarket across the street to keep your minibar affordable - 10min walk across Darling bridge to downtown if you want to venture~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_472128908~“Weekend stay ”~Location is very ideal, next to the shops on darling harbour and a quick walk away from the CBD where qvb, Martin Place etc. are. The rooms are clean but a bit outdated; the carpet in our room had a huge stain on it but looks like hotel management doesn't care whether we notice it or not as they did not even bother to cover it up (with some sort of furniture, for example) Anyway, the rooms are still pretty spacious anyway and the beds, like in most Accor group hotels, were very comfortable and cozy.  The food in their only restaurant was surprisingly reasonable and most dishes we ordered one dinner were amazingly good. Coffee and pasties in their coffee shop were good as well.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471832574~“Does the trick”~The Novotel on Darling Harbour is located well being around a ten-fifteen minute walk from Pitt Street (shopping!) It is clean and tidy, lightly funny smelling. Nothing 'oh ah' to report but if your purpose is just to have somewhere to lay your head at night this is a good choice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471785463~“First time in Sydney”~We made a very last minute decision to visit my son who has been living here the past 2 years. The location was superb. Close to the harbour, a bridge away from the City, & opposite the water taxi to Manly. The room was a tad small but perfectly function able. Tea & coffee making facilities, tv, Internet. Bathroom with both shower & bath. Check in staff were very helpful and knowledgable. Breakfast was Buffett style & ok, although some of the pastries were dry or stale.  I'd definitely return, just due to the location itself.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471503546~“Amazing experience everytime”~We stayed at Novotel Darling Harbour from the 11 March to the 13 March. Our stay was not only pleasant but made more comfortable by the friendly accommodating staff. Most of the time people pick up the phone or email to complain but I thought let me take the opportunity to thank the staff on duty. Just to name a few, and I am not good with last names so apologies, Josh (Assistant manager), Amanda (at the check in desk), Jackie and the others. Thank you so much for making our stay enjoyable and comfortable. We look forward to staying with you again.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_471493545~“Noisy hotel in need of a refurb.”~Booked here for 3 night stay for a conference. Paid extra for an earlier flight and accommodation for the night before the conference thinking I'd have a good nights sleep and awake refreshed for the long day ahead. Not at this hotel! In summary; - hotel prioritises revenue from hosting functions over needs of paying sleeping guests - at least three (of the four I was put in) rooms were tired and in need of modernisation - hotel services after hours are poor eg. telephones are not answered and there are very minimal staff available - charges a premium price for it's location and then fails to deliver a premium service First room (5th floor) faced onto the central atrium and was instantly aware of loud music coming from what I was told was a function. When asked staff reassured me that the bar shut at 10 so noise would ease then. On this basis I tried to settle for the night. Suffice it to say music and crowd noise continued past 10pm so I packed back up and went back to request to be moved to a quieter room. Moved to a room on the third floor and this was worse. A very scruffy room and very noisy. Felt like a room above a disco!  There seemed to be little or no acoustic insulation for the function room from sleeping accommodation. I tried to call front desk - no answer. Same story from all the hotel contact numbers but eventually got through to room service - they stated that the function was due to finish at 10.30PM (it was then 10.40) but although it had overrun it would quieten soon. 20 minutes later the 'disco' was still going strong (I was by then not in any mood to take up Whitney Houston's offer of a dance with somebody!). Once again I packed up and resolved that I'd give up on this hotel and find one I could actually sleep at. Man at front desk was apologetic but stated that he could not refund me for tonights stay as it was 'too late'. This was the point I'm afraid I lost my patience and became the 'angry man at the desk'. We eventually agreed that he could find me room he would guarantee would be noise free - 10th floor and one of their suites. It was indeed quiet enough to sleep in but now after midnight and seething I did not have a restful night. I was told this room was booked out for the next day and would have to vacate the room again so spent the day carrying around all my possessions and exhausted. Instead of feeling refreshed there were a couple of points in the day I could have easily nodded off (the opposite of what I planned for). By then I was sick of having spent so much of my time moving from room to room and resolved to just put up with whatever the hotel provided me with so long as it was quiet. I was given a room on the 9th floor which was tired, in need of redecoration but just about quiet enough to sleep in. The hotel has a good location (particularly for the conference centre) and the dining room downstairs is modern and pleasant. I would not stay in this hotel again and would not recommend it to others; - it does not give enough priority to the comfort of it's guests - it has not invested in maintaining the standard of it's rooms - it is trying to get away with minimal staff and hence the service of the hotel suffers.~1~nan~nan~1~nan~2~2~nan
review_471234309~“Great venue to stay right on Darling Harbour”~The office chair was a little uncomfortable if sitting on it for a few hours,( I had to do some paperwork) but plenty of cushions available to offset this, otherwise no complaints Comfy Queen bed, ability to make a drink, wifi and good ensuite. As I was at a conference offsite I didn't need meals so I am unable to comment on catering at the hotel.~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471198209~“great spot”~Hotel needs some urgent updates with new furniture , carpets etc, but overall a very nice hotel with easy walking distance to a great number of restaurants and bars, not to mention the restaurants in the hotel it self are excellent. If you are looking for a hotel that offers excellence with staff, restaurants then you have found the Novotel on darling harbour to be all that and more, we will be staying at this hotel when next in Sydney , not far from the CBD~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
