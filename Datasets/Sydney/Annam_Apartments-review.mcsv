review_471519023~“Brilliant and seamless stay”~Spacious, clean and very handy accommodation near all the amenities you could imagine. Within 100-200 m you have access to restaurants, cafes, supermarkets and pubs. Furniture was comfortable and the kitchenette was very practical indeed. That's it for me, I will no longer look up any other accommodation when I am in Sydney. This is the one for me!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468771005~“Three star property, clean and comfortable”~This is a 3 star property. Not luxurious or upmarket. Reasonably well equipped but nowhere near the class of a Meriton. Very clean and you get the impression they try very hard to please, so if the rate is good and you don't mind a basic room, then stay here. My major complaint is that the roller blinds aren't flush and street lights come into room. The property is on a reasonably busy road but I wore ear plugs and the noise didn't worry me as much as I feared.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_464149678~“Clean and friendly”~Stayed here on Monday 27 Feb - Wednesday 1 Mar 2017. The reception staff member was very pleasant and polite and check in was quick. Was impressed that he explained about keeping your room tag away from Mobile as it can cause problems. Was in Room 53 (top floor) and when entering apartment was certainly impressed with the cleanliness and overall design of the apartment.  The room had a nice clean bathroom with a washer/dryer combined. Few cracks in the corners of the wall. Shower was large though shower rose was a bit low. I am short so no problem. The kitchen was fully stocked and drawers/crockery etc were all clean. Bit of a crack in the induction cooktop area but would not stop people cooking.  King bed which was comfortable not too hard or soft and pillows were comfortable. Only difficulty is watching the tv in bed (need to the whole thing and it is slow to come on).  There is a small area which has a lounge chair, small table and chairs to eat from and built ins. Iron was clean and plenty of hanging space. Very small balcony no room to sit.  Careful when on the balcony at night as the apartments across can be seen clearly and obviously one tenant does not seem to worry about closing blinds when changing and it was obviously not cold in his apartment (LOL) Overall the apartment was conformable, had everything you need, air conditioning worked well and large fridge had plenty of space. Close to restaurants, station and the nightlife of the cross (well the nightlife still left). Coles just a short walk for all your grocery needs.  With any area, it is important to be aware of your safety at night and the cross is one of those areas. I had no problem returning to apartment at 2 in the morning but please always be aware of your own security. Well recommended.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_463364507~“Pretty good for the price”~This is not a bad option for reasonably priced accommodation. It is very conveniently located close to Kings Cross railway, supermarket and ithe shops. Staff are helpful. Offers a kitchenette which is workable, a washing machine. The road noise is pretty loud but nanageable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455942887~“Excellent!”~Had a fantastic stay for just short of a week whilst in Sydney. The apartment is fantastically located near to public transport and walking routes and provided a perfect base to explore this fantastic city. Accommodation-wise, the apartment was very spacious with a full size kitchen and comfortable lounge area. Staff were always friendly and helpful and I would not hesitate in recommending this accommodation to anyone wanting a comfortable and well located apartment.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455043662~“Great Customer services”~We haven't even visited yet and we are already impressed!  We are planning to visit Sydney in April for a friends wedding and after some hunting came across Annam as a possible based for 2 weeks. We had a number of questions including requesting information about a possible early book in and us going on a 4 night excursion and needing to store our bags for the wedding. We emailed the reservation team and had a very quick response from SAM who has been wonderfully helpful. They answered all our questions quickly and helped us with some other inquiries and requests We are now very much looking forward to our stay with the team in April and will send an update when we get back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455013683~“Great week long stay”~We stayed here whilst in Sydney as part of our tour of Australia. We enjoyed our stay very much. Having arrived in Kings Cross we were sceptical about staying here due to the location but it was perfect. The street was quiet but less than 2 minutes walk from the centre of Kings Cross.  Check in was helpful with the receptionist recommending local supermarkets, restaurants and getting the tube to get around. Would highly recommend staying here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451321403~“Wonderful large apartments”~These apartments were very central to train station, eateries and the hospitals. Had great views and very well set out rooms with a kitchen and a king size bed that was really comfortable. very friendly staff and a very reasonable price made this a very enjoyable experience. even had room for the car underneath at a very reasonable price. Would certainly recommend these apartments!! We did get a room with a large fridge but not all rooms have them so just need to ask as must better when staying a few days!~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_450856144~“Cockroaches galore”~Do you believe in hell? You just might after one night at Annam Apartments. The pictures of cockroaches, mold, and chipped paint in the room speak for themselves. The refrigerators are so noisy, you will think that NASA must have launched a rocket over the building. Stay at your own risk.~1~nan~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_439686534~“Nice location”~We stayed here over the NRL Grand final weekend... Its nice, but the level of detail is average, and the windows all need double glazing.... The road noise was loud. We usually stay at the vibe rushcutters which is only 300m away... ( But it was booked out )...~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_439057574~“Annan Lived Up to all expectations”~lovely rooms, well serviced and clean, well equipped, close to restaurants, shops, transport systems, but also walking distance from attractions. Friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend and even go back there.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_438427878~“4 night stay”~Fantastic welcome from staff. Very helpful and informative. Gave us a choice of three rooms. Nice location. Kings Cross in next street and offers great choice of restaurants. Love walking around this area at night - quite upmarket compared to years ago. Approx 20 min walk and you're right in the middle of the city. We have thoroughly enjoyed staying here and highly recommend. Our room was number 22 and we loved it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433396372~“Not the greatest!”~We were put up in here by our landlord as there were some Fire Safety checks happening in our apartment over 5 days.  Location: you cannot go wrong with the location - you re a walking distance away from wherever you need to be in the city. Service: the staff were great, no issues. Rooms were cleaned daily, although not sure our sheets were changed over the 4 nights we stayed here. Value: living in a prime location can be expensive so I am assuming you pay for it.  Rooms: I did sleep really well, although the room we stayed in was a bit randomly shaped and did not particularly inspire. The bathroom had a damp smell and the shower wasn't very powerful. I am sure this would have been fine if it was a holiday and not a layover whilst our apartment was out of action.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~5~nan
review_432044376~“Central to Kings Cross and transport to everywhere”~Fantastic little find.... staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Apartment was quiet and comfortable with a little balcony that looked out over the city. Supermarket close by approx 200 mts and the same for the train station. Entertainment is walking distance and a fantastic place to stay. Will stay there next time I'm in Sydney.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_424200714~“Great customer service, nice room but could be better ”~Spent one night here with my partner. We booked a studio and arrived hours before the designated check in time. On arrival our room wasn't ready so they were nice enough to be really accommodating and upgrade us to a 1 bedroom apartment! The room was quite comfortable however had a bit of an old mouldy smell to it which is a bit off putting. The room however was nice and clean. I would probably stay here again if I needed to stay in the area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421580938~“Good Value & Location”~1 bed room apartment was a good size with well set up kitchen. Combination washing machine and dryer was a great bonus. WiFi another bonus. Plenty of restaurants and cafes in area. 20 minute walk to city, 5 minutes to Kings Cross train station. Apartment was serviced daily regarding bed making and bathroom linen, cleaning average could be more consistent. Reception helpful. Overall a good location and value. Only down side was street noise at night but I guess that what you get living in a busy city centre ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_398260001~“A good price and a reasonable location.”~We had a stay of several days at the Annam Apartments and had two different rooms. Both were on the corner so there was a fair bit of traffic noise, but there are other rooms that may be quieter. The rooms were cleaned every day with new linen and consumables. The kitchen is adequate with a cooktop and microwave though if you want a full size fridge, not a bar fridge, then you may need to ask when you book. The place is near a supermarket for supplies, plenty of eating places and the train station. The centre of Sydney is a 15 minute walk away. All in all, I would recommend this place for a trip to Sydney for the place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393750709~“Great Value, great position”~We wanted accommodation in the Elizabeth Bay area and the apartments turned out to be ideal. Position was perfect for us just a couple of minutes from Kings Cross railway station, so great access to the whole of Sydney and only about 20 minutes to the airport. Plenty of shops, cafes restaurants with in 5 minutes walk. Don't miss the Kings Cross Bakery just around the corner in Bayswater Road, best Bread & Butter pudding I've had in years! The apartments are very roomy ours had a good sized bedroom with en-suite (+ Washing machine) & great shower although it did overflow a bit. Good kitchen with a large dining tale & a fairly comfy couch in the Sitting area. TV was fine. Unit was clean and great value for money. Will definitely be staying here again~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_389172061~“Can't fault it”~Stayed here for a few nights in July with my partner. The location of the apartments is just a short walk from Kings Cross station and near a Coles supermarket which is handy. We arrived early and they checked us in straight away which was helpful. The apartment was more than adequate with a kitchen, big fridge, bathroom, eating area, television and air conditioning. The room was clean and tidy despite showing some visible signs of wear and tear. Bed was comfy. Slightly noisy but we are used to that from our flat in the UK. The room also had a washing machine which was useful.  Would definitely return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381734010~“Comfortable in a good location”~This was a spacious 1 bed apartment with good sized kitchen and adjoining lounge and dining area. We were on the 5th floor and away from Kings Cross Road but still found it a bit noisy. The location is great being about 200m from Coles and the Kings Cross train station with plenty of nice bars and eateries within an easy walk. Oxford St is about a 10 min walk and Market St in the Centre about 20 min walk. Staff are friendly and helpful. The only problem we had is it was terrible weather for 24 hours of our stay (supposedly worst in 30 years) and our apartment leaked with water coming in around a window and seeping about 45cm across the carpet. However wasn't any great drama and staff provided us with a number of towels to try and soak it up.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_369780225~“Good location and easy access”~Value for money, the location was very convenient and very close to Coles. Train Station at walking distance. Staff is very friendly, cleaning was done on a daily basis which was pretty nice. The only down for me was no cable connection and no access to internet on television.~5~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_365925113~“Ups and downs”~I stayed here for work for one night. While it is very nice on the whole, there could definitely be improvements. The room was set out a little strange and you had to stand in the kitchen to watch the tv (i ended up moving it). There was a lot of road noise and you could clearly hear what people were saying as they walked passed, but if you are used to that it would be fine. Good location and close to lots of food options. The kitchenette was really good and the fact it had a washing machine was great. The biggest thing for me was that the sheets were not pristine. I could tell that someone at some stage in the life of the sheet had bled on it. They should really soak them or throw them out when that happens. It wasn't fresh by any means and was very faded but it was still there and that irked me. Unfortunately by the time I saw this reception was closed, so I couldn't tell them. I'm sure if they had known they would have fixed it, but i'm not sure how a cleaner could have missed it.  So overall a really nice, spacious apartment, just check the bed when you check in.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~4~nan
review_361874925~“Great spot easy to find”~5 nights on the 5th floor, we were quite happy. Yes there is traffic noise, but the room was clean, kitchenette fantastic, plenty of room. Bed was comfy and staff helpful. We would definately stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_350885423~“Clean but noisy rooms”~Hotel is in good location near kings cross station. Service was friendly and they helped us with moving around Sydney. There is many good restaurants and bars near the hotel and also Coles supermarket. The room was nice and large with fridge, washing machine, flat screen tv and dvd player. Toilet was clean and there was standing shower. Although the room was very nice we found out at night that it was very noisy. You can hear people talking in the street and every passing car woke me up. Luckily the hotel is in pretty quiet street so there is not many cars passing by at night.  Our experience was good and hotel has free wifi. The hotel is good value for money.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_318591088~“Did what I needed”~This hotel was chosen on price and location, I was based on a boat at CYC, it was a short walk away and much better value than the local hotel as it had the kitchenette, washer driver and a good spaced room. Yes the road and passerbys can be noisy but I am a deep sleeper and you cant be close to it all and have no noise on a budget. I would recommend this to those who want a good value apartment close to a great park and shopping and transport facilities.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_315961156~“Pictures don't match reality, nevertheless it was all OK”~We stayed for 3 nights at the Annam and liked our stay. Check-in was smooth and explained us a lot about the area and Sydney and gave us some good tipps to travel around Sydney.  The apartment was not really big, but OK for our stay. I am not sure, the pictures on the internet are lovely, but our apartment was not that nice decorated. In fact, there was only basic furniture in the apartment and no decoration at all. Also the furniture did not match each other, so random stuff were put into the apartment.  The apartment was clean, which is the most important part.  Wifi was available but did not work for the entire stay.  Apartments are located quite near to Kings Cross station, but I it's not in a very busy area.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~3~nan
review_306494019~“Great place in a great location”~The apartment has a plain interior but is very clean, and the staff are very friendly. I really enjoyed my time there. The apartment is a 2 minute walk to restaurants, shops, Darlinghurst Road and Kings Cross train station. The apartment is also only a 20 minute walk or so to the Sydney CBD, and a train ride away to Bondi Beach. The location of this apartment makes it a perfect place for those who wants to explore Kings Cross, the city centre (Harbour Bridge, Opera House, The Rocks, Circular Quay etc), and the beaches. The apartments on 2nd and 3rd floors that are facing east give you a great view of the Paddington, Woollahra and Double Bay area. It is a nice little apartment tucked away and yet close to everything.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_297831137~“Clean and comfy but very loud”~My apartment was clean and modern with a very comfy bed and lovely shower but it is let down by the incredibly poor soundproofing of the rooms. It is very loud and not for light sleepers- it feels as though I'm sleeping directly next to the road. I did appreciate the free-wifi.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_295147393~“DISMISSIVE AND CONDESCENDING MANAGER and LIED ABOUT TAXI FARE TO AIRPORT!”~I chose this apartment because of the reviews I saw here on tripadvisor. Most of what they say about the hotel is true, but let me start with the negative before the positive. I booked directly with the hotel and I got a 15% discount because we booked 6 nights a full month before our trip. When a relative told me about TRIVAGO, I also checked out Annam days before we got to Australia, there at that website, the discount was at more than 25% FOR MUCH LESS NUMBER OF NIGHTS FOR THE SAME DATES I BOOKED!!! Since Annam already charged us for the first night even as soon as I booked, I thought that maybe I should just print the offer at trivago so that the hotel can match that price when we got there. When we got there, the front desk personnel referred us to a tall lanky man who has a European accent, WHO WAS VERY DISMISSIVE AND CONDESCENDING! He said that he DID NOT KNOW ABOUT TRIVAGO, HE DID NOT CONSENT TO THAT PRICE AT TRIVAGO, AND IF THAT PRICE WAS SO GOOD WHY DID I NOT JUST BOOK WITH TRIVAGO!!!! I told him that because I already paid for our first night and I thought that he could at the very least match the price. He was very curt and condescending! the least he could have done was upgrade our accommodations! Fast forward to a day before we were to depart Australia. I approached the front desk to inquire about booking airport transfers, he said (once more the curt, condescending, dismissive guy was within earshot) that it costs $16 per person to the airport, but since there are 2 of us, it would be BETTER TO TAKE A TAXI WHICH WOULD COST ONLY $35. They gave us a number to call for a taxi 131451... LO AND BEHOLD, THE TAXI COST WAS $57!!! Oh one more thing, they really DO NOT CLEAN THE ROOMS. They merely make the bed, give you new supply of towels and take out the trash... OH they FORGOT TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH! And when I reminded them, that tall lanky curt condescending dismissive guy said that what am I complaining about, it is just 3pm, there is a lot of time to take out the trash,... from yesterday!!!! I loved my stay in Australia BUT my Annam Apartment interactions were REGRETTABLE!~2~nan~nan~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_293989635~“Great location, modern apartments, and the nicest staff!”~The staff were so helpful and very accommodating!

review_289353496~“short stay in Sydney”~Annam apartments are in a very good location - easy access to the city and eastern suburbs. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The apartment was clean and had all that you need. They have on site parking for an extra minimal cost which is very convenient. It is a bit noisy however you are in the thick on things so you should expect a bit of noise. Overall this is a great place to stay.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_281242218~“Modern, Clean, Economical, Close to Transport, Cafes, Restaurants, Supermarket”~Easy 8min walk from Kings Cross Train Station. Friendly and Helpful Staff. Lift access to room, Large Apartment Style Room. Nice Kitchen & Bathroom (Bonus washer/dryer), Comfy bed. Although in quiet leafy street, some traffic noise and a couple of bumps and scrapes in room; would only be a problem if your very particular. Was very comfortable and convenient for 3 day stay; as a mum & business women would definately recommend to others and would stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_278641722~“bargain price -great spot”~this is unbelievable value for Sydney,we travel to Sydney 4-5 times a year for work and have tried hotels,etc and we will definitely be coming back to this place. We stayed 4 days during a wet and cold Easter break. Having the extra room to move around was perfect whilst indoors, and a combined washer/dryer to get clean & dry saturated clothing was brilliant. The staff are really helpful and security is an obvious key point for the management. our apartment was clean,with newish appliances, well stocked with utensils for cooking. its very well placed for transport, but we often walked into CBD as its a leisurely 30 minutes. Supermarket close by and plenty of restaurants etc within a few blocks.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_275230976~“Recent stay at a great hotel”~My wife and I required a room at short notice and the very accommodating staff at this establishment bent over backwards to look after us. The apartments are in a great area and easy walking distance to everything you may need. The room was great, very large and well appointed everything was provided. Will certainly stay here again and would recommend it for sure....~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_274832251~“Great location and large room”~I stayed here last month with my boyfriend, while visiting Sydney. The location was great - two minutes walk from King's Cross station and about ten minutes walk from Hyde Park. The service was great - we were warmly welcomed and whenever we needed assistance, the staff were very tentative and friendly. The room was large with a small balcony. The prices were very reasonable, too - would definitely recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_271879596~“Convenient location”~Great location - close to trains and buses in Kings Cross but away from the noise and crowds of the main street. I really like this place as the staff are friendly but not pushy. Due to my early starts and late finishes, I don't always see the front desk staff as it is not manned 24 hours a day but there was no trouble with that arrangement. Kitchenette was well set up. I've stayed in both the one room apartment and studio apartment and was very happy with both.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_267459886~“It fitted our needs”~I was very sceptical on booking with Annam Apartments after reading TA reviews so my expectations were fairly low. I was in Kings Cross area for some surgery so the appeal of being close to the clinic with all the benefits of an apartment at a very very good price appealed.  The apartment is not well signposted, it's like they are hiding the fact they are a hotel lol so it was hard to find when driving in. The lovely gentleman waited outside in the rain after I called for directions to assist us in parking etc. Not once did we have any issues with service. We opted not to have housekeeping as I was in bed recovering most of the time so staff were always on hand to bring fresh towels and take our old ones without disturbing us. I had a final appointment on the day of check out and reception were kind enough to let us leave our car in the parking until we were ready to depart, even after we had checked out.  Others complained of noise, we were on the third floor and noise was minimal. Never heard any loud music. Could hear car noise but that's expected in the city and it wasn't loud. Only problem we had was a feral family in the room above us decided that it was best to throw all their child's used nappies onto the balcony's below them?! Reception were up to our room promptly and dealt with the issue professionally.  As for the rooms they are big. I was worried a studio apartment would be too small but it was very big and we certainly didn't feel we needed anything bigger. Kitchens are well equipped. You do your own dishes, I have never stayed in an apartment that doesn't ask you to wash your own dishes. Unfortunately the rooms felt dirty, walls and carpet were badly stained, bed mattress was too big for the bed base, shower hooks were broken, fittings were cheap and overall the room was just run down to the point where it felt dirty. Most of the time wifi worked well, I was able to make Skype calls and go about normal business. Location is perfect, kings cross station is a 2 minute walk and there are plenty of eateries to choose. Car Parking was $25 per night, pretty standard in Sydney City if you can even find a hotel with parking at all! Annam Apartments doesn't market itself to be 5* therefore their prices are very affordable. If you want to 5* then you will pay double elsewhere.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~5~nan
review_263037812~“if you depend on WiFi - don't book Annam Apartments”~I do love location, the appartments are great, spacieous and well equipped - but all that does not help if you depend on Internet. I am hugely disappointed since I always got kicked out on Skype calls, lost e-mail connections, and just could not communicate. I will never pay in advance again - without having tested the internet. I would not mind paying extra for internet, as long as it works!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_257561361~“Good location, but poor service”~They were just doing the bed and wipe down the toilet a little bit. No more than that. The floor was not vacuumed everyday as I would expect a service apartment do. Plus, there was no dishwasher (and that's fine) but nobody was washing the plates or anything. I have been to other hotels as this one and they were all doing this, so I was a bit disappointed. The area is fine, quite near the centre. The train station and a Coles supermarket are at 5 minutes walk distance too.~2~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_254206083~“Conveniently located, comfortable”~The location and the price are the reasons you'll book here. Close to Kings X station, bus just outside, just off Bayswater Rd, an easy 10-15 minute walk to St Vincents Hospital and Darlinghurst Rd/Oxford St. Close to restaurants, public transport and the CBD.  Rooms are comfortable, with fridge, oven, microwave, sink, washer/dryer all supplied. Enough room to feel like you are not in a shoebox. Wifi adequate and free.  Yes, there is road noise. I found it most noticeable between 6-9pm, you'll probably hear some revellers too. Take ear plugs if you need silence to sleep. I didn't find it a problem, but could certainly hear it. Until I fell asleep of course. I didn't find it a deal breaker but if you like a really quiet room you might.  I found it very convenient and very good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_250124923~“Very spacious rooms and excellent location”~I didn't know the guests were expected to check-in by 9.00 pm or before. But this is the same case in almost every hotel I stayed in Australia so if you are not from Australia, and if you are from India like me :-), where you can check-in any time after the check-in time, you are going to be very surprised (unpleasantly). Just be really careful about your check-in time. Inform them beforehand - they will let you in until 12.00AM for a fee. And if it's later than that, you are going to be stranded. You'd better book some other place if your flight lands after 10.30pm or so. My taxi ride from Airport to the hotel was very expensive. I had to pay $78. Which is twice than I expected. Take the train if you don't have too many luggages. The hotel is quite close to the railway station but it will be difficult to walk if you have 2 suitcases to carry, like I did.  The room is spacious and very clean. They have a functional kitchen with all the basic things like plates, cups, spoons, knives, pans, kitchen towels, stove etc., And Coles Super market is nearby. The only flip side is I spent too much time cooking and eating :-).The storage space is also very good. Actually, it's the best I'd seen during my entire Australian trip that lasted over a month. Many have complained about the noise level but I didn't find it a big problem. May be I'm used to noisy places :-). They don't service the room everyday. Only towels are being changed (if you want) and the bed is being made and toiletries refilled .But this is the norm in Australia. This room also has a very good bathroom. Not the usual cramped ones. And, there's a washing machine in the room. Everywhere else I stayed, I had to pay to use the washing machine/drier. The location is great. If I go to Sydney, I'd definitely stay here again just for the location. Very easy access to buses and train and you can walk to the CBD too if you are not afraid of walking a couple of kilometres. PS: They provide everything - like soap, shampoo, moisturiser, dish washing liquid, laundry detergent etc. You have to bring your own tooth brush and paste though.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan

Large bathroom which has a washing machine and we had the air conditioning on most of the time. The security entry is by card entry to lifts to all floors.

The property is on a reasonably busy road but I wore ear plugs and the noise didn't worry me as much as I feared.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_464149678~“Clean and friendly”~Stayed here on Monday 27 Feb - Wednesday 1 Mar 2017. The reception staff member was very pleasant and polite and check in was quick. Was impressed that he explained about keeping your room tag away from Mobile as it can cause problems. Was in Room 53 (top floor) and when entering apartment was certainly impressed with the cleanliness and overall design of the apartment.  The room had a nice clean bathroom with a washer/dryer combined. Few cracks in the corners of the wall. Shower was large though shower rose was a bit low. I am short so no problem. The kitchen was fully stocked and drawers/crockery etc were all clean. Bit of a crack in the induction cooktop area but would not stop people cooking.  King bed which was comfortable not too hard or soft and pillows were comfortable. Only difficulty is watching the tv in bed (need to the whole thing and it is slow to come on).  There is a small area which has a lounge chair, small table and chairs to eat from and built ins. Iron was clean and plenty of hanging space. Very small balcony no room to sit.  Careful when on the balcony at night as the apartments across can be seen clearly and obviously one tenant does not seem to worry about closing blinds when changing and it was obviously not cold in his apartment (LOL) Overall the apartment was conformable, had everything you need, air conditioning worked well and large fridge had plenty of space. Close to restaurants, station and the nightlife of the cross (well the nightlife still left). Coles just a short walk for all your grocery needs.  With any area, it is important to be aware of your safety at night and the cross is one of those areas. I had no problem returning to apartment at 2 in the morning but please always be aware of your own security. Well recommended.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_463364507~“Pretty good for the price”~This is not a bad option for reasonably priced accommodation. It is very conveniently located close to Kings Cross railway, supermarket and ithe shops. Staff are helpful. Offers a kitchenette which is workable, a washing machine. The road noise is pretty loud but nanageable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455942887~“Excellent!”~Had a fantastic stay for just short of a week whilst in Sydney. The apartment is fantastically located near to public transport and walking routes and provided a perfect base to explore this fantastic city. Accommodation-wise, the apartment was very spacious with a full size kitchen and comfortable lounge area. Staff were always friendly and helpful and I would not hesitate in recommending this accommodation to anyone wanting a comfortable and well located apartment.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455043662~“Great Customer services”~We haven't even visited yet and we are already impressed!  We are planning to visit Sydney in April for a friends wedding and after some hunting came across Annam as a possible based for 2 weeks. We had a number of questions including requesting information about a possible early book in and us going on a 4 night excursion and needing to store our bags for the wedding. We emailed the reservation team and had a very quick response from SAM who has been wonderfully helpful. They answered all our questions quickly and helped us with some other inquiries and requests We are now very much looking forward to our stay with the team in April and will send an update when we get back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455013683~“Great week long stay”~We stayed here whilst in Sydney as part of our tour of Australia. We enjoyed our stay very much. Having arrived in Kings Cross we were sceptical about staying here due to the location but it was perfect. The street was quiet but less than 2 minutes walk from the centre of Kings Cross.  Check in was helpful with the receptionist recommending local supermarkets, restaurants and getting the tube to get around. Would highly recommend staying here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451321403~“Wonderful large apartments”~These apartments were very central to train station, eateries and the hospitals. Had great views and very well set out rooms with a kitchen and a king size bed that was really comfortable. very friendly staff and a very reasonable price made this a very enjoyable experience. even had room for the car underneath at a very reasonable price. Would certainly recommend these apartments!! We did get a room with a large fridge but not all rooms have them so just need to ask as must better when staying a few days!~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_450856144~“Cockroaches galore”~Do you believe in hell? You just might after one night at Annam Apartments. The pictures of cockroaches, mold, and chipped paint in the room speak for themselves. The refrigerators are so noisy, you will think that NASA must have launched a rocket over the building. Stay at your own risk.~1~nan~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_439686534~“Nice location”~We stayed here over the NRL Grand final weekend... Its nice, but the level of detail is average, and the windows all need double glazing.... The road noise was loud. We usually stay at the vibe rushcutters which is only 300m away... ( But it was booked out )...~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_439057574~“Annan Lived Up to all expectations”~lovely rooms, well serviced and clean, well equipped, close to restaurants, shops, transport systems, but also walking distance from attractions. Friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend and even go back there.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_438427878~“4 night stay”~Fantastic welcome from staff. Very helpful and informative. Gave us a choice of three rooms. Nice location. Kings Cross in next street and offers great choice of restaurants. Love walking around this area at night - quite upmarket compared to years ago. Approx 20 min walk and you're right in the middle of the city. We have thoroughly enjoyed staying here and highly recommend. Our room was number 22 and we loved it.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433396372~“Not the greatest!”~We were put up in here by our landlord as there were some Fire Safety checks happening in our apartment over 5 days.  Location: you cannot go wrong with the location - you re a walking distance away from wherever you need to be in the city. Service: the staff were great, no issues. Rooms were cleaned daily, although not sure our sheets were changed over the 4 nights we stayed here. Value: living in a prime location can be expensive so I am assuming you pay for it.  Rooms: I did sleep really well, although the room we stayed in was a bit randomly shaped and did not particularly inspire. The bathroom had a damp smell and the shower wasn't very powerful. I am sure this would have been fine if it was a holiday and not a layover whilst our apartment was out of action.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~5~nan
review_432044376~“Central to Kings Cross and transport to everywhere”~Fantastic little find.... staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Apartment was quiet and comfortable with a little balcony that looked out over the city. Supermarket close by approx 200 mts and the same for the train station. Entertainment is walking distance and a fantastic place to stay. Will stay there next time I'm in Sydney.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_424200714~“Great customer service, nice room but could be better ”~Spent one night here with my partner. We booked a studio and arrived hours before the designated check in time. On arrival our room wasn't ready so they were nice enough to be really accommodating and upgrade us to a 1 bedroom apartment! The room was quite comfortable however had a bit of an old mouldy smell to it which is a bit off putting. The room however was nice and clean. I would probably stay here again if I needed to stay in the area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421580938~“Good Value & Location”~1 bed room apartment was a good size with well set up kitchen. Combination washing machine and dryer was a great bonus. WiFi another bonus. Plenty of restaurants and cafes in area. 20 minute walk to city, 5 minutes to Kings Cross train station. Apartment was serviced daily regarding bed making and bathroom linen, cleaning average could be more consistent. Reception helpful. Overall a good location and value. Only down side was street noise at night but I guess that what you get living in a busy city centre ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_398260001~“A good price and a reasonable location.”~We had a stay of several days at the Annam Apartments and had two different rooms. Both were on the corner so there was a fair bit of traffic noise, but there are other rooms that may be quieter. The rooms were cleaned every day with new linen and consumables. The kitchen is adequate with a cooktop and microwave though if you want a full size fridge, not a bar fridge, then you may need to ask when you book. The place is near a supermarket for supplies, plenty of eating places and the train station. The centre of Sydney is a 15 minute walk away. All in all, I would recommend this place for a trip to Sydney for the place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393750709~“Great Value, great position”~We wanted accommodation in the Elizabeth Bay area and the apartments turned out to be ideal. Position was perfect for us just a couple of minutes from Kings Cross railway station, so great access to the whole of Sydney and only about 20 minutes to the airport. Plenty of shops, cafes restaurants with in 5 minutes walk. Don't miss the Kings Cross Bakery just around the corner in Bayswater Road, best Bread & Butter pudding I've had in years! The apartments are very roomy ours had a good sized bedroom with en-suite (+ Washing machine) & great shower although it did overflow a bit. Good kitchen with a large dining tale & a fairly comfy couch in the Sitting area. TV was fine. Unit was clean and great value for money. Will definitely be staying here again~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_389172061~“Can't fault it”~Stayed here for a few nights in July with my partner. The location of the apartments is just a short walk from Kings Cross station and near a Coles supermarket which is handy. We arrived early and they checked us in straight away which was helpful. The apartment was more than adequate with a kitchen, big fridge, bathroom, eating area, television and air conditioning. The room was clean and tidy despite showing some visible signs of wear and tear. Bed was comfy. Slightly noisy but we are used to that from our flat in the UK. The room also had a washing machine which was useful.  Would definitely return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381734010~“Comfortable in a good location”~This was a spacious 1 bed apartment with good sized kitchen and adjoining lounge and dining area. We were on the 5th floor and away from Kings Cross Road but still found it a bit noisy. The location is great being about 200m from Coles and the Kings Cross train station with plenty of nice bars and eateries within an easy walk. Oxford St is about a 10 min walk and Market St in the Centre about 20 min walk. Staff are friendly and helpful. The only problem we had is it was terrible weather for 24 hours of our stay (supposedly worst in 30 years) and our apartment leaked with water coming in around a window and seeping about 45cm across the carpet. However wasn't any great drama and staff provided us with a number of towels to try and soak it up.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_369780225~“Good location and easy access”~Value for money, the location was very convenient and very close to Coles. Train Station at walking distance. Staff is very friendly, cleaning was done on a daily basis which was pretty nice. The only down for me was no cable connection and no access to internet on television.~5~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_365925113~“Ups and downs”~I stayed here for work for one night. While it is very nice on the whole, there could definitely be improvements. The room was set out a little strange and you had to stand in the kitchen to watch the tv (i ended up moving it). There was a lot of road noise and you could clearly hear what people were saying as they walked passed, but if you are used to that it would be fine. Good location and close to lots of food options. The kitchenette was really good and the fact it had a washing machine was great. The biggest thing for me was that the sheets were not pristine. I could tell that someone at some stage in the life of the sheet had bled on it. They should really soak them or throw them out when that happens. It wasn't fresh by any means and was very faded but it was still there and that irked me. Unfortunately by the time I saw this reception was closed, so I couldn't tell them. I'm sure if they had known they would have fixed it, but i'm not sure how a cleaner could have missed it.  So overall a really nice, spacious apartment, just check the bed when you check in.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~2~4~nan
review_361874925~“Great spot easy to find”~5 nights on the 5th floor, we were quite happy. Yes there is traffic noise, but the room was clean, kitchenette fantastic, plenty of room. Bed was comfy and staff helpful. We would definately stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_361396824~“Great location and helpful staff”~We stayed for five nights in the king suite. The apartment was very roomy and the staff were always happy to help with questions, requests, etc. The location was fabulous - plenty of cafes, restaurants, and a train station right at your doorstep. The apartment itself was a little dated and tired, and the shower could have done with a thorough cleaning, so given that it was probably a little pricey for what it was worth. But overall, we were happy with our stay and would go back again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_350885423~“Clean but noisy rooms”~Hotel is in good location near kings cross station. Service was friendly and they helped us with moving around Sydney. There is many good restaurants and bars near the hotel and also Coles supermarket. The room was nice and large with fridge, washing machine, flat screen tv and dvd player. Toilet was clean and there was standing shower. Although the room was very nice we found out at night that it was very noisy. You can hear people talking in the street and every passing car woke me up. Luckily the hotel is in pretty quiet street so there is not many cars passing by at night.  Our experience was good and hotel has free wifi. The hotel is good value for money.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_344135715~“great spot- amazing alue”~I have stayed here for business and holidays,, really good spot for transport, Coles is just round the corner, lost of pubs,cafe & restaurants within 10 minute walk the apartments are spacious and very clean, parking is available for only$20pn , cheap for Sydney the manager & staff are fantastic, cheerful & helpful, I still cant believe the value, cheaper than hotel room but with own clothes washer/dryer & cooking facilities, even a balcony to enjoy breakfast !!!!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_335592756~“Above expectations...”~If you want that authentic 'Sydney-Lifestyle', this is where you need to stay!! We live in the outer suburbs of Sydney, and stayed at the Annam Apartments for a little getaway over the Chistmas long weekend. As our weekend progressed, I enjoyed my stay more and more. We were greeted by the lovely staff, who were ever so helpful. They showed us the way to the buildings car park. $25.00 per night (this is the average for overnight parking in Sydney, in some cases it would be considered on the fair side of expensive). Please check the Annam website for parking inforamtion, as it is Potts Point, there are sizing limitations depending on your car. It's a very small block of apartments, right on a busy intersection which heads towards the CBD or the Coast, depending on your desired direction. At night, the road traffic can be distracting and heard clearly from inside the rooms. But, that's Sydney. Due to some extra availability, and my booking a few months in advanced. We were offered an upgrade on our room, to a 1 Bed Room Apartment. We happily accepted. My partner was particularly impressed with the kitchen, and commented on the size of the refrigerator. Most other places have a small mini bar which doesn't hold a lot of food or drink. Also available in the kitchen - electric stove top and oven, cuttlery, plates, bowles, glasses, wine glasses, tea cups, kettle, dishwasher and sink. Carpeted area is fitted with an air conditioning unit, dining table, tv, coffee table and 2 seater lounge. With a window view of side streets.  I also admired the artwork, there were a few lovely pieces throughout the room.  The queen bed, was very comfortable, with ample closet space. The bathroom was also on the large side, as it included a shower, toilet, basin and washing machine/dryer. Free WiFi available, but it wasn't very reliable. It was easier to use out own data. But for international guests. I believe it would be perfectly fine. During our stay we managed to do quite a lot from our location. We drove out to Bondi Beach for lunch which is approx. 15 minute drive. You can also catch a train from Kings Cross to Bondi Junction. Then take a local bus to Bondi Beach, or walk the distance 3.0kms/40min walk. There are also direct buses to Bondi Beach from local bus stops along Oxford Street (approx. 15min walk from the Annam). We enjoy our walking, and took a stroll around Potts Point. We went to the local Woolworths for snack essentials, and vistied a few specialty stores along the way. We admired the well known El Alamein Fountain which leads to the Fitzroy Gardens. There are a lot of local places to eat, at all hours of the day. It's also a great location for visiting the Sydney CBD and Sydney Harbour. If you enjoy walking it's about 2.0kms to Sydney's Town Hall - keep going 'West' and you will reach the bustling Darling Harbour. A little bit south and you will and you will find yourself in Sydney's China Town.  If you have a few hours to spare, I would recommend walking from the Annam Apartments - to the Sydney Opera House, with a detour through Hyde Park and the Royal Botanical Gardens. You end up so close to the action of Circular Quay, you won't believe you got there so quick, for us this was about 4.0km walking. For those of you who consider yourselves foodies, visit the top end restaurants of Sydney, with their amazing water views at the famous 'Woolloomooloo Wharf' it's even closer to you, than the Sydney CBD!!  Fantastic Apartments, Amazing Location - for that Authentic Sydney Experience. This is where you want to stay for a short time or a long time.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_331732085~“served my purpose”~Just off the kings cross road, yet very calm and quiet , Stayed there for a week . Generally served my purpose .

review_328319227~“Close to everything but away from the main road”~Close to everything. Only 10 mins away from king cross train station, the city and many food places and a coles. Building was not flashy and didn't stand out (which was great) and was off a main road (also great). Desk person was friendly and very helpful. I was shown on a paper map where the station was and the coles and a nice cafe I did not get to try. Very forthcoming and accomodating. Unit was clean. Unit was fairly large as far as units go. Bed was comfortable. Windows were barred. I had a kitchen with adequite tools for a basic cooking experience. Sitting area with small lounge and a balcony with lockable door. Could pull down blinds to shut out light or poeple seeing you. Had a tv and a dvd/tape player. Had a radio (didn't have iphone port). Aircon worked well. Large washing machine. Shower. Really my only complaint was that the bathroom window was left open prior to me getting the room (but seriously if thats your only complaint, its all going well!). Surounding area is nice. Pretty upscale for the city.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_318664277~“So Close To All The Action”~Not the best apartments I have ever stayed in but in a great location just off Kings Cross Road & within walking distance to the City surrounded by lots of restaurants giving you plenty of options to eat.

review_318591088~“Did what I needed”~This hotel was chosen on price and location, I was based on a boat at CYC, it was a short walk away and much better value than the local hotel as it had the kitchenette, washer driver and a good spaced room. Yes the road and passerbys can be noisy but I am a deep sleeper and you cant be close to it all and have no noise on a budget. I would recommend this to those who want a good value apartment close to a great park and shopping and transport facilities.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_315961156~“Pictures don't match reality, nevertheless it was all OK”~We stayed for 3 nights at the Annam and liked our stay. Check-in was smooth and explained us a lot about the area and Sydney and gave us some good tipps to travel around Sydney.  The apartment was not really big, but OK for our stay. I am not sure, the pictures on the internet are lovely, but our apartment was not that nice decorated. In fact, there was only basic furniture in the apartment and no decoration at all. Also the furniture did not match each other, so random stuff were put into the apartment.  The apartment was clean, which is the most important part.  Wifi was available but did not work for the entire stay.  Apartments are located quite near to Kings Cross station, but I it's not in a very busy area.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~3~nan
review_306494019~“Great place in a great location”~The apartment has a plain interior but is very clean, and the staff are very friendly. I really enjoyed my time there. The apartment is a 2 minute walk to restaurants, shops, Darlinghurst Road and Kings Cross train station. The apartment is also only a 20 minute walk or so to the Sydney CBD, and a train ride away to Bondi Beach. The location of this apartment makes it a perfect place for those who wants to explore Kings Cross, the city centre (Harbour Bridge, Opera House, The Rocks, Circular Quay etc), and the beaches. The apartments on 2nd and 3rd floors that are facing east give you a great view of the Paddington, Woollahra and Double Bay area. It is a nice little apartment tucked away and yet close to everything.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_297831137~“Clean and comfy but very loud”~My apartment was clean and modern with a very comfy bed and lovely shower but it is let down by the incredibly poor soundproofing of the rooms. It is very loud and not for light sleepers- it feels as though I'm sleeping directly next to the road. I did appreciate the free-wifi.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_295147393~“DISMISSIVE AND CONDESCENDING MANAGER and LIED ABOUT TAXI FARE TO AIRPORT!”~I chose this apartment because of the reviews I saw here on tripadvisor. Most of what they say about the hotel is true, but let me start with the negative before the positive. I booked directly with the hotel and I got a 15% discount because we booked 6 nights a full month before our trip. When a relative told me about TRIVAGO, I also checked out Annam days before we got to Australia, there at that website, the discount was at more than 25% FOR MUCH LESS NUMBER OF NIGHTS FOR THE SAME DATES I BOOKED!!! Since Annam already charged us for the first night even as soon as I booked, I thought that maybe I should just print the offer at trivago so that the hotel can match that price when we got there. When we got there, the front desk personnel referred us to a tall lanky man who has a European accent, WHO WAS VERY DISMISSIVE AND CONDESCENDING! He said that he DID NOT KNOW ABOUT TRIVAGO, HE DID NOT CONSENT TO THAT PRICE AT TRIVAGO, AND IF THAT PRICE WAS SO GOOD WHY DID I NOT JUST BOOK WITH TRIVAGO!!!! I told him that because I already paid for our first night and I thought that he could at the very least match the price. He was very curt and condescending! the least he could have done was upgrade our accommodations! Fast forward to a day before we were to depart Australia. I approached the front desk to inquire about booking airport transfers, he said (once more the curt, condescending, dismissive guy was within earshot) that it costs $16 per person to the airport, but since there are 2 of us, it would be BETTER TO TAKE A TAXI WHICH WOULD COST ONLY $35. They gave us a number to call for a taxi 131451... LO AND BEHOLD, THE TAXI COST WAS $57!!! Oh one more thing, they really DO NOT CLEAN THE ROOMS. They merely make the bed, give you new supply of towels and take out the trash... OH they FORGOT TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH! And when I reminded them, that tall lanky curt condescending dismissive guy said that what am I complaining about, it is just 3pm, there is a lot of time to take out the trash,... from yesterday!!!! I loved my stay in Australia BUT my Annam Apartment interactions were REGRETTABLE!~2~nan~nan~nan~1~1~1~nan

The apartment was clean and had all that you need. They have on site parking for an extra minimal cost which is very convenient. It is a bit noisy however you are in the thick on things so you should expect a bit of noise. Overall this is a great place to stay.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan

Lift access to room, Large Apartment Style Room. Nice Kitchen & Bathroom (Bonus washer/dryer), Comfy bed. Although in quiet leafy street, some traffic noise and a couple of bumps and scrapes in room; would only be a problem if your very particular.

review_278641722~“bargain price -great spot”~this is unbelievable value for Sydney,we travel to Sydney 4-5 times a year for work and have tried hotels,etc and we will definitely be coming back to this place. We stayed 4 days during a wet and cold Easter break. Having the extra room to move around was perfect whilst indoors, and a combined washer/dryer to get clean & dry saturated clothing was brilliant. The staff are really helpful and security is an obvious key point for the management. our apartment was clean,with newish appliances, well stocked with utensils for cooking. its very well placed for transport, but we often walked into CBD as its a leisurely 30 minutes. Supermarket close by and plenty of restaurants etc within a few blocks.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_274832251~“Great location and large room”~I stayed here last month with my boyfriend, while visiting Sydney. The location was great - two minutes walk from King's Cross station and about ten minutes walk from Hyde Park. The service was great - we were warmly welcomed and whenever we needed assistance, the staff were very tentative and friendly. The room was large with a small balcony. The prices were very reasonable, too - would definitely recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_271879596~“Convenient location”~Great location - close to trains and buses in Kings Cross but away from the noise and crowds of the main street. I really like this place as the staff are friendly but not pushy. Due to my early starts and late finishes, I don't always see the front desk staff as it is not manned 24 hours a day but there was no trouble with that arrangement. Kitchenette was well set up. I've stayed in both the one room apartment and studio apartment and was very happy with both.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_267459886~“It fitted our needs”~I was very sceptical on booking with Annam Apartments after reading TA reviews so my expectations were fairly low. I was in Kings Cross area for some surgery so the appeal of being close to the clinic with all the benefits of an apartment at a very very good price appealed.  The apartment is not well signposted, it's like they are hiding the fact they are a hotel lol so it was hard to find when driving in. The lovely gentleman waited outside in the rain after I called for directions to assist us in parking etc. Not once did we have any issues with service. We opted not to have housekeeping as I was in bed recovering most of the time so staff were always on hand to bring fresh towels and take our old ones without disturbing us. I had a final appointment on the day of check out and reception were kind enough to let us leave our car in the parking until we were ready to depart, even after we had checked out.  Others complained of noise, we were on the third floor and noise was minimal. Never heard any loud music. Could hear car noise but that's expected in the city and it wasn't loud. Only problem we had was a feral family in the room above us decided that it was best to throw all their child's used nappies onto the balcony's below them?! Reception were up to our room promptly and dealt with the issue professionally.  As for the rooms they are big. I was worried a studio apartment would be too small but it was very big and we certainly didn't feel we needed anything bigger. Kitchens are well equipped. You do your own dishes, I have never stayed in an apartment that doesn't ask you to wash your own dishes. Unfortunately the rooms felt dirty, walls and carpet were badly stained, bed mattress was too big for the bed base, shower hooks were broken, fittings were cheap and overall the room was just run down to the point where it felt dirty. Most of the time wifi worked well, I was able to make Skype calls and go about normal business. Location is perfect, kings cross station is a 2 minute walk and there are plenty of eateries to choose. Car Parking was $25 per night, pretty standard in Sydney City if you can even find a hotel with parking at all! Annam Apartments doesn't market itself to be 5* therefore their prices are very affordable. If you want to 5* then you will pay double elsewhere.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~5~nan
review_263037812~“if you depend on WiFi - don't book Annam Apartments”~I do love location, the appartments are great, spacieous and well equipped - but all that does not help if you depend on Internet. I am hugely disappointed since I always got kicked out on Skype calls, lost e-mail connections, and just could not communicate. I will never pay in advance again - without having tested the internet. I would not mind paying extra for internet, as long as it works!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_257561361~“Good location, but poor service”~They were just doing the bed and wipe down the toilet a little bit. No more than that. The floor was not vacuumed everyday as I would expect a service apartment do. Plus, there was no dishwasher (and that's fine) but nobody was washing the plates or anything. I have been to other hotels as this one and they were all doing this, so I was a bit disappointed. The area is fine, quite near the centre. The train station and a Coles supermarket are at 5 minutes walk distance too.~2~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_254206083~“Conveniently located, comfortable”~The location and the price are the reasons you'll book here. Close to Kings X station, bus just outside, just off Bayswater Rd, an easy 10-15 minute walk to St Vincents Hospital and Darlinghurst Rd/Oxford St. Close to restaurants, public transport and the CBD.  Rooms are comfortable, with fridge, oven, microwave, sink, washer/dryer all supplied. Enough room to feel like you are not in a shoebox. Wifi adequate and free.  Yes, there is road noise. I found it most noticeable between 6-9pm, you'll probably hear some revellers too. Take ear plugs if you need silence to sleep. I didn't find it a problem, but could certainly hear it. Until I fell asleep of course. I didn't find it a deal breaker but if you like a really quiet room you might.  I found it very convenient and very good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_250124923~“Very spacious rooms and excellent location”~I didn't know the guests were expected to check-in by 9.00 pm or before. But this is the same case in almost every hotel I stayed in Australia so if you are not from Australia, and if you are from India like me :-), where you can check-in any time after the check-in time, you are going to be very surprised (unpleasantly). Just be really careful about your check-in time. Inform them beforehand - they will let you in until 12.00AM for a fee. And if it's later than that, you are going to be stranded. You'd better book some other place if your flight lands after 10.30pm or so. My taxi ride from Airport to the hotel was very expensive. I had to pay $78. Which is twice than I expected. Take the train if you don't have too many luggages. The hotel is quite close to the railway station but it will be difficult to walk if you have 2 suitcases to carry, like I did.  The room is spacious and very clean. They have a functional kitchen with all the basic things like plates, cups, spoons, knives, pans, kitchen towels, stove etc., And Coles Super market is nearby. The only flip side is I spent too much time cooking and eating :-).The storage space is also very good. Actually, it's the best I'd seen during my entire Australian trip that lasted over a month. Many have complained about the noise level but I didn't find it a big problem. May be I'm used to noisy places :-). They don't service the room everyday. Only towels are being changed (if you want) and the bed is being made and toiletries refilled .But this is the norm in Australia. This room also has a very good bathroom. Not the usual cramped ones. And, there's a washing machine in the room. Everywhere else I stayed, I had to pay to use the washing machine/drier. The location is great. If I go to Sydney, I'd definitely stay here again just for the location. Very easy access to buses and train and you can walk to the CBD too if you are not afraid of walking a couple of kilometres. PS: They provide everything - like soap, shampoo, moisturiser, dish washing liquid, laundry detergent etc. You have to bring your own tooth brush and paste though.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_249152053~“So good came back the following year”~Our one bedroom apartment had all we wanted, large bed, dining table for two, armchair style chair. The staff are friendly, attentive and helpful. The rooms are serviced and cleaned everyday to a good standard. Large bathroom which has a washing machine and we had the air conditioning on most of the time. The security entry is by card entry to lifts to all floors. The office opens 8 am to 9pm and staff friendly and advise and helped with our requests.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
