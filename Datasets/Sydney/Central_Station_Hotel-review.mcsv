review_478994175~“Neat but Small”~Neat and tidy rooms, much smaller than expected, pictures give the look of rooms being larger. Clean amenities and the breakfast was delicious. Was a very short 1 night stay but staff were lovely and organising it was a breeze~4~3~4~4~3~5~5~nan
review_478577117~“great stay”~Hotel was great location, central for most things and close to the station, clean and well decorated, all staff friendly and helpful, would definitely recommend to friends. would have liked more cupboard space but managed. quiet except for the road~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478397003~“Not worth the money you are spending for”~The Hotel is located excellent were you can reach the important sightseeing site's in a short distance also airport transfer is easy by train (main train satation about 300 meters away from the Hotel ) But the room was somewhere in the back of the building without view ( two metres away the wall from the next building ) To expensive for such a room, not worth to say~3~2~4~2~3~3~3~nan
review_478364489~“Comfy”~Great little stop over hotel on way to San Fransisco. Very clean, roomy and very central. Staff were accommodating and a lovely breakfast place next door. Thoroughly recommend. Also has a good looking asian place downstairs which we didnt get to try but smelt really good~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478145738~“Tiny rooms”~Styed here for three nights pre cruise and two nights post cruise holiday. The rooms are vary basic and far too small for anything but a single business traveller with little or no luggage. The bathroom had a good shower but only a very small wash basin with no storage or work surface to stand anything on. Bed was comfortable but took up most of the space in the room. Wardrobe was only big enough to take afew shirts, not long enough to hang anything longer.~2~2~3~3~2~4~4~nan
review_478103011~“Clean budget hotel”~Very small room, just space for a double bed. However bathroom nicely renovated and modern. Our room also had a balcony which was nice. Good hotel for a 2-3 night stay, but I wouldn't stay longer than about 4 nights. Reception modern and nice looking- helpful and friendly staff. Lots of cafes/restaurants in the area. Relatively good location- about 5-10 min walk from central station.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477852465~“Central Clean Compact”~Hotel is centrally located. Room is clean,with comfortable bed and size of room, though small,is sufficient. Could do with a safe and ironing board. Ground floor room hallway was noisey at times. Housekeeping was excellent.~4~4~4~3~4~5~4~nan
review_477612954~“Ok Just a bed to stay”~Was a good location but just a bed, very clean and the staff were good but a bit pricey, would recommend to friends and family but would also tell them to shop around as well. Was very handy to the heart of the city and central station.~3~3~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_477578376~“Dissapointed”~I booked this hotel three months before using it and the money was taken at the time of booking – a double room, costing over $150 p/n. I was very disappointed with the room, it must have been the worst room in the hotel.  When the description stated “1 Bed” it was not joking. If less money had been spent on the opulent shower and soft closing toilet lid and more spent on the necessities, ie. a small coffee table and 2 chairs instead of one stool and an unusable bench, a vanity unit instead of a tiny shelf and feminine hygiene disposal (of which there was none) I may be more disposed to write a reasonable review. I was on the second floor and rooms 211 onwards necessitated use of 5 stairs which had no usable handrail and the sensor light only came on when half way down the stairs - I use a cane so I needed the help of my husband to negotiate the stairs. The room smelled very musty when we first entered which leads me to believe that the room was not used very often, considering that the booking was made 3 months before (and they had my money in their bank) I would expect a better room. In fact if I had booked into a cheaper hotel this would have been the room I would have expected. The room was on the corner of the property and the traffic noise was very bad from early morning to late at night. Hotel Housekeepers were very good as were reception staff. ~3~1~2~2~2~4~4~nan
review_477568548~“Hotel Central Station”~This is a great hotel, staff are so obliging. I was on my own and unfortunately where I needed to go in the city, this was not a good location but I would highly recommend it if this is not a problem.~5~5~3~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477541246~“Awesome Staff!!!”~The staff is the greatest asset for this hotel. Val, Flor, Elaine, Joy and Jacky were extremely helpful in getting us an excursion to the Blue Mountains booked, giving us tips on places to visit in Sydney, things to do, etc. The room service personnel was also incredibly attentive to detail. Everyone was very polite, personable and a pleasure to talk to! Apparently, there are plans to renovate the hotel rooms, which are a little small once you have a king size bed in them, and definitely larger closet space and an in-room security safe would be great improvements. Can't beat the location: walking distance to all the highlights of the city, and to the Museum subway station. Again, the staff was amazing!~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477334217~“Sydney overnight”~Very pleased to have chosen to stay at the handy Central Station Hotel on way home to Alice Springs from trip to Fiji on Easter Sunday 2017. Old place with extensive renovations, but still nice ambience and handy to Darling Harbour, Central Railway Station and Chinatown. Most enjoyable and happy to recommend to others....thank you for the opportunity to place a review.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_477313639~“Well located although small”~Hotel is only about 300 metres away from Sydney Central Station and near to town centre as well (walking distance - about 1km).  Rooms - or the one we had - are quite small and could have done with a bit better planning (TV in front of wardrobe; fridge in wardrobe so hard to get to the milk!). Only single glazing as well so you could hear the street. Need to particularly advise the hotel if any requirements "out of the ordinary" like wanting twin beds or no steps between lift and room!~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_476970193~“service is good but room is poor”~the service is good and satisfied, however the room we stayed is so small and smelly especially the first day. there is a pungent smell from some detergents. the room condition Doesn't match with the photo.~2~2~5~4~2~4~5~nan
review_476931738~“Stay in Sydney at Central Station Hotel”~Very nice hotel at very good location with excellent connection to airport! At walking distance to tourist attractions like cathedral, botanical garden and city center. Good place to have breakfast next door. Get an Opal Card a few weeks before the trip to Sydney so you can use public transportation without any delay and you can use it for the ferries too. Sydney is worth a visit and stay at least five days!~4~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_476633322~“Friendly staff and good location”~A short walk from capitol theatre, chinatown and shops. Staff were friendly in assisting with our queries. Rooms were a little small though and there is minimal space for movement. However, since the hotel is cheaper, smaller rooms are expected. Overall a good experience at this hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476451253~“Small but adequate”~This place is lovely but at the same time You get what you pay for. The staff were lovely. But the Shoebox room is literally that. We couldn't get round one side of the bed to the desk unless we climbed the bed. Obviously a lot of travellers stay so it's understandable the walls Were badly scuffed from cases etc. we were staying for two nights in march before flying overseas. I knew what to expect as staying in Sydney; you get what you pay for. Of all the places I have been in the world Sydney has been the most expensive.  I cannot fault the staff at all as they booked us a shuttle with ease and were efficient. If I were myself again I'd be fine with the shoebox room But it just was not the right size as a couple.  Like many hotels in Sydney too you pay for a view. I have been lucky from time to time to get rooms with views but on this instance the small Window we had looked to a wall. Again I reiterate the room size would be fine for a single traveller staying for a night or two but not for Someone travelling or looking for leisure accommodation for more than a few nights. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476231308~“One night stop over before cruise”~We booked 2 triple rooms and they were polar opposites in size and quality. One was great, one was ridiculously small. Front office person was not the friendliest of chaps. Beds were comfy. Wouldn't stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475971252~“Convenient to Everwhere.”~It's near Central Station. You are easy to take tram to wherever you want. And it's also very near China Town. It means if you are Chinese, you are easy to get food. There are Chinese , Japanese, and Korean cuisines.~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_475946929~“Holidays”~Was a nice hotel to stay at, all that we needed. The walls and doors are very thin as you can hear everything around you. When other reviews said super small they were not wrong but that did not bother us as it had everything that we needed. The price and what we got was great and would recommend staying there and we would stay again.~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475545466~“Teeny”~Up graded to the king room with balcony and was so shocked. Room is beyond tiny! Picture in web site is very deceiving.  We felt so claustrophobic we had to sleep with curtains open which ran the length of the wall. Was really had to sleep due to lights but was the lesser of the problem.  We had talked about stay 2 nights in Sydney, thank god we did not.  Curtain leading out to balcony was filthy but the rest was clean and a decent bed.  Just not comfortable because so small.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475497218~“Overnight”~Very convenient to central station, very nice clean rooms, Easy walking distance, Staff very friendly,  Will stay again if we have to stay in Sydney the night Only 1 problem is the stairs after you get on level 1, made it a bit difficult with our suitcases.~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475397208~“Excellent place to stay.”~Central Station Hotel is wonderfully located in the heart of Sydney, close to everything.

review_475250670~“good location”~Stayed recently. Central location to main shopping, restaurants and tourist attractions. Staff very helpful. Room space a little compact. All amenities available, despite the limited space. Good for short duration if you only intended for sleeping.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_475147554~“No glasses!”~No wine or beer glasse provided or available when requested !! Rooms are clean it's a good bed but very small. Outside train and traffic noise is a significant problem. Desk staff friendly but seemed restricted in their ability to satisfy guest requests.~2~2~3~2~3~4~3~nan
review_474807328~“Not too bad”~If you were to arrive by car it can be difficult to find a park before checking in and getting access to the carpark across the road. The room was small but it did the job for a one night stay. Staff were helpful and well presented.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474787185~“Good little hotel”~Staff are friendly and helpful, reception is bright and clean. Rooms are on the small side but I knew that when I booked. You can't hear the road traffic either which is nice. It would be nice to have better towels and sheets, these were a little thin and worn. Overall good value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474498246~“Short stay hotel”~The staff are wonderful. The room was small but expected. There were stains on the bed runner and thick mould on the curtains. Other than That, it was great. Would stay there again on another short stay.~3~4~5~4~3~2~5~nan
review_474475409~“Great central located hotel”~Spent four days here from April 10 -14. Staff were very helpful and after booking in to a room with the view of the back of another building,I said to my wife, our first trip to Australia and we can't even see the area from our room. I decided to go see what they could do and 1/2 hour later we were in a room with a view. Great location to walk to many sites and shopping and we had a great time~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_474300236~“A warm welcome and a smile”~Central Station Hotel is a wonderful informal hotel with probably the most amazing and helpful staff. It was like a home from home. Look, the rooms maybe a bit small but they are for sleeping in after all. Highly recommended.~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_473880550~“Rooms too small - think I had the smallest King”~Was simply just an experiment to see whether it was worth being close to the Central Station but the noise of the trains with lack of soundproofing kept we awake. Excellent staff though and inviting reception/foyer area.~3~3~4~2~2~2~3~nan
review_473535933~“Tried hard”~Reception looked great, all the fittings in my room were new, and it was clean. Just a far too small concrete box with a hard bed, minimal wardrobe, no room for a chair to sit on, no room for a place to put your bag, no room to clean your teeth over the mini hand basin because the glass shelf was in the way. There was some type of monitor in the ceiling that flashed every three seconds!~2~2~4~2~2~5~5~nan
review_473447450~“Small but Central”~Very small rooms. The king bed is two sings put together. However, the location is excellent, within walking distance to majority of major attractions and delicious local cafés. Great service received by staff.~4~3~5~5~4~4~4~nan

review_473264481~“Handy Location”~Pushing a wheelchair, Central station handy for departures & Museum for arrivals as both approaches downhill. Able to get a more suitable room for our needs after one day but this should have been sorted out from the start. Staff eager to help. Clean site. Informed on checkout that fridge supplies were gratis because of direct booking. Too late to utilise this advantage. Needed toaster & microwave.~3~3~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_472692642~“Very disappointing ”~We were given a room so small I couldn't open my suitcase !! A double room that was hardly bigger than the double bed ..The saving grace was the bathroom which appeared to have been updated ..Too expensive for so little .. Location was very good ..You can walk into town ..Or take a train from the nearby station ...... Not a hotel I'd return to ..~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472211299~“Don't bother coming here!”~This was a glorified backpackers hotel,it had no amenities and was grubby,badly in need of decoration sand modernisation.Our room wasn't big enough to swing a cat! We had no storage space,the tiniest oof windows which was of frosted glass,therefore the room was dark.Not to be recommended.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_472013199~“Great location for a mid price hotel.”~I stayed here for 2 nights during the week. As I was not overly familiar with Sydney, I found this hotel to be a well run mid price range hotel. It is very close to Central Station ,and has a good eatery at the front door. The rooms were small, and this might be a consideration for a couple making a reservation.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_471526131~“Over priced and over rated”~We were very disappointed with our accommodation. Over the internet a true picture is not given of the room. We found the room small and smelly so we had a poor nights rest. Location is very handy to Central Station and that is the only positive comment I could make.~2~1~3~2~2~2~2~nan

review_470996435~“Beautiful Heritage. World class location”~An unbelievable building in an equally impressive location. Will be returning!

review_470976628~“2.5 stars to be exact...”~The GOOD stuff : Location - close to Central station, Chinatown, Paddy's Market, great shopping sites and eateries within walking distance. Front staff were fine with easy check-in and brollies on loan for the rain. Miniature ironing board and mini-fridge and bathroom amenities were OK. Kettle with coffee/tea provided. The NOT SO GOOD stuff - room size. Like a closet. Given that we were on a month long vacation, there was hardly any room for our luggage and us. The bathroom was petite and the shower even more so - enough just to do a 360 deg turn without hitting the glass. Given the cost per room per night (given the season), it was very underwhelming. We asked for a larger room and it would have cost $25 more per night - no way after what we had paid. No room safe. Hallways to rooms were narrow and only one elevator which made for extended wait times. We chose to stay here for the location but we would not choose to return; we were "aware" of the small sized room but were still surprised.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_470525360~“Very central”~The location was good and easy to get public transport . The beds were comfy enough but the room was a lot smaller than I had anticipated from the photos .

The Singapore Harry restaurant was tasty !~3~2~4~4~3~3~4~nan
review_470521802~“Adequate hotel for a short stay, particularly if you wish to be close to central station.”~For a short stay (2 nights) and those wishing to be close to central station this hotel is fine. However the room was noisy - more sound proofing may dampen the traffic noise. All staff on the check in desk were very friendly and efficient.~3~4~3~3~3~4~5~nan
review_470514017~“Central and comfortable”~We stayed here for four days and although it is not a budget hotel, it was quite affordable. The room was comfortable, clean and had good facilities like Fox tv, kettle, fridge and tea making facilities. When we booked, we opted for no housekeeping but still had beds made and new toiletries & towels every day. The location is a 10 minute stroll from Central railway station, convenience stores and food outlets are nearby. There is a coffee shop on the street side open breakfast and lunch, an Asian restaurant and a fine dining one in the hotel so no one needs to go hungry. Staff were pleasant, helpful and efficient and I would stay here again.~5~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470471984~“Short stay in city”~Room was very small but appeared clean and everything there needed. Unfortunately the window looked onto another building so could only see a brick wall! However one advantage of this was the room was very quiet. During the 4 days the washbasin and toilet was not cleaned and this was definitely a downside of our stay.~4~3~4~4~3~2~4~nan
review_470440664~“Good Location, and it stops there.”~We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to our Great Southern Rail Trip on board the Indian Pacific.

We will not stay here again.~3~2~4~2~2~3~3~nan
