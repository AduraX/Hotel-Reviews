review_455775697~“Brief stay”~We had a 1 night stay for a special occasion. The hotel is well located close to Town Hall station and is across the road from the Queen Victoria Building and one block away from Westfield Centrepoint. We had booked a basic Hilton guestroom and were upgraded to the next best room with a Hilton Deluxe, this being a slightly larger room with a separate shower. Bonus was this was on a slightly higher floor and towards the end of the corridor, with views looking out towards Sydney Harbour. The room was comfortable and quiet with an excellent bed. As a Diamond member, we had access to the Executive Lounge, which was well stocked, and an extensive breakfast buffet was included in Glass downstairs.  We did not receive a welcome letter and we had to request the complimentary water. I was told that this should be delivered to the room around 4 PM but as our room was not on an executive level it would appear that the room was missed. All staff we encountered were helpful and friendly and more than willing to help. We would happily stay here again..~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_478378526~“great location for downtown Sydney”~I have seen some reviews that stated the service was not great, but I had unbeatable service for the entire week I stayed at this hotel. Guest service, Concierge, bell staff, restaurant staff were all amazing and very outgoing. Certainly a high volume hotel and I can understand that staff may get tired, but it was great. Hotel room was super posh with really cool views.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_478145051~“The worst customer service ever”~I stayed at Hilton Sydney for 10days..3days we stayed at king relaxation suite and 7 days at executive room as my husband left australia already we didnt need big room. On the day i wanted to checked in again for executive room as i have checked out the relaxation suite, the customer service didnt let me check in since the room was under my husband room when he booked in.She was sooo rude to me with no smile and treated me as if iwas a con woman who tried to stay at hilton under someone room...she called her manager and once again the asian manager with no smile and rudely didnt believed me eventhough i showed her the proof of payment from my bank to hilton for $4600...she ended up called my husband who at that time on the plane luckily he bought wifi at the plane so he can be contacted...the asian manager rudely didnt even apologised and even threatened me to call security!!!!..i stayed at five star hotel bfore around the world but i never experience like this...they didnt even apologized to me and i paid $4600 to stay there for 7days Very dissapointed indeed~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478079920~“Good location, Aversge service, average rooms”~If you need or want to be staying in Sydney CBD then the Hilton is a good option in terms of location, but for me I felt the rooms were average and the service was of a similar level too. They forgot to make over our room on both nights of the 3 nights I stayed, and when I did call turn down service at 8.30pm to ask for it to be done when returning from an early dinner, they said it was too late, even though I called and asked for the room to be turn down at 6pm when leaving for dinner due to their forgetfulness Thile night before. I'm not sure what others 5 star hotels they are comparing late to but 8.30pm is not late and thought it was funny they thought it was late so i checked out and stayed at the Langham in Double Bay~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_477815365~“Convenient location though service is inconsistent”~The Hilton is very centrally located in the heart of the CBD within easy walking distance to Pitt Street Mall. If are in Sydney to shop, then the location is hard to beat. It is also very close to Town Hall railway station and major bus routes which makes getting around Sydney convenient.  My wife and I stayed at the Hilton to celebrate our anniversary. We had a enjoyable stay, due in large part to the professional yet friendly service provided by Moe in the Executive Lounge. No request was too difficult for Moe and she went out of her way to ensure that our stay was a special one – thank you. There are some areas in the hotel where there is scope for improvement. We went up to Zeta Bar for drinks in the evening but were told that the majority of the cocktail selections were not available as they were out of stock of a number of ingredients! We ended up having drinks in the Marble Bar downstairs which had a much nicer atmosphere. I was disappointed to note upon checkout that the Marble Bar added a tip to my bill without my consent. Being a Diamond member, breakfast is complimentary in either the lounge or the restaurant downstairs. As the restaurant was closed for renovations, breakfast was served in the state room on Level 2. The venue appeared to be short staffed – there was a wait to be seated and many of the food & drink stations went empty for prolonged periods of time.  The was a wide selection of canapes and drinks at the Club Lounge in the evening which meant that we did not have to go out for dinner. Overall, we enjoyed our stay but our experiences within the hotel were mixed.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_477605343~“Location Location Location”~If you want to be in the CBD this is a great location. Right across the street from the Queen Victoria Building with all of its shops and restaurants. One block to a train station. Two blocks from the huge Westfield Mall and the major department stores. A couple of blocks from the financial center and a short walk to Darling Harbor. Close to Chinatown. The hotel is obviously geared to business travelers. Three were several restaurants in the hotel, but unfortunately, we did not get a chance to eat in any of them. The room was on the small side but very nicely appointed. Modern decor, and a glass desk. My only complaint (and it is not such a bad complaint) - I would have rather had a nice comfortable chair instead of the desk. There really was no place to sit in the room except for the bed or the desk chair. Breakfast in the Executive Lounge was very good. The staff was extremely accommodating. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_477597561~“Loved the hotel and the service. ”~We had a great time at the Hilton in Sydney. Location is very good and service too.

The ambience was nice, the service was great and the food was perfect!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477571914~“We had a near perfect experience here”~I am a Hilton Honors member and we stay at Hilton properties in the US and Europe. This is one of the nicest, best-staffed and -managed hotels we've been. We stayed on a high floor and had lounge access, with complimentary breakfast there each day and the happy hour each evening, both of which are great values. Our sleeping room on the 38th floor offered a great city view, but was small. It was well furnished, with nice amenities and I loved the Magic button on the phone. It's simple. Push the button, tell the operator what you want, and it appears as if it is magic. The staff was unfailingly polite and professional, from the bell staff to reception, concierge, housekeeping and, especially, the lounge. We actually had two short stays separated by a four-day trip to New Zealand, and we were able to store the two large bags at the Hilton while away. Can't say enough nice things about it BUT, they blew it on the last night. I called in-room dining and ordered a cheeseburger and was told - I'm not making this up - that "this has been a popular choice this evening and we are OUT of cheeseburgers." OUT of cheeseburgers? OUT of beef patties and cheese? I was incredulous and shared that with the in room dining operator, the front desk and the Concierge desk as I walked past them on my way to the McDonald's on the corner, from which any hotel employee might have brought me a cheeseburger! Wouldn't you think? And who let the hotel run out of beef patties and cheese, anyway. Still, when we're in Sydney, we'll choose the Hilton.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_477620172~“Good location in Sydney”~Very clean hotel with modern amenities. Helpful staff attending to your needs. Location can't be beat. The Marble Bar is beautiful although the dance floor and DJ area looks like a temporary, inexpensive throw in. Walking distance within finance district and ability to reach the Opera House on foot. Would recommend this facility to anyone visiting Sydney.~4~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_477327670~“The Relaxation Suite delivers on its name”~The Suite itself is really nice, and the spa in the bathroom is a cherry on the top. Reception staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, and when I discovered that I had left something in the room, they were very quick and efficient in finding and returning it back to me. Conti breakfast at the Exec Lounge is a pleasant experience, although I expected a little more choice. Overall, happy and satisfied. Well done, Hilton!~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476961207~“Hilton Always Delivers”~We have been to Sydney before and stayed at the Four Seasons near Circular Quay. It turned out to be a "Two Season", so we opted not to return. We are Hilton Honors members, so booked an Executive Suite at the Hilton in Sydney. Hilton always delivers in many ways, and we are never disappointed. The Hotel is lovely, it is in a terrific location with tons of shopping, restaurants, and Darling Harbour is a hop, skip and jump away. It is immaculate, the Executive Club offers a wonderful breakfast with more than continental breakfast choices, and the Club in the evening has quite a bit of decent food selections that are tasty enough and diversified. The staff is top quality, and always friendly and accommodating. Cons: the Executive Room is very very small. We were on our way to a month vacation starting with a cruise out of Sydney up the Gold Coast ending in Singapore, and the off to Borneo for jungle trekking for two weeks; ergo, we had four suitcases. The room was so small we had to constantly maneuver around our things. There is an ergonomic desk, a king size bed, and a good size closet. Also there is a separate bath and a separate shower. Having stayed here a few nights, I realized that the planning of the room was poor. There is an end table next to the bed which is about 10 feet long by 20 inches wide, and runs the length of the wall, which is absolutely useless and takes up a lot of room. That needs to go, and the desk, which floats in the middle of the room, needs to be moved against the wall to garner more space. The TV is in the corner on a very large round media table, at the corner of the bed, which is difficult to maneuver around due the oversized media table. Easy fix would be to put a corner table in that space, allowing for much more room. Also, the bathroom is WAYYYY too small for both a separate bath and shower. There is only room for one person at a time in that bathroom, and no other vanity area in the room. There is a small tight sink area that has enough counter space for a couple of items, and that is it. Gut the shower, make it a Tub-bath combo, and enlarge the counter/sink. So whomever planned this room has poor spacial reference. The room is large enough; it was just designed poorly.  That being said, I would stay here again because I like the area, and I like the hotel. Hilton offers the most amazing sleep experience. I will just be better prepared for a tight space next time!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476142637~“Nice hotel but some reataurant staff were snooty!”~The hotel was nice, not terrific but adequate. We paid significantly to get the daily morning buffet for the duration of our stay.

review_475643978~“Long layover in Sydney - Relaxation Room”~The room was wonderful, and the staff very helpful. My flight arrived almost an hour early and I went to the hotel to see if the room was ready, being 7am it was not. They held my bags and I walked around the Royal Botanical Gardens and across the Harbour Bridge until about noon, then went to the executive lounge and ate a little lunch and relaxed until the lounge host brought me my rooms keys and told me the room was ready. Everyone was very helpful and kind. The room was incredibly comfortable, with the wonderful Hilton Pillow menu, and the bathtub was glorious. Will definitely stay again.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

Large selection of inroom bar fridge, stationary products and robes - everything 5 star. Definitely would stay here again!!~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474842637~“Great for business, maybe not for vacation!”~We arrived a day late here thanks to Qatar Airways and an over night in Doha making a 24 hour journey into 2 days - emailed the hotel to keep our room and had an almost instant reply giving us assurance we needed. So had high expectations of this property.  Had a great welcome to the hotel from the friendly door staff and concierge - they was always cheerful and talkative whenever we were at the entrance area.  As we arrived late we decided to try a drink at the marble bar and then retire. The bar is an impressive cavern under the hotel, however lacked any character. I suppose it would be better if you saw some live music (Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights) or directly after work finishes.  Room service was average but overpriced, your better off adventuring outside the hotel and getting a takeaway from the numerous outlets surrounding the hotel - as we arrived late and pretty tired we stuck to the safe option of room service.  Breakfast serves a great selection, staff are again very friendly. Don't attempt breakfast between 7:30 and 08:30 you'll find it far too busy and tripping over other guests.  Utilised the executive lounge on a few occasions and only once during evening canapés - the reason being is the hotel is a business hotel (period), coupled with the design of the lounge - lots of corners etc. It seemed a bit 'clicky' and as if I was invading the regulars territory.  The hotel is in a great location to get to all the sights of Sydney and the concierge is always on hand to help you out with arranging tickets, advice etc. But we felt a little uncomfortable being on vacation (and attired as such) with every other guest in business ware - doesn't help with the conference centre attached to the hotel either.  We also managed to create a security incident with my wife's pyjamas which got swept away with the bed linens - eventually returned after much chasing (clean I must add!),but zero apology or offer to reimburse us for the additional pjs we had to buy. We were made to feel more guilty for leaving an item of nightware on a bed (how strange an act we committed!).  I'm not sure if any other Sydney hotels have a better mix of business and leisure guests but this one certainly didn't feel that way! The rates were also exorbitant even booking in advance, hence I opted for a reward stay (point took a bashing on this one!).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474608950~“Sydney Hilton”~This was our second stay at this Hilton. It's located right in the heart of downtown Sydney and close to most everything. Great service by everyone at the hotel.

review_474384285~“Great location but with small room and disappointing indoor pool”~The hotel is in the moat convenient location out of all hotels in Sydney. We stayed there for four nights and have had no trouble visiting all Sydney key attractions without any problem.  The only problem we had was the size of the room. The room was uncomfortably tiny for a young family (two kids both under the age of 6). It certainly felt quite confined and cramped and it was a such a relieve to return to our home after spending four nights in the tiny space. We didn't have twin room / nor had an extra rollaway bed. We may not consider Hilton for our next family holiday but will still be the preferred option for business/non-family trip.  Another disappointment was the indoor pool. Frankly speaking, we have chosen Hilton over Swissotel for the indoor pool. However, the pool was certainly not at the typical Hilton hotel level so we ended up not enjoying it.. Only been there once and never re-visited.  Hope this review helps other family travellers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474382780~“good location, room and breakfast”~Last having come more than a decade ago, i was pleasantly welcomed at the "refurbished" Hilton. It is relatively brighter and rooms were "done up" enough to afford much better rest. I had comparatively refreshing sleep, having come in from touring the "bushlands". Its location at George Street also placed it within walking distance of park and harbor, whether at the rocks or in Darling. Having an indoor swimming pool was also convenient for early morning dips after gym. An irritation however, was having to pay for wifi, – seemingly a feature of many five star hotels. A shame. Because three star ones, offer free wifi. Last but not least, enjoyed the breakfast spread which was served with warm Australian hospitality and professionalism.  D Wee~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_474326557~“Slow service, slow lifts and very average breakfast for an International Hotel.”~Had to queue to check in as only one person at the desk. Then the gave me a room with single beds though their computer stated the opposite. Then at 11.00 PM their bar is closed which is incredible being Sydney and an international hotel chain finished off with a breakfast where both coffees were served cold and the bacon unedible [dry and chewy]. When checking out, it seemed only one lift was working for we stopped at 6 floors and being full people had to wait for the next lift which is a joke on a Monday morning when doing business.~2~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_474076901~“Visit to Lounge on level 36 (or is it 38) is best!”~Shared room with business colleague, in early April 2017, 4 nights, on 41st floor. Room a bit small for 2 but location is superb for business travellers. Closed to all amenities - Woolies, Coles, watering holes, 7-Elevens, kebab outlets, pharmacies, etc. And just 2 minutes walk to QVB (for those who like to shop!) Great breakfast buffet too.Best of all, lounge from 6-8pm is very worth going!   Drawback - prices are steep, as expected.  Would be good if hotel provided humidifiers as kept waking up middle of night for water as mouth, nose and throat were always very parched from dry air. Other than that, the stay was very much pleasant.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473932554~“Vacation”~Wonderful hotel but housekeeping missed the mark.

review_473989354~“Pass on the Sydney Hilton”~Overall, this hotel has declined over the years. Now the prices are high, the rooms are shabby and run down and they even charge extra for flat whites for breakfast. The value for the money just isn't there for the Sydney Hilton.~2~1~4~3~2~2~3~nan

This hotel is located in the Central Business district, in George street, few meters away from the pedestrian area in Pitt street, where you find a lot of nice shops , bars, and people just having fun. In April 2017, when I was there, there were some construction work on George street, which is closed to the traffic for cars; however, this did not affect at all our stay, and we were not bothered or had any problem for that. Breakfast was good, although a bit expensive (25 Australian dollars each person/day)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473484041~“World's Smallest Room (and Bathroom)”~When my United flight was cancelled, I needed a place to stay not 3.5 hours away from the airport. Sydney, being fully booked (and highly overrated) offered few options at the last minute. I found the Hilton (at a ridiculously high, surge pricing rate). The service at the hotel was actually great. The room, with a king-sized bed, is large enough to change your mind without going out into the hallway, but just barely. The bathroom was truly tiny. On a $ per square foot basis, probably the most expensive place I have ever stayed. I can not imagine two people staying in this room and using the bathroom. Hardly big enough for one.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473483781~“Small Rooms, Central Location, Typical Big City Business Hilton”~This hotel trips over itself by being too clever for its own good. As others have noted, it's a big, bustling business hotel with small rooms. Our stay got off to a rocky start. My son and I were told the room wasn't ready (which I fully understand) but would be in about 2 hours, and our bags would be delivered to the room. So we went out for lunch, came back and while the room was ready, it only had a queen sized bed and not the two twins we'd requested. So that had to be rectified. There were also no bags in the room. Went to the bellstand, they showed me a sheet saying they'd been sent. And then they looked around and there they were right in front of them. They said the sheet was checked off as delivered because that's because the bags were about to be delivered.    Would love to meet the room designer/architect who thought the idea of a frosted-glass enclosed bathroom was a good idea. See my picture to fully grasp what I'm talking about. There are a couple of flaws to the idea of a glass bathroom.. When the bathroom occupant turns on a light at night, it illuminates the entire room. And the sliding glass door doesn't seal in the same way that a traditional door would, leaving everyone vulnerable to noise and odor. Also there's no lock for privacy.     The hotel does have a pool. Most places you find the pool, swipe your key, grab a towel and hit the water. Not so here. It's a complicated trail through a locker room/changing area separated by gender before you actually find the pool. My 14 year-old son was amused by the naked dude walking around the locker room. The pool shares the space with a local gym/healthclub.   The elevator buttons involve a room key to go up, a system that doesn't always work if you've got a balky key card. One of the panel of buttons is on the side of the wall, which people back into. The other panel is in the traditional location by the door but the key activation sensor is located at the very bottom, only a few inches off the floor. Wouldn't the designer thought to have put it at the top?    Comfortable but small beds. And a nice Executive Club lounge for light breakfast and an evening snack. Lunch is not served up there. But certainly a good space to work and relax, although only one computer was working at the time. Food, and the variety of the food, was good. And appreciated having two computers with internet access up there.    The hotel is very close to the Town Hall train stop. And if you don't have bags, you can access the train from the adjacent mall, although could be tricky to find on your first trip TO the hotel. Once you've located the hotel on George Street you'll figure it out for the return. Just be aware that the street in front of the hotel is being torn up for a massive mass-transit project which looks like it may have years to go.    Can't enthusiastically recommend this hotel and it wouldn't be my first choice for Sydney. That said, if the Marriott wasn't available and I was traveling as a single business traveler, I just might wind up here again.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan

The Sydney Hilton is right opposite the QVB and ideally located for shopping and generally getting around Sydney. Not only was the Level 27 room spacious and beautifully presented, but the outlook over the Town Hall and St Andrews Cathedral was open and enjoyable.

It helped to be on the 42nd floor and the view was amazing. Overall it was a comfortable and enjoyable stay. However, the only negative was that one of the front desk lady wasn't all that nice. I arrived at the hotel at 10am on the 11th of March requesting early check in. The only room that was available was next to the elevator which I stated in the original booking that I did not wish to stay next to the elevators. She could not offer me another room until later in the afternoon which was fine but she seemed bothered by my request.

Only thing I liked abt my stay was the city view~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470348050~“Wonderful business lounge - better value than the breakfast”~This was my third time stay at The Hilton and I was not disappoints. This time we had a wonderful large suite which afforded magnificent views, a jacuzzi bath and double-headed shower. I am a sucker for facilities and enjoyed the gym, taking a yoga class in the afternoon. The best bit to be honest, was the business lounge. It was vey well equipped, spacious and had quite the spread. I think it is better value having a pass to the business lounge and enjoying a light breakfast there, than having breakfast at the restaurant.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469959340~“Overpriced shoebox room”~Charged me $2k 6 months in advance of the trip. Took my mum to Sydney to celebrate her 60th. Hotel ruined the trip. The room was a tiny shoebox that didn't even have enough space for our suitcases. The beds were tiny single beds that would slight about. Complained to management & they couldn't have cared less, just said it's primarily a corporate hotel. We were made to feel like we didn't fit in. Every night it took around 5-10 minutes to get up to our room because they only operate one elevator so we had to stand in a queue with all the drunken abnoxious corporate guests after dinner.~1~1~5~2~1~3~1~nan
review_469694513~“Great location, friendly staff and beautiful rooms”~My recent trip for work and stay at the hilton was great.

review_469470475~“One of the nice hotels in the Hilton chain”~Reasonably priced, well situated just in few steps from Hyde Park and Sydney Tower Eye, this hotel proposes many dividends to its Diamond members :) You can enjoy happy hours in the business lounge with drinks and pretty good food.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469001051~“One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at”~As a gold member I was upgraded to a suite on the second from top floor. The gym is a real gym where locals purchase membership so it is large and fully equipped.  Ther eis a 25 meter pool as well with sauna, steam room. Unfortunately, the fitness facilites clse at 9PM but open at 5:30AM The Glass Brasserie restaurant on the second floor is well known and deserves it's fine reputation. In the basement is the Marble Bar which is beautiful and a nice place to finish the night after dinner in The Glass Brasserie all without ever leaving he hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_468791223~“Not quite sure how to feel?!”~My partner surprised me for my 21st birthday at the hotel on Saturday (18th march) and booked for a deal that I would not say is the best. He booked directly with the hotel for a deluxe room (470$ for one night) not inclusive of breakfast. A couple hours prior to check in he called to inform that it was my 21st and whether anything special could be arranged. The staff said "leave it to me" and when we arrived in the room there was a half bottle of red wine in our room. When inquired with magic, staff informed it was complimentary with the "package" along with 2 bottles of water and a late checkout. When told staff we don't drink red wine, we were asked if we would like it replaced with 2 extra bottles of water?!!!! Of course it being my birthday I was not happy.. Additionally, staff at front desk did not inform us of late check out..If we had not asked, we would've left at the usual check out time.  Ordered room service that night. Server was nice but did not wish happy birthday even after my partner had informed him and I myself mentioned it too. Service felt a little pushy and we were informed to "put our dishes back in the box and place it outside the door". No turndown service was provided either for that night which I find strange for a 5 star hotel such as Hilton.  Not all is bad tho- the beds were incredibly comfortable and the room had some great features such as the blockout blinds. Breakfast was also top notch and managers were friendly.  I think if u were to visit the property for a special occasion, I would try else where. It's safe to say I had a memorable birthday not because of the stay but because of the company I had.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468538077~“Nice Hotel”~Nice hotel and located few minutes by walking to Opera House. Rooms are clean and well presented. My only disappointment was the front desk staff, who were not helpful and a little rude. Overall it was a nice nice stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_468382147~“Relaxing stay”~Fantastic location and great hotel. Was able to choose my room through HHonors app day before check in and got a corner room with great views. As a HH Gold card holder, received access to the lounge for breakfast and canapés and drinks of an evening. Relaxed atmosphere and friendly service. Rooms nice, bed comfy and shower great.

review_468442237~“Best Hotel Ever!!!!!”~This is the second time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.

review_468249741~“Excellent room but had a few bad encounters...”~Just arrived back to Perth after an excellent stay in Sydney.  Each time I visit Sydney, I try to say somewhere different and this time, we had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Sydney. From the booking process, through to check-out this morning, the staff very professional and very courteous. Service you would come to expect from one of the most reputable hotel chains in the world. Stayed in the Executive Relaxation Room, which was just as good as the photos portrayed. The room was exceptional. Large, spacious, plenty of natural light with neutral tones and all the usual amenities plus a few luxurious extras.  The walk-in rain shower was wonderful but someone difficult to use, with three separate dials that controlled different features and temperatures, including vertical massage jets, which didn't quite have enough pressure to work to the desired effect. The deep double-bath featured strong jets for a nice relaxing bath. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, although the pillows were way too soft. There is a pillow menu available, however the ones we had seemed to be the best, so grabbed the spare out of the walk-in robe and slept with 3! The room features a separate sitting area off the entry foyer and work desk overlooking the city, with sideward glimpses of Darling Harbour.  We were signed up to the Hilton Honors on arrival and given complimentary wifi, access to the Executive Lounge on Level 36 for continental breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and canapés - all inclusive in the room rate, with a list of other features. Didn't receive a daily newspaper but it wasn't the end of the world.  Upon making the reservation, I requested a room well-away from a lift due to previous nightmares in other venues. The room we were given was directly behind a bank of 3 elevators, which run non-stop, 24hrs a day. The elevators cause a loud vibrating and clicking noise in the room. The sound is a mixture of a fierce tornado or an A380 taking off. Despite buying earplugs, they were to no reprieve and lucky to have received about 3hrs sleep a night when the lifts slowed down in the wee-hours before sunrise. Arrived back to Perth absolutely exhausted and not very "relaxed" after our stay, which is a real shame. The room features an automatic mini-bar. I have seen these in Vegas before and are an immediate trap. The second you lift something from the fridge, it automatically adds it to your room bill. After reading this, we contacted the concierge service "Magic" and explained what happened. The advice we were given was to just clear the fridge and use it for our own personal items then get the mini bar credited back to the room upon check-out, which we did but appeared to be frowned upon at Reception. Housekeeping seemed to arrive early every day. A note was left under our door each morning before 9am to advise that a clean was attempted but as the room was occupied, please call the "Magic" concierge service to organize for them to come back. One afternoon, the room was still being cleaned at 6pm and another afternoon, a housekeeper swiped into the room without knocking or warning. Apologized and left - quite unprofessional and potentially embarrassing for us both if I were getting dressed (wardrobe in the foyer of the room). Stayed on Level 39, which had a really terrible "wet-dog" smell, which lasted the whole stay. It was as though the carpets had been shampooed and couldn't get dry. Quite a heinous smell.  George Street is going to be closed for many months ahead, whilst a light rail tram is built on the Main Street. If arriving by Taxi/Uber, let the driver know to enter via Pitt Street, otherwise you'll be walking blocks with your luggage like we did. Once you figure out the traffic flow, the hotel is actually located in a fantastic position, close to the major shopping malls and plenty of eateries. Enjoyed our stay and the General busy vibe but a few issues encountered, which you would not come to expect from a hotel chain as reputable as the Hilton. In my honest opinion, it certainly wasn't worth the money or the acclaimed rating, which led to making our reservation. Location and room quality were probably the only highlights of this establishment. Would I stay here again? Hard to say... I'm leaning towards maybe not... not for the price we paid. My expectations were quite high considering the cost and reputation.  As I was checking out, a new guest was next to me checking in, which the staff member said the only room that was currently available was a room by the lift which was "incredibly loud!". Clearly a known issue, yet we weren't advised, despite the request not to be located by a noisy lift. Disappointed a little...~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_468219095~“Great location, friendly staff, clean rooms”~Stayed at the Hilton Sydney for leisure for 4 days. Knew in advance that the weather was going to be poor, so booked an upgraded room - a "relaxation room" as thought more time would be spent in the room than normally would be on a holiday. The hotel is located in the heart of the CBD and has access to both George and Pitt Streets - with walking distance to the main shopping areas, as well as train stations and easy access to get transport to Circular Quay. The room on the 39th floor had fantastic views of the city and out to the harbour, as well as of the Westfield tower.  The rooms are very well cleaned and maintained and the staff are very friendly.  The Executive Lounge is excellent for continental breakfast, with a good, quiet atmosphere and plenty of space. There's a lot of room for business work if you need someone to print / have small meetings.  There were only two disappointing factors to the stay - the first was a big one. As previously mentioned, had booked a "relaxation room," which is supposed to be relaxing - but the room was located on the 39th floor, next to the service elevators, and behind that, the actual elevators which are constantly running all day and night. It sounded like a plane was landing in the room. Not to mention the service access door, right outside our door, banging continuously. Also, I assume from the elevator, there was a knocking sound inside the wall of the room every time the elevator was moving. All of this was despite putting in a request for a room "not near an elevator." As a result, we struggled to sleep for the nights we were there.  On a minor note, one day in the middle of the day a housekeeping supervisor walked into the room without knocking, I guess she assumed we weren't in the room to do a "cleanliness check."  Wouldn't hesitate in recommending the hotel to anyone.~4~nan~nan~3~5~nan~5~nan

review_467937903~“Great friendly service but....”~Very friendly service throughout all business areas from front desk, housekeeping, lounge and Glass restaurant at breakfast. The duty manager that welcomed us personally was a nice touch. The welcome gift already sitting in our room as we walked in was a nice touch. Good snacks and drinks at the Lounge. Good spread of food at breakfast. Only snag is that they charge you $5 a cup during breakfast for a cappuccino or cafe latter or a flat white!! Only the watered-down filter coffee is provided complimentary with the breakfast.  Note to F&B Manager : it is an outdated practice to charge seperately for coffee during a buffet breakfast, just because you call it "barista coffee". It is no longer a novelty to have a cappuccino, etc. Almost all establishments are able to supply high quality cappuccino, etc. Please supply us with a self-service cappuccino machine and we will gladly make our own. We do not need a barista during breakfast. Note to GM: high commendations on a well run hotel with consistently friendly, efficient and professional service. It is unusual to have such a high standard of service from every staff member in all areas of the hotel. Well done.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467745058~“Over rated”~We booked because of location, and 5star rating. The room had the basics, no more than any other 5star. However, it was the size of a large cupboard, I had to walk sideways to get into the far side of the bed. And the bathroom, although again adequately fitted, was probably the smallest I've ever been in. The managers response was that they really catered for corporate guests. Yes, they'd only have to suffer for an overnight, and what would they care, they weren't paying for it. We were staying for 3 nights, as part of trip, there wasn't even space for two cases. Manager did offer to upgrade us, for half the normal rate of another £600. Very generous, but no.  Internet connection/ speed was absolutely pathetic, again that could be upgraded at a cost. Ridiculous, 5 star?? Expect better. The location is great, as it is for all the other hotels in the area....do yourself a favour, try one of them instead.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_466448041~“Good but missing the extra details ”~I travel to Sydney regularly and have spent many nights at the Hilton. The hotel is nice and the rooms are clean and spacious but the hotel just seems to be missing on service. Every time I stay, something minor seems to go wrong - for example quick checkout invoice not left under door, charger brought to room but didn't work, twin beds when arriving in room when king ordered. All small things but they are the difference to me between a good and great hotel!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466447123~“Too commercialised”~Average experience at hotel. Check in took a long time. There was a long queue. Check in staff were not overly friendly, perhaps because they were so busy. Considering the price of staying at this hotel, I consider this to be below par. The room was as would be expected for a 5 star metropolitan chain hotel. The food at the glass restaurant was very good. The location of the hotel was great, only a stones throw from Darling Harbor.~3~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan

review_465924128~“Amazing service”~We stayed at the Hilton Sydney for one night and were very impressed with the service, facilities and all staff. The Executive Lounge served drinks and canapés which meant we could sit quietly and avoid the Mardi Gras crowds (as we were very jetlagged). All of the staff in the Executive Lounge were friendly, knowledgeable and provided exceptional service.  The buffet breakfast is one of the most extensive and impressive hotel breakfasts I have seen and I would definitly recommend getting a room and breakfast package or paying the extra.  All staff from initial check-in to passing Housekeepers in the hallway went out of their way to greet us and wish us well.

review_464930470~“One night stay”~We stayed here for a night prior to joining a cruise and chose an Executive room as we have previously enjoyed the facilities offered by Hilton's Executive Lounges.  The room was on the small side by comparison with others we have stayed in, though perfectly adequate. Clean with all amenities present. Though charging $8 for a small bottle of water is outrageous. I can't imagine anyone buying one who has access to the Lounge so why antagonise customers so unnecessarily? Free water would cost Hilton next to nothing to provide.  The wi-if was free but very patchy in the room. Simply not good enough these days.  The evening refreshments and continental breakfast in the Lounge were very good and all the staff we met were excellent.  This Hilton was not nearly as good as Hilton Barra in Rio where we stayed in December.  It is primarily the excellent staff that justify four stars.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464873378~“First Class Business Hotel with an exceptional Gym and Bar”~I stayed here for four nights for a conference. The pricing is on the top end but several features makes the Hilton Sydney stand out. The gym is one of the best of any hotel I've stayed in with free daily classes, an extensive sauna and spa. The Marble Bar in the basement has a real history to it and is one of the most beautiful bars I've been to (gets lively on the weekends). And the Glass Brasserie restaurant has great views and great food... at a price.  I stayed in a deluxe king room on the 39th floor which was clearly geared towards the business traveller. My room was right next to the lift shaft and though I could hear the lifts running up and down, for me it was a background rumbling which was not unpleasant, and which I could block out anyway. If you are particularly sensitive to sounds and distractions though, this may be a larger irritant. The room was large with a desk. Bed was comfortable. Great views over the Sydney Eye and QVB. Shower was very hot, average force. They provided a multiplug adapter (much better than mine) which I thought was a nice touch. But beware the minibar: it's touch sensitive so removing an item even if you don't eat it will be automatically charged.  All in all a top notch stay, for a top notch price.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_464845970~“Basic”~Upon check in I asked the receptionist where I could have a drink, as the coffee shop area was dirty - see picture and people were bringing in takeaways and eating. She suggested the wine bar in Glass restaurant. I went up to the restaurant only to be told that it was not open until 5pm - reception should know these things. I had no option other than to sit in the dirty coffee shop area, I could not have a drink as there is no table service and being on my own would mean I wouldn't necessarily have some where to sit after ordering. The room was very small and cramped but it was clean which is the only redeeming feature. If you are looking for somewhere to sleep and you aren't concerned with comfort and service lack of facilities then this for you.  Personally it was not for me at all.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464937148~“Disappointing”~The rooms are tired and the attention to detail was not there on this visit. I have stayed previously and thought it was great. This trip however I was unable to access my room until after 5pm. The room was not cleaned to the Hilton standard I would have expected. Bell boys were helpful and Reception staff tried to be but were very much driven by process rather than customer satisfaction. Location is very convenient. The fitness centre was good too. A disappointing stay this time.~3~2~4~3~2~2~3~nan

review_464241686~“Not such an Executive lounge ”~Stayed here recently and didn't realise it was Australia day as well. Perhaps that accounted for the hoardes of families staying. Certainly have no objection to families staying and enjoying themselves but the whole point of an executive lounge is a bit of exclusivity.  Over the 4 days we were there people were stocking up with so much complimentary snacks and canapés as their actual dinner. It was a total melee and shambles. Very unrelaxing. Taking food away to their rooms. Children taking 30 at least dim sum balls for the whole family to feast on.  We have stayed at many Hilton hotels and always in executive lounges. Never again in Sydney.  The staff were pleasant enough but unable to cope with the onslaught of feeding locusts.  Always a queue for drinks. No self service as in other Hiltons.  Perhaps the hotel should have a separate area for families.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

I love the Hilton experience where you feel you know what you are going to get when you walk in but there is enough local culture in the hotel to remind you where you are. The breakfast I think remains one of the best hotel breakfasts anywhere.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464202262~“Fantastic service. An "odd" room”~As usual with Hilton hotels, the service was wonderful. Our room (#4313) was very odd and a bit of a challenge for a couple staying three nights (very limited shelf space anywhere, small and oddly placed shower, etc.) The breakfast buffet is excellent, and the Executive Lounge staff are very helpful and cordial.~5~3~5~5~3~5~5~nan
review_463935286~“Great Conference and Dinner Venue”~Spent two + days at a conference. Venue and food was very good for the conference with lots of choice. Conference bar would have benefited from my coordinated and prepared staff to reduce queue times. Dinner at the bar was extremely tasty where we enjoyed duck and pork belly pancakes, along with steak tartare. Visually the Hilton is an interesting hotel with lots of glass and a vertical garden. Easy across the road access to Queen Victoria Building.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463839087~“Amazing service”~I know that this was a 3 day conference and everything was way over the top because I am sure my firm paid top dollar. But the service we got at breakfast lunch and at the bar was exceptional. As soon as you seemed to move someone was there to assist. Just so polite and helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
