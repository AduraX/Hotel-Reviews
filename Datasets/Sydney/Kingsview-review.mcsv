review_162807160~“Great B & B”~Myself and my husband stayed at the Kingsview on Saturday night. Would definately recommend this B & B. The owners are lovely, extremely welcoming. The room was great. I feel this is great value for the money. Would highly recommend this B & B to anyone!!  There are lovely pubs nearby and a great Indian. You are not too far from the centre either.  Would highly recommend!! I will definately be booking here again~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
