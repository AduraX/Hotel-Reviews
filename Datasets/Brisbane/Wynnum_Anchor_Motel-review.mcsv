review_467748029~“A relaxed and quiet stay in Anchor Bay Brisbane”~Several of us were on a Veterans Cricket trip from Sydney to play Queensland in a State or Origin two day tournament and the Wynnum Anchor Bay Motel was the nearest accommodation that was picked for us. From the start of our experience, everything was in order. A recently renovated Motel, with new Air Con units, nice bedding and updated decor, with salt water pool and deck area plus under cover al fresco eating area, it was perfect for our stay. Sam and Julia, the managers could not have been more helpful. They took me to the train station about half an hours journey to Brisbane Central, breakfast was good value and served in a timely fashion, and nothing was too much for these hosts. I have no hesitation in recommending this motel to others who like a handy location near Manly and a step away from the Bay. Well done and thanks. Simon~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_450296453~“Convenient”~We stayed her after returning from Moreton Island on a late ferry. The room was clean and tidy with a great shower, which was a great relief after being on the island for 9 nights. The owner was helpful with advice and the hotel is located a short distance from shops and cafes. On street parking is available for caravans and off-street parking for vehicles.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_447934490~“Good night sleep”~The motel is close to Wynnum shopping, quiet location, good quality beds - good night sleep. Staff were helpful after a stressful day. Breakfast was most enjoyable, nice not have to rush to get dress and go to a restaurant - breakfast delivered to your door.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_446118788~“Clean, Comfortable & Quiet”~We stayed one night on our way to Moreton Island. The owners were very helpful, after we realised we had lost our print outs for the ferry & our camping, they were more then happy to print them out for us at no cost. Great motel, water pressure in the shower is great, the bed is super super comfy. Loved that it had a guest laundry. Quiet location and we can recommend the little Indian restaurant a few minutes walk up the road. Delicious! A lovely place to stay!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_445362787~“Good quiet location near bayside walks”~stayed closeby to where I needed to work. Found the motel was as earlier comments suggest in an older style 1960's ranch style. Found my stay great - freindly staff, clean hotel, fresh paint, new beds and linen, standard hotel accessories - flat screen, mwave, crockery and offer of free wifi. Pool is in a sunny spot with BBQ nearby (didn't have time for either unfortunately)~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_440799679~“Nice surprise.”~When I arrived I was a little disappointed with the outside of the motel. Lesson learned don't judge a book by its cover. I was greeted by very accommodating staff, who were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was standard fair but had a very comfortable bed, with good pillows. As a very regular traveler, these are the things you appreciate the most. Definitely recommend~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440645050~“Best Value, older quiet small motel close to Airport by Car.”~I have stayed at the Wynnum Anchor Motel, many times. The Owner is on site and are extremely accommodating. If you want peace and quiet, perhaps catching up on jet lag. This is the place. Best value, clean & comfortable.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_438615651~“Stop over before departing from Port Brisbane to Moreton Island”~We stayed for one night and found the motel clean, tidy, modern and quiet. Nice in room kitchen and eating area for breakfast. We could park at the front door which was convenient. 15 minute drive to Port Brisbane which worked well for our onward travel arrangements. I would recommend this motel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438395597~“Overnight Moreton island trip. ”~This motel is very clean, it had everything we needed for an over night stay. The owners are very pleasant and nothing was ever to hard. If you need to be at the port of Brisbane early we totally recommend this motel. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436721450~“Business Trip”~Stayed a couple of days for business trip. Accomodation was very neat and tidy. Sam at reception couldn't do enough for us. Very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431703277~“Spotless”~Lovely older style hotel and absolutely spotless. Have stayed in many hotels with higher stars and this motel would be one of the cleanest. Had a family room two single beds and one king size, well equiped mini kitchen and tidy bathroom. Beds were comfortable linen crisp and had plenty of towels. All on ground level suitable for all ages and accessobility. Parking at front of each motel unit. Close to harbour, foreshore walking paths and local shops and cafes.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424922594~“Great Discovery and value”~We came here last Friday (with my partner and his mother) during the long weekend and we were lucky to find a spot and lucky to discover this place. The room was very clean, there was even soap and shampoo! We didn't have a swim in the rock pool but rather enjoyed our time around the area. Roger was very helpful with his tips. If I had to say something negative it would be the internet connection, however that didn't bother as we had better things to do. :)~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_418756097~“Lovely place with very helpful friendly owners”~We stayed here to attend a family wedding and the owners went out of their way to make our stay a great experience even down to assisting with finding a Dr on Sunday when my hubby got sick. Very clean room with a great comfy bed.  Yummy home cooked breakfast at a great price. All in all, we found this a great place to stay and very good value for money and would recommend it to others looking for accommodation in the area. We hope to return there again to experience more of what the area has to offer.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_398598494~“little gem”~Rooms spotless, beds very comfy, air con great. Friendly owners provided a very good breakfast sas well. Nice quiet location with a lovely sea front just around the corner. Didnt use the pool as we stayed just 1 night inbetween a long layover at Brisbane airport. Would def stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396084485~“Very good motel, very clean and friendly staff”~Recently renovated, except for bathroom. Renovated very well for a budget motel. It was exceptionally clean and the renovation has been done well. Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. The owner told me bathrooms are being progressively renovated. They have an outstanding BBQ area and timber decked pool. They are literally 100 metres from the water's edge of Moreton Bay. They have free wifi, quite speedy with router inside the room and lighting in the room is outstanding. On the down side it is probably a little over priced for what it is and is a little way away from the Wynnum town and park centre.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_381594434~“Basic but clean”~Stayed here on business due to our normal accommodation being full and not having a back up plan.  Very basic place, clean facilities and friendly staff but not the type of place for the travelling worker. Typical motel you might find on a main highway whilst on a driving holiday.  No face washers in room, only one towel, no hair dryer and the lights left on outside shine straight into your room at night even with timber blinds closed. Linen was very poor, thin and small towels.  No restaurant close by (walking distance) doesn't help. If you are on a budget and passing through great place to land, just BYO everything as options are very limited.  Upside: comfy bed, clean and tidy, close to freeway.  Downside: price, bathroom and no food close by.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_373190946~“Quaint hidden gem”~We stayed here on Saturday the 14 May  Having just returned from a cruise.  I must say that on location alone I wouldn't have looked at this online, we ended up here due to a booking stuff up.  Well this place is a gem. No it's not all modern with all the bells and whistles but it is terrific.  Two houses back from the beach and Wynnum and in a very quiet area. I love that "sleepy" feeling that old water front communities have.  The family room was spacious and the beds very comfortable. A good size bathroom and a great shower.  The place was clean. Very clean. There was a big tv, microwave etc.  it was only a short drive in to town and no parking problems.  Would I stay again? Very definitely yes.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368541669~“Great place to stay! Very clean! Great Breakfast!!!”~The staff are friendly and helpful!  My granddaughter really enjoyed the swimming pool. There was also a selection of DVDs to watch - including children's, family, comedy & drama. Good flat screen TV.  There was a great selection for breakfast. The omelette Julia made was delicious.  The motel had a very friendly atmosphere.  The room was spacious. The roo was SPOTLESS, definitely cleaner than other places that I have stayed.  I would definitely stay at Wynnum Anchor Motel again. :)~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_368264903~“Woken with a start”~The rooms are somewhat dated, particularly the bathroom, however are spotlessly clean and feature some updated furnishings. The area is surprisingly quiet for being so close to the hustle and bustle of a major city, so a peaceful sleep was easy to achieve. That being said, I was woken with quite the start at 5.15am ... thought we we experiencing a major emergency only to realise the person next door was having a shower! Pays to take earplugs!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_364968772~“Excellent!”~Great place to stay. Everything we needed. Our stay was one night. Great price and location. Very friendly and super convenient. Family room was awesome. Pool and BBQ area. Would definitely recommend this place and we'll be back for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_364712288~“Friendliest place to stay! Treated like family.”~I came to stay at Wynnum Anchor Motel as a female travelling alone for work.  Sam and Julia went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable. Having them on site 24hrs made me feel safe as well. The pool and all amenities are very clean. The room was spacious, with kitchette and micro. Hanging space in the closet. I will return! I recommend Wynnum Anchor Motel to anyone coming to the Wynnum/Manly area. Beautiful fresh air from the Bay also. :)~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_358903798~“Everything we needed and friendly owners!”~This is a excellent motel situated right by the beautiful Moreton Bay. The owners were very friendly and helpful and made us feel most welcome. The rooms are simple and clean with everything you need. The motel is easily accessible to some lovely walking paths by the water, which was how we spent our afternoon. We ordered room service breakfast the next morning as we were heading out early - it was delivered right on time and was home cooked and delicious! Thanks for a great stay!~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_356684322~“Excellent motel on Brisbane's Bayside”~Thoroughly recommend this small but very welcoming motel just south of mouth of Brisbane River. The beach is very close by and there is a good small pool on site. The units are very comfortable and clean and the owner is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. (He delivered us to the airport early the next morning. Only a 15 to 20 minute trip.) The motel is situated in a quiet spot so is very peaceful. Shops and restaurants are a short drive away or a 20 minute walk. Would definitely return to stay longer than just overnight.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_354685112~“Some good things, some not so good”~Standard, no frills, 3 star. Some good things (convenient parking, laundry available, tidy room, friendly staff). Walking distance from two playgrounds, and a longer walk to the water play area for kids. Pelicans were magic. Most importantly, it was very clean. Notes: Others have noted the state of the pillows and their comments are fair. Pool was nice but some dead bugs (which may be unavoidable but it's an issue for some). Bring an eye mask. Despite east-facing windows and no daylight saving, there are no block-out curtains. Hello 4am. Ditto ear plugs. To deal with the people who, having woken at 4am, then start their day and engines at 5am. This may be usual QLDer behaviour, but did not make for a restful stop. Bring your own breakfast. While the motel's menu is convenient, some items were not fresh, while others were overpriced. -- All this is not to put you off, I would probably stay again, I'd just come better prepared.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_347506333~“Good Motel, Great Location”~We booked this motel for the last night of our holiday because it is only 20 minutes from the car rental company near the airport. It is also a great location because it is near the Wynnum Kids Water Park, which our daughter loved. A few blocks in the other direction is the Lytton Roost, where we added 3 birds to our life list. The Wynnum Mangrove Boardwalk is also there, but we skipped that because of rain. Maybe we will walk it next time. The motel room itself was small but not cramped. It was clean and had the basic necessities. We were able to park right outside our door. Reception was friendly and helpful. We will probably be back.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_345502189~“Basic overnight stop”~This traditional style motel is very near the sea in Wynnum - not near the beaches, but close to the mangroves and walking paths. It is not outstanding, but satisfactorily comfortable for an overnight stop. A pool on the grounds may be attractive particularly to families. I felt it was a little expensive for basic accommodation.~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_342276232~“Nice rooms & friendly staff ”~We stayed for 2 nights in a family room, has one queen and 2 singles, studio room with decent bath, toaster, jug and kitchen sink. Rooms are nice and new, large TV. Nice pool area with BBQ. The staff are really friendly and helpful. In room breakfast was great!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339728394~“Friendly,restful motel”~The building is in the standard motel configuration of the early post war period,but well maintained and clean.There is a nice pool and barbeque. Best of all is its beautiful location in a secret part of Brisbane's bayside,only a few metres from the Wynnum North Esplanade.Very quiet,sea breezes and relaxing walks by the sea and the nearby boardwalk through the mangroves.Wynnum RSL and Wynnum CBD only about a kilometre away,as is the train to the city. The manager is a great guy,helpful and friendly and respectful. Just be careful when reversing especially at night.It is easy to go over the revetment which divides the motel property from the roadside footpath,because there is no lighting,signage or other barrier to alert one.Sounds silly but more than once this has happened to my knowledge,very lucky that no serious damage to vehicles as the drop is about 12 to 14 inches,leaving the car stranded on the fulcrum of the concrete edge of the top of the wall. But otherwise,full marks and highly recommended!~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_337958810~“Incredible”~Never, after having been in hundreds of hotels/motels, have I met more accommodating people than Julia and Sam, the owners. After having been searched at Sydney airport and some of my things were forgotten to be returned, passports, money, credit cards, the owners spent hours on the phone and computer to get me back to Sydney to retrieve our belongings before we went on a New Years cruise from Brisbane. Apart from that, the rooms are so clean and so well equipped, it was pure pleasure to stay there. Thank you so very much. Bill and Minne~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_334066148~“great place to stay for a night”~stayed here with family before going to Moreton. Friendly owner who put a 4th fold out bed in our room so both kids could have their own bed. Location is just off the waterfront with a renovated clean pool where kids and myself had a good swim in. room was clean, functional, queen bed was quite hard but good, pillows offer little support though. We could park our very high car right in front of room. The walls are very thin but it was no issue for us on our one night stay, would have no issue staying here again great place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_296137006~“"We'll be back!"”~I had booked a number of rooms for friends and ourselves for a reunion weekend several months prior to the event. On arrival we were greeted like long lost friends and made to feel very welcome. Our room was fresh and clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The situation is ideal, quiet and away from traffic, although it is close to all amenities and the Manager kindly helped with transport to other venues, as we were a big group. There are also good walking paths right from the Motel's front door, allowing early risers to explore the foreshore of Moreton Bay. We stayed for 3 nights and on our last night we used the Motel's BBQ facilities, with our Host being most accommodating to our large numbers. We have already booked for next year.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_260633216~“Very friendly place to stay”~Clean and comfortable place to stay. Convenient to everything.

review_221001328~“Ok..”~The accommodation is very basic, and a little tired looking. It's in a convenient quiet location.  The helpful and friendly managers were very flexible without late arrival and early departure. This place covers the basics. We didn't take advantage of any other of their services so am unable to comment on them further.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_210248672~“What friendly staff :)”~What a lovely clean place. We were greated by such nice owners who were more than accomodating for our needs even given us extra blankets because they didnt think the port o cot supplied was soft enough.  And what a great location right by the water. My only suggestion better curtains to keep light out. Would definately stay here again and refer to others.~4~5~5~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_203651483~“Overnight stay”~All that you need for an overnight stay, room clean and comfortable. Checking in was easy plus the new owner was very friendly (for someone from Sydney lol) Will stay again if ever in Wynnum area again.~4~3~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_179997360~“Very basic and barely got a third star”~We travel regularly and rely on websites and other peoples reviews in our planning. When we arrived we were dissapointed that the "Features" listed on this motels websites are NOT features of the motel, But instead are features of the town and are a 1.5km plus drive away. We have 2 children and were planning to make use of the facilities and have adults take turns to rest. The motel has a pool and that's it. There is no shade over the pool so we were unable to use this. The Queens bed was firm and the springs could be felt poking through. There are blinds on the windows but no curtains or anything to block out the sunrising. This meant that we all woke at dawn. The price we paid was very steep considering its location and amenities. On the upside this was very clean and well cared for and the staff, who were looking after the place for the owners, were a lovely couple. So if all you are after is a place to shower and sleep this will do.~3~2~3~2~3~5~3~nan
review_175341052~“Great Location”~Nice Motel very clean and roomy. It is close to the Wynnum Manly Water front and local shops. Staff were very friendly and checkin was a breeze. Has everything you need for a nice quiet stay in the Brisbane area.~4~4~4~3~4~4~4~nan
review_162495500~“A nice stay in Wynnum”~Very good location if you want to be in the area. Very close to train stations on the Cleveland line. Lovely parks and seaview in a few steps. Friendly managers. Problem was with the wi-fi connection as I was in the farthest room from the reception. Generally very clean could do with some vaccuming every day.~3~4~4~5~5~3~4~nan
