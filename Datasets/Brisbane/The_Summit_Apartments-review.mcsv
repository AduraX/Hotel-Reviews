review_474419701~“Comfortable, affordable and handy”~The well appointed units are excellent, everything you need to get comfortable. We were visiting a sick relative at St Andrews Hospital which is almost next door and the Summit was a great place to stay. Easy access to the hospital and all the comforts of home. An easy stroll down to Brisbane CBD, comfortable beds and a nice kitchen.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_473731575~“All you need”~Easy check in..easy car park process... we had a 2 bedroom apartment..was bit outdated needs modernising but other than that its all you need kitchen beds bathroom etc.. only 10 mins walk to queens plaza where all the shopping is.

review_463994746~“Good value-convenient to hospital-clean”~We booked in for two weeks as my husband had a hip replacement. Due to recovery process and physio we extended and have stayed a month.  Conveniently placed basically next door to hospital (5 min walk) Clean and spacious apartment. Good sized fridge and well appointed for cooking. No oven only microwave. ( I bought Sunbeam nutri bake oven for $88 (speedy bake) that has been well utilized. Good laundry. Very comfortable bed. Good air-con. I set up an office on the desk in the lounge with printer (also purchased for $56) and ran the business from here with no troubles. Free wifi. Papers daily at reception. If you need anything just ask, reception and cleaning staff are very attentive. Free city bus does the loop Monday to Friday. Bus stop close stroll. Free parking underneath is a welcome addition. Pool pristine, public areas spotless. Deliveroo provides a great selection of restaurants for takeaway, delivered in 20-30 mins. Download app on your phone or order online. (Avoid the one on the fridge) This has been a home away from home. We will be back!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_458384990~“Good value and clean ”~Stayed 2 nights a little dated but very well maintained and clean great bed and friendly service will stay again as is handy walking distance to everything and well priced. Had 1 bed apartment with great views from balcony.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458157994~“Very comfortable and affordable accommodation”~Having stayed at Summit Apartments recently I found the apartments to be well equipped, clean and spacious. Needing to visit St Andrews Hospital these apartments are situated within walking distance to the hospital. Apartments are fitted with air con, dishwasher, everything needed either for an overnight stay or a family holiday. Also they have an outdoor pool, sauna, spa and even a small gym for visitors to use. Staff were very welcoming.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_443932258~“Good value”~Stayed two nights in one bedroom apartment very roomy unit a little dated and worn but clean and well equipped. Free parking a plus with large parking bays just watch the clearance only 1.9 metres just enough for our 4x4 wagon. Good spot close to town and parks within walking distance only if you don't mind an uphill walk returning from the city centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437617940~“Good clean accommodation”~We recently stayed in The Summit Apartments in a studio room and were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are spacious, very clean and the beds are comfortable. The bathroom was also spacious with washing machine and dryer. The staff were friendly and helps us with what ever we needed. I will be staying here again.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436516936~“Handy location , reasonable price for inner city.”~Stayed in a two bedroom apartment. 8th floor. Apartment was very spacious. Floor to ceiling Windows and wrap around patio gave great views of city lights. Central A/C was quite noisy and not adjustable, other than that the fixtures and fittings were good. For the price and location it is good value. Little bit of a problem communicating a late arrival when making a booking but all sorted in the end. Undercover car park is 1.9m clearance, so if you have a larger car you may have to park outside.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_435274525~“Perfectly located for St Andrews Hospital”~I booked for 3 nights and have extended for a further 2 while my husband is staying at St Andrews Hospital. It's location literally next door was the deciding factor at the time of booking. I originally booked a studio but was upgraded to a 7th floor 1 bedroom apartment. While dated to a degree, the apartment is spacious with a comfy sofa and dining table, large kitchen, laundry with w/machine and dryer, renovated bathroom and good sized bedroom with a comfortable queen sized bed. There's plenty of storage and a nice balcony overlooking the view. Our room faced away from the road so was quiet although the air conditioner was very loud at night and blew onto the bed. But it can be turned off if a problem. I have found the apartment very comfortable and clean. Daily servicing includes making the bed, emptying of bins and replenishment of toiletries and coffee/tea although towels are only replaced if left on the bathroom floor. The free Spring Hill loop bus has a stop just around the corner and normal buses are close by. All in all a perfect stay for what we needed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433052091~“Dated, but clean and tidy”~Stayed here overnight, while attending a local conference. The checkin process was straight forward, and the staff helpful with instructions for after hours access. The rooms were clean and tidy, but a little dated. The beds were comfortable, sheets were clean. The hotel itself is near the Roma St Parklands and is based in Spring Hill, so also near some medical facilities, which is handy if required.~3~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_424240300~“The apartments are regularly filled with drunks”~Not sure how anyone could get a good nights sleep the apartments are regularly filled with drunks over long weekends and weekends in general, no one had the authority to shut it down and these apartments ruin the area as they are filled with drug takers and drunks all the time .. management do nothing about it ... recommend any other hotel but this one it's dirty shoddy and the pool and internet rarely is clean or internet works~1~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_414784567~“Bridge to Brisbane Day”~Perfect place to stay for the Fun Run recently. Walked out the door and found the start right there. Good sized rooms with everything provided for a longer stay. Would come again. Only problem was the air conditioning was noisy so  left it off on the last night.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_401230914~“Lovely staff.”~We only stayed one night because we had to go to the hospital (which is very close 4 min away). But if we had to stay longer I would of been quite happy to stay another night. The staff at reception he was lovely and very helpful when my partner was asking questions on where the closest hobby store was. The room was clean and I didn't hear any traffic in the night. Will be staying here again if we ever have to go to Brisbane. And for the price $139 a night is great for what you can pay in the city. And if you are here in time for the Ekka it is really close too..~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_400621797~“One night stay”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment on the sixth floor. First impressions of the lobby and room were that they were quite tired. The room was spacious, but furnishings were old and the bathroom was original 70s/80s vintage. We had an issue with lights not working. The place was clean but in desperate need of renovation. Not sure if other parts of the complex had been updated, but aside from the kitchen, this apartment was very very dated. We were happy we only booked for one night.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_398967265~“Used the Apartment to stay in whilst husband in Hospital”~Stayed in studio apartment 707 while my husband was in Greenslopes Hospital for a week. Found the apartment was modern, clean and very comfortable with the added bonus of a good size laundry and well equipped kitchen. The apartment had a balcony with a great view of the city. Being on the 7th floor did not find it noisy and with free car parking found it only a 15 minute easy drive to the Hospital. St Andrews Private Hospital is just across the road as is Roma Street Parklands. A 12 minute walk brings you to the main railway station and the Queen Street Mall in centre of Brisbane. Tasty takeaway places were only minutes away from the Summit Apartment. I found management friendly and helpful - nothing was a problem for them.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_338616281~“Tired and grubby with cockroaches”~Although the location to the local private hospital is ideal, this hotel is very very tired and grubby. There are stains on the walls, dirty carpet, foul smelling lobby, cigarette smoke in the hallway and a dirty kitchen. Our first room had an infestation of cockroaches in the bedrooms, bathroom and dishwasher. Once this was bought to the attention of the manager, we were offered a different room which thankfully doesn't have any creatures! The wifi which is stated to be throughout the complex is very poor strength or non existent everywhere but the lobby.  Credit to the staff for finding us a new room quickly, but otherwise this hotel is hugely expensive for its quality.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_329669087~“A very pleasant stay with very helpful staff”~We were a little concerned as we belatedly saw some disappointing reviews of the Summit Apartments. Seriously, I don't know which room these people had but our room was very comfortable, clean, spacious and had everything that we required. The staff were very accommodating and friendly.The location was excellent, very central to everything.We went to the Ed Sheeran concert and instead of waiting for a Taxi (approx. 2 hr wait time) we walked back to the apartment, ittook about 20 mins.People, stop being so negative! This place is great value for money! Trish~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_328764921~“Spacious and friendly”~My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the comfort, spaciousness and value for money of this accommodation. It was a medical trip so we wanted to be close to the hospital. We were practically next door to it. Sitting on the balcony and drinking in the bright lights and sounds of the city was unbelievably intoxicating for a country couple like us. We will definitely go there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_274584560~“Spacious, clean, convenient and GREAT VALUE !!”~Stayed overnight to attend a concert. At only $149 We had a 1 Bedroom Apartment with a queen and single in a separate bedroom with balcony as well as dining/lounge with balcony, kitchenette and bathroom. Was roomy, clean and well appointed in a great location and included FREE Wi-Fi and parking! Bargain!  My only negative is the air con system is not controllable. It's either on or off and set at management's temperature. We ended up sleeping with all balcony doors open as it was too hot and stuffy (a balmy winter night). If rooms had air con that I could control the temperature I would have rated 5 stars! Some of the previous reviews I question if any of these issues were raised with management? I work in tourism and it frustrates me to no end with the petty reviews where most of the time management are not aware so have no chance to try and appease guests during their stay, also seems to be whinging about little things that really doesn't impact stay or that can be helped .  Some of the comments for this hotel is due to expecting too much. You are in the CBD so expect noise, yes it's older but still well presented, carpet in lift needs replacing? like really? that affected your stay???? I actually paid particular attention to this when in the lift, and yes it's worn but hell it's a high traffic area so is expected!! Car parking hard to find spare space? Well that means it's busy and it's free parking at that, a rarity in the city!! 5 Star Hotels have these same issues along with expensive parking with little room! If you want high end deluxe accommodation stay at a 5 star hotel with the 5 star pricing rather than this extremely comfortable 4 star hotel with 3 star pricing! I have stayed in many 5 star hotels that were no where near as good as Summit. Credit where credit is due.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_268202759~“summit not really”~Room was tidy and well maintained, unfortunately thats where it stops. Very noisy not only from street noise and nieghbors. Then there was the air-conditioner which rattled constantly and from time to time even howled. Didn't have any problems working out what the neighbors were up to, could smell the cooking all through our room along with a few other illicit smells. The kitchen set up is just plain crazy as any form of cooking risks setting the fire alarm off as the rangehood was next to useless. Would not recomend these apartments to anyone.~2~1~nan~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_254035821~“Value for money.”~The best place to stay if you need to be close to St Andrews hospital. Apartments are spacious and provide all you need. The complex is aging but is well maintained. Reception is very helpful and accommodating. If you are staying for leisure the Spring Hill loop bus is a great way to get from The Summit to Brisbane City. It is a free service. There are 2 stops handy to the accommodation.  There is a nice pool and a gym also available on site. The common areas of the complex are kept spotlessly clean. We have stayed 3 times and have been more than happy each visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_246943831~“Value for money”~We stayed at the Summit Apartments for two days just after Christmas 2014 and had a recently renovated room on the 6th floor. The apartment was spacious and modern - quiet and had all the accesories necessary to make it a comfortable stay. Staff were really friendly and accommodating and the location was awsome being only 10 mins from the city centre, a short walk to the Sportsman's Hotel and a short cab ride from Petrie Tce and good food options. There were a few negatives but they were insignifcant to the positives - cleanig was a little under parr and the A/C dripped water from the exhaust between the lounge and bedrooms. But on the other had the attention to detail was excellent. We had a blown lamp bedside, decided not to report it but the next day it was fixed.  Likewise, the pool was great and a fantastic spa. I always guage a hotel by the idea of......... 'would I stay there again?' ......... in this event, given the price ($145.00) and the recently renovated room (6th Floor) - yes I would. Definetely value for money.~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_246248415~“OKAY”~For our purpose it was ok accom, large room, good comfortable bed, kitchen good, proximity to activities good. Paid $149. Generally the apartment was a bit smelly and could do with a bit of an overhaul. Undercover secure parking provided but difficult to find a spot that's not reserved. Lift carpet old replacing required. Shot walk to CBD.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_243383439~“Okay but not over the top”~You can tell from the first minute you're in here that this Is an old building, which didn't worry us as we weren't going to be spending heaps of time in the rooms. Underground carpark is free which is great but it's really small/tight which makes it difficult to get around, but it's not the end of the world. Common areas could do with a bit of a spruce up to bring it back to a higher rating. The rooms are good, we had the 1 bedroom which also had a single. The room is huge which would be great if you were spending time in the room. Kitchen is pretty stock standard, fairly well equipped.  Bathroom looks nice and you'd assume it has been newly renovated, however a bit more cleaning is needed as there is mould around the edges in the shower, luckily the black tiles mask it, but it still needs to be done. Beds were comfy and staff were friendly, I would stay here again if I was on a budget in Brisbane.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_243371764~“Disgusted”~ If I could up load photos to this review it would turn your stomach. The cough is covered in stains and looks like it had been picked up off the side of the road, the bath has mold and had not been cleaned in some time, don't get me started on the kitchen! Will never ever stay here again, so many cleaner apartmentts in Bris - take your pick just dont book here. Only thing going fir it is location.~1~1~5~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_242384995~“Nice Location”~We had an overnight stay here in a two bedroom apartment. Nice stroll to the city centre. We drove from sydney and arrived well before checkin time. The staff member was very kind and helpful and quickly arranged our room, which was fantastic. Bed was very comfortable and noise level was quiet given the convenient city location.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~5~nan
review_241798530~“A great place to stay”~i have been staying at The Summit apartments for years and have never been disappointed. Close to the city, beautiful Roma Street Parklands almost outside the door, a great Spring Hill loop bus that runs every 15 minutes to the City, clean & comfortable modern 2 bedroom apartment. Free WiFi, (just ask reception if you are having trouble connecting). There are also several cafes close by, and the Spring Hill pub a short walk away. I will be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_235108880~“Would never stay there again”~So dissapointed. My parents shouted my sister and myself down to Brisbane to watch my brother play in his footy finals. She had been telling us a week prior about how nice the 2 bedroom apartment is and the spa bath etc etc. When we arrived, we were told the pool was unavailable. Dissapointing. We were also told by the lady at the front desk to ring down if we have any problems. When we got up to the hotel, there was no spa bath. Also dissapointing as my Mum had been so excited and even bought bubble bath! We then decided we would ring down to ask if we had been assigned the wrong room. There was no phone anywhere. Mum then had to go downstairs and ask why we have no spa bath. The lady responded with 'sorry we only have 1 apartment with a spa bath and it is already taken'. Mum was unhappy as she had clearly paid extra for a spa bath. They gave us a $30 refund. We then put the aircon on which made a horrible banging and clanging noise! Dad was very unimpressed. There was also no bottle opener or coffee cups. That night me and my Dad decided to go for a walk to look for some takeaway food. We asked the lady at the front desk where the closet place is she responded with 'I don't know'. Annoyed, we walked down the road and found a little pub to eat at. The next morning my Dad left early to return the hire car so myself, Mum and Sister wanted to walk to Queen St Mall. After googling where to go, we asked the lady at reception ( a different one this time) which way to go. She said im not sure and pointed to the opposite of what our map said. So we walked out that way then checked google and what she had said was completely wrong. All in all, horrible service. The view was amazing though! We all said we would never stay there again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_229582795~“Ok but a couple of potentially big issues”~First off the good parts, location is excellent, even to walk in to the CBD but be warned Spring Hill is literally that, a hill, so the walk back is pretty taxing. Apartment we stayed in was 1 bed, it was clean, spacious and the kitchen was fully equipped so no grumbles there. Now the negatives. The first one is a biggy. There's no separate room control for the heating/cooling. So basically you're at the mercy of a communal heating system. It had literally been 27 degrees that day but when I pressed the switch to turn the system on it was pumping out hot air! When I asked the girl on the desk about it she said they were just coming out of winter hence the warm air circulating!!! It's Queensland for God's sake! The result was my 1 year old daughter was boiling, I couldn't open the balcony doors as the traffic outside is too noisy so I had to endure a baby in discomfort, and to be honest my wife and I struggled to settle in that heat. The other negative is more specific to our needs. I rang ahead to ask if they provided baby high chairs, the girl on the phone said no. On our last day my wife was reading through the manual and spotted that baby high chairs were something they could provide! I went down and this time spoke to a different lady and she said, oh yes sorry, the girl you spoke to is new! We found this out just in time for breakfast on the last day, but after all that the high chair had nothing to secure our daughter in, it was just a seat with no tray and no harness so it wasn't actually safe to use. There are plenty of apartments around this area so my advice would be pick another. I ticked average as opposed to poor as it is a good location and is a good space and in good nick, but the main negative on the heating is just too big a negative.~3~3~nan~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_219197531~“Weekend Footy Trip”~Stayed at the Summit for a weekend with my family. We booked a two bedroom unit and went to a Friday night footy game at Suncorp Stadium. The unit was clean and functional. Although the pool was not available we didn't mind as it was too cold for swimming. Location was good as we could walk to the city and the stadium. Good Thai restaurant and a bottle shop only one block away.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
