review_474904062~“Brisbane International - Windsor...work accommodation”~The rooms are clean, compact but homely, restaurant is superb fine fining....Hotel staff friendly...not much surrounding the location but close to RHB. Lutwyche Road traffic can be a little hectic to negotiate.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_473962052~“Always a great stay”~I often stay here for work. I am always made to feel welcome and the staff are always happy to help out with any requests. The staff are always friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to make my stay comfortable.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_472246828~“Stayed for work”~Rooms were clean, staff friendly and proper/usable WIFI, not dial up download speeds that you'd typically get elsewhere.  Pool and gym were a handy extra for me.  Would certainly stay again without hesitation.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472232437~“Does the job”~We were spending a night for a quick trip to airport with early flight. Hotel staff friendly and room was comfortable. Not too much around in the restaurant department but they have an nice Italian on site. Safe travels!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472023468~“Despie the worst weather the staff at the Windsor were amazing.”~I stayed at the Windsor during the recent storms. Staff couldn't get into work but you would have never know they were struggling getting people on the ground to do the work. Reception staff were at the restaurant and they were working like mad to make sure our stay was still one where the normal friendly service standards were maintained A great team~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_471229871~“Work trip”~I regularly use the Brisbane International - Windsor as my hotel of choice for work trips. The staff are always very friendly & helpful, the food is good and the rooms are clean & comfortable. It is also close to freeway access for travel.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_471225000~“A Small Older Hotel”~On a busy road but not much noise, Staff were very helpful. We would have liked the bar area to be open for drinks or coffee in the afternoon as we arrived at three and could not get a drink and as there are no places around in walking distance we had to drive to find a place. The hotel has an Italian Restaurant but not a great menu. The buffet breakfast was good. I found our room was small with older style furniture but for a one night stay it was OK.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_470684141~“GREAT accommodation.”~I have stayed overnight at the Windsor International on a number of occasions for work and have always found the staff to be very professional and welcoming. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet, even though the hotel is situated on a busy main road, road noise has never been an issue including any of the front rooms. The restaurant Va Bene is excellent, quality food and service in a relaxing atmosphere. Plenty of car parking and close to walking tracks, shops and hospital.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470213481~“Good alternative to staying in the city”~Usually when I go to Brisbane I go for work and so stay in the CBD to be close to the office. On this trip it was a family wedding in the Valley and as I drove to Brisbane wanted a place that was convenient and offered parking without charging an arm or leg. The Brisbane International is a pleasant small property, not to far out of the CBD. While not 'high-end' it was comfortable, with clean good sized rooms, decent wifi and good service. It is very reasonably priced and was god value for money. Perhaps the hotel was not fully booked on our arrival date (Friday) so we were allowed to check-in early (12.30pm) which was much appreciated as the wedding started at 3.30pm. All in all I would stay there agaon.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_469573676~“Quality in every way”~The bed was the most comfortable we had experienced in any motel/hotel and the staff were amazing - helpful and professional. The night we stayed had a power outage at around midnight and I have a medical condition that requires electricity and they were very helpful and concerned. I couldn't have been in better hands. The room was spacious and very clean. The price was very competitive and we will be staying there each time we go to Brisbane.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_469288147~“Really nice stay”~Stayed 5 nights with my 3 year old son. Room was very comfortable and clean.

review_464988446~“Very comfortable”~The place was very neat and tidy. We were woken by the house keeping as we slept in, he advised us to put on our do not disturb sign, but we never had one to start with. We then called the front desk advising them we were headed out and could they make up our room. When we returned, it had not been made up. The next morning, at 6am, the fire alarm went off. This is something that can happen anywhere. The staff were very organised in getting everyone outside. Didn't we all look gorgeous. Lol. There apparently was some machine that has malfunctioned somewhere. Better to be safe then sorry.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464956958~“Good value hotel and excellent Italian restaurant”~While it is out of the city, bus transport is frequent. The cost was very reasonable, the room very clean, though the bathroom was small. The restaurant cooks excellent Italian food, the crab gnocchi was brilliant. Used Uber to go to the airport, which cost half that of a taxi fare.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_464481928~“Great place to stay for a short stay in Brisbane”~We stayed in this hotel following our arrival in Brisbane airport and one day before leaving Australia from Brisbane airport. Very close to city centre especially if driving. Good facilities, nice rooms and great staff. The food at the Italian restaurant is also very good.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462506110~“Pleasant stay”~Used this hotel for a one night stopover on way back to USA. Quiet, good dining and breakfast on site. Would use again. Relatively close to the airport. Access via Uber took about 25 minutes. Seversl quick food places close to hotel.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_462139735~“Pleasant niche hotel”~We had booked on the understanding that it was an airport hotel. Ouch! $50 and $55 fares to and from the airport dispelled that notion. However, the reception we received was excellent. We arrived at 10.00 am, after having left The Bahamas over 30 hours before. We were exhausted. But the receptionist was marvellous and had us in a comfortable room within minutes. (Nothing of "you'll have to wait until 2.00 pm!) The bed was comfortable and there was free, fast wi-fi. The hotel atmosphere is quirky - but very pleasant. We did not try the restaurant but it looks elegant. We had a real problem with the electrics in the room, which all depend on putting your key into a slot at the door. Suffice it to say that the system did not work and we were not happy at having no lights in the bathroom, as we were making an early start. We reported it, of course, and I am sure it will be fine next time we stay - as we shall, God willing. A recommended hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_461353619~“Always a good stay”~Good and friendly service without being in your face try too hards。 room very clean and very comfortable with good wifi.

review_460830344~“Business Trips”~I stay here for business quite often and I must say the customer service is outstanding, second to none. Rooms are clean and food is good. It is also close to the city. The only thing that I would mention for improvement would be the gym, however in saying that there is plenty of fully equipped gyms close by. See you all again soon.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459507159~“Comfortable homely rooms.”~Stayed here on a rushed business trip recently - excellent. The rooms are very comfortable with all that you could need - unfortunately wasn't able to visit the restaurant - maybe next time. The parking was a little tight but ok if you were careful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457986725~“Great stay.”~This was my first stay but won't be my last. It is a very nice hotel, the staff are very welcoming and friendly. Easy access to the city via taxi or a short walk to Windsor Station. Had a great nights sleep, free wifi is also nice to see, not the fastest internet speed but perfectly fine for web browsing and email. Only thing I would like to see is a loyalty program, for someone who travels for business every month it's a nice touch to get rewards.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456776319~“Stay in Brisbane”~We chose to stay at the Windsor on this visit as we had previously experienced good service and other family members have also stayed there. The service is excellent, easy and free parking, and good access to airport and other places of interest. On this occasion we were extremely impressed with the service from the dining room. We went in for breakfast after closing time, not being aware what time breakfast finished. The staff however immediately re opened kitchen and happily provided an excellent breakfast for four of us. The food and service was first class.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_456083214~“Simple and effective”~Have stayed here a few times now. Love the location and ease of access to the property. Cafes, grocery stores, shopping centres and public transport all near by. Clean rooms and friendly staff. The small kitchenette in the room also makes it very convenient. Will happily stay here again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_455764057~“Quiet and free parking”~Second stay here; this time we had the surprise bonus of a tiny kitchenette/cooking area; this was very handy as we enjoy making our own breakfast so really appreciated this. The value with free parking while still being a short distance from the CBD makes this hotel a good return choice.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455582849~“Perfect !”~I cannot fault this place. It was an extremely convenient location for the hospital. Only a short taxi ride into the City. The team members were amazingly helpful and friendly. The room was lovely - clean, spacious and comfortable. Obviously we would recommend this motel to others.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_451395007~“Great value. Friendly staff”~We booked a double twin bed room and were very happy with the room. It was a good size allowing us to easily setup a portacot for our youngest. All the staff were really friendly and helpful. The night manager helped us figure out the aircon for which we were really grateful! The only minus is the location of the hotel. It is not far from Brisbane CBD (and there are regular express buses) but it's in an area where there are no cafes or places to eat (apart from McDonalds across the road).~4~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445520745~“Excellent Location, Clean and Comfortable”~Very central to all things in the city. Rooms clean and comfortable. Front desk and cleaning staff friendly. McCafe across the road for a coffee in the morning. Excellent value. Stayed here before and will do so again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_444922959~“Clean, convenient and central to evrything”~We booked in order to be relatively close to the entertainment centre, then saw how close it was to the CBD so booked two nights. We had a ground floor room 116 which had high ceilings and view of a garden at the rear. It was pretty spotless, and an open shower bathroom was also very clean. The Italian restaurant was down the hall and I had a meal before the concert, and breakfast is good too.Reception was friendly and the entire booking process was simple and efficient. A great idea wa s reminder the day before with a menu attached. This is a sort of boutique hotel with free parking and we'll certainly use it when we go to Brisbane again. Central but no noise, however room 116 is perhaps not t he best one as it is right near the stairs and restaurant.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_443624183~“very quiet property regardless of the location”~stayed here of one night on business and was pleasantly surprised. getting there was a little difficult (major roads, no turning etc etc) but once in it was lovely. Underground car park, nice reception area and good lifts. the room was really spacious, with nice pillows and a comfy bed. the bathroom was a bath/shower combo and a little dark (also had the toilet behind the door?) but over all a great nights stay. Also dined in the restaurant for dinner, and the meal was great - usual in house costs (a little more than usual) but very accommodating.~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan

Household staff very friendly and their standard of work was faultless. Dined at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Both meals great value and the evening meal of pasta was delicious. To summaries a great stay, great location to airport, to city etc and great value. Would definitely stay again~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_443435559~“Pleasant Surprise !!!”~Had to visit Brisbane for a show with family recently & came across this motel through Trip Advisor. Great location with friendly staff & even better price.

review_443378474~“Always great ”~I've always seemed to stay here while traveling to Brisbane, the check in staff are always pleasant and helpful. The rooms always large and clean, with tea coffee facilities. The shower was awesome after a 10 hour drive. The only flaw and it's a small one and not the hotels fault, is that you need to be traveling the right direction to enter the premises. But a upturn later gets you there.  I'll always stay here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443006959~“Great Place with great staff to match”~What a great place to stay. The staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was ever to much trouble. We were part of a family of 15 over from NZ for a family reunion and the location was perfect for us . We had a double room which was great for us and the housekeeping staff must be commended as well as the rooms were so lovely and clean. The pool was well used in the heat by us all. A few of us dined at the restaurant and the wait staff were so friendly and accommodated our requests..and the barrumundi was delicious. We would all stay here again in a heart beat, thank you for looking after us all so well.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_442960928~“Around the 6th. stay at Bris. Int. Motel”~Our stay was a single night but this would be around our 6th. stay at the Bris. Int. Motel. Our initial room was 312, we took our suitcase to it and went and asked could we have room 315 or same style room, the Manager obliged us and we changed rooms to 315. The challenge of getting into the shower is still there, no hand rails and a giant step to get up and over the edge of the bath tub, floor in bathroom very slippery, take care here. The next was breakfast and I noticed this in several other reviews, it was cold, not warm cold I mean COLD COLD, when I mentioned this to the waitress the attitude was "Really", all we had was a good hot pot of tea, every other stay we have had has been excellent, the front office staff and the restaurant staff of an evening are champions, the double beds are excellent, other than that we were given a $15:00 credit (out of a $38:00 cost, expensive pot of tea) for the cold breakfast that we did not eat. From every other stay I am disappointed on this stay, it is not the Bris. Int. Motel that we are used to. Paul & Deann.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~3~nan

review_439996981~“Totally avoidable”~It is right next to a very busy road. The quality of the window is so bad that the entire night it was impossible to sleep. Even though they had many rooms available. They assigned the rooms with most problems to us. Even though the booking was through TripAdvisor. The ranking is very high but please note it is for their restaurant and not accommodation. It is deceptive. They were not marked well on Google maps. We had to drive around the block few times and then getting it Right.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439436091~“Very friendly and helpful staff”~We stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights on our way to Hamilton Island, the staff were amazing and went out of their way to help. We asked the hotel if they would be happy to keep some of our luggage while we went North to the Whitsunday Islands and this was no problem. We stayed one night on our return from Hamilton Island and again everything was great. We had two meals in the hotel in their Italian restaurant and everything was great. Will definitely recommend this hotel if you are passing through Brisbane.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_438944088~“I would stay there again. Definitely.”~The staff were such wonderful. kind and genuine people and that's to be highly acknowledged and respected.

The food was absolutely delicious! cant complain.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_434921297~“very pleasant”~We had a very pleasant 4 day stay at this hotel. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was functional but showing its age (still has a shower curtain). The air conditioner was effective and quiet - much appreciated as we left it on overnight. Relatively quiet considering it is on a main road. Morning peak hour traffic and motorbikes were audible (double glazing on the one small window would solve the problem). Very good location with a bus stop outside the front and 24 hour McDonalds across the road. Approx 700 metres to the train station. Reception staff were very pleasant.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_434891373~“Best Place In Brisbane”~I go to Brisbane quite often and this is my favourite place to stay. It's got a real old style feel to it and the staff are super friendly. It's close to the airport and only a short distance to the city. Their restaurant is also top notch, so at the end of the day you can really enjoy a great Italian meal.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434744180~“Suited our needs”~Close proximity to the Royal Brisbane Hospital was my reason for choosing Brisbane   International. Another positive was that we could cancel up to 24 hours before our arrival, without having to pay anything, if our plans had to change.  The one thing I would like to see is a hand rail installed on the wall at the end of the bath. Stepping in and out of the bath is very dangerous, particularly for people who are advanced in age, or have a tendency to be unsteady.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_434164799~“Very comfortable ”~Very central to my business needs. I loved the classic look and feel of the rooms. Timber furniture. Wow. Had everything I needed including limited cooking facilities. The free parking was a bonus. Overall just an easy place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433748111~“Pro's & Con's”~Checked in late - okay. Nice clean rooms. Older hotel. Wonderful showers missing a few items in the bathroom (shampoo no conditioner). Can have breakfast there, pleasant enough. Checkout gentleman was superb. I know I left my hair straighteners there as the only place I used them and did not want to pack them still hot. I phoned then next day but lady on reception said she 'couldn't see anything', did not offer to take my phone/email so a bit upset as I would have liked someone to say "I can ask the staff, let me take your contact details and I will let you know"~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_431526716~“Adequate and clean”~We needed a hotel that would be easily accessible from main hwy as we landed in Brisbane after 6pm when it was dark and would be daytripping to Philip Island and would be returning late the next night too. This was easy to find but not in a walkable or nice neighborhood, very commercial. I was traveling with a baby and this felt safe enough and they supplied a cot for an extra $15. The full size bed however was very hard and my husband and I had sore backs. The water in the shower would be extremely hot or very cold, no in between. The ac was old and noisy but the room was very clean.~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan~3~nan

review_424606364~“A lovely hotel”~I stayed for 3 nights to be close to work meetings. As others have said...the staff make this hotel. Nothing is too much trouble. They are dedicated to quality service and deliver every time. The room was comfortable (we upgraded to an executive room due to an early arrival). Our room had a kitchen and small balcony which was perfect for staring at the trees and the birds. We used the laundry on the last morning and left with clean clothes which was much appreciated. There are some great restaurants nearby. A thai one up on the road to the train station, about a 10 minute stroll. A fabulous gourmet deli down Newmarket Road. Well worth the 15 minute walk. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424532884~“Wonderful - as always!”~This was our 4th(?) stay at Brisbane International - Windsor. It's always our choice of preferrence for our last night in Qld before flying home. Everytime we stay here we are reminded exactly why it's our first preferrence! The front reception staff are friendly and welcoming - it's just like coming home! The parking is free, undercover, plentiful and well-lit. The room, as always, was spacious and comfortable (twin double for our family of 5). The bed was the most comfortable we'd stayed in for a few weeks! Previously we'd not had time for breakfast but we did this time and it was lovely. It wasn't the massive spread you'd get at a 5 star hotel but there was lots to choose from and the quality of the food was exceptional! Hot eggs, bacon, sausages etc, cereals, fruits, yoghurts, pannacotta, breads, cakes, slices, muffins, tea & coffee. The chef does an amazing job! We booked online direct as an online member and received a very good rate for bed & breakfast. I'm not sure what is normal but we were not charged for breakfast for any of the chilren (6 and under). The friendliness, kindness and high standard of customer service that we received here is sadly what is lacking in so many other Australian hotels. Thankyou to all the team for such a welcoming stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423721489~“Clean, VERY comfortable beds, good location.”~Good location - the male check in staff member was very friendly and helpful. The bed - so comfortable - really good! Parking - really tight in the undercover area we were parked in but would stay there again no problems. It was only a quick over night visit before we flew out on holidays so didn't look at or use any of the facilities.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_423647432~“I wish I could take this place with me when I travel!!”~I've stayed here over the years as I work in the RBH and other hospitals in Brisbane. Every aspect of the accomodations is excellent. Location: It's a short trip from the airport. It is not in the CBD but short cab ride away. About 300 meters from Royal Brisbane Hospital. Parking: well lit, undercover, close to entry and free. Gardens and building: interesting, peaceful, nicely manicured and blends into the overall architecture/ design of the building. The building is beautifully appointed, warm and welcoming with good traffic flow, easy to navigate around. The rooms: quiet, modern, spacious and tastefully blended with the furniture. Very clean, nice large tv, lots of power points, very comfortable bed, windows open if you prefer fresh air, AC is quiet, doors close quietly and automatically. No noise from adjacent rooms. Large and spotless bathroom with a tub and shower has ample hot water and the usual soaps and shampoos. Service was excellent and very welcoming. The price was very reasonable, in fact great value.  The finishing touch is the adjacent Italian restaurant Va Bene. One of the best I've been to in Australia. You'll love so don't miss it! I go there for dinner and breakfasts even when i'm not in town overnight! You'll love the experience there!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The staff, service and room were beyond excellent especially that we not on holiday. The motel is also just down the road from BRWH which was great for my husband who chose to walk to the hospital to visit me which saved on hospital parking too.

Only problem we have is with the bathroom knob that you fiddle with to either have shower or bath. For safety I ended up running bath for my son who has a disability. I used it and it would cut out in middle of shower or cold water would come through . In my sons' case hot water was hard to control. I do hate these things. When renovating put two sets of taps in. Rooms do need to be updated but confortable and handy to my family and getting into city.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_418272460~“Great location and room”~We stayed here with our 2 children and got a twin room (2x double bed). The room was spacious and modern. The location was great as it is a good distance between the city and the airport. Although it is close to a busy road our room was very quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this place.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_417232007~“Enjoyed our stay”~The Brisbane International - Windsor was a great place to stay for a night to watch the Rugby. Husband and son have stayed before for the same reason so we came back. Good value with a special that included a buffet breakfast. Only complaint was the room was quite cold and being Spring still the thin cover was not enough. Having said that there is an air conditioner and extra blankets in the cupboard which I used and wished I had gotten out of the cupboard BEFORE I went to sleep. The breakfast was lovely but my husband mentioned that the pancakes tasted a few days old. Staff were excellent - very friendly and professional.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_416804915~“Clean, quiet room but don't expect much from the restaurant.”~I stayed here because it was closer to where I needed to be for work than many others. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. My only two issues were that the restaurant closes for dinner at 8.30pm (although I couldn't see where that was mentioned anywhere) and at 8.35 the kitchen was already packed up. After then they only offer pizza and there are no other options I could see. You also have to close the bathroom door when showering or running the bath as the steam generated sets off the smoke detector but then you cannot see anything in the bathroom. The free unlimited wifi is a great bonus. I would stay here again as its close to work and the airport but I'll also look at trying other options in the vicinity.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416273090~“i regularly use this hotel”~Great people, great service, clean rooms, good location.  This hotel is a little old has a very nice restaurant... but the best part is that people remember your name when you walk through the door.  As a frequent traveller I love this.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_406023354~“Great amenities”~Loved everything about our stay. Ticked all our boxes: Free fast wifi. Free parking. Air con. Fridge. Microwave. Huge spacious room. Comfortable beds. . Very quiet. Great area for bikeway/walks. Friendly staff. We were upgraded to King room no extra cost. $260 for two nights for husband and me. We didn't partake of Va Bene restaurant as the cost would have busted our rather frugal budget!! But we managed to Self cater very well! We will be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_405449016~“Accommodation that suited our neeeds”~We wanted accommodation close to the Ekka and this hotel offered a reasonable deal,  The room was clean and a good size, the bed was comfortable, unfortunately the walls are thin and we had kids on both side that screamed and played up so that was the only real annoying thing, the front staff were very pleasant and professional, I would stay at this hotel again maybe next year when I go to the Brisbane show...~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_402233950~“Great Property - Close to airport”~We stayed at the Brisbane international hotel on our last night in Australia. We were greeted at the front desk by a fellow Canadian who was extremely helpful. The rooms were nice and the hotel was a great value. Would highly recommend it.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_401931648~“Just like the pictures”~I stayed in a few places in Australia and most of them the pictures were photos hopped so the actual rooms were not recognisable. Not th case here. Nice big comfortable rooms. Only comment was that the Web page said it was close to the train station. I got the airport rather than a taxi and got lost. Best bet is to get a taxi from airport. Also excellent WiFi. Not limited.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_398273672~“Good place to stay while discovering Brisbane!”~We needed a place to stay while we discovered Brisbane for few days and this place was perfect for us! When we wanted to arrive to Brisbane a day before we had booked and asked if we could change our booking they were very helpful and responded quickly! The room was nice and classy with very comfortable beds and quite big TV. Amazing value for the price for four of us and the people in the reception were really nice and encouraged us to use the free WiFi all we want and it worked without any issues! The parking was free and covered and it was perfect for us also because we were travelling with two cars. The city centre, bars and many attractions we wanted to see were only a short taxi ride away!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_395981078~“Great old style hotel experience”~The Brisbane International Windsor is a great old style hotel, in both building and service. Extremely friendly and helpful staff, nice rooms, great resteraunt, good extras like free fast WiFi, close to city, and in my case work. Importantly the price is more than competitive especially seeing how close to down town it is. Overall a good experience and worth a try nex time you are in Brisbane on work or pleasure.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_395633652~“Good visit BUT. .”~Stayed here for 4 nights in early July.Enjoyed our visit.When I picked up the room key at reception i was asked for me Visa card as security..said I wouldn't be charged.When we got back to NZ I find I've been charged for our 4 nights stayed. My partner booked the hotel assumed would go on his Visa. I think this is dishonest & am not happy about this charge going on my Visa with my authority.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_391283568~“Affordable and Tidy.”~I enjoyed my stay at Brisbane International - Windsor. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and tidy. The price was affordable and the atmosphere was nice.  The motel itself was within walking distance to plenty of bus stops and the train station, making my trip even more convenient.
