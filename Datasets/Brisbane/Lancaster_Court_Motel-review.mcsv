review_467912873~“Great value good location”~On a 1 night business trip and needed accommodation in this area. Older style motel, very clean and owners extremely pleasant and helpful. Room has microwave, toaster, jug, basic crockery and cutlery. Pub and several takeaways close by. WiFi was not great but serviceable, similar to most motels in this category. Located on main road but noise was not a problem. Highly recommend for a business trip or a 1 or 2 night stopover.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan

review_467110605~“Did the Job”~We went to Brisbane for a concert at the Gabba, worked out really well, the bus goes right past the door. Rooms are fine, not luxurious but you are not paying much either. The location is very close to take way food, chemist, and hotel with drive in bottle shop. So you have all you could need. The hosts were really friendly and have a sense of humour.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_465175330~“Attending Concert at the Gabba”~Affordable, clean, comfortable amenities, A/C was lovely and cool. Welcoming owners who were personable and helpful. Central location easy walk to public transport, dining options, pharmacy, service station. Wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the pool and outdoor areas but we will have to do this next time we stay. We will definitely choose to stay here again. Thank you for your hospitality.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464931367~“In Brissy to see Adele”~Came across the Lancaster Court Motel when looking to stay in Brisbane to see Adele. When I first saw the price for the night (only $134) I didn't have great expectations. How wrong was I. When checking in I was greeted by 3 well mannered and smiley youngsters. When the owner came to the reception I could tell where they got their manners from. He was very pleasant to deal with. The room itself was spacious and exceptionally clean. The beds were so comfortable to sleep in. The hotel was a 10 minute bus ride to the Gabba and an $11.00 taxi ride back to the motel. No need to worry about food outlets as there is a Subway, Hungry Jacks, KFC, Sizzler and Woolworths within 100 metres. We will definetly be back. Congratulations to the owners for providing great customer service and a well presented establishment~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_458772659~“Escape from the heat”~Booked a room here at the last minute to escape the heat and what a treat. Pleasant greeting at reception who gave us some real milk for our evening. The room was very pleasant and spacious with a very comfy bed and sitting area. For a relatively low cost I'd highly recommend the Lancaster!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_435221054~“another quiet economical sleep in Annerley”~Have stayed three times. Easy to find. Easy access to Brisbane train line and near main roads that link to city and suburbs. Each time had room upstairs, on the far back wall, away from the main road. Room quiet enough a good sleep undisturbed by traffic. Air conditioner very effective in Brisbane heat and humidity. Nice morning walks to The Corso and UQ.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_430816735~“Friendly. Great value and comfort. ”~We had a quick over night stay before an early hospital appointment. The staff were very friendly and even though we arrived close to the cut off time for food being served, they waited for us to order. The food was very good value for money and tasted good. The room was clean and comfortable and had a microwave which was a bonus. We will be returning.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427087171~“Excellent find!”~We recently spent a night here and will definitely be going back :) The managers have a lot of pride in the cleanliness of the motel and they are very welcoming. Our stay was relaxed and quiet -- will definitely be going back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425520910~“Great motel and location”~We have stayed at the Lancaster Court twice now. It is in a great location, handy to Woolworth's and fast food stores and the rooms are very clean and tidy.. We will return to the Lancaster Court Motel when we need to stay in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422261881~“Lovely!”~Great hosts, so accommodating to our requests, and really friendly too! I'd booked a double room for travel with my 15 year old son, and rang to see if it was possible to change. By the time we checked in, Judy had moved things around so that we had more than one bed :-) Beds are comfy and firm. The location is ideal, close to the city and public transport, and for us, a short walk to the venue for my son's sporting competition at Yeronga. Their motto "country hospitality, city convenience" really sums them up well. We will definitely be back!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_420344941~“Scrupulously clean, experienced, professional and friendly managers and staff”~I meant to book this motel last time I stayed in the Annerley area but booked another motel by mistake, (see previous review). This couldn't be more different. It was clear on arrival that it is managed by experienced and professional managers and staff. The garden and pool area were tidy and very well maintained. Checking in was easy and we were met with a genuine and friendly welcome. We requested and were given a ground floor room. There was undercover parking right outside our room. The room itself was scrupulously clean, spacious and the furniture and amenities were in good condition and repair. Dinner was available and reasonably priced, other than that there is a supermarket across the road and although there are several cafés within walking distance, in the evening there were only fast food chain outlets open. I'd stay here again without hesitation and recommend this motel without reserve.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_419661134~“Great location”~Located in a good position if your need is a choice of 3 large hospitals, close to the city for business, easy access to the Airport.  There are numerous places to dine that are very close too.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  We didn't hear any traffic noise from up stairs.  Simply a pleasant place to stay with delightful hosts.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419328040~“Ok ”~A place for a few nights. Its not a big place with a bar and 3 restaurants. Prices are reasonable. Staff or management are really helpful. Most guests come back again and again. I have been there twice snd have liked my stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414744410~“Clean, homey, friendly, compfy and convenient!”~The welcome was genuine and sincere. Room was very comfortable, clean, and homey.

review_403915706~“Make Lancaster Court your first choice!”~An unassuming motel from the road. Inside you will find friendly staff, great home cooked meals and excellent clean facilities.

review_394650726~“Very clean but noisy.”~Stayed one night the room was exceptionally clean could not fault in anyway. The room had everything we needed.  The most annoying problem were the guests themselves. No respect for other patrons. Noise levels were totally unacceptable. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390896857~“Excellent value”~Great location with many choices for eating. 10 min walk to the train station. The staff are extremely helpful, appreciated fresh milk to have with my coffee. Rooms are large with convenience of toaster ,microwave. With undercover parking and outdoor pool. Although its a busy road, traffic noise is not a problem it is well insulated. . Thank you Judy and John for always making my stay comfortable.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_390329895~“A Nice motel with unusable 'free' WI-FI”~To be fair this is a friendly and clean motel that provides all you would expect in accommodation and the homely set of meals that are available, however even if they had to charge extra i would pay to have a decent wifi or internet connection. The response most of these motels to the poor wifi connectivity is 'we can't do anything about it - open the door of your room or go outside'!!! I am wondering if the poor connectivity is in part due to their fear that residents will suck up all their data capacity - if so there are ways to address this problem rather than offering a poor service.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_388855973~“Made to feel at home”~My family and I have stayed at Lancaster Court approximately five times over the last ten weeks. Judy and John made us feel welcome every visit, and even kept us in the same room each time so it would feel like home. Their motel is kept very clean, and little touches like fresh milk offered on arrival for a cuppa made us keep coming back. Woolworths and various places to eat are in an easy walking distance. And it is an easy trip to and from the airport. We would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_384700992~“Old but clean and noixy”~This place is old probably 70s build and hasn't had much done in the way of renos that I can see! Check in easy friendly too. Upstairs room quite clean except bathroom bin hadn't been emptied. No biggie.  Flat screen telly but it's small. No blankets on beds but in cupboard  With the constant traffic out side it's very noisy and woke me throughout the night.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382606467~“A GREAT PLACE TO STAY”~This is a great motel only 20 minutes from Brisbane city. The buses are at the door, as is Woolworths for meals, many restaurants and shops. The owners are great and the rooms spacious and comfortable.They serve great meals also at the motel. I have been staying here 3 times a year for 8 years and the service has never changed. I would recommend the Lancaster to both solo travellers and families.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_380423612~“Fresh and clean, quiet and safe, very handy -- Just right”~Look, she's little old and jaded, but beautifully maintained and ultra fresh and clean! Wife and I appreciated the help from managers and the welcome big room on arrival. Positioned so close to Hospitals etc, we found it very good value and very comfortable at same time. Appreciative of free wifi and local knowledge of management~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_377873726~“Friendly and welcoming”~This motel is a quiet oasis in Brisbane. Despite being on a busy road it is quiet and private. The rooms are a good size and very clean with comfortable beds. It has a really nice courtyard with outdoor furniture to relax and read a book, have a drink. The couple who manage it are friendly and really helpful. There is a small swimming pool and grass area. Internet is available. There is a kitchenette with a microwave but no stove. The only negative was a lack of comfortable seating in the family room we were in (4 of us) but this is the norm for rooms like this. We would definitely stay there again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_376025386~“top recommendation”~We found the room was superbly clean and fresh with very comfortable bed. The managers were friendly and accommodating. We stayed overnight as my husband needed surgery at the PA hospital and we had to be there at 5.45am. It is only a very short drive to the hospital though during the day there's a bus route close to the motel. If we need to we will definitely stay there again. Thank you Judy and John White~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_375663212~“Accommodating Friendly Motel”~Made a very spur of the moment trip to see my dear friend losing her battle with cancer. Arrived into Brisbane in the evening and as soon as I turned my phone on I had a lovely message from the motel informing me that the reception closes at 8pm but they will stay longer if I needed. Motel is half way between the airport and where my friend is living and not very far from the CBD. The staff were very helpful with directions and locations and everything else I needed. Home cooked breakfast was yummy. Surprisingly the motel is very quiet considering it is on a main road. The room is spacious and very clean and had everything I needed.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_365539536~“Awesome slice of comfort and hospitality”~Even though I booked through a hotel website I called to ask for a ground floor unit and was greeted by the kindest voice. John sorted out my needs, including my dinner. I'm a little fussy so I was pleased that had Atlantic salmon on the menu. I arrived tired after work (7:15 pm) and greeted first by John's wife, Judy. Such a welcome is rarely given these days I'm sad to say. They were wonderful. My dinner was brought to my room and I thoroughly enjoyed my home-cooked meal. The room was spotless and spacious. A surprise balcony looked onto trees that gave complete privacy. All the little extras are there plus some. The kitchenette was well-equipped with generous amounts of tea and coffee etc. I don't fully recommend a place easily but this is up there. Yes it's on a busy road but it did not affect my sleep. Thank you for your personal touch John and Judy. Keep up the great work.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_363287416~“Great freindly motel”~What a great place to stay in Brisbane. it was very close to the CBD but far enough out not to have to worry about the traffic. The owner could not have been any more help full and nothing was any trouble. We really appreciated the email we receive before we arrived welcoming and they where looking forward to help us out. We will stay there again when we visit Brisbane again. Highly recommended.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_362156207~“One night stand”~What a lovely refurbished motel. Comfortable bed, very clean room and inexpensive, generous meals, home cooked. We were so pleased with this establishment we are recommending it to friends, as we all need to stay in Brisbane quite often. Easy access from the Bruce highway and close to the PA & the Women's Hospitals we thought the location excellent. WiFi & Cable TV were a bonus, a pity the TV set was a little on the small side.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_359215140~“Excellent customer service”~We arrived on Good Friday to find that there was little open for dinner. We had planned a catch up with family new to the area from overseas, who didn't realise we would have limited choice. Judy and John went above and beyond, keeping the kitchen open way past closing, and on a public holiday. We ended up enjoying a fabulous family dinner by the pool.  The rooms themselves are clean and tidy and a personal favourite, no dirty old bedspreads!~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_353193921~“Great value for money”~For a three and half star motel we were very impressed with our one night stay. Refurbished clean rooms with everything needed.

review_349552613~“Overnight visit”~We stayed one night on the night 19 February 2016 our daughter was moving to Brisbane for Uni and the motel was situated in easy distance. We had two car loads of gear the managers were very accomodating of us and there was no problem with accomodating both vehicles. The food was terrific and reasonably priced. They were great in preparing food for my husband who arrived very late. The court yard area was a great spot to sit. We found fantastic company from other travelers sharing a chat through dinner.  The room was quiet, pleasant and clean. We enjoyed our stay and will go back without hesitation~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_348991724~“Good Old-Fashioned Motel”~I don't stay in suburban motels much so maybe they're all reminiscent of times past? This was a delightful place and felt like it was straight out of the 1970's - but in a very good way!  The room was fresh and modern but there was something classically old-fashioned which was actually very comforting. It has everything you need and the receptionist is so friendly and helpful (maybe she's the owner?) The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pool refreshing and I'd highly recommend the place and the location.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_347492293~“Extremely Friendly,Convenient, Clean & Comfortable”~A 3 night stay. My husband had an operation in Greenslopes Hospital. Took me 3 minutes to drive over to see him Day & Night from the Motel. The Managers were incredibly friendly & the meals they prepared for me (breakfast & dinner) were superb. The room itself was picture perfect. Impeccably clean & comfortable.The courtyard was very comfortable with a very friendly atmosphere. I couldn't of asked for anything better. I will definitely be returning & will recommend to friends of mine travelling south in the future. MANY THANKS.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_345733531~“Comfy Bed, great pool.”~2 night stay, the room was clean and comfy. Hungry Jacks across the road, Subway, Woolworth's 100m down the road. Although this motel is on the very busy Ipswich Rd we heard no road noise in our room, apart from the odd siren. My one criticism is the TV was so small you need binoculars to see it properly.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_340783668~“Convenient and comfortable”~Booking was easy, at short notice - we were attending a funeral in Brisbane. Very pleasant to deal with, room was comfortable (not new and fancy), quite adequate for what we needed - and not wanting to pay top dollar, this was very good value. Breakfast was good, and noticed there was a nice little pool, even though we did not have time to use it. Parking under cover was convenient. Would stay again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_338282733~“Friendly service, comfortable clean accommodation ”~1 night stay to take my kids to the Brisbane International. Very friendly service. Clean rooms with nice comfy beds. Close to shops and public transport. Also only $12 for a taxi from here to the Qld tennis centre. The pool was lovely and refreshing after a hot day/night at the tennis.   The only suggestion I would make is that some milk in the fridge to make a cuppa after a big day would be nice.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_324319770~“Great suburban Motel”~I took my aged mother to Brisbane to visit her sick brother. The Lancaster Court is close by her brothers house. I was concerned it was on a busy road but thick, well kept hedges, the driveway and car parking spaces were an effective buffer for the traffic noise. It is only a short distance along Ipswich Rd from the end of the airport link and tunnel so dealing with traffic to get to and from the airport was easy. The rooms were much larger than what most city hotels offer. The linen was all in excellent condition, the rooms clean and the beds comfortable and you could actually  set the air con to the temp to what you wanted. The staff were pleasant and helpful and it is very close to local shops Good value for the money~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_319701967~“Not able to take up booking”~I was impressed with the prebooking service with confirmation emails before and friendly service on the phone when I booked. However, when I arrived, I found that there were steps up to the office and to the rooms which were too big for me to step up with no railings to hold on to. The lady from the office was helpful and cancelled my booking for me and suggested alternate accommodation.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_314944602~“Nice and tidy motel with friendly staff”~I stayed for 2 nights with my wife in this place, nice and friendly staff. The room is quite clean and tidy. The location is just 10 minutes away from the city area, which is fine because you don't experience too much traffic in this area. We arrived after office hours and the hotel staff gave us a clear instruction on how to collect the key etc..So far it is a pleasant stay. They have a small swimming pool which I think is quite average. The only thing which is a bit inconvenient is you can't get any wi-fi in your room. You need to go to the open space at the second storey in order to get some signal. I personally have a hard time with the bathroom towel, I think it is made of cotton or wool (I'm not so sure), so it leaves a lot of threads around the room. In general a nice place to stay, a good experience for me and my wife.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

Its location is very good, close to cafes, Woolworths and shops. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable but the WIFi only worked occasionally. It was great value for a motel only 7 km from the city centre.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

Less than 3kms from Greenslopes Private Hospital and close to the Princess Alexandria Hospital. Well thought out communication methods to provide room service. Beds comfy and firm.
