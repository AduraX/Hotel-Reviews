review_437935731~“Fabulous friendly staff”~Hi The friendly helpful staff made such a difference to our holiday stay here at Brisbane. The hotel is situated in such a busy central location, with this in mind it astonished me how the staff go out of their way to help! I have been touring the East Coast of Australia in my high top camper ;) and can highly recommend a visit here! Thanks again D Connely and Rheya :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383252915~“Beautiful”~Wow, when you walk in, it's grand!! You're met with a sweeping staircase and grandeur. Mood lighting, large floor space and plenty of tables. Out the back is the restaurant which is also large with indoor or outdoor undercover semi enclosed eating space. Food was exceptional. Plenty of Gluten Free options. Will definitely be back here.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_371318278~“Best pub grub I've had in Australia!”~I had the orange roughy (pearl couscous, roast veg, macadamia) for $20 and my husband had the beef brisket nachos for $17. Absolutely the best quality and value that I have had at those prices. Beautifully cooked, and the flavours were perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_345054444~“Dependable - good beer and food”~My wife and I ate at The Transcontinental last night.  The beer selection is very wide ranging and I found a number of decent brews to keep me cool. My wife was more than happy with the house Sav Blanc she drank. Feeling in the mood for simple but comforting food, we both selected the lamb sausages from the ample menu. They were delicious, and came with salald, mashed potatoes, and gravy - and it was all very well presented. The meal was excellent, and very good value too. Recommended for food and/or drinks.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_334535040~“Crowded but put out the welcome mat for us old guys; appreciated.”~Went to The Trans for a few drinks and lunch. The beer was cold and plentiful, served by bar staff who knew their business. In spite of the pre-Christmas crowd staff found us a table. Lunch was excellent, served hot. Food staff are friendly and happy.  We'll be back.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_286009007~“Cool craft beer bar”~Since this place closes relatively early (which is fairly common in the Brisbane CBD) it took me a while to get around to visiting this pub, namely because it would either be too early, or too late. However when I was walking past on my last night in Brisbane I discovered that it was open, so we stepped in for a drink. It wasn't all that fantastic, but it does have a pretty decent craft beer bar. There was a decent selection on tap, so I have a hard time choosing. However, there isn't really an outdoor area, so that sort of put me off a bit. However it isn't a bad place for a couple of drinks in the afternoon.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_268164152~“A good meal for a good price”~took the whole family here for lunch. Staff were great. Food was good quality pub food and quick out. We enjoyed the atmosphere and it is worth the walk. Across the road from Roma Street so great position if you don't want to drive~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_256628545~“Great Caesar salad in the bar”~A real caesar salad with a runny cooled poached egg - can recommend it also their burgers are pretty good too! The service is efficient and friendly. We had sparkling water and this was served in large glasses - good value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_242326332~“Good food”~Good food, waited a little bit for it but they were flat out!! Worth the wait anyway!  Good value for money, disappointed on Sunday though as we went back for seconds & it wasn't open, so beware!!! Helpful staff, very clean throughout! Bottle shop attached also , so could be handy!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_222278507~“Great craft beer selection and delicious pub food”~The title pretty much says it all, we took advantage of having a room in the new Meriton mere steps away, to really let our hair down with a large party of friends and make a night of it. The live band played alternative rock covers and were really decent. The blokes in our party took advantage of the extensive craft beer selection as well as the bucket of 4 Coronas for $20 all night. We ate from the fairly small menu, and weren't expecting much, but the food was fresh and delicious. We'll be back as many in our party work around the corner, what a happy find!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_208799383~“A nice surprise”~I don't seem to get to Brisbane very often, even though i only live on the Gold Coast, so i finally decided to have a good night out there. A group of 5 of my girlfriends and I booked some accommodation right in the city. We asked the front desk for a recommendation on where to go for some warm up drinks, they gave us directions to the Transcontinental. I was extremely impressed with the interior ( i was later told that the venue had just undergone a very large renovation) We decided to take a seat at what seemed to be referred to as the 'main bar or craft bar'. The bar staff were awesome, they gave us some great descriptions on all the different beers they had ( i hadn't heard of most of them) and even let us have some little tastes before we made our decision. I decided to venture out and order a beer while my other girlfriends grabbed some wine of their wine list.  We decided to order some sliders after they were recommended by the bar staff and i must say, I'm glad that we got them!!! they were awesome! A two piece band started shortly after we had arrived and they were playing some classic acoustic songs. We ended up stopping in at this bar over the next couple of days that we were in brisbane. We tried out a couple of the other bars in the venue and experienced the same great service through everyone that we encountered. We are aiming to plan another trip to brisbane simply so we can work out way through that food menu, but if you need to start somewhere, start with the sliders!~5~5~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_195642957~“Great!!”~I didn't want to go out but we are staying across the road so we came here for our anniversary dinner. Awesome service, fast delivery of meals, bartender friendly and really helpful. I had porkchop with mashed potatoes, looked great tasted even better. Prices are good too, My husband had steak sandwich so filling he couldn't eat it all. Plus live music on a Friday night, come here!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_191280223~“Never had a experience like it in my life”~Was out at the Transcontinental Hotel last night for the Devil's Kitchen festival. Had organised for my best two friends to join me in what has almost been a decade since we last went out together as we have all had family commitments. We paid for some accommodation just up the road some we could all enjoy our evening of music and drinks without having to drive. Anyhow on my 3rd beer i had a tap on my shoulder from security advising that 'that will be your last beer for this evening". Now i thought he was joking and when i asked him why he said he couldn't say why and that was it. It was only 6.30pm in the afternoon and was dumbfounded. Anyway thought not alls is lost as there were many bands i was there to see and at least i could enjoy the music. Anyhow my friend went downstairs to go to the toilet and was told to leave the premises immediately. When we couldn't find him we went on to search for him and found him waiting outside and the security once again gave no reason for his ejection. Anyhow we just left no fuss and very disappointed and had an early night to bed. We are all still dumbfounded as to why? I have never caused any problems or been in any trouble in my life, and did nothing last night to warrant their crazy behaviour. SHAME on your staff....you really ruined three peoples night for no reason, maybe the staff there thought it would be funny to do that to someone..the whole episode make no sense and we are already laughing about the whole thing. Pity we travelled so far and spent all that money and didn't get to have a great night and experience.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_119384015~“Visit on a Sunday for a cracking deal!”~We stopped in for a few beers and to watch the rugby (Aus v NZ) apart from a very annoying Kiwi girl clapping every 2 seconds we really liked the atmosphere and layout of the bar area. Drink prices are reasonable (For Australia) and they have a wide selection of beers. What really sealed the deal for us was the $10 special of a choice of chicken schnitzel and chips, battered fish and chips or rumo steak and chips. I went for the rump steak (My first steak in Oz) and if they are all as good as this one then I will be a happy man. Very beefy and tasty, on a par with some of the best I've eaten at home. When you consider a beer is about $5.80 then this meal cost $4.20 which is quite frankly the bargain of the century. Well worth a visit.~4~5~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_89882215~“All talk no delivery”~Our recent Christmas party for work (56 people to attend) was booked at the Transcontinental. We were sent a menu for $25 a head and a wonderful menu it was with all the christmassy type foods. It was the menu that was the decider in making the booking. What we got on the day coudl only be described, at best, as horrible. It was nothing like what was on the menu previously sent. At no stage were we advised that the menu had been changed. When asked why we weren't getting what was on the menu we were informed that the chef had ignored the instructions for the menu. Hot food was cold and there were long delays in serving everyone present. There were apparently 3 or 4 christmas parties on the same day and there seemed to be only 2 wait staff to cover everything. Those poor girls worked extremely hard. I would have expected for a bit more care to be taken with such a large group. The drinks bill was waived and we weren't charged for 5 people who attended but what we got on the day was certainly not worth the $25 a head we were charged. Very disappointing and would not go back there again.~2~1~5~nan~nan~5~1~nan
review_6553632~“Best Value Steaks for what you pay”~Located opposite the Transit center in Roma St, Brisbane City, the Transcontinental hotel is a great place to have dinner and or a few beers. The prices are great. On Friday Arvos you can get 4 coronas for 20 bucks. The steaks are $5.95 which includes decent salad, breadroll, you choice of sauce (pepper, diane, mushroom etc). They aren't the greatest steaks but for 6 bucks, it is possibly one of the best value meals in Brisie and certainly better then Mc rip off's. Healthier to. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
