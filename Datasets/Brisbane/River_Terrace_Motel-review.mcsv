review_136570122~“Not so friendly”~We made some changes on the number of rooms a few times before the exact date. No confirmation and reply from the motel management on the room availability. When reached there, person in charge kept complaining that we confused them with changes. Location wise, not so strategic as the nearest ferry terminal is down below Kangaroo Cliff. Walking distance to story bridge; 10-15 minutes. The room is not sound proof as we can hear someone opening and closing the bathroom's door! If you drive; there's lot of free parking place at Pierson Street; which is located behind the motel. Recommend to stay other places in Brisbane City.~2~3~2~2~3~3~2~nan
