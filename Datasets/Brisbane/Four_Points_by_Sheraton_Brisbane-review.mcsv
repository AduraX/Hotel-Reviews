review_479302172~“Great location in CBD”~A modern highrise hotel in an excellent location in the city. Efficient and friendly check in and check out, Modern clean room at a reasonable price. From this location you can walk to shopping,restaurants, the riverside and ferries, across the bridge to the cultural centre, local parks and also access the city bike system. My only negative is that the building is surrounded by similar neighbouring highrises and the views are between buildings. The hotel has privacy blinds which is good. If you obtain a reasonable rate I think this is a good option for a couple of days touring the city on foot or bicycle.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_478840029~“Lovely stay”~I stayed at this hotel on Tuesday 18/4, I arrived around 7pm and check in was quick and efficient, the bed was very comfortable and I got a great nights sleep.  Free and fast wifi is available, Some hotels can be difficult to get online but I had no issues here~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478728798~“Great CB Option ”~Another Four Points gem giving excellent value for money. Centrally located, good hotel, comfortable rooms, valet parking available in room deals, very friendly and helpful reception staff. Good rates and deals via the SPG app or for walk in's ask what packages they have available, we got room for two, breakfast, valet parking and two free drinks for $160 a night. That option may not always be available but in comparison to other hotels of the same standard that deal is very hard to beat considering most will charge at least $45 a night for parking alone. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as was the young guy on the 30th floor bar. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478715162~“Nice Rooms to good Price”~The rooms are modern and nice and so is the bathroom. I had a room in the corner with view in two directions (window in the main room and in the bathroom). Everything was clean and the staff was friendly.  The hotel has a bar with nice view and good service on level 30. The breakfast is a standard buffet, as you will get it in most of the hotels in Brisbane. Will definitely stay in this hotel again. Paid previously much more for well known hotels which where not even half as good.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478150920~“Adequate stay - but beware the construction next door”~We stayed at this hotel for a few nights in mid April. While the rooms are small, the location is very convenient for getting around Brisbane. - The hotel is located a few minutes walk from Central station - which is on the AirportLink train line. It is also minutes walk away from the Botanical Gardens, Albert Street pedestrian mall and Brisbane river harbourside. - The hotel is very new and in a modern style. - Staff were very friendly and efficient. We were checked in a matter of minutes. - The rooms are clean. While comparatively small, all the essentials are there. There is only one usb port (as part of the clock radio). This seems a bit of an oversight as the hotel also caters for business travellers. - The room includes blackout curtains as the sun as intense in the morning (our room faced north-east) and was reasonably quiet as we were on a high floor. However, it is important to note that we stayed at this hotel during public holidays. There are construction site next door which (luckily for us) were not active during our stay. The noise level may be different if the construction works were happening. Overall, its an adequate hotel while staying in Brisbane and was particularly good value during our stay. However, the construction activity next door could affect your stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_477683995~“Comfortable and central”~Great hotel in very central location. Staff are friendly and service was exceptional. Rooms are on the smaller side but the layout is excellent and provides all you need. Larger rooms are available for extra cost but for business travel the standard rooms are very comfortable. Would definitely stay again at this property.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477633043~“2 nights over easter - would stay again”~My hubby and I stayed two nights over the easter break - room was modern and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom set up is very open with sliding doors- so if you are in a "new" relationship be mindful of you are comfortable with that kind of set up ( wink). Very centrally located and would stay again. Front desk staff were lovely. We used the yellow city bikes and walked most places- but I heard the car park cost $50- seems very steep vs the room rate- think management should reconsider this... a bit crazy. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476971362~“Easter break”~We stayed here over Easter. Our stay was enjoyable, the room was good and we enjoyed the breakfast. The location is perfect for getting around the city, parks etc. Staff were very polite and helpful especially the bar guy in sazerac and the manager of the eatery. Well done to these two guys and we will return one day.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_476240562~“Inadequate recognition of Starwood Platinum”~In the past, would have stayed here often as a loyal Starwood elite member but there is little recognition here of that status. Stayed here for convenience this time as we were dining at nearby Aria and Euro but there are so many options in town that offer either better design, better service or better value.  The rooms are smaller than any of the Meriton apartments which are actually cheaper. Got off to a bad start when checking car in as Braden was focussed on a piece of paper while I was lugging heavy cases to the front desk and there wasn't much service that could compensate for that.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_475726761~“Good for business”~Traveled here for business. Arrived early morning. Hotel was easy to find using GPS, even with the nearby construction. Checkin was good and went up to the room. I fumbled with the lights (I was tired) and could not find a DND sign but tried for a nap anyway. Did not realize that I selected both the DND and Clean Room switches so housekeeping was knocking on the door. Room was spacious. Went out during the day and there is a lot within walking distance. About two blocks away is a mall with a food court. Numerous restaurants all around. Walked the other direction about two blocks to the Botanic Garden/River. I just kept walking, across the bridge, and then through the other side, over another bridge and back. Before i knew it I had walked a very enjoyable 4-5K walk. Driving back and forth to work each day was a simple exercise. Note that I paid for the valet parking which allowed in and out access. The hotel morning breakfast was okay and a little pricey. So we ate at the restaurants within a block or so which was both convenient and a much better price/quality. For dinner, we again had numerous options that we had the task of selecting. Everything was great. The only challenge was the construction next door. I had a late start one day and was awoken by the loud construction. The other days I was up by 6AM, so did not get impacted. The gym was nice and a good size. Used it once and could barely tell there were 3 people in it. Cardio eqpt is on one side and the free weights are in a separated area. If I return, I would stay here again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475104006~“No pre-warning of 4am start to construction ”~First of let's ignore the construction for a moment. The hotel is small but modern. Rooms follow this formula too. Bed is comfortable and TV selection is also fine. Bathroom is spacious and functional although I did have 2 stained white towels, 1-hand towel and 1-bath towel - YUK! Lobby is like a shoebox and really is not acceptable for a "hotel". Staff was friendly and efficient but no warning about construction. Room is fine but nothing flash or inspirational. For dinner, the restaurant that is promoted in the lifts as being open until 10pm daily....isn't. The only thing open is a bar on top floor. Meals there didn't float my boat and anyway, the seating selection looked too impractical for dinner. Remember this hotel charges similarly to the Hilton and no comparison  Strangely express checkout does not include a copy of the bill. What am I signing for here???? Four Points, talk to your Westin cousins. They manage to do it fine. I don't know why you'd have a system in place that sets you up for failure and conflict. I regularly see little errors on bills. Now to the construction. It is NOT alright to place a note in the corner of the room advising a concrete pour will begin at 4am. Sorry. That is disgraceful. We're not talking about normal hours and some building noise, which I would totally get. We are talking about grinding, loud, awful noise during the time people are well and truly asleep. I have a headache already and it's only 630! For such a major disruption which you knew about, you should have made it very clear before I turned up and given me the choice. At worst BEFORE checking me in you should have warned me so I could make a choice. Not leave a note on the desk. Obviously genuine customer satisfaction comes last to Four Points.  This is now my 2nd experience at a Four Points and my 2nd poor experience. If it is a cheap and cheerful, then I understand there are compromises, however, this is not the case. Obviously Four Points is not for me.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474821671~“Not quite there”~It's too bad the construction next-door is prohibiting this property at this time. the staff was great, but acted like it was an inconvenience to be kept up all night. Sam at breakfast, so sweet and accommodating . Not enough attention to SPG members especially given all the points I have. Solutions too little too late . Property Location is excellent . according to them no good room location for quietness so depends on timing of construction .~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474374214~“Great Stay”~From the time we arrived to the time we left we received fantastic service. The views from the roof top bar are amazing. Queen Street Mall just a short walk away for all that retail shopping. Great stay will be back.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_474371617~“Great Girls Weekend”~We arrived before check in time but our room was ready so we were able to check in. The girl on reception was lovely and explained everything to us, offered maps etc. Our room was on the 27th floor and had great views toward the Brisbane River. Just a very good experience all round. The roof top bar is well worth the visit it has amazing views. We will be back~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_472957754~“Toilet views”~We are staying in the Four Points Sheraton in Brisbane and it has a great location, 99 Mary St. You can walk to many places nearby or take the bus. Our room was new modern and had great river, city scape, park, and bridge views. The toilet even has its own window view. There is construction next door to us but it was quiet. Great staff and extremely helpful. Totally recommend this hotel! 5 minute walk to central train station.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472356539~“Perfect service again”~I would like the thank all the team at four points again for an other great stay. Stayed in the suite this time was very nice. Plenty of room for a nice weekend away with my wife. Check in was great very easy room was ready and everything ran smoothly. If you are in Brisbane for 1 night or 36 nights ( that's how many nights I stayed here last year ) you can't go past this hotel. Close to everything it's a good hotel at a good price. Staff very pleasant when walking in and out of hotel. Will be back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471723775~“What you would expect”~Quick one night stop over when unexpectedly delayed in Brissy overnight. Staff all friendly and helpful room was a good size bed was comfy with pillow menu and nice linens not sure why I had a disabled bathroom but there was a shortage of rooms so perhaps why it was very clean and functional - room service menu was ok not extensive but sufficient the blackout roll down shutter curtains are a bonus not quite a Sheraton standard but very nice~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471581895~“2 day Conference”~Two nights in this hotel that included an on site conference were a pleasure. The staff at check in were friendly and helpful. We received a room upgrade and found the room comfortable on an upper floor. Room size was small, but the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was modern and well equipped.  We live in an outer suburban home and found this hotel in the CBD extremely noisy with sirens, street sweepers, rubbish collection and general traffic noise excessive. (Even though double glazed windows and on the 22nd floor it was noisy)  Breakfast was typical buffet style with espresso coffee available for extra cost.  Convenient walking distance from Eagle Street Pier restaurants overall this was a good hotel experience..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471436056~“Centrally located”~This hotel is centrally located in the CBD district. A person can walk downtown to Eagle Street Pier, botancial gardens or even across the river to South Bank. I can't say enough about Petrice she helped me organize tours and was very helpful. The buffer breakfast was ok. The breakfast consisted of bread, cold cereals, sweets and hot food. A person can also order an omellette. The Roof top bar has wonderful views. I found the room to be a bit noisy due to construction. My room had a view of the city. One thing I liked about the room was the darkening blind. As a platinum member I got a treat delivered to the room. I asked the lady for a house coat and she said we don't have any. So I called the front desk and we we have them so I got one delivered to my room. Guess what it had a stain on the collar. I did bring this to the attention of the manager. The staff are wonderful. WIFI is free if you are a SPG member. There is no pool.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_471392559~“Sheraton - really? Pay for wifi if you don't book direct?”~I stay here a lot - and it is an okay hotel for overnight business trip. But currently site next door is full on construction (not their fault) - but they have a mean, stupid, outdated wi-fi policy. Apparently because my business books through a third party, I don't get wi-fi. In 2017 at a marginal cost of 5c, this is insulting. On this trip, the Manager waived the rule (for which I am grateful) but it is a dumb policy. Sheraton should simply not use third party agents rather than punishing guests...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471258028~“Great staff, good rooms”~Stayed here for a night. I knew there was construction taking place next door as I read other reviews so I emailed the hotel and asked for a room away from the noise (i'm a light sleeper). To their credit, they accommodated with no issue.  The room is great, lots of individual lights, good pillows, comfortable bed with all the amenities. The only thing I would recommend would be a bottle of water in the room as it's become standard in most hotels now. It's the 1% that make places 5 stars.  The room was clean , easy to use entertainment. All staff were great and bubbly and it was refreshing to see smiles compared to some other hotels in Australia. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_470425574~“My Preferred Business Hotel”~I normally do not like a big hotel room when I travel for work, and the basic of my requirement is always a good bed.  Four Point have a good bed, well, at least to my preference, which is not soft but firm bed (not hard) and when they said Queen bed, they meant 1 single Queen beds and not 2 combined single beds. I used to stay in Caspri because I really like Caspri from different perspectives (see my review) but I kinda like Sheraton Four Points now for these reason:  1. Sheraton SPG Programme - Well, at least I can collect points and use them in future.  2. Good firm bed that suits my back and it is not formed by 2 single beds. 3. Good breakfast buffet - a wide variety of choices.  4. Good City View room via Floor to ceiling glass window. 5. Location is walking distance to Queen St Malls. 6. Alarm clock with the right iPhone 6 chargers point. The only draw back for me here is their gym room. No windows at all, like a small cell. Very miserable. Equipment is good though. Hotel includes welcomed drinks at rooftop bar which has a good city view, not sure if this is for SPG members only but then the membership is free. Definitely my first choice in future.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470171987~“Superb staff!”~We stayed for one night this weekend. During our stay my friend became feverish and ill.

review_468415171~“Missed the Point! But quite a good hotel!”~Felt like a pilot as I had to "go around" as I missed the entry due works going on next to the entry and my map app stating 400 metres when it was 200 metres! Other than that it was an easy book in with valet parking and free wifi. I point out it was a Groupon voucher( stating it was $350 in value....not, no breakfast or upgraded room was included...so buyer beware!) To be honest its not a flash hotel entry but the staff were great which is more important, but the real point of difference was there is a manned Expresso bar at the entry which is open at 5:30 am in the morning....spot on! Room was very well presented everything uni formally in place, tidy and clean. Liked the electric blind on the main window...nice! Not so the frosted sliding door( not to be confused with the frosted entry door to the bathroom) which may be a privacy issue for some. But room was well set up and I liked the fact that there wasn't anything in the mini bar. You can order what you want from reception. Makes a lot of sense for all! As for location it kinda maybe works(very close to eateries) unless you want to be right in the CBD! Overall an enjoyable stay and would recommend the hotel for those with a specific place to be on the edge of the CBD.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468414867~“Great”~Room was really nice but no view other than down to the street. Roof top bar looked amazing with great views over the river.

review_468034917~“Smashing”~What a very nice hotel. We stayed here for 3 nights a couple of weeks ago after Sydney. Not really knowing a lot about it and it already being booked as it came with the tour , we were really hoping it was better than the one we stayed at in Sydney which was awful and what a pleasant surprise we had, it was lovely, modern, clean and the staff were so helpful. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_467768764~“IBIS style at Sheraton prices”~I am not a frequent writer of bad reviews but sadly I can not recommend the Four Points by Sheraton in Brisbane. As the title describes, one gets the feeling of an IBIS budget hotel but at Sheraton prices; rooms are new but nothing special, construction across the road commences at 06.30, breakfast is served in a room without windows, all fruits are preserved but for the pineapple that was not ripe, staff that is not not trained to great you, valet parking at 45 AUD+ and on it goes. I am sorry but this is not an hotel to recommend to any other business traveler.~2~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_467603974~“Terrific location and superb service!”~Coming from the US we weren't expecting much from a Four Points. We were staying there on either side of a 7 day cruise. What we received was the warmest welcome - getting us into our rooms early - and an extraordinary staff, from the bellman to the concierge to the manager. They were genuinely concerned with our well-being and offered any tips we needed for sightseeing and restaurants. The hotel is conveniently located and only about a 10 minute walk to the river, Queen St. mall, and the botanical gardens. The rooms were generously sized and quiet. Being in Brisbane it is a high rise as are most of the surrounding buildings. There's a great view from the top floor bar. We will definitely stay there on our next visit.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467438382~“Smaller Standard Sheraton”~We stayed here as it came in a deal with a concert tickets, for this it worked out fine. The accomodation is quite close and central to the city and transport. Our Uber knew where to find us easily. The rooms are standard, but clean and well presented. There is nothing in the mini bar, we had to wrestle the ironing board to get it to stay up. Unfortunately when we were staying there they are building a new apartment block nextdoor and the hammering begins very early and very loudly. Parking is extra at a whopping $49 and the buffet breakfast was rather reasonable at $22. The pillows were very uncomfortable, not only ours but also our friends found this staying in another room. They have a cafe on the ground floor but unfortunately it is not open on Saturday afternoons or Sunday. When walking to the elevators you have to pass the front desk but no matter how many times we did this, the staff at the front desk seem to have much more important things to do on their computers rather than lifting their heads and making eye contact and acknowledging their guests.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467064260~“Cosy”~Found a deal on Groupon for one night stay, parking, buffet breaky, late check out (2pm) and bottle of wine.  We have found our experience to be great. Service was lovely and friendly, and breaky was pretty good too.  The only slight negative I would have, is the room was a little smallish. If staying with another person, I hope there's no shame between you two especially when it comes to using the bathroom. There's not much in the way of sound barriers in there.  Apart from that, the bed was comfy, pillows were ok but the water pressure in shower was soft.  There's a rooftop bar which was pretty cool too.  Construction going on around building but wasn't noisy from our room (level 18).  And didn't interrupt our sleep, or stay. Walking distance to heaps of shops and eats.  Pleasant stay overall.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466397989~“Find accommodation elsewhere”~As a local who has stayed in a lot of places in Brisbane, I won't be returning to Four Points at this location.  The rooms are standard and what you'd expect for a new building. The construction around the hotel has limited the views, reduced the appeal of the street, and increased the noise. I normally would write suggestions about what room to stay in, but I would humbly suggest that you find other accommodation in Brisbane. The service was lacking. This may seem unimportant to you if you are just wanting a bed to sleep on. But, the staff still need to process your payment, check you in and out, and clean your room. These simple tasks were incredibly difficult during our stay.  I am still following up issues with the payment. At the end of our 2 night stay we were out of pocket 4 nights plus bond ($860) due to staff instructing us that this was standard operating procedure. 7 days later, after not receiving the extra 2 nights plus bond refund, I contacted the manager. The manager's response was "I can't compensate you for any loss because the staff were following standard operating procedure." ... "It must be an issue on your bank's side". I then contacted my bank and they are still waiting for a confirmation from Four Points to release funds.~1~nan~3~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_466089837~“Brand New and Excellent location and style, but Poor and Expensive Parking Services”~The hotel is in a great location and is brand new, so it is very stylish and clean. The only issue was their valet parking. We paid $50 for valet parking per night which is extremely expensive but when we left, the hotel could not find our car. We waited nearly 15 minutes to finally get our car which made us late for our flight. The hotel did not even offer to refund the parking charge.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~2~nan
review_465663921~“Value option for downtown Brisbane”~Sheraton Four Points are a reliable value option. The Brisbane hotel is similar. Walking distance from Central Station (about 10 minutes, and I had two suitcases on rollers). Room was quite nice and comfortable. Ate dinner in the rooftop lounge and it was good. Stayed only one night and didn't use the gym or other facilities. They stored my luggage for four days while I was in PNG. I would stay again.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_465510686~“Acceptable - but soulless and lacking service”~This is a comfortable modern hotel in CBD Brisbane. A good location, which could be so much more if they wanted to be great. Price is too high for what you get. Probably full of SPaG members who are here for the points. Have been here four or so times now. Pluses - Location is great being downtown in the CBD. - Part of SPG (only one in Brisbane) - Modern rooms - but emotionless  - bottle opener in room - always friendly reception when I arrive Minuses - Rooms are a tad on the small side for what you pay - Poor food in restaurant on rooftop. I ordered the dips which I sent back as they were probably the worst thing I've had (that I didn't cook) in a long time. I don't think Ive ever sent a meal back before anywhere (ok... maybe an overcoooked steak) - Slow service. I asked for some cutlery ( there is none in the rooms...just spoons) and it took somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes to arrive (two add breaks) while my food got cold. I called twice to ask what was happen g and it was always someone else's fault. - Poor water pressure in the shower. One of those times when your back hits the soap tray because you are up,against the wall trying to get water. - modern rooms lacking character.  - currently next to a construction site which noise starts at 6:30~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~2~nan

review_463935344~“Good location, but left wanting.”~I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Brisbane for 3 nights in late February. I chose this property simply because of it's location to meetings that I was attending in Brisbane. Check-in time was listed at 3pm which I did consider late in the day to be checking in, however I managed to catch up with friends so it wasn't to much of an issue. Check in was fast and efficient and I was asked if I wanted to join SPG membership. I declined to join SPG Rewards for a number of reasons, however by the time I got to my room I had received an email welcoming me to SPG Rewards.  When I entered the room, I noticed how long and narrow it seemed. The bathroom is directly to the right and a small hanging cupboard to the left. The bathroom has an opening directly into the bedroom (of which I am not a fan of in any accommodation) and a small narrow window. The window looked out to the apartment building next door and if you don't draw the blind on this window the balconies next door could certainly see everything in the bathroom. The blind for me didn't work straight away as it was not sitting in its runners correctly however a short play around got it sorted and working. The shower is quite spacious however I found the water pressure was not quite as good as other accommodation in the Brisbane CBD. There is no mini-bar unless you specifically ring down and have one delivered. The bed was and pillows were very comfortable and I cannot fault those at all. The bedside tables however have an opening in them instead of drawers and I found one of them to be full of dust. The view from the floor to ceiling window overlooked another apartment building. There was a noticeable lack of black-out curtains however there is a button located next to the bed to operate an electronic blind. The noise from the blind was astounding and you probably couldn't hold a conversation over the noise until it was either fully down or you stopped it. I had to use the iron one evening and dragged the ironing board and iron out of the small cupboard. The ironing board was designed for people of a small stature as it is not very high at all. I ordered room service one night and it arrived on time and hot and was quite nice. I did not partake in the restaurant or the eatery. Overall the accommodation was pleasant enough, just a few small issues as outlined above.~3~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_463622645~“Would stay again”~Got a really good price on this hotel which included buffet breakfast. The hotel is in the CBD and close to waterfront, Queen's Plaza and South Bank. The room was small but comfortable. They are building a new high rise next door so it can be a little noisy if you like to sleep in. Their electronic black out blinds help with this. Buffet breakfast had something for everyone with extensive amount of items. Would stay at the Sheraton Brisbane again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_462777498~“Good Value - Great Location”~The entrance foyer and check in to this hotel is small so it can get pretty busy but once you're past that it's all good. The rooms are well appointed and pretty much what you would expect - comfortable and impeccably clean, but fairly small.  The views vary from room to room but most, at time of writing,include some kind of building site or other. There is a lot of building going on in Brisbane. This, however doesn't really impact on the quality of the stay. The Valet parking is efficient - breakfast is good value and the bar/ restaurant on the 30th floor is ok but a bit expensive and over rated.  This hotel is located in a great spot close to the Botanical gardens and River and there are plenty of other options for eating. The sun comes up early in Brisbane in the summer so don't forget the block out blinds - the switch is on the wall by the bed!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462166661~“Simply Fantastic.......”~On arrival at the hotel you are greeted by very friendly staff,the lobby is very small but this is not a concern.Check in was quick and I was allocated a room on level 15 (about half way up ).The room is very modern, comfortable bed, good size TV on the wall and a writing desk in the corner.There is a good size cupboard for one to hang up your cloths and next to the cupboard is a luggage rack / cabinet to place your bags on.The bathroom is very good,it had a walk in shower which was nice and roomy.The lighting in the room is very good and one will get a good nights sleep (I must point out I was there on Saturday and checked out on Sunday so the construction site for the new Westin hotel was not operating) . One negative comment is that the advertising in the lift for the bar on the 30th floor is a little deceiving.It lacks atmosphere, with the exception of one staff member I truly believe they need some urgent training in customer service. The breakfast is very good but again staff are not focused on service.The best staff are in the lobby, like my check in experience the staff were fantastic and helpful on the morning that I was checking out.  Location of this hotel is perfect,a easy ten minute walk to Central station, Queen Street Mall can be reached in five minutes and Eagle Street (for restaurants ) is also just five minutes away.  I would certainly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_462138607~“Great service & excellent location ”~Not the most luxurious but great for a one night stay in Brisbane where I was meeting friends. It's in the heart of the CBD, 5 mins walk to Queens Street for great shopping and 5 mins to the Eagle Street Pier and the bars on the river in the opposite direction. Access from airport is simple, taking approx. 25 mins for $30 return stopping at Central station.  I've been really impressed with the consistency of service at Sheraton hotels in Australia and Four Points was no exception. Check-in was quick & staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms are modern, clean, bed huge and very comfortable. Very well equipped with good hairdryer, adapters, tea and coffee etc. Breakfast was really very good. There was construction going on directly next to the hotel but the disturbance was minimal on level 3 where I was located. I would advise anyone considering staying to sign up for the preferred guest scheme. It can discount the room rate and the breakfast rate in the morning, if not included, even if only planning on staying the once.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461826608~“Good Business Hotel-GreatLocation”~Second stay in short order at the Four Points. Being a (relatively) new hotel the amenities are very good. Very nice, modern rooms. Excellent reception staff-very friendly and efficient. I left my diary behind and when I realised it was very little hassle to retrieve it. I will make this hotel my 'go to' for business in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_461239597~“2 night pre-cruise stay”~Excellent hotel, very clean, comfy beds, nice modern rooms, great location. Helpful, friendly staff. The bar on the 30 floor has really good views, nice for a night cap. If in Brisbane again would definitely stay here.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
