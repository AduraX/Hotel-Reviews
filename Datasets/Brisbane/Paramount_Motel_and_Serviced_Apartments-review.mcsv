review_434957929~“Paramount Motel, a great place to base yourself for Brisbane getaways”~I have had the opportunity of staying with Moira and Les at Paramount Motel on a Mon-Fri basis for the past 9 weeks. Dealing with both of them is not only enjoyable but they have made me almost apart of their family, if I have forgotten something or am possibly running late, they have always been easy to get in contact with and are always happy to help. On one occasion they also met me late one night when I'd forgotten my key. They are both a shining example of everything you could ask for in a host, which has kept me coming back week after week. Thank you Moira and Les.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_430453370~“Good sized rooms”~Have stayed here before on my last trip to Brisbane. The rooms are a good size and ours had a separate kitchen. Rooms would be improved with a refurbishment but their saving grace is that they are very clean and the whole place is tidy. I always like to stay in a place which has a pool when I'm travelling to Australia and am pleased that the pool is also clean & tidy. The pool was a welcome place to go to after a hot day out and there is a BBQ to use which was great. The managers are also very helpful and friendly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422647493~“clean and comfortable”~really enjoyed our room last weekend, had all the necessary equipment. The cleanliness of the room and friendliness of the manger was excellent. Really enjoyed the flat screen television. will definitely be back. Thank you~1~nan~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_422299028~“Terrific & affordable place to stay”~Stayed here for 4 nights, and very happy we were. Yes, it's an older motel/apartment building but the rate and location more than make up for its tiredness.  The managers were friendly and helpful, the apartment was as clean as the proverbial whistle, it was quite spacious and really comfortable. Had to do some remote work on this trip so the table accommodated the laptop nicely, the chair was comfy and a soft breeze through the window meant I wasn't too hard done by. The noise from the road wasn't too bad - certainly didn't keep us awake or interfere. Location was perfect, so close to the river and Southbank (which is brilliant), a stroll across to the city and Story bridge, and I did some wonderful runs each morning along the river and surrounds.  Has a pleasant pool to languish in, plus washing machines out the back (which cost $3 a load and you can hang washing on the lines in the sunshine). If you have a dicky knee and can't climb steps, ask for a unit on the ground floor (although we were rather fond of ours on the 1st floor). We'll be back to Brisbane and will stay here again. Highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_332516304~“Leisure ”~We stayed here just overnight with another a couple in 2 rooms. Great and friendly service from the time we arrived. The rooms were clean and had everything we needed. Great location as it was just down the road from our dinner at Riverlife and close enough to the city too. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_316442161~“Great affordable Accommodation”~My wife and I found Paramount Motel very comfortable clean and quiet . The Hosts Moira and Les were really nice and friendly and a delight to deal with. Great location very close to the Pinapple Hotel a couple of restaurants and major chain take aways . Nice and close to the Gabba and not far to the Queen st Mall.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_307690549~“Great place to stay”~The missus and I had a great time staying here. Very close to the city we only had 1 minor issue where there were no sheets on the bed but it was seen to straight away. The owners were very professional and a delight to deal with. Highly recommend! ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_278604051~“Very uncomfortable night's sleep”~We were in unit 17 which was clean and tidy with plenty of room, but the bed was rock hard, like sleeping on the floor and we both had a bad night's sleep. There was a Queen bed and a couple of singles and we were told that if we slept in any beds other than the Queen bed, we would be charged extra! I have never heard of that before, I thought we had paid for the room not the use of beds!!!~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_250405382~“Unassuming; value for money”~Fairly dated exterior and lack of shiny signs mean that you could easily bypass this motel. While not in the luxury class, rooms were spacious and clean, carpets were new and beds were comfortable. Décor is a bit dated in style, but everything worked satisfactorily. TV and air conditioner are modern efficient units. Tarriff was very reasonable. Location is ideal for someone wanting an overnight stay after attending a game at the 'Gabba or visiting the nearby hospitals. Parking is easy (not very secure but the area is generally safe). Pub over the road does good meals and there is a convenience store next door. Access to the upstairs rooms is via a steep staircase so would recommend the ground floor to those with mobility issues. Road noise wasn't a problem on my stay but assume the units at the front may have an issue. I just wanted an overnight stay - ate out and only really slept, showered and left so had no real call on service, but on check in, the managers were friendly and helpful~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_235464946~“Great motel and really nice owners”~In crontrary to most of the reviews here I found my stay really good, my partner and I really only stayed in the room of a night and were out and about south bank since we were so close all of the other time. Thank you for a lovely stay we will definitely be back next year!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_231943331~“Average at Best”~This motel has a tidy old kitchen, the bathroom is old but tidy. The bed was firm and good the TV very small, the couch was comfortable enough. Beware check out is at 10am, I'm normal used to 11am checkouts and I didn't read the fine print until 10am on the day of depature. Because of medical appointments in town I asked if we could extend checkout until 12, where I was told this would cost me an extra day. In the end I paid half a day extra. I didn't complain and have never been charged for a late checkout before. Also be aware the check-in is up to 6pm, but to be fair I was late (got lost in Brisbane), the lady called and directed me to the motel and opened up 15 mins late. The service was fine but how can I say not welcoming, the position close to town was good. The price per night was budget and more than fair. Saying that we would not stay again.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_229350063~“Ripped Off”~Dear All, I would NOT recommend this Motel to anyone. Its noisy, old (1970's decor), the shower does not work properly (I scalded myself), I had to fix the TV up myself, the room was smelly, I nearly broke my foot walking into the bathroom with an unmarked raised step. It was very very noisy, traffic, late night parties next door, crying kids, a very old and noisy antique air conditioner, and a very uncomfortable bed. I would not normally have mentioned this, merely put and shut up. However to add insult to injury, I was charged 25 dollars on my credit card, without my authorization for some glasses, 3 cups and a plate left on the draining board. In other words 25 dollars for putting a few pots away. The woman I spoke to got my back up by challenging my version of whats clean and whats not (I do know how to clean a plate). The way she carried on was of as if i had had an all night party and the walls needed repainting. People who live in glass houses should not throw stones, the MOTEL is CRAP, and the standard was only raised my me and my wife being there. Andrew S Gregory~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_221511439~“Pleasant stay”~Simple accommodation, neat and tidy. Owners very helpful. Would stay there again. I walked to both brisbane and the RNA show grounds during my stay, although public transport by ferry, bus and taxi available nearby.~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_221431963~“Enjoyable stay”~I enjoyed my few days here & found my unit a very generous size & spotlessly clean with a well appointed kitchen, large bedroom/living room area and a generous sized bathroom.Handy location to South Bank and CBD so even though I didnt have a car it was only a cheap taxi ride away from several places I wanted to visit. A great location for those visiting Brisbane.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_212137514~“Enjoyed our stay”~We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We found the owners to be very helpful, very happy to answers questions and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Good value for money. We loved the fact that there was a kitchen included, room was very clean and had plenty of space. A great location to visit Brisbane and other attractions.~4~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_206452240~“not worth it”~reading the reviews I can see where you would get the unfriendly owners from. They seem very uninterested and they do come off unpleasant. Location is easy to find. rooms are low range but what you pay for I guess. lots of room is the only plus.~2~2~4~3~2~3~1~nan
review_205505016~“Close to the footy”~Close to the Gabba at a good price. Would recommend it to others looking for a place to stay while watching the footy at the Gabba. The owners were very friendly and helpful. Good parking was included.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_193681088~“Not overly impressed”~Only read these reviews after having a not so great experience at this motel. Cant really comment on the owners as the last couple of reviews have both positive and negative as I didn't have much contact with them just checking in and out. You really get what you pay for at this motel is all I have to say. Alright location but mouldy dated rooms with a very unclean feel. I don't know how else to explain other then I didn't feel comfortable during my stay here. Rusty shower, mouldy smell and just not the best motel. Wouldn't stay again~2~1~4~1~2~1~3~nan
review_191292824~“Highly recommended”~We had a family wedding to attend in Brisbane. This place ticked all the boxes. Large rooms, full kitchen, great service and very helpful owners.

review_190997082~“Nice owners/great location”~Well we have to contradict the previous reviews. We found the owners very helpful and pleasant. It is an older motel but we found our unit to be spotless. The location was great for the couple of functions we had to attend. The free Wifi and parking was great as parking in Brisbane is very costly. We will go back there and also be recommending this Motel to family & friends. All we can say is the group who wrote the last reviews must have really upset the owners.~4~5~5~3~3~5~4~nan
review_187229410~“THE WORST!”~I would never recommend this motel to anyone! It is a dirty place run by a grumpy old lady! When we arrived at the motel we were asked to leave a $250 bond.. We stayed in our room over the weekend and made sure the room was in a clean state when we left! When we checked out the lady told us that we were getting charged $150 for cleaning, when we were told this we asked to see evidence of the mess we had left. Instead she locked the door and told us we were not allowed back in to have a look and mentioned that we were the worst customers she had ever had! On the Monday morning (9th December 2013) when we were leaving I realized I had woken up with rash looking bites all over my body which I believe were from the sheets and mattress protectors because according to the owner the mattress protectors don't get changed! This lady is a thief and has nothing better to do but steal peoples money!  I will defiantly be taking this matter further as the customer service was absolutely horrible!!!~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_187117356~“Rude owners, dirty motel”~We stayed at this motel over the weekend and I can honestly say it is the worst motel we have stayed in ever. The lady owner is extremely bitter and unfriendly. And the motel is old and smelly. We are not usually the group to complain so when we Checked in and saw How the room was compared to pictures we didn't say anything.. Or how the kitchen smelt like there was a problem With the drains and the shower was the worst shower I have ever used. At 9:30 the owners came By to check our rooms before getting our bond back and when we went to hand in our keys we were told we were loosing $150 each room.. So $300 all up for carpet cleaning and the cleaning of sheets and mattress protectors. We said don't these get cleaned anyways and we were told no only the sheets.. Pretty unclean. When we asked if we could be shown these carpet stains and extra cleaning charges that were $150 cost to each room we were told no that they don't have to show us and locked the doors! So they couldn't even show us what we were being charged for. Overall worst motel experience and I will never stay there again!~1~1~3~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_187116722~“Worst motel experience ever!”~We stayed at the paramount motel in Brisbane for a music festival over 3 nights. We booked 3 rooms for 14 people, 6 in 2 separate rooms, and 2 in another room. we were told we could drink by the pool each day before the festival, have music on etc as long as there was no noise complaints. We had no dramas, cleaned up each day before we left etc. only were at the motel for a couple of hours before leaving to attend the festival at 1pm each day. The motel was completely dead. There was only 3 other rooms booked as well as our 3 rooms. It's a dirty, old, smelly (drains), hot water doesn't last long motel. Paid a $250 bond, and on checkout were refused our bond back as we apparently had too many people staying and they had camera "footage" of us having extra people in our rooms; even though we didnt, asked to view the footage were told no. Then was charged extra for having a smelly room, told there was vomit in a room, but the manager wouldn't show us where the vomit was and locked our door so we couldn't go back in for photos. Have written a complaint to take this matter further. It is managed by an old grumpy woman and her husband. They have nothing else better to do then try and get extra money off people staying. Overall experience terrible. WOULDN'T RETURN, WOULDN'T RECOMMEND.~1~1~5~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_171956888~“Good for GABBA”~A large clean room with a separate full kitchen, cooker, fridge freezer. Bed was comfortable, TV with lots of channels. There was a laundry which was very cheap to use and a small pool. A bit noisy in the mornings as it was on a main road just up from the GABBA cricket ground. Quite a few restaurants and supermarket nearby which was useful. It was a bit far out from the CBD a good 15-20 minutes walk and a short ferry ride into the city. (Very odd that every other ferry was free, why would you pay the equivalent of £4 each for a 5 minute journey when you could wait 10 minutes and not pay??) Overall not a bad choice if you don't want to pay high prices in the city or are attending the cricket. The staff were very helpful.~3~5~3~3~4~4~4~nan
review_170064248~“No cancellation”~We booked for a business trip recently (we have stayed here before so nothing like a returning customer!!) and quite often do business in the area and would have considered booking here again - we had to cancel the current booking in hopes of deferring it maybe maximum 2 weeks - NO CANCELLATION policy - so Paramount are keeping our money but you guessed it - we will NEVER book here again - we are a returning customer and fully intended rebooking within the next 2 weeks but with a no cancellation policy - forget it!! Moral of the story : Check small print of money hungry motel before booking - that's one way to lose business~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_149156823~“Good Value”~We have just spent 3 nights here and the whole experience was wonderful, rooms very spacious, well equiped kitchen although a little dated, we enjoyed our stay. Les & Moira were a delight, we enjoyed having a daily chat with Les. We didnt have any problem with traffic noise (even being a weekend). We also enjoyed our swims didnt use bbq which was there for guest to use.We were visiting our son so had no reason to use public transport, but it is all very close by.. We did enjoy our stay and will be going back next time we go to Brisbane.. Thanks again Les & Moira for a great stay.. Great price and great place to stay..~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_142946986~“Good value, clean accommodation”~We stayed here for three nights on holiday and found the accommodation very good value and spacious. We rang the owner direct and were given a better rate than on the website and she couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. the room is older style but huge and clean. The kitchen is well supplied. The bathroom is very dated although well maintained. Each day the bins are emptied and you may change towels if you wish, the room is not completely serviced or beds made. There is no breakfast available at the motel although it is available just up the road at a neighbouring motel. The location is very convenient though a bit noisy at night. Our room was up a long flight of stairs - you may wish to request a ground floor if this is an issue for you. If you want modern accommodation then this will not suit you, however, if you want clean, large accommodation at a cheap price then you can't go past the Paramount.~3~4~4~3~3~4~5~nan
review_138738096~“Double check your room rate BEFORE you arrive”~While I don't remember booking through check-in.com.au for this room I will never do that again after a previous bad experience with another agency. I printed off the confirmation email prior to departing on our 12 hour trip which stated under inclusions that it was $155.00/pn for two of us only to find on arrival that we would be paying $185/pn for two of us. There was no other accommodation available due to the EKKA and a conference so we stayed. The receptionist was very unhelpful & whilst the check-in agency offered a discount on future bookings they both passed the buck between themselves & we ended up wearing the cost of an extra $120 for our four night stay which was made worse by the fact that my husband had stayed many times before & our friends were charged less for double the time. The place is locked up so that you have to go to reception [which is also locked] to get the pool gate unlocked in the middle of the day? Glad I didn't need to use any of the other facilities and glad I didn't spend too much time here. This motel is in a good location but that is all it has going for it and I will never, ever book here again. I also hope this is not indicative of the QLD tourist industry in general. Opportunistic greed!~2~1~4~3~3~3~1~nan
review_133806382~“Great location”~We spent three nights in this motel - the rooms were large and clean - we were pleasantly surprised... close to town with a great pub that does good meals across the road!! we will stay again.

review_121282110~“We were very pleased with our two night stay in this motel”~We had never been to Brisbane before so I was a bit worried that the location of this motel was not going to be convenient for getting in to the city. In fact it is very well situated with only a short walk to the end of the road where there is a spectacular view of the Brisbane skyline. There are steps down to the riverside and then a most enjoyable walk along the river to the Goodwill footbridge which leads across to the city. Brisbane was very pretty when we were there as the jacaranda trees were in full bloom .  We received a warm welcome from Moira who runs this very reasonably priced motel with her husband Les. Although the décor of the apartment was a little bit dark it was very spacious. There was a kitchenette with all the usual kitchen appliances including an oven. We did not experience any noise from the road, partly because the motel is set back from the road and perhaps also because we stayed over a weekend.  The motel has a communal laundry and there is an IGA express supermarket a very short distance away which, besides the usual things, sells hot pies and fresh bread.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_118812577~“Great place to crash!”~Not sure about the last review. We had a great time, slept like a baby after some recommended Riverlife adventures, pretty close too. The hosts here were the best an we will be back. :)~4~4~5~5~3~4~4~nan
review_117971491~“Terrible experience, incredibly rude managers”~The worst motel I have stayed at so far. We found the managers of this motel irate and incredibly rude. We stayed for a few days and the manager screamed like a lunatic at my wife on two occasions when we wanted some service for the laundry upsetting her and ruining our evening. I think this woman has some serious issues so I would strongly advise anyone to stay well away, that is unless you like Fawlty Towers. Also the room wasn't serviced each day and it was not clean with damp coming through the kitchen ceiling. They should pay you to stay here..~1~1~nan~1~nan~1~1~nan
review_88259197~“Great Hosts”~My daughter and her boyfriend stayed here twice. They went back the second time because of the location and the helpful and friendly owners.

review_82126556~“Spacious rooms but very noisy and a very hard bed”~This motel is in a location handy to the river and city centre, is reasonably priced and the rooms are large and well equipped. However, we stayed on a Saturday night and the road noise was terrible right through the night - there are busy roads on both sides of the motel. Our other complaint is that the room had a very hard bed and was not comfortable.~3~3~4~1~3~4~3~nan
review_64334572~“Fantastic Service from Friendly Owners”~A great place to stay. Centrally located in lovely area. Rooms are older style making them extremely spacious. Everything was spotless. Owners very obliging and helpful. Highly recommend.~4~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_62985300~“Our value choice for visits to Brisbane.”~We have used the Paramount for two, weekly trips to Brisbane in the last eight months, & will use it again next trip. We selected it for the location in our price range, and was very pleased with the facilities, cleanliness, & friendly service of the owners Les & Moira. The location is on a busy road,  but rooms are set back enough that noise was not a problem. A good convenience shop, & bus stop are very close. The Gabba & a Coles supermarket are a short walk away. Southbank, river ferries, & city are a 20 min walk, past Kangaroo Point cliffs, & a lovely walk along the Brisbane river.~4~5~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_62427662~“Great value, spacious, clean & close to the River & City Centre”~I thought I would write a review of this motel because the only ones here are so old and I am sure much has changed. Certainly the managers have changed twice since those mentioned in previous reviews and the current Managers Les & Moira couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful. The motel looks outdated from the outside but we were pleasantly surprised by the size of our standard unit which had a full kitchen and bathroom, so actually a 3 room unit. The interior looked as if it had been updated recently and although the bathroom and kitchen floor tiles were dated the whole place was very clean. We have paid much more than $98 at other motels and received less value. We found the 24 hour corner shop which seemed to stock everything incorporating a Subway sandwich counter as well as hot chickens, pies and pastries really good as it is only yards from the Paramount. There are also very good and cheap BYO Thai, Malaysian & Italian restaurants nearby and the Pineapple Hotel food is still excellent. We loved the riverside cliff walk to South Bank and used public transport preferring to leave our car at the free motel car park.~4~5~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_11123096~“Basic but OK”~We booked our stay early in the year based on the positive reviews on tripadvisor. Our experience didn't live up to those positive reviews but we certainly didn't have any problems with the paramount. The apartment was spacious and had everything we needed. Had we wanted to cook the kitchen looked fine, we were just too lazy to in the end. The decor is basic but for us on a budget and spending most of our days out it wasn't an issue for us. It's located near the river and a 20 minute walk to the Southbank with bars and restaurants. It's a fair walk into the city centre across the river or a 10 minute walk to catch a ferry across. Walking back from the Southbank or coming off the ferry there is a steep climb up to the hotel from the river though. As mentioned in other reviews the best thing about the Paramount is the Pineapple opposite which does great steaks.  It's not somewhere to go if you're looking for luxury but for a cheap base to explore it's fine.~3~3~3~nan~3~3~3~3
review_10188607~“Do not expect 4-5 Star Luxury”~We can only recommend this hotel for the budget traveler. After reading reviews on trip advisor we expected more - sorry to say we were disappointed with the accommodation. One "let down" was that there was no where to have breakfast early morning.  "We could not recommend cooking in the appartment" Cheap and cheerful - you get what you pay for and in this instance we most certainly did :)~1~2~3~nan~2~2~1~2
review_10100793~“You get what you pay for”~We arrived during a thunderstorm, at night and saw who we think is Wayne come nearly into the office while we were checking in, then leave. We had to carry our bags ourselves, up stairs in the rain and with my partner who has a noticeable physical disability got soaking wet and we thought that at the least someone may have offered to help us. We wouldn't necessarily have taken up their offer but it would have been a friendly gesture that we would have thought would have been appropriate considering the other reviews of the hosts.  Room was basic and at $95.00 a night you wouldn't have expected anything more.  Shower was a mere trickle for my partner and when he went to reception they replaced the shower head straight away. Not sure how the cleaner didn't notice the lack of water when the unit was cleaned. Toilet ran all night and when we said about the shower, the guy said he would fix the toilet while we were out. Toilet kept running for the next 2 days. In New Zealand at most motels, beds are made, this place says they are a motel and serviced accomodation, however the bed wasn't made while we stayed here, nor was it cleaned ie the floor, or dusted. You can't open the curtain as a sign says the sun will fade the furniture.  Remote was kept together by a rubber band. Even though it says it is serviced if you use their dishes, there is a fee if you do not wash them and put them back.  Location to city is not too bad, however if you have a car and you come from the city to the motel and it is peak hour, you will find it difficult to cross 3 lanes of traffic to get into the motel. We had to keep driving for 10 minutes just to be able to make a safe turn and then sat in the traffic for another 20 to get back to the motel. For those of you superstitious, there is a unit 13. My partner who booked it kept telling me it was cheap and cheerful, however I just found it cheap. There are quite a few hotel/motels in this area, and may be worth checking out before booking at the Paramount. Pineapple hotel across the road is great for steaks. Wagyu steak was delicious.~3~2~2~nan~2~2~2~2
review_8071815~“Great hotel for the price”~after seeing previous reviews we decided to try out the paramount hotel initially staying for 10 days but ending up staying 17 days. Majorie and Wayne are the perfect hosts, with the rooms being good and clean and worth every penny of the money, easily booked over the internet. the bus stop is just outside and you can catch the 475 into the city or you canwalk 15 mins to southbank and get the city cat catamaran to north quay which virtually outs you on the queen st shopping malls Just opposite is the Pineapple hotel which does the best steaks i have tasted especially the house t bone at around $34 Back to the hotel there is internet access which was invaluable to us and the rooms are quite spacious. If you are looking for clean good accomadation for yourself or family then look no further, there is also a kitchen and oven, bascially self contained apartments, which we were sorry to leave. Thank you Majorie and Wayne for making our stay so good Tony Beaven ~4~5~5~nan~4~4~5~4
review_6358144~“all round excellent motel”~6 of us stayed for a week in mid november & found the accomodation excellent value.we went for the cricket at the gabba,the ground was 10 minutes walk away.the rooms were spotless & spacious.they included a well equipped kitchen with full size fridge/freezer,microwave,oven/grill & welcome pack (washing up liquid,tea coffee,sugar etc) there is a convienience store open 24 hours just one minute walk from the motel & a pub/bar across the road to go for a drink or to eat.this bar also has a shop where you can purchase all your drinks,perfect to take back to the paramount & have a drink round the swimming pool or when using the barbeque. finally the owners,marjorie & wayne,were very friendly & nothing was too much trouble for them. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Bus stop almost out front will get you into the center of Brisbane in 5-10 mins. 15-20 mins from the Airport, only minutes from the Highway to the Gold Coast (50-60 min drive) Supermarket is a 5 minute drive, and numerous eating options in surrounding area( KFC, Mc Donalds, Chinese, Subway etc). Overall, excellent Value and location. Would definatley stay there again! ~5~5~5~nan~4~5~5~3
