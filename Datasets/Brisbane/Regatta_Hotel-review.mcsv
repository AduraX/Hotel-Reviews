review_475962661~“One of the best iconic Pubs in Australia 🇦🇺 ”~This is by far the best bar/pub in Brisbane I've been coming for over 10years all different times of the week and can't recall any negative experiences. Its safe has a very relaxing vibe but can get pretty busy Friday, Saturday and Sunday which is expected. The steak and wine selection in the boat shed is fantastic and I cannot recall ever not enjoying a meal there. Give this place ago you won't be disappointed~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473961826~“Disappointing. What has happened to the Iconic Regatta??”~When we arrived we were most impressed as the place looked amazing. We walked up to what looked like a cocktail bar outside with gorgeous lounges and decor to be told that they don't make cocktails at this bar and to go inside to the "Cocktail bar" which was just part of the public bar. Went to the waitress and I asked for a cosmopolitan where she replied "What is in that again?" I told her not to worry as I was not prepared to have a $20 drink not made properly. So then my husband and I ordered some lunch and I got the soft tacos and along with being just two bits of deep fried chicken and some red onion it was stone cold. The staff seemed as though they didn't want to be there and it was overall a disappointing experience. We will not be back. I am sad that the Iconic Regatta has fallen so much.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_471264906~“What happened Regatta?”~We have dined at the Regatta several times a year as they normally do the best steaks in town. However, on our recent visit things had changed dramatically and not in a good way. I ordered the Sirloin steak medium rare with a jacket potato and side salad. The steak, while cooked the way I ordered, was full of gristle and lacked flavour. The jacket potato was cold and smothered in sour cream, the salad was excellent thank goodness. I was extremely disappointed with the service as I had to ask twice for a steak knife, remind them about the salad and had no joy when I mentioned the steak was terrible. What has happened, have they changed the staff, are they making so much profit that they no longer care? Might try another place in future if things don't pick up.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469924375~“Remember to check the bill before paying!”~Dined on a Friday night at the Regatta to celebrate a birthday. Avoided the Boathouse dining area as it was crowded, instead trying the sidewalk cafe, situated on the other side. Smaller choice selection with our party of 6 having the steak, chicken or burgers as a mains only. Steaks were $22.50, with the burgers and chicken parmy between the $16.50 - 19.50 range. Reasonable price and good quality food. Table service was also ok without waiting too long for drinks to arrive. End of the night arrived so we requested and paid for the bill while finishing our last drinks. It was then that one of the table saw we'd been charged for a bottle of red that was never ordered ($52) and an additional glass of red ($11) that also didn't belong to us. When queried the error was instantly rectified and cash provided back to us as we'd paid by credit card. Didn't appear to be too much checking going on to verify our claims. Can't complain about the way the situation was handled just somewhat surprised there aren't better processes in place. Hadn't been there for years and to be honest won't be rushing back again. Food was ok, service was ok but really nothing stood out to make me come back the week after.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469028158~“Eventually, They Got Their Act Together”~We were celebrating my wife's birthday, and chose the Regatta as the venue. Unfortunately, the start was less than desirable. The bar outside the main dining area was grotty, the service in the same bar was non-existent and when it did happen, the waiter was "snooty" and appeared disinterested.  Once we went into the restaurant, the service improved significantly, thank goodness. More importantly, the meal was delicious and we really enjoyed ourselves. When it came time to pay, the earlier experience came back to haunt us, and resulted in them missing out on an otherwise guaranteed tip. The dining experience was 5 star. Pre dinner drink was a single star, at best.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464882942~“Popular trendy corner pub”~Very nice city corner pub, good selection food, Tapas share sale plates in main bar with large selection of beers on tap. A courtyard beer garden, formal steakhouse and gaming room open till late. Comes with a warming however; don't be caught out in 'covered' beer garden if it rains- it floods indoors!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463623855~“Good night”~We had a lovely night,I thought the food would have been better after reading the reviews. I ordered the pork cutlet which was enjoyable, The other 3 had steaks which were average. The shared entrees were good. The wine was very expensive, The service just okay.~3~nan~nan~nan~5~5~2~nan
review_458398799~“Nice place ”~This is a nice place to sit and have a beer over looking the Brisbane river, the beer is ice cold, a bit pricey but very nice. Friendly staff and a beautiful old building. Will be back for sure, could not fault the staff, they were excellent.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455515986~“Surf and turf ”~I'm A massive lover of fine cuts of meats that are well cooked and delicious. These guys are top notch when it comes to delivering that outcome. My meat was cooked perfectly to the requested 'medium rare' and I ran a surf and turf option with bugs covering my large cut of meat. I rounded this out with some Magnificent duck fat roasted potatoes that had a capital C form crunch and were scrumptious. Also had a well prepared pear and rocket salad with shaved parmessan. The restaurant has a buzz with large roomy tables, comfortable seats too.. Family friendly, this place is an easy dining experience.. Well suited for are group a quality wine menu, what's not to like. Bathrooms are clean and staff are friendly and on their game. Check this place out. It's good option for south side dining. You can also grab a drink k in the area afterwards if that suits your plans too.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454026890~“Group visit”~End of year group lunch for 12. Nice menu. They had a full house so the kitchen was flat out. The food was good overall, everyone's meals arrived together. Staff were excellent. Wine list was very good and reasonable. The fit out is nice, but too large for atmosphere which is my only criticism. I'd come here again with a group.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451994133~“Quaint old hotel ”~After a relaxing ferry ride up river we got off the city cat and walked across the road and there on the corner was this lovely old hotel . We sat outside and enjoyed the breeze . They had a few things labelled gluten free and I had calamari where hubbie had nice tortillas . Good service at the bar and good table service . ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450064634~“Beautiful building ...disappointing food”~We went to celebrate birthdays of several family and friends. We arrived at 12pm and of course we all had trouble with parking. That was expected. Building is beautiful and the atmosphere and position is lovely. I ordered fish and chips - $20.50 which came just as I sat down from ordering. We were all impressed until we realised the other meals werent coming for around 30 mins an others had fish and chips too! The two small pieces of fish were nearly all batter, the salad was just lettuce in a very small dish with one cherry tomato cut in half with chips. Extremely disappointing. I will go there again for a drink....but never for food.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448743372~“Nice Industrial interior”~Had lunch in the bar with interstate visitors. Lovely grain salad; too late for the calamari, but fish and chips were good too. Nice atmosphere with exposed brick and tiles on wall. Plenty of variety in where to sit and style of food to have. Waitress was very pleasant.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_448334783~“River views”~This is a great historical pub with lots of atmosphere. Great place to meet friends and enjoy the food drink and views. Excellent selection of tap bar you will not be disapointed. Had a brunch the eggs and bacon down just perfect and a chutney that complemented the meal. Coffee was easy to drink and tasted great~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_448165310~“Great wine terrible steak”~First of all, the airconditioning is woefully incapable of maintaining a comfortable temperature during lunch. I ordered rib fillet, medium, with blue cheese sauce which took nearly an hour to arrive. When it did it was waaaaayyyy overdone, and full of gristle. In the meantime, I enjoyed 3 schooners and half a bottle of Soumah Pinot Noir. I highly recommend the Soumah Pinot Noir. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446653903~“Disappointing lunch”~The food here used to be great. We keep coming back intermittently in the hope that it will be great again, but sadly not.  The staff were good about our undercooked meals and brought full replacements, but off the back of a disappointing meal last time too I can't recommend it unless you're just there to drink.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445982253~“Great food”~We went on a Friday without a booking. There was a few Christmas Parties happening but we managed to find a reasonable quiet in the foyer area. The pizza was delicious as well as the chicken. It is close to the City Cat and walking distance to many hotels. Would definitely go again but perhaps on a quietier night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444938782~“Easy dining at the street cafe ”~Very impressed with the service at this hotel. Staff were attentive but not in your face. Food was great and good size for lunch.. Very pleasant sitting under the trees on the sidewalk.  Inside the bars are great. The central courtyard is the place to meet, but can get quite hot in Brisbane's summer. Right at the city cat stop so,easy commute as parking is not easy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438644058~“The best pub in brissie”~This has been my favourite pub for over 10 years and it just keeps getting better and better. Check out the rum bar downstairs or the 3 flavoured chips, pumpkin, potato and sweet potato to go with your drink.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_437644555~“Sporting Gold”~For any sporting occasion the Regatta is the place to be. With heaps of TV screens and a good turn out, you can't go wrong. The downstairs whisky bar is also a great escape, with live music played often.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_433085452~“Great Saturday Session”~We dined here on Saturday and the service and food was excellent. Great calamari and steaks were delicious. The presentation of the main bar is one of the best long bars in Brisbane. Its an iconic destination. The pimms station is very popular with the ladies and overall a great pub. There is no accommodation to my knowledge so i cant rate the rooms.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_412118358~“Great steaks”~Ate at the Boatshed Restaurant (at the Regatta Hotel) on Saturday 27/8/16.  Staff -- Very friendly and helpful. Service -- see Staff above (staff make the service) Food -- Most of the party had steaks and a few the fish(barramundi) -- no complaints and no food left on the plates. Personally, I had the 400g Rump-- perfectly cooked to medium rare, flavoursome and a bit chewy(how a steak should be!!). Before entering the restaurant, there is a large bar area directly outside for pre-dinner drinks. The restaurant can get a little noisy but sometimes that's the enjoyment. Well worth many visits.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_408056557~“Great busy vibe at the Regatta... ”~If you want to be right in the mix in a hip and happening traditional meets modern pub then this lively venue might suit you. A large sprawling well decorated pub offers something for everyone, age range from twenties to 60's..Drinks are served from several bars, service is good and live music hums in the background. We ordered bar food which to be honest was over priced for what it was but it was tasty enough. All in all we had a very good night and will definitely be returning for the drinks and the atmosphere..Note parking can be an issue..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408026492~“Lunch alfresco great food ”~Five friends and I enjoyed a Saturday lunch at the Regatta Street cafe which is sidewalk dining on Sylvan Rd. Be warned parking is free for 2 hours but limited so get there early and also don't forget to reserve a table. The setting is lovely with herb gardens, umbrella for shade and river glimpses, the menu extensive and you even have the option of the pizzas from the bar menu. I had an espresso martini and a steak burger with maple bacon on a brioche bun that came with a side of chips. Absolutely delicious. My friends enjoyed coffees, to be honest I found the $1 mug surcharge excessive especially when paying for specialty milk also. I have two complaints - coffee should never be served "over" a baby in a pram accidents can easily happen, and we were frequently subjected to cigarette smoke from the nearby designated smoking balcony which really detracted from our experience. Next time we'll request a table closer to the coronation drive end or inside. Overall a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon and we were grateful to the staff for taking the time to snap a photo of us and let us split our bill at the till.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399034420~“Lukewarm food over cooked and non existent service”~Over cooked steak , medium rare was requested. Old cooked greasy chips and tasteless fish served with a salad of lettuce only. Service terrible. Waitress handed me very hot plate and didn't warn me - shame the food wasn't hot instead - I dropped it as it burnt my hands! Was told we'd have to wait because I ordered a cocktail as the barstaff are very busy. Waited half hour just to get a menu ! Won't be back - awful place !!!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_394128742~“Great service ”~Had lunch a few times here it is close to the toowoong village and overlooks the river. The service is great and food is lovely. The bottle shop behind this hotel. And the boatshed bistro. Makes for different dining. All I can say is this is a little gem. Has cold beer and hot coffee. Caters for all ages. This place will not disappoint. Not far from the Wesley hospital as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_394114754~“End of Financial Year Work Party - Brilliant!”~We had the winterford room and hired a two piece acoustic band. The price is very reasonable, the staff are extremely professional and the venue clean and fresh. There is a long balcony joined to the room that overlooks the Brisbane River - which is spectacular at night time. We had 40 guests attend and the total cost for food / alcohol (open bar) came to $3,200.00. Perfect venue!  We are now looking for a venue for our Xmas party and in comparison to the Regatta Hotel - other venues are charging a minimum spend of $5-$8k for rooms. Cannot speak highly enough about this function room.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_393066556~“Relaxing meal by the river”~I visited the Boat shed restaurant at the Regatta hotel last week and I was not disappointed! The ambience was beautiful; the restaurant was warmly lit, fresh flowers on the table and great decor. The service was immaculate, our waitress was beautifully patient as we 'ummed' and 'ahhhed' over the menu. Our steaks were cooked exactly the way we ordered, and the choice of accompaniments and sides were quite impressive (choice and flavour). Our meal coupled with good quality wine made for a really pleasurable experience. Whilst the restaurant is on the more expensive side of things, the portions, service etc. really makes it a worthwhile visit. I am very glad that I took my cousins, from overseas, to this restaurant as a last night meal before leaving Australia.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389643625~“Great steak”~The steak here is very good. Eaten at a lot of well know and well acclaimed steak restaurants in the city, Cha Cha Char, Moo Moo,The Norman Hotel and Brekkie Creek Hotel to mention a few,sure there are loads more to mention at different price ranges. Must say never been disappointed anytime with a steak here over the past twelve years living in Brisbane. I always have eye fillet as find prefer this cut for different reasons,so this review is based on that cut. Would say its reasonable value for what you get. The menu is quite varied with choice and should be enough to cater for most tastes.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_389573254~“Great relaxing venue”~Enjoyed the atmosphere great venue lovely historic hotel. Good place to catch up for a relaxing drink with family and friends. Cosy couches and nice fires.

review_389252769~“Decor magnificent ! service and food very average !”~We visited the Regatta many times over the last 10 months as we had to temporily live in the area, and this was the closest pub in walking distance. The pub itself and décor are absolutely amazing and stylish and beautiful . But I would have say the food and service were extremely hit and miss , consistently inconsistent !!! one day a lovely tender steak, next day , tough as an old boot . some times chips hot sometimes cold !! portion size always different , and a small menu with rarely a special of the day . The service from a couple of the staff was great but mostly couldn't give 2 hoots , with real attitude problems.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~2~nan
review_386828862~“Could do better”~We are from the bar menu at Saturday lunchtime. We had fish and chips. It took ages to come and was cold when it finally arrived. The fish was disgusting - a very tough old shark, I think. We really should have sent it back, but we had waited so long and couldn't bear the thought of waiting again.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_382302737~“Great bar!”~The Regatta hotel doesn't have rooms for rent but instead is a beautiful old style bar. The building is a great reminder of older times on the river in Brissy. You can get a pint or glass of wine upstairs or go down to the Walrus bar downstairs. The Walrus bar boast one of the largest rum selections in Australia. Beautiful setting on the river.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380949171~“Great steak”~My husband and I were staying in Paddington for a few nights and were looking for a good quality steak for dinner.. We thought we would try the Regatta Hotel as it looked like a quality pub, and hoped their food quality would match.. We were very happy with the quality of the steak, which was cooked to our liking, the salad that came with the steak was a bit drab so we were pleased we also ordered the Beetroot and watercress salad... They have quite an extensive wine list and bottles of Moët for $60..!! They also sell Moët by the glass for $20... Whilst we didn't have the Moët, we were exceptionally happy with the bottle of Cab Sav.. All wine prices were very reasonably priced.. The atmosphere was also very good - we were there on a Wednesday night so it wasn't over crowded... Overall, I would recommend the Regatta Hotel for good quality food, great wine (& Moët), pleasant atmosphere and really great customer service..~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_366463286~“Birthday brunch ”~We love visiting the Regatta Hotel. It is a birthday treat for my wonderful husband.It has been a favourite of ours for years and we love all its history. We love looking at the Brisbane river enjoying a coffee and sometimes a wine in the afternoon. It reminds us of beautiful old grand lady. Love the old photos, funky old world on tap beer tanks very large in shiny copper. We always find the staff very friendly. Meals are nice and casual. Easy parking. Opposite the city cat Toowong stop. Must visit here when coming to Brisbane.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_363168843~“Pretentious me????”~Overpriced food that is only ok at best. Bar staff who tended to think they were a bit too cool for school.

review_361680432~“My favourite lunch spot!”~Working close to the regatta means it's the perfect place to escape for lunch. The staff are great. Everyone is always incredibly friendly. The food is always brought out quickly and they cater for take away. The food has always been cooked perfectly and tastes fantastic. The pricing is great. The decorating is even better. There is two beautiful outdoor dining areas as well as the indoor section. You can always grab a drink after work and mingle with others. Some afternoons (and Sundays) you can even enjoy live music in the courtyard. There is a great beer, wine and wiskey selection for the alcohol lovers in all of us. I would highly recommend visiting here and enjoying one of the best restaurants/ bars Brisbane has to offer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359204175~“Wanna here a joke. Regatta table service”~Ate here Saturday night. The food was perfect can not fault it. Nice meals for a decent price. What was the downside of the night was the complete lack of service. We were seated. Waited 15 mins with no one coming to ask if we would like a drink. Had to go ask at the bar to get a menu. Finally 5 mins later we received our menu. Another 20 mins went by before we were asked if we would like to order. Sat here for two and a half hours and only asked once if we were right for drinks or anything else. Had mentioned when we went to pay. Only to get the excuse that the waiter was new and didn't know what she was doing. What a joke.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353435265~“Great steak but how sad was the servise !”~One of the better steaks I have had but I just can not believe how lazy many of the staff are. Drink orders talking 15 Minutes and when I asked why I was told " we only have one bar person on " Just so slack and no one cares.  I do not even expect a reaction. This is an iconic hotel and should be doing better.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

She was also very well groomed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
