review_479324316~“Everything we needed and more”~Not only were the staff lovely but the bed was comfortable, the air-con was good, the shower was great, and it was super close to nice food and shops. Perfect for our one-night stay, we felt it was great value.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_476358619~“ideal for the GABBA entertainment and refreshments”~I stayed here for 1 night during Easter 2017 due to an AFL game at the nearby GABBA ground. Booked a 2 room apartment for myself and another couple. Room was very clean, toiletries supplied, coffee, tea and sugar, full range of cutlery and plates, stove top and microwave. Room fronted onto the road but was not bothered by traffic noise. Was bothered by the noise of a loud rattling air-con on the balcony however. Check in was efficient despite me being early, (I was there at noon) Free onsite parking. An onsite restaurant, IGA supermarket, Pineapple Hotel, KFC and McDonalds all within 100 mtrs The GABBA ground is a 10 minute walk away.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467426046~“Not a great experience”~We were disapointed in the standard of this motel, granted they were busy as Adele was playing nearby at the Gabba stadium. But we were disappointed how small the room and the bed was, very cramped. There was cigarette ash on the window sill when we arrived in a "no smoking room" and a dead cockroach in the bathroom. on the plus side the staff were friendly and pleasant and it was perfectly situated for the concert we were attending at the Gabba.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~4~nan
review_465122675~“Overnight Stay”~Great location and handy to a number of restaurants, coffee shops and hotels. Easy walking to The Gabba and bus station as well as Kangaroo Point cliffs - great for photos especially at night. Very clean and comfortable. Staff were lovely. Only disappointment was lack of parking. I booked a spot but they were all taken. We were packed in like sardines. Still well worth a look if you are looking for something cheaper but handy to Brisbane CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455530434~“A pleasant surprise, a Gem in Brisbane!”~We stayed at Southern Cross for 3 nights, we were walking distance to everything which made the location a standout for us. Our room was updated, spacious, clean and very affordable. The staff were friendly and proactive. What a pleasant surprise this getaway was without breaking the bank. I would definitely stay here again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455118087~“Great Location, very comfortable”~So glad we picked this place to holiday and meet family, very comfortable, cool, clean rooms. Friendly staff. Best location, walking distance to the Brisbane Rivers and all Brisbane has to offer. We didn't need a car . Will stay here again, highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453501332~““Great accommodation and location for an affordable price- We'll be back!”~This is our second stay at Southern Cross Motel & Serviced Apartments and found further noticeable upgrades with the new management. This time with our family of five for 7 days. It is easily accessible from the airport and not too far from the city. We found the rooms to be spacious and clean. The aircon was brilliant and cooled the room in minutes! Motel is close to Local Pub Hotel & other restaurants & cafes - literally a walk across the road. Plenty of privacy, despite being on the corner of a main road; however, we had no issues with noise from traffic - barely noticed it to be honest. The hosts were awesome. There was ample parking space for guests. We stayed during the Cricket at the Gabba when the place was fully booked and also spent a day at Dreamworld (only 36 minutes drive approx) to return and managed to still get a parking spot. We only had to walk a few minutes to Streets Beach at Southbank to swim during a very warm stay. The family loved it and would be staying here again on out next trip and I would definitely recommend to everyone to experience it for themselves.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_453182184~“Good BUT check your security/bond refund”~For $120 a night, on a night where there was a game at the Gabba and other places increased their prices, we thought this was great value. The room was very neat and clean, much cleaner than some places we've stayed. Air-con was ice cold and very effective, even on such a hot day and evening. The balcony had a nice view of the city lights. Having a kitchenette with an actual sink and a microwave was a bonus, cutlery and plates were provided so if you're on a budget with meals this definitely helps. Towels were beautifully soft, and nice amenities. It was a double bed only but still comfortable and a blanket was provided for extra comfort. There was also a small lounge chair in the room. Location-wise, you are only 5 minutes walk to the Gabba, and there are plenty of food options nearby. Undercover parking in Qld summer storms is also a bonus. Issues: You definitely have to check on your bond/security deposit. We were told at the time of checkout that we would get our bond deposit back on our credit card within 3 days. A week later we rang and it hadn't even been processed at all. This was disappointing and if we hadn't followed up then they would have kept our money. How many people don't check and never receive their deposit back? The issue is also that they don't just put a hold on the credit card, they physically take $100 off the credit card. Also disappointing was being told we had to come back to reception no earlier than 7am on checkout day to get our deposit refunded - what about guests needing to depart early? Another woman had paid a cash deposit and was still told it would be refunded onto her card within 3 days - this was then corrected and staff had to chase after her to give her the cash back. If not for these two things, we would have given 5 stars.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452229302~“Awesome place to stay - I will stay again!”~I stayed at here over the Christmas break in one of their serviced apartments. I was really impressed by the friendly, helpful staff and how comfortable and quiet the apartment was! The bed was really comfy and the place was kept very clean. I loved how close this place is to all the cool places in Kangaroo Point; I walked to southbank for food and coffee, visited the cliffs and had a nice walk at the Botanic gardens. Gerry – the manager – and his staff will help you out for a great stay! I will definitely come here again. Thanks for a wonderful experience. I wish all hotels were like this -- 5 stars!!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_448423973~“WILL BE BACK AGAIN!!”~Our apartment felt like a home.room was very clean,modern and well presented.Staff at the Front desk were very helpful.(pamela) was very friendly and accommodating.Parking was another good point for this place.i would definitely recommend this place to others.we will be back in March.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_448419265~“Really great place to stay!”~Stayed here again as I had another gig in the city.. Staff were extremely pleasant, helpful and accommodating. The room was fresh and clean, beds are comfy and the refurbishing improvements by the new owners just keep coming! The view from our room was awesome, we could see fireworks for the Christmas festivities as we were very close to Southbank and Brisbane city. It's great for families, we saw kids enjoying the pool almost every time we were outside.. This place is awesome value.. very happy, 5 stars! :-)~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_446633690~“Room for improvement”~We had a 2brm apartment which came as a 1brm with interconnecting door to a studio room. We did have the option of getting a 1 bdrm with a small hallway to a studio (all private) but as teenager would have been in the 'studio' apartment, I decided that it would be more family friendly with interconnecting door 'open'. Very basic inside with not a lot of utensils in the kitchen. Staff was more than happy to provide a bit of dishwashing liquid which I thought might have already been provided. Laundry powder is not provided but can be bought at reception. Sliding door and light above stove didn't work but managed to get handyman to fix door but after 6 days still no stove light. This is 'basic' accomodation but it's in a great spot. Check if there is anything on at the GABBA as the parking at Sthrn X 'will' be full. One unfortunate stand-out was the 2 seater couch. As this was the only seating besides kitchen chairs. It's a bit odd as where do the other 1-3 people sit? The 'studio' room had no window as such, as the 'bubbled' glass looked straight onto the 'common area' used by patrons. Drapes are always closed because the lights are left on (always) outside the room. If staying here again I will try the 'other' option of a 2brm apartment. Pleasant staff, lifts working, cost not too bad so all in all not great but also not too bad.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_404299617~“Worst motel ever”~This is by far the worst accommodation I have ever stayed in. Before even arriving I had called up to double check my booking twice and they had lost it both times. Upon my arrival there was no parking available because all the parks were taken up by the people visiting the restaurant. Half the lights in he apartment didn't work and the staff seemed clueless to what they were actually doing. I handed over my card and I.d. to pay for the bedroom and was told my bond would be out back into my account within two buisness days after my departure. A week later I rang up because i hadn't gotten my bond back and was told they still had it there because i did not give my bank details when I left. First of all I had already given my card when I checked in so all my details were recorded. And secondly I wasn't told this when I checked in or checked out. I have stayed in quite a few different places and this is by far the worst. These people need to seriously work on their buisness and customer skills because i will not be returning again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400216071~“New management is AWESOME”~I've been staying here on and off for work over the last half dozen years, and it's changed hands a couple of times and has seen some dodgy times, however the current 2016 management is GREAT. The rooms have been nicely done up, are cleaner than ever before, the rooms are wonderfully equipped and redecorated and the beds are COMFY with CLEAN sheets. I'd been considering changing motels when there was dodgy management here, but will DEF be staying now that the changeover has been so good. The staff are sooo helpful too. Elevator was on the blink and they helped me carry my crap to the second floor. And I'm an overpacking girl LOL. No complaints here. Affordable, and great service and rooms. Happy visitor here. :)~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_390281313~“Very average”~had trouble with key card, the room was very old and run down, had trouble with the tv, room was very small for a triple, had to keep asking for towels and there was no do not disturb. The Italian restaurant downstairs was very nice though.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan

review_371651024~“Great choice.”~In short the room was extremely clean and comfortable, management and staff were only too willing to assist, the location was great and very good value. Would highly recommend. Also free Wi-Fi…which you don’t always get at other motels.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_371382676~“What a place AAAAA++++++”~The family and I stayed for three nights. We were amazed firstly with the excellent room rate. Secondly how clean and well presented the rooms were. Thirdly with the Staff and Managment been extremely friendly and helpful the whole time. Can't thank them enough.  If you looking for a short or long stay while on holidays or passing through Brissy this is the place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_371030619~“New Management are lovely!”~Stayed here as I had a gig in the city... The new management staff are lovely! Happy to accommodate, and the room and building were so fresh and clean!! Would definitely recommend to others for accommodation close to city, river and South Bank! :-)~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_370294726~“The Southern Cross is a good value for money to stay in Brisbane”~Within a stroll to Kangaroo Point’s breathtaking view of the skyline & river. The staff and the new management were very friendly and accommodating, always keen to give help or assistance to their guests. The rooms are mixture of apartment and hotel rooms. We had a comfortable 1 Bedroom complete with kitchen for cooking your own meals, two split system a/c, flat screen tv, fridge and tea and coffee making facilities very reasonable considering room price. Walking distance to the Gabba for the footy and restaurants nearby. Exploring the city without your own transportation is not even a problem as the taxi and bus are easily accessible and free city hopper ferry on the river. In fact, a 15 minute walk would lead you to Maritime Museum for a ferry to town. They also have ample parking space for their guests. The hotel offers free wifi. Overall, I found the hotel is comfortable at a very affordable price. I’d stay there again and recommend for convenience.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_367030458~“Very Noisy”~Yes we knew it was on a busy road but arrived in Brisbane at night and we were tired and on a shoestring budget. In addition the receptionist told us on the phone that she would give us a quiet room. As the motel looked modern (only 9yrs old) we expected it would most likely have double glazing. This proved not to be the case. First room we were given key to had a serious water leak so we back-peddled out of the room and returned to reception where we were immediately given another room. The room was alright - just average, the water just trickled out of the shower, single bed creaky/noisy. I asked if there was off street parking and was assured there was however we discovered insufficient bays but fortunately we found a park on the street about 100m away so we had to lug our bags this distance.~2~nan~1~nan~3~nan~3~nan
