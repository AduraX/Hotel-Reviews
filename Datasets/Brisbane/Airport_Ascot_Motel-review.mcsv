review_475159429~“Homely”~My wife and i stopped off here one evening after landing at the airport and before moving on to the Gold Coast and other places. The managers at the time very hospitable and personable. Helping us with public transport, the weather and a range if other things.  The hotel itself is probably cheap for Brisbane/ a capital city in Aust. It is in a great location for shops pubs restaurants and public transport including the river ferry! The room was great. Bed comfy and has free parking. Will be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474868079~“Fly, Stay and Cruise”~Perfect spot to stay if your flying into Brissie to go on a cruise, only cost $135 for the night. With the port just down the road and the motel offer a free shuttle service also have a shuttle to the airport but I just used Uber (around $18)~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472311680~“Perfect value for the money”~Booked for one night Monday 27th March due to an early Tuesday morning flight and to save on a very early drive up from where we live on the Gold Coast. On line booking very easy. Price was $140 for a twin room. Over $100 cheaper than the well known chain hotel nearer the airport. Arrived around 7.30 pm and was greeted by a friendly gentleman at reception. Very quick check in and was allocated a quiet room towards the rear of the building on the second floor. Room and bathroom absolutely spotless with good towels in the bathroom and very nice bedding. Not a huge room but a queen bed and extra king single. Neat bathroom with complimentary ammenities, usual tea and coffee with biscuits and a good standard TV. Very comfy beds and aircon that worked effectively. No bar at hotel but you can purchase from reception, they have alcoholic and none alcoholic drinks in a large fridge behind the reception and some snacks. Very reasonable in price much cheaper than your usual hotel bar but you have to consume in your room or on one of the provided outdoor smoking balconies. Breakfast is available if pre ordered. We didn't bother but pricing again looked ok. About a 5 minute walk brings you to a few bars and restaurants, pizza, cafes etc. For a night before a flight (about a 10 to 15 minute drive to BNE) or across the road for the cruise terminal I would very strongly recommended this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_471998112~“Would recommend”~Very clean motel, management are lovely people and they offer a shuttle service to the airport (have to pay for it). We did not know there was a free pickup from the cruise terminal, which is how we got to Brisbane/this hotel so we missed out on using it, but for those reading this if you get off from a cruise and book here you may find this useful. Some eateries nearby (Indian which was closed when we were there and Italian) and a convenience shop as well. Air con/heater works well. Would definitely stay here again. Hopefully the new owners keep the place as good.~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471509852~“Very clean, well appointed, convenient location, well priced”~We booked this on line at 9pm and turned up at 10pm the same night. The key was in the night safe so we let ourselves in, found the room to be very clean and well appointed. We had everything we wanted, it was quiet, the bed was comfortable and it was only $155 for a twin room. What more could we ask for?~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_459006545~“A bit pricey but a clean motel convenient for cruise terminal”~Stayed here overnight pre cruise. Room is of an adequate size, clean with a modern bathroom. Towels are white and fluffy with complimentary toiletries. Plenty of tea and coffee in the room. Allowed to check in early after an overnight flight. Motel is next to a busy road but the glazing is good.  Have given a lower rating as The motel is quite pricey for just room only and no other frills. Breakfast can be pre-ordered ranging from $12 to $20. There is a parade of shops and eateries along Race course road to the right of the motel, 10 to 20 mins walk away. Transport to cruise terminal takes 3 mins and is complimentary.~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_458641921~“Close to airport, near the cruise ship port area”~This is a lovely little motel. It's rooms are modern and clean.They are not overly large, but big enough. We had a Queen room. There is a little fridge and kettle in the room. The hosts at the front desk were welcoming and helpful. It's a couple of blocks walk to the port side area, Eat Street and the City Cat dock, as well as the bus to the downtown. A number of decent restaurants are also within a few blocks walk. Very convenient to the airport if you are just popping thru Brisbane, about 15-20 minutes by cab. You are right on a Main Street, so rooms with a balcony might not be quiet for sitting out, but our room...no balcony...was quite quiet. There is a washer and dryer on the second floor.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456490669~“Convenient and friendly”~We booked this Motel for one night before starting a Cruise from Brisbane. It was in a convenient location, and they provide a free shuttle to the port and/or a paid transfer to the airport. (They are unable to do pickups from the airport, due to restrictions). It cost us AUD30 for a taxi from the airport to the Ascot. It is within walking distance of the lovely Portside Wharf, where you can find restaurants, shops and a cinema. The staff were particularly friendly and there is free wifi.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_450350184~“NICE SURPRISE”~My brother & his family, and my husband & I, booked this hotel over the New Year weekend for a three & two nights stay respectively, as it was both close to the airport & within walking distance of the New Year's Eve fireworks at Portside. To be honest, there were limited affordable choices available close to the City but as it turned out we were more than happy with our decision. The property looks like it is a little older from the outside but is neat & well maintained. On entry it is easily evident that there have been extensive renovations throughout which makes it overall very comfortable. The rooms are not overly spacious but are well appointed (tea/coffee making, small bar fridge, large flat screen TV, good quality linens) modern but basic in design and importantly, very clean. My brother's family had adjoining/ connecting rooms which very simply allowed ample space for the extra guests. There also was a constant, reasonably fast, free internet connection - unusually it had none of the frequent drop-outs you encounter at most motels! Mini-bar/ snack options were available for purchase from the reception desk during office hours & a basic room service breakfast menu was available if required. I would expect the average guest would only stay here overnight due to it's closeness to the airport, but we found the property's proximity to restaurants, public transport, weekend Eat Street Markets and Portside's amenities also makes it perfect for a longer stay It may not have the bells and whistles that a lot of newer motels have such as a gym, pool or restaurant but everything you need is in easy reach and the free onsite parking is also a bonus not offered at many inner city properties. All the dealings we had with any of the staff were handled professionally and in a friendly manner...there was a hiccup with all our room keycards not being validated for our full stay but the problem was easily rectified. We would definitely stay at this motel again and will happily recommend it to others.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_447712441~“Friendly helpful relief managers”~Lovely motel close to shipping wharf. Was directed to the restaurants on the wharf by the very friendly and helpful relief managers.

review_444358478~“Very convenient stopover point”~We arrived after hours and left early so did not physically get to meet anyone however every time I spoke to anyone on the phone they were extremely polite and very helpful. The room is of a good size with a comfy bed. There were roadworks going on all be get outside but that did not disturb a really good nights sleep. Nice and close to the airport so ideal for stopovers.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_433429141~“Not cleaned Properly”~Our room was not cleaned properly. It looked like the sheets weren't even changed. We found at least 6 long black hairs in the bed. The white quilt cover was stained as well. The bottom of the fridge was full of water and not at all cold. There was a dirty towel left from the last people, hanging up behind the bathroom door.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~3~nan
review_414135197~“Wonderful Service!”~My friends and I had a university ball down the road at Moda Events. We were greeted by a lovely lady. Her husband offered to take us to the event down the road in the shuttle bus, free of charge. The room was clean and tidy, the facilities were great and the bed was comfortable. The couple that managers the motel are so friendly, accomodating and they offer exception service. They really did go out of their way to make our stay worthwhile. Would definitely come and stay again and recommended this motel to friends and family.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_412575223~“Good value for money”~This airport motel is clean, well maintained and perfectly fine for a night. It's on a busy road so isn't a place you'd stay for a relaxing getaway, but purely for a transit to or from the airport. Its close to a couple of car storage companies as well so it is convenient to drop your car off and get a transfer to the airport by the car storage people. The motel has everything in the room you would need including toiletries. A short drive takes you to either Portside or Racecourse Road for a meal. Perfectly neat and adequate motel.~3~5~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_409857072~“A very good motel”~We stayed for one night before traveling to Bargara. Very good location not to far from the airport. The room and bed were comfortable. It was clean and the price was reasonable. Ample parking. We would stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_409798093~“Clean and Tidy, Friendly Staff”~I stayed here for one night, or most of one at least as I had an early flight out. I was easily able to find it and park my hire car and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room was neat and tidy and while obviously not new there's been an effort to update various aspects. The location is good not only in terms of being relatively close to the airport but also close to many restaurants. For my purpose it was the perfect stay and at a very affordable price.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_402637534~“Great location.....”~We only stayed one night as we were heading off on a cruise. Great location for the dock, Eat Street Markets and not far from Brisbane CBD. Great couple running the Motel and a FREE shuttle service for you and your luggage to the ship. Very neat and clean and smelt really nice! Highly recommend - would stay again for sure!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400513369~“Close to restaurants ”~Pleasant motel and close to some good restaurants. But the shower was unbelievably tiny, difficult to move in and I'm not a big person. Also 5 minutes to DFO. Free parking with some undercover. Friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_398971193~“Clean & comfortable ”~Great hotel close enough to the city but easily accessible to the ship terminal and airport. Good value breakfast and clean rooms, the only thing that distracts a little is the shower cubicle is tiny and the towels really could do with replacing.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397107628~“Four star at three star prices.”~What a great find! This small yet compact motel tucked behind the cruise terminal was just what we needed for our overnight stay before commencing our cruise. The room was modern, exceptionally clean, with everything we needed, including a small balcony. For a small extra charge breakfast was brought to our room. The windows are double glazed so no noise from busy main road and the super friendly and efficient staff were a bonus We even got a lift to the port after a late check out! Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_396447264~“Pleasantly surprised... Use their shuttle from the airport”~My wife booked this as an inexpensive quick overnighter we before my international flight home. For the rate I wasn't expecting much more than a bed but turned out to be a decent place. I took a taxi from the airport to get there and it was 32Aud, the hotel shuttle was only 24Aud back so I should have used it to begin with. Checkin staff was nice, recommended shuttle and places to eat in the area. I like that they had drinks to choose from, and a few snacks available as well. In the morning, door to terminal door was 13 minutes.  It wouldn't be a first choice but I'd stay again without hesitation.  It's on a bus line, but not on the airport train line.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_394522974~“Good option near airport”~Clean, quiet room, very friendly reception. Lovely breakfast served in my room next morning (there being no breakfast area downstairs). The toast was still crisp and hot. Taxi ride from airport a bit pricey at 38 AUD, but apparently that's more or less the norm. Manager Paul dropped me off at the airport next AM for 22 AUD, but he said that to do pickups also would be just too difficult. This seems to be one of the few hotel options relatively close to the airport.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_387233508~“Better than most others”~It's clean, updated and reasonably sized. All you need before you hop on a plane the next morning. Some restaurants close by. Late check in reception, which is a plus. Would stay again when good deals available, otherwise too pricey for what it is~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383612097~“Very clean & cosy”~We've stayed at this motel several times and are never disappointed. The rooms are a little small however very clean, comfortable and functional.

review_380059663~“Clean and convenient.”~Short trip from the airport, staff were welcoming and courteous. Our host upgraded us to a twin room when he found that we were friends travelling so we didn't have to share the bed. Bathroom clean and fresh looking. Problem happened when the shower was running, a major flood occurred as the water leaked at the side near the toilet. 2 bathtowels and the bath at were unequal to the task. Not too easy to get dinner at night, but continental breakfast is available I think. We left early, 6.30am, and it was not offered. Would stay again, mostly because of convenience and the reception staff.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_379872725~“Short stay”~Stayed in a standard Queen room. Small but cosy, mini fridge and tea/coffee supplies. In room safe also handy. Bathroom was tidy, small shower, the towels were also small/old/rough and could be replaced. The couple running the place were so friendly and helpful with tips for eating out. They make it worth the stay!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_372987674~“Tour Guide ”~This is our third stay at the Motel. This time we had a couple of Chinese Students with us for a visit to Brisbane. The location is fantastic as we hopped on the city cats and cruised into town and then football. The accommodation is clean and people are always nice.  We are thinking of making it a regular.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369774468~“Handy for the airport”~Checked in after flying from New Zealand. The staff at reception could not have been friendlier and more eager to help. Our room was a reasonable size, clean and quiet even if the motel is on a main road. Everything was spotless, the bed was comfortable and the walk in shower (good if you have bad knees) was excellent. Self serve laundry facilities are available and free to use. Just around the corner is Racecourse Rd which has a handy coffee shop for breakfast. Parking is under cover and free. Beer, snacks and soft drinks can be purchased at reception if you arrive late and don't want to go out. The wifi was good and also free.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_362963093~“Excellent location if you're connecting with a Cruise”~10 minutes from the Airport. Taxi cost 35.00 which I thought was a rip off. We only stayed 1 night here as we were catching a P&O Cruise the next morning but it was clean, comfy and friendly. There were some night Markets on that were a 10 min walk at most away down near the Port. Just ask reception how to get there. There was a huge variety of food available, 2.50 per person to get in. The Motel has a free shuttle service to the Port which takes only a few minutes at best.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_361815277~“Okay place to stay”~It was impossible to find a hotel room closer than about 4 miles from the Brisbane airport so we selected the Ascot. A bit weird there, as you had to drive into the parking garage to access the lobby, which was locked (around 4:00 PM). Had to ring a buzzer and wait for someone to open the door. The room was satisfactory. Nothing special. It was clean, had the fridge, coffee maker, etrc., but wasn't upscale at all. I don't have any specific complaints. Just "eh."~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_335133033~“Returned again”~Stayed a second time one year later when we were holidaying in Aussie again. Clean and tidy rooms, a little on the small side but fine for 1 night. Main attraction is the handy location to ports and the owner gave us a complimentary ride to the Tangalooma wharf area. Cooked breakfast was good and filling. Friendly, helpful staff.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_334985716~“Good budget accommodation”~Not overpriced, very clean. Friendly helpful staff.  Nothing flash, no mini bar, but does provide breakfast to room. Smoking balconies on each floor.  Close to ferries and public transport.  Restaurants and hotel for meals nearby - walking distance.  Although we didn't use, I'm told has shuttle to airport or cruise terminal.  Lifts to each floor, easily accessible.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_319440926~“Perfect before cruise!”~The Airport Ascot is perfect if you are heading off for a P&O cruise, as the wharf is only 10 mins walk from the motel. But the motel also offers free shuttle to the wharf if you have a bit of luggage.  We stayed one night. The staff were very helpful (delivered extra teabags) & gave us good meal advice. The beds comfortable, good water pressure in shower, and room clean & tidy. A small balcony on our family unit on the 3rd floor was nice for the evening. Good air con & an easy walk to some nice cafes.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_314041390~“Nice rooms near airport and restaurants”~There were three adults traveling back from Brisbane to LA. We needed a place near the airport for the night. The Ascot is a great choice and we will definitely stay there again. We got a family room that had a king bed and a queen bed, separated by a wall (the king room had a door also). There is a little kitchenette (careful - it froze all our food!) for microwaving or toasting or having tea or coffee. The room itself was very clean and well-appointed. It felt new. Bathroom was also very nice. The only downside to the bathroom is the shower stall if very, narrow. If you are a large person, I don't think you'd fit. I am 5'5" and when I was washing my hair, my elbows were brushing the sides of the shower. I don't know about the other rooms - maybe they have some with larger showers. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and they will provide a shuttle to the airport for a nominal charge. The van was new and very clean. Highly recommend this motel.~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_313350818~“Handy For Brisbane Airport”~Clean and tidy hotel excellently placed for Brisbane Airport.

They were incredibly accommodating and flexible in checking us in early with no extra costs. Wifi was complimentary, and the rooms were warm, comfortable and the beds were heaven to sleep in! The staff were very helpful in recommending good places to dine, places to shop and even gave us accurate approximates for taxi fare!!! They gave us complimentary rides in their shuttle to the harbor to catch our boat! Just fabulous! My only apology was that we did leave the room in a bit of a state prior to cruise - we were pressed for time and we have a tendency to be a but unorganized! But none the less - they were fabulous about it (-:~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

This motel was 5 star in our eyes , spotless, fresh and clean , and well priced . a great place to stay before flying out and close to the airport , the staff member was so helpful knowing our dilema , and informed us that she would get as many as 4 people a week coming to her in the same situation as us ,would recommend this motel highly .~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

Nothing was too much trouble - the receptionist was very helpful even suggesting a dinner venue (The Eat Street Market) and giving us an umbrella in case of rain. The room was small but clean.

review_291327278~“Airport Ascot Motel Brisbane”~Travelling with two teenage boys so needed a 2 separated bedroom motel/hotel that had 2 single beds in one room and one Dble/Q or K bed in another. Also wanted something reasonably priced as it was for one night only. The third requirement was it had to be close to Suncorp Stadium for a game we were going to that night and also reasonably close to the Airport for departure the next day. Located and booked Airport Ascot Motel easy enough on line. Overall I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the motel. The young receptionist was very friendly, approachable and happy to provide information on the surrounding area such as where to eat and the local night markets down near the docks. The apartment was two rooms, on entry in the first room a Q bed with a small kitchenette, bathroom leading of it and two singles in the other room. Both had T.Vs and ample room so did not feel cramped in. Internet was free with no problems connecting. I am fussy when it comes to cleanliness usually spotting hair or dust but in this case the cleaner had done a fantastic job and the rooms were cleaned to a high standard. The beds were comfortable and the heater/Air con temp was easy to control and worked well. Photos on the website actually do not do the motel justice, I believe it was a lot nicer in person. The only negative, which by no means was the Motels fault, was the noise of the traffic on the main road the next morning but as we were up it was of no consequence. Suncorp stadium was an easy 10 mins drive one way, 10 mins drive to the airport the other or easy way and extremely close as in walking distance close (5-10 mins depending on pace) to the Cruise Ship departure terminal though the motel did offered a free ride to the terminal if you wanted one (had to be booked night before, prior to 9pm). Overall I would have no hesitation recommending this motel.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

Very convenient to airport and downtown. Price was reasonable, parking was free, the girl at the desk was friendly and helpful and helped when the airline lost our luggage. there are several places to eat within walking distance.

review_265895436~“Exactly what was required”~I was staying on the other side of Brisbane and had to catch a 6am flight to Sydney to connect to Johannesburg. The thought of getting up at 4am and rushing to the airport filled me with total gloom, so I looked for a mid-price hotel near the airport where the family dropped me off after dinner.  The receptionist was welcoming and confirmed my taxi would arrive at 5am. I paid the bill and went up for a shower and bed. I slept soundly and got up at 4.30am in time to catch the taxi which arrived a few minutes early. There was nobody on duty, but it was easy to get out. The taxi arrived on time and I caught my plane without difficulty. The total bill was $162.40 which whilst not cheap was reasonable for the facilities offered. The room and shower were clean, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning worked. I needed nothing more. Highly recommended for people like me with early planes to catch.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_258985647~“Great for access to airport”~We stayed for one night between international flights. Only 12 minutes from airport. We got a taxi which cost $28. The room is basic, no frills but clean and comfortable. Our room was 208, very quiet and the beds very comfortable. There is a fridge and coffee/tea making facilities. No minibar or extras like moisturiser, showercap but adequate. Short 9 minute walk to Bretts wharf to catch the Quick Cat up the river to Southbank. Short walk to Racecourse Drive where there are plenty of restaurants and bars. If you are looking for just one night and don't want top of the range I recommend it.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_258362441~“Great location....”~We stayed here for one night prior to the departure of our cruise ship. It is well located to Hamilton Harbour and the Airport. Unfortunately we arrived the same day that Cyclone Marcia had hit further north. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful and offered us a transfer to the wharf the following day. We didn't have to name a time either - they told us to call out when we were ready. As it turned out, we were very grateful for this offer as there was torrential rain all day. Our Internet worked well. Room was a little smaller than anticipated but it was clean and very comfortable. Our room was nearer the front but we could only hear traffic if we opened the window. Only other comment is that we felt the rate we paid for the room was high. But then its location is very good if you are flying in to Brisbane to take a cruise ship at Hamilton Harbour.~4~2~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan

There was Internet at a charge and the receptionist was also the 'cleaner'. The inernet didn't work for either us which was not good as we needed to stay in touch with our house sitter and daughter. The up side was the owners, they were very nice but if we needed to stay close prior to a holiday again, I don't think we would stay here.~2~nan~4~1~nan~nan~2~nan
review_246267511~“Great convenient location”~This is an excellent stop-over hotel for the business traveller or if you are driving up the coast on a holiday. A short distance off the M1 and Southern Cross Way (old Gateway Motorway), and only 10 minutes from Brisbane CBD, there is easy access off Kingsford Smith Drive into the hotel. There is plenty of parking, and I was surprised how quiet the rooms were being so close to Kingsford Smith Drive (I was in a room near the front of the motel), the rooms must be sound-proofed and/or have double glazed windows. The bed was comfortable, and the room had a flat screen TV, Tea/coffee making facilities, as well as a nice modern bathroom. Hamilton Harbour and Portside Wharf Shopping Centres a short walk away (acorss Kingsford Smith Drive), where you will find cafes, restaurants, supermarkets and other retail stores, as well as the cruise ship terminal. Highly recommend this hotel for a night or two.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_240722641~“Good location”~We stayed here for 1 night and it was a very good choice. The motel is fairly close to the airport and a taxi will cost about $25 - $30. The room is not very big, but that is fine for just 1 night. The bed was comfortable and our room was at the back, so no traffic noise at all. The motel is close to the Portside Wharf, where there are many restaurants and shops. The girls at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. We recommend this motel!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_240291393~“2 bedroom isn't a two bedroom!!!”~We booked a two bedroom family unit to stay here on 23 October. The room was not clean at all, the kitchen sink had scum all around the tap and obviously hadn't been cleaned in some time. We had asked for a port-a-cot to be in the room for our young son and this wasn't done. When we got to our room I had to ring to get a cot. When the lady brought it up it was broken so she went and got another one. They didn't have a proper mattress for it so put a blanket down and he had to sleep on that. It wasn't a two bedroom that we were given either. It was a one bedroom with the queen size bed out in the living area which was tiny. Certainly not big enough for more than three people to stay in that unit. I'm glad we only had to stay here one night as it wasn't a pleasant stay. We left as soon as we could in the morning. It's a shame as it wasn't the cheapest place to stay. We specifically booked there as it seemed nice and spacious for our children and clean. Very disappointing.~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_239441760~“Great location not far from airport”~We stayed in a family room at the Airport Ascot motel. We were impressed before arriving as received confirmation texts for our ETA and preferred bed configuration. Hotel is walking distance from the river with lots of good restaurants nearby. Bit of a busy road, but we weren't bothered by any noise at all. Clean, well maintained, undercover parking, and easy to drive to and from. About a 40 min ferry ride into the city which was lovely. Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_236284313~“great for pre or post flight stay”~We were a family of four staying overnight before our early morning flight. We had a family room, queen bed in the lounge/main room and 2 singles in a separate bedroom. The main room was small but okay for a short stay. The service was excellent, they let us check in early as my husband was not well.  The hotel is on a very busy road and although the rooms are sound proofed you can still hear the road noise - earplugs are useful.  The furniture and fittings were modern and the place was spotlessly clean. It was a short drive to restaurants and the city and an easy early morning trip to the airport.  There was free off street parking and free WiFi - we seemed to get more than was usual but with a teenager we weren't complaining.  Overall a great place to stay if you're flying in or out of Brisbane and need to overnight somewhere.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_236246931~“Good Value / Good Choice”~Booked this through Trip Advisor based on reviews. Check in was easy. Receptionist helpful and friendly. No issues.  Room was an adequate size. Clean and had everything required. Had a small deck. My only gripe would be that the shower is small but that said was more than adequate. The room was quiet and we felt like the only ones in the hotel.  We had a good nights rest. There is a direct line for taxi service and true to receptionists word once booked it arrived within 2-3 minutes. Taxi from airport cost $32 and taxi to airport $25. We aren't quite sure why such a price variance. I guess check price before entering can. Again the receptionist said taxi would be about $25 and that this would be better option than the shuttle service they offer which is $12.50 per person but leaves at 4.20am, 5.20am etc. Taxi gave us more flexibility.  This place is a 5-10 min walk from the night time food markets, which were great. The location is good as we could have easily gone into the city by ferry which is 5 mins away. There is also the wharf with lots of eateries so you are spoiled for choice. We opted for the markets which were just booming with people, great food and entertainment.  We would definitely opt to stay again. Cost in NZ $165.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_235514445~“Great little place to stay for an overnight flight”~As the title of the review says, this was a great, quiet hotel to stay the night when you need to catch a plane in the morning. The room and the bathroom/shower was spacious and clean, and the young lady on the reception desk couldn't do enough for us. Before she went home that night she made sure she had booked us a taxi for the next morning (there was no one on reception when we left) and also gave us directions to the Eat Street Markets so we could stretch our legs and get something to eat before we slept. It was a great stay after a long flight, I only regret I didn't catch the young lady's name so I could thank her here! We stayed the night of the 5th of September 2014.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_233417131~“Convenient and clean”~Stayed here overnight as we had an early plane the next morning. Staff friendly and recommended the night markets (Fri, Sat,Sun) at the cruise terminal (5 minutes walk) which were excellent. Staff were happy to book a taxi for next morning or there was a free taxi phone which had a cab there in 5 minutes. Rooms clean and comfortable. Great for getting to and from the airport.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_231785949~“Great Experience”~Very friendly & welcome staff, Rooms are still new and clean. Great location, close to airport, a quite, trendy spot of city.

review_231719555~“Excellent Couple Stay”~Stayed two nights here for short break.Close to airport save the travel time. The comfortable room with good facilities can be expected. The balcony for Tea & Coffee in morning is wonderful. Close to shops and all sort of transportation. Especially there is a new gelato place opened in the next street. The gelato shop was grouped with other restaurant and make the dinning choice even more attractive.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_231498505~“Great location to cruise terminal”~Stayed here overnight prior to a PNG cruise the next morning as it is so close to cruise terminal. Comfortable with a nice balcony. Spotlessly clean. Very friendly reception staff who organised a free shuttle bus to cruise terminal for us. The terminal is within walking distance but shuttle bus is much more convenient with luggage.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_231272601~“Good Overnight Stay”~Spent one night here before catching an early morning flight overseas. A small but comfortable room with a good bed and all the facilities one expects. Enjoyed sitting on the balcony for an evening drink before heading out to dinner. Close to Racecourse Road for plenty of dining options. Staff very helpful. Only criticism - the shower. The shower head is mounted very high on the wall and is not adjustable. No shower caps provided so ladies unless you wish to wash your hair at 6.00 am I suggest you bring a shower cap. Better still - management should include them with bathroom disposables.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_230922323~“Handy to the airport.”~Staff were friendly. After an exhausting week I was happy to check into a quiet room to rest before the flight home. If you are on foot - walk out the front gate and turn left...walk up to the lights and turn right......the new precinct under construction has a Subway, IGA and some restaurants and clothing stores. It is still a 10-15 minute drive by taxi to the airport but very close to the port. The only downside was the cleanliness of the bathroom - I mentioned it to the counter staff and she came to clean the tiles near the floor but the splash back still had someone else's toothpaste marks etc so a bit more attention to detail in the bathroom would make it the best place to stay. Modern, quiet, lift to the floors for anyone needing a mobility friendly motel,~4~5~nan~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_230770991~“Great Basic Hotel”~We decided to spend a night in Brisbane during a long layover to the US. The hotel was pretty close to the Airport (10 min taxi ride). It is within walking distance to a few shops and nice restaurants. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The front desk will book your taxi to the airport and a wakeup service is provided.  The room is very basic but clean. Not a very big room but the bed was comfortable. I would recommend this room if you need room for a couple of nights.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_227402186~“Weekend stay”~We found this motel to be in a great location close to shops, pubs and loads of restaurants. The staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you. The rooms are very clean and tidy, the balcony off our room was excellent. This place is great value for money and close to the airport. The free washing machine and dryer did come in handy during our stay. Walking distance to Racecourse Road and Portside made this stay even more enjoyable.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_224136913~“Convenient, safe & friendly”~Solo female traveler on stop-over in Brisbane. Easy to find shuttle at airport & less than 10 minute ride to motel as 1st drop off. Friendly reception, given fresh milk for tea (so welcome). Comfy room with plentiful toiletries so no need to break into case. Felt safe & room was very clean. Option of having breakfast delivered to room. Able to print boarding pass for next plane in reception & punctual transfer back to airport. As an airport stop-over worked very well indeed.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_222776759~“clean, good location, very reasonable price”~I found this hotel to be very clean and modern. It was considerably cheaper than a more dated hotel and it is a good location. It is close to airport. And you also can take Con X shuttle about $15. It close to many good restaurants, you can find verity food along racecourse rd. And also a cruise ship dock near by. I like a mini Brisbane river cruise, CITY CAT where is 10mins by walk. Front desk is very friendly.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_221905560~“clean, modern, and reasonably priced”~My husband and I stayed here for one night prior to our overseas holiday. We found this hotel to be very clean and modern. It was considerably cheaper than a more dated hotel also located on Kingsford Smith Drive. The room was small but okay for 2 people just staying overnight. It was also a very easy drive to our airport car parking/storage the next day. The ensuite had a very handy pull out shaving/make up mirror with very good lighting. We stayed here on a Saturday night and the staff suggested we have dinner at the Eat Street markets: an easy 5 minute walk away. It was nice to taste some international cuisine prior to leaving for our overseas holiday.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_218559403~“Compact and convenient”~I highly recommend this motel if you are looking for a short stay convenient to Brisbane airport. Taxi fare from airport to motel $36, shuttle bus service available one way only from motel to airport, runs houly in morning from about 6am until about 9am, costs $12.50, great value and very convenient, but you definitely need to book the day before, the shuttle service picks up passengers from multiple hotels in the area and when I caught it today there was only one seat spare. Airport Ascot Motel itself was a pleasant surprise for reasonable priced standard room $160. The motel is very well maintained, fresh paint and decor and impeccably clean. Receptionist was extremely helpful and lovely to deal with. There is no restaurant in-house but you can order room service for breakfast, either continental or hot choices, and also they have a basic menu for evening meal room service, but there are heaps of dining choices in walking distance and Hamilton Harbour is across the road and a 10 min walk to choice of restaurants and bars. The motel is on busy Kingsford Smith Drive but my room was located all the way to the back end and Traffic noise was not an issue. My room was quite compact, if you want to do a basic exercise work out it would only just have enough spare floor space, the triangle shower space was almost half size of normal space, so I really mean "compact", but overall a very good standard of decor and cleanliness.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_218544146~“Great Location”~We booked the Ascot for its close proximity to the Cruise Terminal as we were departing on a cruise the next morning. The rooms were clean, had tea and coffee making supplies and a lovely big bed. Easy walking distance to the Portside for restaurants and bars. The motel had a free transfer to the Cruise Terminal, great service especially if its raining but the motel is also close enough if you fancy a walk.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_215482102~“Ducksta”~We stayed for one night before joining our cruise, and 2 nights after. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and even drove us to the cruise terminal. The rooms are small but very warm, quiet and cosy. There is plenty of places to eat nearby a childrens park across the road and only a short walk to the River Ferry. We would happily stay again. Be aware of the Taxi companies, a fare from the airport should be around $30. (Not $47 with a toll!)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_213243276~“A great stay”~Stayed day before taking a cruise and again for a night after cruising. They had a free shuttle service to the port in the morning of the cruise and we were able to be picked up on our return for a $5 fee from the port back to the hotel and we were given an early check in. There is no restaurant at the motel but the port is about a 10 minute walk with an IGA, cinema and restaurants and we found a great seafood restaurant/cafe/take away - Seagrills 3min walk from motel in Nudgee Rd.The service at the motel was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful, found the rooms to be a good size and very clean, shower a bit small though, beds comfortable, had a twin room with one double and one single bed. Ordered a hot breakfast one morning, very nice and well cooked, usual motel pricing. There is a free taxi phone just outside of reception and taxi arrived a couple of minutes after calling, cost to airport was about $20-$25.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_213220523~“Great stopover hotel”~Stayed for one night before flying out of Brisbane. Clean, comfortable, friendly saff. Good comfortable bed and a quiet room.

review_213213615~“Near the Port and some nice restaurants.”~This is a good hotel to stay in if you are going on a cruise that leaves from Brisbane, the rooms are very nice and airy, the air conditioning is good.Some rooms have balconies which give a little more room and fresh air. There a small fridge and tea making facilities in the room. You don't here traffic from nearby street. They don't have a restaurant but down stairs at the front desk the have munchies and drinks in a large fridge that you can buy, or you can go to the Port area; it's about a 10 minute walk; where there are shops and restaurants (including a great Mexican one) and an IGA; also in the street behind there is a large fish shop that sells great fish and chip and other seafood delicacies, but it's quit popular with the locals so you my have to wait for a little while. But it looks like you can phone in an order, so if you get a menu you might want to do it that way. They also have a shuttle service to the Port wharf if you're catching a cruise ship and there is also a direct taxi phone near the entrance to the hotel. all in all it's a nice place to stay if you're catching a cruise the next day.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_212554135~“Handy to port”~Overnight in Airport Ascot ahead of a cruise. No courtesy van from airport. Cab cost around $25. Rooms on the smaller side, but tidy and modern looking, and suprisingly quiet with the busy road alongside. So all in all quite adequate for a 1 night stay. Grabbed a room service cooked breakfast, and took the courtesy van to the dockside ready for a nice cruise.~3~3~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_211815331~“Great place for late flight in and early flight out”~Tossed up between a number of airport hotels as I only needed a bed for 8 hours in between flights coming in and out of Brisbane. Ultimately went with the Airport Ascot and was not expecting an awful lot given that it is in an area that is primarily for layovers, but was pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, quiet, very clean and comfortable. Arrived and departed whilst reception was closed but there is a security box to collect keys and a drop box to leave them the next day. I was impressed that the hotel rang to see what time I was arriving and departing so they could ensure that I could get into my room. There was a kettle, tea and coffee in the room, but it would have been good if there was a vending machine given that reception was closed (and that were the cold drinks and snacks were sold) but went to the hotel next door and took advantage of their offerings.  Would stay here again if I have a layover and recommend it for this purpose. FYI: Please be aware that hotels in this area (and there are about 3 blocks of them) are about a $30-$35 taxi ride from the airport. This is not a fault of the hotel and also not why they are not getting an excellent, rather it's just a general note that Brisbane Airport Hotel's are not actually at the airport, within walking distance of it or even a 5-10 minute taxi trip like most airport hotels are.~4~5~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_210735201~“Really fine layover Motel with day rates”~I had 7 hours to kill and having just stepped off a 14 hour flight from LA all my body could think of was sleep. I found the Airport Ascot 550 on the information board at the baggage area of the airport. Plus: a published day rate. Clean and inviting rooms, friendly accommodating staff,close to airport. Cons: needed to take a taxi as they don't offer a shuttle. I was thrilled to find a hotel that was interested in offering a day rate and everything was great from there on in. Yes I will stay there again and be happy to do so.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_209564980~“It is what it is!”~Location just what we needed for dropping off our motorhome and spending time in the city before flight to NZ the next day. This is just what it says it is and does it very well. Tip: Use the water taxi from almost outside the door to the heart of the city. Taxi arranged by reception was prompt for the airport drop early the next morning. Great Italian restaurant a couple of hundred metres down the road.~5~5~5~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_208450245~“We will stay again”~From the point of arrival, we were made to feel very welcome, and that nothing was too much trouble. We were tired from a long flight and we were early for booking in, but it was no trouble for management, who handed over the keys with no fuss whatsoever. What a relief to be able to just flop on the bed for a quick nap before heading out again! We booked a deluxe room for our three day stay, and it was more than comfortable, with very up to date furnishings. Lovely bathroom. The deluxe rooms are well worth the little extra because they are located in an area of the complex that is devoid of traffic noise, so that we had three undisturbed nights of good sleep in a very comfortable bed. The rooms also seem to be soundproofed, as there was no noise coming from adjacent rooms. The location suited us very well, as there is a ferry at walking distance that takes you on a very enjoyable ride to the city and back again at the end of the day. When came time to head home, because the motel is located on the north side of the city, we did not have to negotiate the horror drive through the middle of the CBD, so that we arrived at the airport in a calm and collected state of mind! Can highly recommend this motel. Would recommend that for the evening meal, you wander down to one of the adjacent restaurants.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_205483226~“Good alternative when overnite airport hotel required”~Being close to Bris airport - booked this for an overnite. Reception was shut up by the time i got there (must close about 800pm or 900pm) but very effective night safe for key pick up. Room was comfortable - albeit not the biggest room I have ever stayed in - but certainly adequate. Shower was a bit on the small side but did the job. I have some mobility issues and this hotel was fine for access with parking downstairs and lifts to all levels. Would certainly stay here again~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_475159429~“Homely”~My wife and i stopped off here one evening after landing at the airport and before moving on to the Gold Coast and other places. The managers at the time very hospitable and personable. Helping us with public transport, the weather and a range if other things.  The hotel itself is probably cheap for Brisbane/ a capital city in Aust. It is in a great location for shops pubs restaurants and public transport including the river ferry! The room was great. Bed comfy and has free parking. Will be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474868079~“Fly, Stay and Cruise”~Perfect spot to stay if your flying into Brissie to go on a cruise, only cost $135 for the night.

review_472311680~“Perfect value for the money”~Booked for one night Monday 27th March due to an early Tuesday morning flight and to save on a very early drive up from where we live on the Gold Coast. On line booking very easy. Price was $140 for a twin room. Over $100 cheaper than the well known chain hotel nearer the airport. Arrived around 7.30 pm and was greeted by a friendly gentleman at reception. Very quick check in and was allocated a quiet room towards the rear of the building on the second floor. Room and bathroom absolutely spotless with good towels in the bathroom and very nice bedding. Not a huge room but a queen bed and extra king single. Neat bathroom with complimentary ammenities, usual tea and coffee with biscuits and a good standard TV. Very comfy beds and aircon that worked effectively. No bar at hotel but you can purchase from reception, they have alcoholic and none alcoholic drinks in a large fridge behind the reception and some snacks. Very reasonable in price much cheaper than your usual hotel bar but you have to consume in your room or on one of the provided outdoor smoking balconies. Breakfast is available if pre ordered. We didn't bother but pricing again looked ok. About a 5 minute walk brings you to a few bars and restaurants, pizza, cafes etc. For a night before a flight (about a 10 to 15 minute drive to BNE) or across the road for the cruise terminal I would very strongly recommended this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_471998112~“Would recommend”~Very clean motel, management are lovely people and they offer a shuttle service to the airport (have to pay for it). We did not know there was a free pickup from the cruise terminal, which is how we got to Brisbane/this hotel so we missed out on using it, but for those reading this if you get off from a cruise and book here you may find this useful. Some eateries nearby (Indian which was closed when we were there and Italian) and a convenience shop as well. Air con/heater works well. Would definitely stay here again. Hopefully the new owners keep the place as good.~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_459006545~“A bit pricey but a clean motel convenient for cruise terminal”~Stayed here overnight pre cruise. Room is of an adequate size, clean with a modern bathroom. Towels are white and fluffy with complimentary toiletries. Plenty of tea and coffee in the room. Allowed to check in early after an overnight flight. Motel is next to a busy road but the glazing is good.  Have given a lower rating as The motel is quite pricey for just room only and no other frills. Breakfast can be pre-ordered ranging from $12 to $20. There is a parade of shops and eateries along Race course road to the right of the motel, 10 to 20 mins walk away. Transport to cruise terminal takes 3 mins and is complimentary.~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_458641921~“Close to airport, near the cruise ship port area”~This is a lovely little motel. It's rooms are modern and clean.They are not overly large, but big enough. We had a Queen room. There is a little fridge and kettle in the room. The hosts at the front desk were welcoming and helpful. It's a couple of blocks walk to the port side area, Eat Street and the City Cat dock, as well as the bus to the downtown. A number of decent restaurants are also within a few blocks walk. Very convenient to the airport if you are just popping thru Brisbane, about 15-20 minutes by cab. You are right on a Main Street, so rooms with a balcony might not be quiet for sitting out, but our room...no balcony...was quite quiet. There is a washer and dryer on the second floor.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_456490669~“Convenient and friendly”~We booked this Motel for one night before starting a Cruise from Brisbane. It was in a convenient location, and they provide a free shuttle to the port and/or a paid transfer to the airport. (They are unable to do pickups from the airport, due to restrictions). It cost us AUD30 for a taxi from the airport to the Ascot. It is within walking distance of the lovely Portside Wharf, where you can find restaurants, shops and a cinema. The staff were particularly friendly and there is free wifi.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_450350184~“NICE SURPRISE”~My brother & his family, and my husband & I, booked this hotel over the New Year weekend for a three & two nights stay respectively, as it was both close to the airport & within walking distance of the New Year's Eve fireworks at Portside. To be honest, there were limited affordable choices available close to the City but as it turned out we were more than happy with our decision. The property looks like it is a little older from the outside but is neat & well maintained. On entry it is easily evident that there have been extensive renovations throughout which makes it overall very comfortable. The rooms are not overly spacious but are well appointed (tea/coffee making, small bar fridge, large flat screen TV, good quality linens) modern but basic in design and importantly, very clean. My brother's family had adjoining/ connecting rooms which very simply allowed ample space for the extra guests. There also was a constant, reasonably fast, free internet connection - unusually it had none of the frequent drop-outs you encounter at most motels! Mini-bar/ snack options were available for purchase from the reception desk during office hours & a basic room service breakfast menu was available if required. I would expect the average guest would only stay here overnight due to it's closeness to the airport, but we found the property's proximity to restaurants, public transport, weekend Eat Street Markets and Portside's amenities also makes it perfect for a longer stay It may not have the bells and whistles that a lot of newer motels have such as a gym, pool or restaurant but everything you need is in easy reach and the free onsite parking is also a bonus not offered at many inner city properties. All the dealings we had with any of the staff were handled professionally and in a friendly manner...there was a hiccup with all our room keycards not being validated for our full stay but the problem was easily rectified. We would definitely stay at this motel again and will happily recommend it to others.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_439144662~“Very nice hotel”~We booked this hotel late at night after a cancelled flight and were very happy with it. The room was light and fresh and the bed very comfortable. It is a 5 minute walk from cafes and restaurants. Would recommend.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_433429141~“Not cleaned Properly”~Our room was not cleaned properly. It looked like the sheets weren't even changed. We found at least 6 long black hairs in the bed. The white quilt cover was stained as well. The bottom of the fridge was full of water and not at all cold. There was a dirty towel left from the last people, hanging up behind the bathroom door.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~2~3~nan
review_433098899~“Excellent stopover prior to cruise”~We had a fantastic two night stopover at the Airport Ascot Motel prior to a P&O cruise departing from Portside Wharf. We were welcomed with the relief managers, who were friendly and able to make recommendations to us on things to see and do during our stay. On cruise departure day we were able to get a free transfer to the terminal from motel staff. The motel features free wi-fi as well as all the usual modern conveniences you expect. Highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431683711~“Very Happy”~Only stayed overnight after cruise. We were very happy with our accommodation - very clean,comfortable and quiet. Close to cruise terminal, Brett's Wharf, airport and Hamilton (?) shopping centre and bus stops there. Staff members very welcoming and friendly. Glad that they have a (very nice) shuttle bus available to airport with a good driver and at a reasonable price.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424847381~“Excellent Motel with great service”~Our family stayed here recently, primarily because it was very close to the cruise terminal. The managers were wonderful and couldn't have been more helpful with local information (places to eat, have coffee etc). The rooms (between our family, we had 2 rooms) were very clean and were of standard motel size. One room had just a queen bed, the other a queen bed and a single. As we stayed 2 nights, our rooms were made by housekeeping between nights. As it's a motel, you get the standard tea and coffee offerings (the Manager was kind enough to give us some more milk when we ran out - at no cost). There is no toaster or other food making/preparation items, other than a few forks and a knife in a drawer. I would have liked to have seen a microwave though to heat or reheat some food from nearby shops or to heat up some food for our seemingly always starving 4 year old. The price was excellent at $125/room - especially since it was a long weekend. The cost also included free wifi - which is better than most other hotels/motels that can provide wifi at an extra cost. Overall, we'll definitely be back to stay again, and would be happy to recommend our friends, family and anyone else to stay at the Airport Ascot Motel.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_421912470~“Wood Chipper running till 3am!”~When booking this room the website asked me if I would like a quiet room. Of course as I was coming in off a 26 hour flight from Sweden I selected yes. On arriving the room was adequate and very clean, but with little on offer in the way of catering. I could only purchase a breakfast pack to consume in the room and I was too tired to go out to find somewhere to eat. Then at midnight the roadworks started outside, complete with a very noisy wood chipper. This went on until 3.00 am. I went out to speak to the workmen, who informed me that this was going on for the rest of the year! I understand that it is not the fault of the Motel, but don't ask me if I want a quiet room when there is a wood chipper running outside the window until 3.00am.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_418194225~“Traveling thru”~Stayed here for an overnight transfer so happy to be close to air Walked around and found eat street great spot for our street food Hotel comfortable and gave us transfer back to airport in morning Not happy I cannot have my say Apparently not enough words Nothing wrong with hotel but just for TripAdvisor Blah blah blah blah blah~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414827012~“Excellent Accommodation & Wonderful Service ”~I checked into this motel yesterday for work and am absolutely impressed by how well maintained and looked after this place is!! The couple managing the hotel are absolute gems!! Viv ( I hope I got the name right) provides exceptional service at all times and is so very accommodating.  My work will continuously bring me to Brisbane and I know where I'd be staying when here:)  The location is also so convenient and handy with easy access to numerous restaurants as well as a woollies across the road. Airport is only a few minutes away as well! Highly recommended place!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414135197~“Wonderful Service!”~My friends and I had a university ball down the road at Moda Events. We were greeted by a lovely lady. Her husband offered to take us to the event down the road in the shuttle bus, free of charge. The room was clean and tidy, the facilities were great and the bed was comfortable. The couple that managers the motel are so friendly, accomodating and they offer exception service. They really did go out of their way to make our stay worthwhile. Would definitely come and stay again and recommended this motel to friends and family.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_413372203~“Great service”~Wonderful service. Managers could not do enough for us. Room was fabulous. One of us was in a wheelchair and this was catered for. Very clean. Great service with the airport shuttle. Highly recommended.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_412575223~“Good value for money”~This airport motel is clean, well maintained and perfectly fine for a night. It's on a busy road so isn't a place you'd stay for a relaxing getaway, but purely for a transit to or from the airport. Its close to a couple of car storage companies as well so it is convenient to drop your car off and get a transfer to the airport by the car storage people. The motel has everything in the room you would need including toiletries. A short drive takes you to either Portside or Racecourse Road for a meal. Perfectly neat and adequate motel.~3~5~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_409857072~“A very good motel”~We stayed for one night before traveling to Bargara. Very good location not to far from the airport. The room and bed were comfortable. It was clean and the price was reasonable. Ample parking. We would stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_409798093~“Clean and Tidy, Friendly Staff”~I stayed here for one night, or most of one at least as I had an early flight out. I was easily able to find it and park my hire car and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room was neat and tidy and while obviously not new there's been an effort to update various aspects. The location is good not only in terms of being relatively close to the airport but also close to many restaurants. For my purpose it was the perfect stay and at a very affordable price.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_402637534~“Great location.....”~We only stayed one night as we were heading off on a cruise. Great location for the dock, Eat Street Markets and not far from Brisbane CBD. Great couple running the Motel and a FREE shuttle service for you and your luggage to the ship. Very neat and clean and smelt really nice! Highly recommend - would stay again for sure!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400513369~“Close to restaurants ”~Pleasant motel and close to some good restaurants. But the shower was unbelievably tiny, difficult to move in and I'm not a big person. Also 5 minutes to DFO. Free parking with some undercover. Friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_398971193~“Clean & comfortable ”~Great hotel close enough to the city but easily accessible to the ship terminal and airport. Good value breakfast and clean rooms, the only thing that distracts a little is the shower cubicle is tiny and the towels really could do with replacing.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397107628~“Four star at three star prices.”~What a great find! This small yet compact motel tucked behind the cruise terminal was just what we needed for our overnight stay before commencing our cruise. The room was modern, exceptionally clean, with everything we needed, including a small balcony. For a small extra charge breakfast was brought to our room. The windows are double glazed so no noise from busy main road and the super friendly and efficient staff were a bonus We even got a lift to the port after a late check out! Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_396447264~“Pleasantly surprised... Use their shuttle from the airport”~My wife booked this as an inexpensive quick overnighter we before my international flight home. For the rate I wasn't expecting much more than a bed but turned out to be a decent place. I took a taxi from the airport to get there and it was 32Aud, the hotel shuttle was only 24Aud back so I should have used it to begin with. Checkin staff was nice, recommended shuttle and places to eat in the area. I like that they had drinks to choose from, and a few snacks available as well. In the morning, door to terminal door was 13 minutes.  It wouldn't be a first choice but I'd stay again without hesitation.  It's on a bus line, but not on the airport train line.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383612097~“Very clean & cosy”~We've stayed at this motel several times and are never disappointed. The rooms are a little small however very clean, comfortable and functional. Free parking is a bonus as is the very close proximity to the airport and city makes it very convenient.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_380059663~“Clean and convenient.”~Short trip from the airport, staff were welcoming and courteous. Our host upgraded us to a twin room when he found that we were friends travelling so we didn't have to share the bed. Bathroom clean and fresh looking. Problem happened when the shower was running, a major flood occurred as the water leaked at the side near the toilet. 2 bathtowels and the bath at were unequal to the task. Not too easy to get dinner at night, but continental breakfast is available I think. We left early, 6.30am, and it was not offered. Would stay again, mostly because of convenience and the reception staff.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_379872725~“Short stay”~Stayed in a standard Queen room. Small but cosy, mini fridge and tea/coffee supplies. In room safe also handy. Bathroom was tidy, small shower, the towels were also small/old/rough and could be replaced. The couple running the place were so friendly and helpful with tips for eating out. They make it worth the stay!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_352573886~“Great for a quick overnight stay”~This hotel was great for a quick overnight stay in Brisbane. It's very close to the airport, has free parking & friendly staff. Our room was well fitted out, clean and fresh. Hamilton Portside Wharf is just down the road with lots of food options which was really handy. Cannot really fault. Was exactly what we were looking for.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_344189265~“Good option ”~They offer an airport shuttle and are conveniently near the airport parking located. Some restaurants and takeaways near the motel available, but some of them might close pretty early.  Good value for money.  Does it's job.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335133033~“Returned again”~Stayed a second time one year later when we were holidaying in Aussie again. Clean and tidy rooms, a little on the small side but fine for 1 night. Main attraction is the handy location to ports and the owner gave us a complimentary ride to the Tangalooma wharf area. Cooked breakfast was good and filling. Friendly, helpful staff.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_334985716~“Good budget accommodation”~Not overpriced, very clean. Friendly helpful staff.  Nothing flash, no mini bar, but does provide breakfast to room. Smoking balconies on each floor.  Close to ferries and public transport.  Restaurants and hotel for meals nearby - walking distance.  Although we didn't use, I'm told has shuttle to airport or cruise terminal.  Lifts to each floor, easily accessible.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_332776420~“Does the job”~This small hotel fulfils most of what I think it is . A motel handy to the airport as well as other shopping/ eating precincts like Racecourse road and Eat Street markets. It's on busy, one way Kingsford Smith drive, so don't go past it like we did as you have to do quite a loop to get back! Nevertheless it's in a good position with parking underneath. Staff were very friendly and offered us a little carton of fresh milk on arrival.  Shower cubicle was small but the bedroom was not a bad size. The shower screen door didn't seal properly- I told the reception about this.  All in all a reasonably good value newish place.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_330108013~“Friendly Comfortable Quality Motel”~Affordable, comfortable, well positioned motel near the Brisbane Airport. Rooms not overly large, shower a little cramped depending on what room you get, but neat, tidy and clean. Air conditioned, recycled rain water used in the toilets, laundry, power saving, environmentally friendly ideas all over. Very friendly reception and kitchen staff. No restaurant but they do have a kitchen, which provides solid good value breakfasts and dinners (dinners I never tried). But why use their kitchen when you are surrounded by a myriad of different restaurants only ten minutes away? Italian, Thai, seafood, Sushi, Japanese, Pizza, the choice is almost limitless. Not far away from the Riverside restaurant precinct complete with lovely riverside walk, Movenpic, and Max Brenner my favourite chocolate bar.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_326818739~“Quiet, clean but small.”~We booked a room billed as a 2 bedroom apartment and I guess it was but it didn't have lounge-room or a lounge and as a result was quite small for three adults. Staff were friendly and helpful. Convenient to the airport, racecourses and to the Hamilton Hotel which serves fantastic steaks. Our room was to the back of the building and surprisingly quiet.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_324970630~“Great Place to Recover from Jetlag!”~We flew from LAX to Brisbane and stay two nights at the Airport Ascot Motel. Our intent was to spend two quiet days before setting off for four weeks of travel throughout Australia. The Airport Ascot was a perfect choice - it was quiet, comfortable and spotlessly clean - plus the location was perfect: close but not too close to the airport, and a short walk to the City Cat Ferry, city buses which went to the CBD, and several options for meals. We were also fairly close to the Telstra store where we needed to purchase SIM cards for our cell phones. The motel staff was cheerful and very helpful. All and all a good choice for a no-frills accommodation near the airport.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_319896745~“Will Always come back”~Service in this Hotel is faultless & the room comfy.  Small Hotel but good.  I travel for Business & like a quiet comfy stay away from home. This Hotel delivers.  A short distance from Ascot Restaurants.  I used to stay up the road at Quality Airport International Hotel: was the best move.  Always coming back to this Hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
