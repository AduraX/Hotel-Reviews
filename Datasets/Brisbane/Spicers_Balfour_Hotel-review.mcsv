review_477907387~“Hidden Gem”~Had an overnight stay for our anniversary. Only one night which was not enough to truly enjoy this hidden gem. Drove past it at first and did not notice this hotel tucked away in a suburban street. Stayed in a suite in the art deco building three doors down the street. Big room, very unique style but it works. Bed awesome. Menu at the in house restaurant not extensive but definitely tasty. Lovely setting sitting on the deck of the old Queenslander for dinner. Service at dinner ok but not outstanding. Meals for breakfast - pulled pork omelette was extremely tasty. Service at breakfast was a chore. Would be a great base to explore Brisbane over a leisurely week.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~3~nan
review_472005932~“Boutique Hotel in great location”~This is a great boutique hotel in New Farm (a cool city fringe suburb). Easy walk to nearby James Street for great shopping (fashion and interiors) and lots of places to eat. The staff are so friendly and helpful. It all feels very personal and nothing seems a bother. The restaurant is excellent. Varied breakfast options (included in room rate). A colleague and I had lunch in the restaurant and that was a great experience too (even had my favourite kiwi bubbles - pelorus!) I have booked to return in June and will be using their board room for a couple of meetings. They have been very accommodating about getting this organised.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_464623659~“Perfect getaway right in the hub of Brisbane”~We stayed for one night for our wedding Anniversary. Love Spicers Hotels and this one didn't disappoint. We choose a mid week package which was excellent value for money and included high tea, two course dinner which was actually 3 courses plus full breakfast and unlimited coffee/ tea. Loved the honesty system with drinks bar and the upstairs Bar had the most unbelievable views across the Story Bridge towards the City.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_462833104~“Relaxing & comfy city stay”~Lovely place for a city stay, handy location. The rooms were smallish but very clean and stylish. A little nosiy at times with people having a good time at the restaurant closeby but not too bad. The bed was amazingly comfortable and had the best night's sleep. The dinner menu is not for vegetarians but there are plenty of places nearby to eat & drink. Try the roof top lounge for a cocktail, wine or spirit. A cosy spot for a pre-dinner drink or in our case, we watched the city with the Story Bridge in the foregraouund transform from day to night. The breakfast was very good. Staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Great place for a little get away.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_458383495~“Lovely visit”~Wonderful place to stay in Brisbane. Close to the city without being in the centre of all the bustle. Staff very helpful and attentive to guests needs. Very relaxing. Old style building with modern renovated rooms. Breakfast was delicious.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_456793532~“What a Wonder!”~On a hot Brisbane night we dined on the verandah with a cool breeze to make the evening. The food was exceptional and the cool white wine complimented the food. The General Manager Sam Giles was attentive to our needs and the staff were delightful. This restaurant is branching out to assist the Asian community to experience fine Australian dinning. There is also accommodation available. A must visit if you are in Brisbane!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456534643~“First class accommodation and unbeatable service”~Spent 3 nites recently in a suite. This is absolutely a first class boutique hotel in every respect. The property is very conveniently located but on a quiet street providing best of both worlds in a city the size of Brisbane. Our room, which was in the annex 2 doors down, was spotless and very well appointed with a comfortable bed and a nice sitting area to stretch out in. This is something you would expect in this class hotel. What really made it special was the absolutely top flight service. It started with the pre-visit personal email contact to address our special dietary needs. It extended to personal recommendations from staff to setting up a take away breakfast on the day we had an early departure for our trip to Lady Elliott Island and the GBR. The cooked breakfasts (included) were quite gourmet and very plentiful. We did not need to eat again until dinner! Thank you Sam (manager) for making our stay so pleasant. You have an outstanding hotel with a very special staff, including yourself - bravo!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456073306~“Nice Small Boutique Hotel”~We had 2 nights as part of our East Coast tour. Our room wasn't ready on arrival (we were early) so we were shown to a small outside terrace and given tea. When we did check in we found that we had been upgraded (free) to a Balfour Suite located in the hotel annex 45 metres down the hill. The suite wasn't particularly large but it was very nice indeed - freshly and tastefully decorated with a nice king bed and a small lounge area with TV. There was terrestrial TV and foxsat in the bedroom. Within the annex is an honesty bar with beer, wines, spirits and soft drinks - however there were no prices displayed so we avoided using this. Breakfast was served on the 1st floor in the main building and was nice - a la carte and no buffet options. The range of food available would cater to almost all tastes I would imagine. The best way to get around Brisbane is on the river using the FastCat service - the hotel supplied us with GoCards, which, if you've ever been to London are similar to Oyster Cards - you simply touch the card on a reader as you embark and again on disembarkation - no need for cash, and cheaper than buying single tickets. The hotel then charged us for our usage on check out. The ferry terminal is a 15 minute walk from the hotel. We had cocktails one evening on the rooftop terrace - they were weak and expensive. Outside of 5-7pm that bar too has an honesty policy. Service from everyone we encountered was of a high standard and all in all a good stay and a refreshing change from the big chain hotels.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454424258~“Loved it!”~Gorgeous old Queenslander converted into a boutique hotel. We loved the decor and gardens and the rooftop bar was fantastic. It's located in a residential street of New Farm, but close to everything (about a 15 min walk to the closest Citycat terminal). Breakfast was amazing and staff were all friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to staying here again soon!~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_454157946~“Few truly achieve what they advertise........this did.”~Many hotels advertise, luxury, personalised service and attention to detail however few truly achieve it. This hotel did. Even before we arrived the email communication was thoughtful and helpful. On arrival the staff could not have been more welcoming and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_453914671~“I want to move in! ”~On our long road trip from Melbourne to Sydney then Lord Howe Island to Brisbane, this hotel has been the most luxurious and confortable by a mile. We reserved a suite which was really a renovated 1940s deco apartment. The bed was so comfortable I had difficultly leaving it and the bathroom was equipped with a large bath and a spacious shower. Our included breakfast was from a menu that provided a much more tempting choice than the usual hotel buffet. Staff were polite and attentive.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451132675~“Good first stop”~Spicers Balfour was the first stop in our month long, multi stop trip to the East Coast of Australia . We stayed two nights and it did the job! Our room was small but well thought out, and little extras like fresh milk and on demand water made all the difference. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows too high for our liking. A choice would have been appreciated. Shower was good, and I liked the toiletries. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. A real plus was the roof garden, which we enjoyed on a couple of occasions, with a honesty bar. We would have liked a greater range of soft drinks, but plenty of variety of beers!  We ate breakfast and dinner at the Spicers. Dinner was faultless- a real delight. Lots of fresh produce and clever ideas. The presentation was superb too. The breakfast choice was wide, and we enjoyed the fresh fruit to start.  Overall a good stay, and we would recommend a visit!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_451118414~“Home from home”~This hotel is more than a hotel, it's just like being at home but with outstanding service and staff to make it so special. Sam and his team are fantastic. Nothing is too much trouble for them, they go that extra mile to make it happen. Breakfast was plentiful and certainly the granola is a must have. Our room was well appointed with decent a/c and a fabulous bathroom with excellent amenities. I sincerely recommend this property if you want to be different. Can't wait to return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450709463~“Perfect Anniversary ”~From the staff to the room to the roof top bar and the restaurant for an anniversary dinner and breakfast this little boutique hotel was an excellent stay.  Relaxing stay at the end of a heck trip, no need to leave once we arrived. Will be on the list of places to stay in Brisbane going forward. Well appointed room with a tub to stretch out in and soak.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450285344~“Superb Spicers”~We stayed in Suite 13 at Spicers Balfour Hotel. It was absolutely superb. Faultless. The bed was a dream (excuse the pun) the furnishings and fittings excellent. Equal to any thing in Europe. The breakfast which was included in the tarrif was one of the best we have had.The special way the eggs were cooked were great and the BACON was fantastic.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437632372~“A different city experience”~An excellent stay. The building is an old Queenslander and despite the best efforts of a "cool"designer will always be so. Breakfast on the verandah was a marked change from the usual city experience. Dinner the night before was excellent, helped and enhanced by two knowledgeable young lady servers. Room was modern and adequate. The ensuite however, caused me great amusement. No doors, in the modern (but inappropriate) style, dimly lit, with wc and shower separated by the use of a hospital-style bed curtain rail system and dark blue curtains....... bring your own torch ! The only real black mark was earned by the sharp, exposed, vertical angle in the toilet grab rail. A fall by an elderly person and it could be QC's at twenty paces.  All things considered, a good experience. The restaurant is outstanding.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437266024~“Hidden gem”~I was looking for understated luxury; a quiet and relaxing night away from home to mark a special occasion. This was perfect. The guest service was terrific and breakfast was delicious. More than this though, it was the ambience and attention to detail that made our stay feel intimate and effortless. A great find, well located and only 8km from home~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436728286~“High tea for 7 - no complimentary Veuve Cliquot”~In celebration of a friend's 50th, seven of us enjoyed a $55 per/head high tea. There was some confusion at the outset about our being there for high tea not lunch which the staff/chef accommodated. Service was excellent. Rather disappointing when paying to discover that if 6 or more people book for high tea, they'll receive a complimentary bottle of Veuve. We did not receive this.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434930551~“Quiet and comfortable”~Stayed for one night on our way back home. Renovated old building, well located close to the river and a few cafes and shops. Staff unreal and the breakfast is one of the best we have ever had. Not a crumb left over. Rooms are small but well appointed. Carpark available for the hire car.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433763553~“A magnificent boutique Hotel”~We recently stayed at the gorgeous Spicers Balfour Hotel with our parents who we treated to the stay on their visit to Brisbane with us. The service is impeccable and staff so welcoming and thoughtful. We were upgraded with a suite enabling us to be close to our parents who we booked one for - an incredibly generous gift by the hotel. The suites are beautifully decorated, spacious and comfortable. We all enjoyed a sensational dinner at the restaurant, every dish a taste sensation - service was attentive and helpful throughout. Breakfast, well true to form, also brilliant. Parents, as did we, had a wonderful stay and will be sure to return to wonderful oasis in the heart of Brisbane. Note, the suites are located in a gorgeoulsy renovated art deco building a mere 40 metres from the reception, restaurant and other rooms which located in the exquisitely renovated Queenslander of the main building. Regarding accessibility, there are only stairs and no lift in the suites building, although our elderly parents had no trouble with them.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_433098281~“Lovely boutique hotel”~We recently had 3 nights at this lovely place. Check in was quick and friendly and our suite was beautifully appointed. Breakfast was included in our rate and was delicious and very generous. As part of our package, we had a 3 course meal in the restaurant and enjoyed it so much we went back the next night to try some of the other things on the menu.  The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Citycat wharf but we also walked to the city along the water one day (about half an hour and well worth it). Also walking distance to lots of little cafes.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_430670136~“Perfect....again....”~Our second visit to our favorite place in Brisbane was more heavenly than the first time. We were upgraded to the suites a couple of steps away from the main hotel....it was AMAZING!!!! Spotlessly clean...great coffee & tea...top notch soaps shampoos etc. Lovely to have our own wee conservatory...also was so nice to see some of the same wonderful staff since our last visit. Breakfast was once again TOPS!! Cannot wait to return and see Sam and everyone else again soon!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428523531~“A beautiful boutique hotel”~From the lead up emails anticipating our arrival, to the quick and easy and friendly check in, to the delightful roomy well appointed room, to the drinks on the rooftop bar, to the wonderful breakfast, this is a really lovely hotel. My wife and I loved this hotel and will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_426269454~“This place has spoiled hotels for me. Single best hotel I have stayed bar none.”~My first impression was a bit unsure as it really didn't appear like a hotel I normally stay in for a business trip, it actually looks more like an upper class restaurant from the front and has no indications of the hotel behind it.  It isn't a high rise, or casino hotel or anything I am used to from the major cities, but once inside, everything is polished, clean, smells fancy (think Anchorman "I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany") and the service at the door is friendly and immediate. I was upgraded to the suites two doors down without asking or expecting (which considering I had started my day at 2:30am and it was about 5pm at the time was the absolute highlight of my day) and ended up in what I would not describe as a hotel room at all, but more the perfect bedroom I would love to design in my house, with a view of the Brisbane skyline from the huge balcony.  They have both a shower and a bath in the suites old style (but obviously newly re-done) bathroom which I can only describe as warm and inviting. The breakfasts are just amazing, I normally order a full breakfast at a hotel to start the day off well and get the normal just 'okay' plate of a couple of sausages and eggs, but the thing that came out was not only enormous, but presented on the plate like an upper class restaurant (this is a hotel breakfast now, not what I expected at all). Still though, what spoiled the hotels the most for me were the staff. I was treated fantastically the entire time and felt like a regular even though this was my first time ever staying there. I would love for this place to stay hidden so I can always get a room there when I get sent to Brisbane, but they really deserve getting noticed for the fantastic hotel they have.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_423576846~“A jem in Brisbane”~We had a fantastic stay at Spicers Balfour Hotel during our honeymoon in Australia. This lovely boutique hotel is in a beautiful traditional Queenslander and is a real character hotel. The room we had was tasteful and very comfortable. We loved the attention to detail, the coffee machine, the lovely water bottle, and the quality toiletries etc. The view from the rooftop bar was a delight. However, the main highlight was definitely the food! We had a three course meal and breakfast included. We found both dinner and breakfast to be really outstanding. It was clear that they used good quality ingredients and the chef is also super. The service was also great, all the staff were very helpful. We look forward to staying there again -- when we are next in Brisbane!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_421304682~“My new favourite place to stay in Brisbane!”~I will never stay in a chain hotel in Brisbane again - this place is everything you want and need! Super close to the CBD, surrounded by cool little restaurants and bars and staffed by an awesome team! From the help yourself roof top bar that is superbly stocked to the boutique restaurant with sensational food this place rocks.  The rooms are well equipped with everything you need and perfectly clean. Very reasonable prices for rooms and literally felt like we were coming home to friends every night. Definitely coming back and telling everyone!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_417768220~“Our wedding night accommodation”~We hired one of the suites for our wedding night and it was beautifully appointed and spacious. The location was also ideal for us being close to our wedding reception. Breakfast was fabulous and included some creative options. Off-street carparking is a bonus in an area where street parking can be a challenge. The negative for us with this stay was the communication. When we booked we requested early check-in and late check-out and were advised that "someone" would let us know several days before the booking if this could be granted but no one did. Disappointingly neither could be accommodated.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_416693555~“Will stay again”~Lovely property. Very personal staff and loved the fact that you felt like you were staying in someone's house. Food was amazing. Self serve roof top bar with honour system really impressed. Will definitely be staying again.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_415145200~“Met all our expectations”~From the moment we arrived we knew wouldn't be disappointed. Staff were friendly and helpful, our suite (an upgrade) provided all we needed for a total getaway. Long stemmed roses, chocolate dipped strawberries and an indulgence pack added to the luxury.

review_412712307~“Beautiful Property”~We had stayed at and really enjoyed Spicers Properties in the past and decided to stay here for our very short stay in Brisbane. Glad we did....The suite was very comfortable and the bathroom was roomy. We were meeting friends so didn't get to have dinner but the very tasty breakfast on the balcony was delightful in the winter sunshine and nicely informal. The staff were very friendly, professional but not stuffy and the booking online was easy and friendly too. The location was very quiet and it was easy to forget you are in a large city. Would definitely stay again if back in Brisbane in the future.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_409136836~“brilliant place”~Terrific, very comfortable, clean and with great staff who obviously care for the hotel in every sense. I won't repeat everything in the reviews above ... But I agree with them.  I would add though that the breakfasts are to die for! I thought the Four Seasons, Istanbul, Sunday brunch was the tops but It has been topped by the Balfour breakfast .... Admittedly simpler but brilliant!~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_409084744~“Relaxing boutique hotel”~My wife and I stayed in the Balfour Suites and thoroughly recommend the roomy calm ambience, the service,the food and the location. We booked a room with breakfasts included where you can order off the menu whatever you wish- everything we had during our 3 day stay was delicious. We also immensely enjoyed our dinner on the balcony, food was top class- we invited friends who live in Brisbane and they said this was one of their favourite places to eat too. We had originally booked into the regular hotel rooms but were kindly upgraded to the Suites section- thanks Balfour staff! Dealing with friendly staff on-line and in person was easy, and our experience was faultless. It's a very pleasant 20 minute walk to the CBD along the river, and good public transport links close by if you don't have a car. Much more relaxing than a big city hotel. We will be return customers!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_409043059~“Amazingly Romantic Getaway”~The room was beautiful, nice sunny area at the front of the room, with the sun streaming through leadlight windows. The bedroom was very tidy, and set out beautifully. The bathroom was next level amazing. Heated shower floor, with a very comfortable size shower. The bath...the bath was astronomically huge, it felt like I could swim laps in it. The staff were very accommodating, they even helped organise a massage. The breakfast were just devine. The decor of the whole room was as promised Art Deco. I couldn't fault anything.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_407216873~“Stylish, thoughtful, personable hospitality”~If you live in a lovely home that’s stylishly decorated and thoughtfully appointed, then Spicers Balfour is truly your home away from home in Brisbane. I’ve stayed here several times when travelling for business, and just keep returning. The hospitality has the feel of a very tasteful, generous friend rather than a business hotel. And that friend is also a masterchef and expert mixologist – the food is imaginative and nurturing (as are the cocktails). I also love the location in New Farm – it’s easy to go for a run along the river, pop down to a James St hairdresser or beautician or stroll down Brunswick St and New Farm Park to lunch at Watt at the Powerhouse. It’s about a 10 minute walk to the main city. I’ve stayed in the separate block of suites on each occasion, which has been perfect, providing a lovely annex area to work. Staff will bring restaurant meals and drinks to your room if you can’t duck away to the lovely al fresco restaurant. My only tip for improvement is the wine list.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_404895097~“I want to be back there now!”~I felt this was a great base for a few days in Brisbane, a bit of a walk but it is a lovely walk to town. It felt a real oasis in the city. The rooms were lovely and very relaxing. The food in the restaurant (especially the breakfasts) was amazing. Well worth staying here, stayed in the main block rather than the separate one, being close to the restaurant was no bother. Really enjoyable stay-boutique style.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

We stayed in the Balfour Suite which is two block away from the main hotel, it's a quiet yet accessible neighborhood. Room is big and comfortable, love the 'mature art decor' style.

The queen room i stayed in was well appointed, quiet and bed was comfortable. Room size is small but it has everything you want from bluetooth speaker, nespresso machine, fridge and kettle. The highlight here is the breakfast and the staff who works in the restaurant! food is amazing from presentation, taste and great service the staff provide. Best of all free parking to avoid crazy $50 parking fee at more central hotels.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

We have wanted to stay here for several years, but as we are locals, we just haven't got around to it. Everything was brilliant - the immaculate room and facilities, the most amazing food imaginable with a substantial beverage list, an upstairs open bar area that is just the best place to enjoy pre-dinner drinks, and the friendliest and most helpful staff we have experienced anywhere. Thanks for a wonderful experience.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

Cleanliness and maintenance of the room was exceptional. A variety of pillows and plenty of divine towels and bathroom linen makes ALL the difference.  Balfours Restaurant, onsite at hotel, was outstanding! Both breakfast and dinner menus are a delight and the Chef/s are to be congratulated! Superb.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_387617981~“Great Boutique hotel in New Farm.”~This is an ideal hotel if you like to stay out of, but close to the city. The welcome is warm and friendly and there is adequate off street parking. The highlight of this cute hotel is the restaurant. Three meals are available. The food is amazing..... Fresh, plentiful and innovative. There is a small cute bar on the roof of the hotel with wide views of the city. Some of the rooms are a little small, but well equipped and comfortable. We did find the beds too soft for our liking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386598119~“Top Class Boutique Hotel”~Stayed here for a week as a base to explore Brisbane and the nearby coastal areas.  Fabulous hotel, great rooms and lovely service. Only a small hotel and some rooms are in an annex 100 metres from the main hotel (which is a tiny drag when you have to go for breakfast in the rain !!!), but otherwise nothing to fault this hotel.  Bonus of free parking and it is only a short walk to the river ferries that get you into Brisbane Centre in 10 - 20 minutes - depending on if you choose the quicker City Cat or the slower City Hopper  Great experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Rooftop bar was great for pre dinner drinks - great menu. As per our previous experiences, service was next level. This property clearly prides itself on its people, who are very professional and passionate about their work. The price is on the more expensive end - but you definitely get what you pay for.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_385683792~“Awesome place to stay”~Awesome staff. Great location. Easy walk to the city. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. The food at the restaurant is divine! The hotel had an intimate feeling and was great for a small group conference. It's not the cheapest, but if your looking for style and appreciate the value of comfort, then this is it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384726195~“It's the little details that matter”~Wonderful experience. Dinner was superb - we were asked about the occasion and were surprised when our dessert was brought out with "happy birthday" and "happy anniversary" written on choco bark pieces.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_384435254~“Inner City Sanctuary”~My husband I stayed overnight for a birthday celebration. We live locally and really enjoyed having such a lovely sanctuary to escape to so close to home. The food, as always at Spicer's properties, was delicious and thoughtfully designed. A designer room, quaint rooftop bar with cocktails, amazing food and a very comfortable bed made our experience one that we were very happy with.~5~4~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_384067713~“Spicers Balfour”~Amazing hotel and restaurant. I cannot recommend this boutique hotel enough. I held my 35th birthday dinner in the Balfour Room and it was perfect. I stayed in one of the suites which was gorgeous. I can't wait to stay again!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_383036116~“Oasis in the city”~Wonderful place to stay. Like anhome away from home. We will be back. Relaxed and comfortable. Very good service. The restaurant is top notch.

review_382948269~“Awesome place to stay in every which way”~We have never put the "prefect" word in any reviews until now!! Peaceful-quaint & a little quirky (honesty drinks bar) extremely clean & nice coffee & tea in our room, which is a biggie for us! The highlight has been the gourmet brekkies, wow what breakfasts! We are still staying at this most perfect getaway and can't wait for tomorrow brekkie time! I recommend the big breakfast! Everything is simply amazing, unfortunately I didn't get our server or the chefs name however I did tell her it was the yummiest food and thanked her, the service we have found very friendly and helpful (our morning waiter) lovely man, THank you Spicers for this wonderful experience,~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382609493~“Hidden oasis.”~Wonderful find through Tripadvisor. Clean, modern facilities due to recent renovations. Easy to find. Easy access for all vehicles. Loved the area. could walk anywhere and there would be a wonderful coffee place or a small group of trendy shops, close to river and ferry and very close to fabulous entertainment at the Powerhouse. Staff are brilliant, so polite and helpful. would highly recommend.~4~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_382582560~“Spicers Balfour”~Staying at a Spicers is always a treat. If you're looking for something a little bit special, away from the big hotels, then I highly recommend. It's within easy walking distance to New Farm and Fortitude Valley. The service is exceptional and the rooms are beautifully appointed.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_380067316~“Restaurant or Hotel?”~Room 1 is beautifully positioned at the front of the hotel but very noisy as a result of the restaurant being right beside you. Some room maintenance issues during our stay such as a temporary fridge, noisy air vent and bedside light under repair. Disappointing that the weekend package only included one side dish for two people at dinner - this was not clear in the detail and seems a bit pedantic considering the overall spend. Seems to be more of a restaurant than a hotel. - everything is geared around the restaurant. The roof top bar is of little attraction in inclement weather.~3~2~4~4~3~5~4~nan
review_379832675~“Wonderful Experience at Spicers Balfour Hotel”~We stayed for one night to celebrate my husbands birthday and was kindly given an upgrade to one of the suites. It was absolutely beautiful and very comfortable. We had such a lovely experience, everything was perfect. The staff are so friendly and welcoming and the hotel is quiet and intimate. We had drinks on the roof top bar which included complimentary canapes for guests staying at the hotel, dinner and breakfast the next day all beautifully cooked and served. This hotel is a must do in Brisbane, its high end luxury and personal enough, so you don;t feel like you are in just another hotel room. Wonderful from beginning to end. Thankyou so much~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_377774305~“Luxury minutes from the city”~We stayed in a suite and it was beautiful. Quiet, comfortable and close to restaurants and shopping. The decor was really nice, the place looked like it was either brand new or had been recently renovated.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_377195192~“What a delight to find Spicers Balfour Hotel!”~From arrival to departure the service was 1st rate. This excellent service continued after we arrived home and I rang to enquire about the wonderful pillows. Sam could not have been more helpful, thank you! We certainly will be return guests to your delightful hotel with the divine beds & pillows. Had a blissful nights sleep!~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_376828685~“First time, but not the last.”~Stayed on a fairly quiet Tuesday night so had no problem parking in the small off street car park. Checkin was smooth and efficient. We were hungry so after a quick change headed to the quaint roof top bar for a drink then dinner. The bar was fairly dark and being an 'honesty' bar an unusual set up, but we enjoyed the experience and the view of the Storey Bridge and the city. Only gripe was the lack of ice or maybe my inability to locate it in the murk! Dinner was excellent, great presentation and interesting tastes from a combination of ingredients. Would visit again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376557505~“What a gem!! Such a cool boutique hotel experience!”~Spicers was great and a great value! Found a great trip advisor deal that included breakfast and was sooo impressed. Breakfast was excellent, I'd have driven here just for the breakfast. The hotel only has 7 rooms or something (although I think there's a separate building down the street with more rooms). The upstairs terrace with the "honesty bar" has the greatest view and the cutest seating area. And the location is perfect to walk over to the story bridge, chinatown area or to james street in Fortitude Valley. Would definitely recommend staying here!!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_376361870~“A bit let down”~Having stayed at a few different Spicer establishments and was really looking forward to this hotel but left a little disappointed.Arriving at 6pm I approached reception and rang the little bell and then waited for 4 minutes - I then approach a chef walking down the stairs and asked for some assistance - he then called out to a waitress who came down and checked me in. Room 3 was underwhelming and the only good thing I could say was that it had a great bathroom!Mini Bar was tiny with poor selection and full of chocolate treats. The staff told me the rooftop bar was temporality closed which was a let down so I dinned in the restaurant and had the steak tartare - very ordinary. Sorry I cant say that I was thrilled by this hotel,it would suit some but not me.On a high note the scrambled eggs for breakfast was superb.Wifi access code was not given on check in which was annoy~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_375334865~“What can I say? only the truth!”~This Hotel was not what I'd expected. I thought that the Hotel looked wonderful on their web site, something special out of town. It was out of town but not special. What WAS special was the Staff. Arriving at night, I was welcomed by Sam. Sam told me that he'd upgraded me to another room in their other building about 200 metres away. Sam went out of his way to make me feel comfortable, showing me a room in the main building before helping with my luggage to the other beautiful building. I was on my own so although I didn't like the idea of having to walk to the main Hotel, I could see the advantage of having a much larger room with - a blessing! a small courtyard with a table and chairs. My biggest dislike were the permanent full covers set over ALL the bedroom windows, ( I assume for privacy from next door) leaving only a small space to allow light in to the room. The lights had to be on at all times and it still wasn't bright. I wonder about the possibility of a fire - How would you get out if you couldn't leave the room? I appreciated the comfortable bed and comfortable furnishings but hey - we all see things differently! I can't say enough about the staff but other than that this just wasn't for me. Note: The roof top bar is not quite what is portrayed in the photographs on the web site. I have posted a separate review on the lovely restaurant.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_375267094~“An unforgettable experience”~First of all we were pleasantly suprised by Youlande when she told us that we had been given a complimentry upgrade to the Balfour Suites for our 2 day stay. She was very helpful, intuitive and had great local knowledge in regards to our wedding plans and needs. Moreover, the food was of exceptional quality, and our wedding venue in the courtyard was very simple but elegant, just as we wanted. The wedding card from the hotel management was a great personal touch. The service from the staff exceeded our expectations. If you are planning a small intimate wedding, the Spicers on Balfour Hotel is definetly the place to be. We highly recommend it.  Pat& Kasa~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_374679951~“Best hotel experience ever!!”~Absolutely amazing hotel. Large spacious and immaculately clean room that had been meticulously restored and renovated.

Thank you for an amazing get away.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_374332193~“GREAT LOCATION, EXCELLENT FOOD, FRIENDLY & EFFICIENT STAFF”~Quiet location close to city. Bus ride to city centre takes only minutes. Extensive menus serving quality produce, beautifully presented by friendly, efficient staff. Complimentary canapes are served in the evening at the Rooftop bar which has great views of the Story Bridge and the city. Rooms are beautifully decorated and amenities are first class.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_373187001~“Romantic night away”~We had a lovely night away at Spicers Balfour to celebrate my husbands birthday.  The service and food at the hotel were fantastic, and it was a lovely walk along the river to dinner in Brisbane city. Would definitely stay there again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
