review_150639009~“Beats staying in a caravan park”~Has this facility been demolished? The last time I stayed it was up for sale. The location was convenient and it was reasonably cheap. Furniture and fittings were old and worn, but the location and price meant these were accepted.~3~3~4~3~3~2~3~nan
review_95524231~“Good price, well presented 3 bd unit”~We found the 3 bedroom ground floor unit to be clean and tidy. The older style suited us for a relaxing few days in Brisbane. Good size bedrooms and storage and car parking was very convenient. The kitchen was a good size and had a good selection of cookware and utensils. Great location close to the city. Highly recommended if you have a family. My parents also stayed in a 2 bedroom unit and found this to be an ideal location and they especially liked the price. We all enjoyed the swimming pool which was private and beautiful on a warm summer's evening~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_91268680~“Overpriced & dirty”~The whole complex was dirty including our room, it was a worse story in my parents room, we ended up staying one night, being charged for two and moving on to Darhl Court in Springhill, a far superior establishment.~1~1~4~2~1~1~1~nan
