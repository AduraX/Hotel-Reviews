review_478322368~“Awesome for a family. ”~The location is AMAZING!! There is so much to do in Southbank with pools and the playgrounds and live music and world class buskers etc. huge range of restaurants and coffee shops. There is also a proper supermarket and the movie theatre an easy walk away.  The king suite is big enough for the whole family, loads of storage and drawers etc to unpack. The pull out couch was ok- fine for kids.  My biggest gripe during our 7 night stay was the grossly inadequate kitchenette, but then I checked their website and realised they don't claim to have a kitchenette!  At the time we booked I wanted to rent a house on Airbnb and my husband wanted to stay in a hotel for the location. I wanted a kitchen for the convenience and cost saving. He showed me the photos of the king suite and said- look, it's got everything you need for breakfasts and lunches etc. However, as it turns out this is just a generous minibar and tea/coffee making area. There are no bowls for cereal (only flat plates) and no toaster, so you can't even prepare a simple breakfast. One night I bought some Microwave meals because we were sick of going out to dinner and I had to buy plastic plates to serve it on, as there are only 2 plates in the cupboard, despite it sleeping 4 (with the pull out couch.) That aside--- this place gets my thumbs up as being ideal for 2-3 nights for a family.  It's very modern, excellent staff, clean and the views are fabulous if you get above floor 4 facing the river.  We had little ones get sick during our stay and the staff were very quick to send up cleaners and new sheets etc, they steamed the carpets. Very reassuring.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478306903~“Pleasantly surprised”~I was pleasantly surprised with my stay here, it was more than I was expecting. The staff were so friendly on arrival. There was a poblem with my room as the bed was broken and without hesitation they moved me to another room and apologised, even offering a bottle of wine (I declined but it was a nice gesture). The breakfast was OK, needs improvement, I would have liked to try the outdoor one but weather was bad and it was not open. The rooms were surprisingly large which I did not expect. Location in Southbank was good and easily walkable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478113446~“Great Position and Faultless Accommodation”~I couldn't fault my stay here, the room was immaculate, service first class and the position - great.  Very comfortable room with view of the river and a balcony - bonus ! Great service from front desk to room service. The coffee shop / bar downstairs was good value and very convenient.  Parking - although pricey -with the only option being valet parking, worked well.  Definitely will be visiting again~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477588686~“Always a warm welcome from concierge”~The best concierge in Brisbane! One of the view Australian hotels that actually take your luggage from your car to your room. A great bonus if travelling alone for work with LOTS of books and luggage! Rooms always clean and fresh, elevators quick and Bacchus restaurant breakfasts are just amazing! I stay here whenever I can for business.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477312627~“Nice Hotel”~We have just had one night at the Hotel and I must say that it was a great improvement from our stay in February this year when the Hotel was in the middle of renovations and every aspect of the Hotel and service was dysfunctional. The rooms are large and can accommodate a family of four with out overcrowding ,the bathroom is also a good size. The pool is only a plunge pool size however if you want to swim the Southbank beach pool is across the road. All amenities are well appointed and the staff that we encounted were pleasant.  Breakfast is exceptionally good for a four star hotel. I would have given 5*s for the stay if it wasn't for the curly black hair found on the entrance floor to the room and the fluff on the bathroom floor and on the carpet,housekeeping were prompt to send someone to the room to remove the offending pieces, however if you are going to use backpackers to clean the rooms there should be strict supervision of them.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~4~nan
review_477027439~“Close to everything”~Conveniently located within walking distance to southbank restaraunts and city cat ferry. Staff need to be retrained in hospitality, they all seemed to make it very obvious they were only at work for their pay, not for customer service. Valet parking was very poorly managed. The pool should be re named The Spa, to small and intrusive to other diners.~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~1~nan
review_476622226~“Close to Convention Centre”~Very convenient for a conference, superb rooms, clean and comfortable. Excellent bathroom with good towels and accessories. Friendly staff. I had earlier joined priority guest rewards and so I got free wifi. Lots of places to eat nearby. Use of the pool was a bit offputting - it's very public, in the middle of the bar outside, which seemed to require a walk through the people to get there so gave up.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476272050~“Great Staff and very nice facilities. ”~Spent 3 nights here and rated the friendly helpful staff as the highlight. Very nice rooms and facilities as well but the staff made the stay most enjoyable. Well done to all the team here!! Food in all venues very nice and good value.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475740616~“Brisbane conference”~I spent a week at the hotel attending events at the adjacent convention center. I was allocated a room early having flown in from the UK, which was appreciated. The room was perfect for a week's stay, the location and views across the river were excellent and all the staff were friendly and helpful.I'd strongly recommend the hotel for business or leisure and hope to get the chance to stay there again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_475669261~“Clean & Comfortable ”~Really decent stay. Facilities were very good overall including spacious function rooms, decent daily breakfast, useful gym space, pool deck. The hotel interior was fitted out nicely with a contrasting 'regal' breakfast floor, modern paved pool deck/bar area and an open plan reception area. Lifts were the only issue going on at the time but it seemed as though renovations were occurring.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475666297~“Brisbane Short Break!”~We make a habit of always staying at Rydges South bank when in Brisbane by ourselves - great location, friendly staff, never had a problem except when we ask for extra towels via the on line check in due to attending functions/shows - never seem to get them! Rooms are always clean and neat and the refurbished rooms have been done to a high standard (bathrooms a bit small but you only have so much space!). Will continue to stay there.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_475426468~“Excellent Hotel and a fabulous visit”~My wife and I stayed four nights. Wonderful room, great view of Brisbane city, very excellent service from ALL the staff and magnificent breakfasts. The rate was very reasonable, particularly as breakfast was included on this occasion. The room was spotlessly clean and serviced every day. We had a deluxe queen room with a balcony overlooking the river and city. The only downside was the traffic noise (not the fault of the hotel obviously) but our stay was still very enjoyable. Highly recommend Rydges at South Bank.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475138171~“Conference stay”~I spent a week at Rydges Southbank while attending a conference at the convention centre and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. The hotel is adjoining the convention centre, a short walk across a rooftop courtyard. I had a higher room overlooking the Brisbane river. The room was clean and fresh with luxurious carpet, an extremely comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. The cafe on the ground floor is OK but the bar and restaurant on the first floor is special. It is also great to be in walking distance to the art gallery library, theatre, walks around Southbank, numerous restaurants and the city. I would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474907557~“Great position...pity about room service!”~Great room, clean and comfortable. We had a Junior Suite. However room service was not good. Meal cold, wrong salad that couldn't be eaten due to dietary restrictions and a room telephone that stopped working after placing our meal order so we could even get the salad exchanged.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_474907335~“Hasn't changed even after uplift ”~I had stayed at this location many times prior as have my staff and as the Pullman King George Square was fully booked I choose to stay here to see what the outcome of the recent renovations were like (10 night anniversary !) The rooms are fresher with modern amenities and the same comfortable bed. The staff are friendly as usual but my let down was the same reason I left the TFE brand to Accor. I ordered a dairy free dinner and was very explicit placing my order and had it read back twice. On receipt it was full of dairy and really dissapointing. I called back room service and spoke to the same person that took the order. It seems (without prejudice) the kitchen here does not care about food allergies as this is again why I moved my staffs and I accomodation last time. Mine is dairy so it makes me ill but if it were nut and ignored I would hate to think what would transpire. A serious look needs to be had with the kitchen as this is seriously letting this place down. I gave it one more go but I'd prefer the mantra next door if I have to change from Accor. If you have allergies or related issues and must stay please double check your meals before eating.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474816802~“Well we thought it was great!”~This is a lovely hotel which is a very convenient 5 minute walk from the train station, excellent for people like myself that cannot walk very far anymore. Lovely huge reception, with the most welcoming staff we have ever encountered & we've stayed in a lot of places. The guy on the receptions name was Wilson & he should be commended for doing a wonderful job, he is so friendly & helpful & that makes for a nice change & a great start to your stay. We had a room on the 3rd floor that was just above the pool. Great views, lovely walk out balcony, huge room which is immaculately clean & beautifully renovated. I don't get why people are complaining about the noise from the pool & bar & the traffic because once we shut the doors we couldn't hear anything but the aircon. Room service was excellent too. We had the steak sandwich & the beef burger both great value for money. A nice touch too was the complimentary drink voucher & and late 1pm checkout that we took full advantage of. Will we be back? Absolutely, can't wait.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474486868~“Great position”~We had a King studio and it was fantastic. Staff were great and facility's great. The buffet breakfast was all very fresh and hot and a great pool and bar area. Lovely spot close to the Brisbane river and entertainment centrs~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_474284243~“Great Hotel”~We recently had the pleasure of spending a night at Rydges, Southbank, Brisbane. We have nothing but the highest praise for the staff, they were extremely friendly and helpful, and made us feel very welcome. The room was excellent, and breakfast in the Bacchus restaurant was great. The location of the hotel, right in the busy and vibrant Southbank precinct was ideal. It's a short walk to the theatres at QPAC, and not much further into the heart of the CBD. If we have need to stay in Brisbane again it will certainly be at Rydges.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473723484~“impressive in all aspects”~very recently had the pleasure of staying at Rydges SB whilst on a Brisbane business trip. I was immediately impressed by the entry and reception. grandeur and opulence ++, with a professional and welcoming reception staff (Georgie?, wish i could give her a personal mention for reason below ) It only continued when i arrived at my stay, extremely spacious room, very clean with a great view over city/river (*only negative was bathroom was a little on he small size and a little pokey, toilet in awkward position). Some slight street/road noise but minimal late at night. Very comfortable sleep overall. back to my comment earlier - the major reason why I will highly recommend this establishment - I became unwell whilst on my stay, upon contacting reception to find a nearby chemist I was impressed beyond measure when the same girl who had checked us in on arrival, without prompting or request offered to send their concierge to collect the over the counter medicine I required, then went to further efforts and delivered it to my room!. This sort of high level service is often lost these days. I commend you. Thankyou~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_473720910~“This time great!”~I have stayed at Rydges three times and the first time I left feeling very disappointed, second time I stayed in their top suite and the last time on the 11th floor. The room, this time was amazing. Can't fault a thing. Thank you Rydges for valuing your customers and allowing priority guests to checkout later and for providing us with support comfortable bedding. The bed was spectacular.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473528826~“Nice stay at Rydges South Bank”~4 of us spent 4 days in Rydges hotel last week. The hotel has a wonderful location right across from the Southbank gardens and close to every thing including the train station. The reception was extremely friendly and helpful with everything. Special thanks to Mr. Tony who was the manager at the reception when we landed at 11.30 pm. The rooms were huge and spic & span, everything in place. We initially booked for 1 night, but extended it to 4 nights as we were very happy. We had breakfast twice and the ala carte was reasonable and very good. Overall a satisfying stay and I will definitely recommend this hotel.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473270498~“Nice Hotel”~I stayed her for one night for work. There is valet car parking under the hotel for $45 a night, as soon as we got inside we were given a free upgrade. The room was nice and spacious, the bed was very comfortable (and clean). The bathroom was nice and the shower was good. There is a mini bar and an assortment of food/drink if you want. The location is excellent - we were at the convention centre, and it took less than a minute to get to the convention. Southbank is right across the road and there are a lot of restaurants and cafes to choose from. It was a good stay.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_472770169~“A very good stay”~In Brisbane for a family function and spent one night at the Rydges South Bank. Staff were very welcoming and check in a breeze. Stayed on the 6th floor with views of CBD & river. Breakfast on the podium level was complimentary as an April special and offered a full buffet - with the option of ordering your eggs any way you wish. Room was clean and would recommend a night at the Rydges. Very reasonably priced.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472012969~“A very convienent location”~We were a little underwhelmed with our stay. Day or so earlier we received a reminder about our, with a request would you like to pay a bit extra for an ugrade? Yes can we have a room with a view - well I suppose it is all relative but view what view? Disappointed that we were not told simple things like oh! You need to swipe you key to get to your floor? Or if breakfast is included where is it served? Was the room value for money - No. there is no where to hang a towel so that you can reach it when you get out of the shower - and then being short I couldn't even reach the towels. it seemed like syle over substance.  However, it was convenient for the dinner we went to that night. Breakfast in Bacchus was amazing! Except for the kids running riot but that is not the fault of the hotel - more like the parents.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_471829552~“It started with a room without a view...”~Arriving at Rydges South Bank I was tired and frustrated after a long trip and without my luggage that hadn’t made the transfer at the airport in Abu Dhabi. I was longing for a shower, a beer and a bed. When I entered my room I was in desperate need for a positive signal in this misery. I walked through the room, opened the curtains and there it was: The Wall…. Some tiny plants tried to hide the concrete, but it was all in vain. A small ray of evening light between the wall and the balcony above was all that was left of my expectations of a beautiful sunset. Then I dragged myself in the direction of the bathroom to wash the fatigue of the day from my body and soul. The first ten seconds went well but then I felt like playing a scene in Waterworld. The water wasn’t running into the small gutter but it floated the bathroom within seconds. How much can a man stand after such a day…. I cleaned up the bathroom and went down for another room, but, off course, there was no other room available… The next day I got a room with some more view and a working shower. They have an excellent breakfast with a sufficient selection of what a person need for food in the morning. The staff is very helpful and made me feel at home after the unpleasant start. A possible improvement could be an increase in the number of channels, as I find them rather limited.​~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471250496~“King suite review ”~Extremely impressed with the king suite, room 115. Very large, dedicated work & lounge areas, two large televisions and a big comfy bed. All fittings were great quality, and the room itself was immaculately clean. Large and deep bathtub, great water pressure in the shower. The couch in the living area was comfortable. Would certainly stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471240564~“Great location”~We love this hotel as it is close to Qpac. Stayed in a suite which was lovely. There was a mixup with a minibar charge we did not use but a simple phone call sorted it quick smart. Great staff great facilities. Pool bar was excellent as was the range of beers on tap. Will be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471235288~“Four and a half stars”~We last stayed over five years ago, and the renovations have been completed and the hotel looks very different. The rooms are brighter, and the reception area is much improved. The location, for us driving from the Sunshine Coast, was easy and the parking service worked very well. As mentioned by others the staff were friendly and welcoming and the room was very comfortable.  We did NOT like the carpeting pattern, especially outside the lift, where it looked as though someone had been very ill. We appreciate that patterns and colours are needed to disguise the heavy traffic, but this seemed extreme. Apart from the buffet breakfast ($39 a head - with no mention of the price that I recall on the menu) it was a pleasurable stay. We will return!~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan~nan
review_471201740~“Top-notch hotel”~My daughter and I recently spent a night at Rydges South Bank, as part of my Christmas gift. From the moment of arrival, when our car was quickly taken to be parked, our experience was smooth, efficient, and luxurious. The beds were large and soft, the rooms spacious, the shower strong and towels thick. The position is perfect for a trip to the cultural precinct of South Bank, specifically, in our case, the Lyric Theatre; and bars, cafes and restaurants abound. We have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, and it never disappoints.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470185367~“The place to stay at southbank”~Great location if you are spending your time at south bank. Generous sized rooms. Small but well designed bathrooms. Good sized balcony. The kids enjoyed the heated pool whilst I enjoyed a coffee and the pool water did not hurt their eyes like some can. Breakfast was the best buffet we have had, everything was great. Not hit and miss here. The beds were very soft.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468768973~“a good surprise”~The service at Rydges south bank was very good. The front desk enthusiastically to find me a room when my agent had booked the wrong nights, room service was quick and food was a good standard. Bed was comfortable, didnt have to wait long for lifts and location was excellent as it is close to Brisbane Convention Centre, Performing Arts, Southbank and others. However it was the excellent service that won me over and will ensure that I return~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_468663917~“Great room, paper thin walls”~A great room, which was functional and comfortable. A comfy bed, good aircon and styled well. The bathroom was a bit small, but it was sufficient for what I needed. The only issue is that the walls are paper thin. I could hear everything going on in the room next to me. Why people are awake at 5.00am having chats, I don't know but it was annoying. The only other criticism I have is the lack of a view I had - I opened my windows to a car park. i wasn't in the room much and I was on a lower floor, so not really an issue. Overall, a great stay, awesome location and a fantastic hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan

review_467685203~“Great Central Location for weekend away”~Stay at Rydges Southbank for a conference & a short weekend away. We had a King Suite on the 3rd level. Fantastic large room, very clean, comfortable king bed and nice decor however would have preferred a room facing the river not over the convention centre. We had the King Suite Decadence package which had chocolates & champagne on arrival, late check out, car parking & rooms service breakfast. This package was great value & the service throughout our 2 night stay was excellent. Location is excellent being across from Southbank Park lands which has an amazing amount of restaurants to chose from.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467106206~“great location”~We were in a junior suite, which was pretty good but was unfortunately on a lower floor so had a view of the Conservatorium across the street (although you could get a peek at southbank through the nearby buildings). They were undergoing renovations in the foyer when we were there, which may have meant we got a better deal than usual, but the works did not impact much on us apart from making checkin a little more busy. The location is great, being a block or two from southbank and QAGOMA complex is a walk away, and it is a short a ferry ride to the city. There's a station close too, so if you have people to visit in the suburbs, it's a great option.  Unfortunately the pool is miniscule, and it seemed that some children were there unsupervised when we took our kids down. One boy in particular was acting quite unsafely, climbing up the ledge of the pool and showing off to others nearby. We tried to find his parents but no one seemed to be taking responsibility. When we got worried about our kids' safety, we spoke to him ourselves and then left. It was disappointing that the staff were not being proactive about this.  The second thing that we were not particularly impressed with was the bathroom. It was TINY! and quite poorly designed - a case of style over substance with the taps splashing water over everything, the shower too open to keep anything dry and the general layout poorly considered.  Still, the room overall was cool, calm and quite clean, the beds were very comfortable, and I would definitely consider staying there again.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_466973180~“location location location”~Other than being a fabulous hotel in itself, it is within easy walking distance of the best strip of restaurants in Brisbane. Little Stanley st is right outside your door, with everything to keep everyone happy on a culinary trip. Also, QPAC is just opposite for shows, theatre etc. Southbank itself is also worthy of exploration. The hotel is everything you would expect from Rydges, clean, professional, great mezzanine bar and pool area, great sheets, the list goes on. Love spending time here.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_466650543~“Good rooms but a few issues”~The location of the hotel is great on the South Bank within easy walking distance of the City, museums and restaurants. Parking is valet parking but on leaving on Sunday at check out time had to wait about 20 minutes for my car as so many were leaving at the same time. Tip. Would ring ahead for your car if you are leaving at check out time. It was my birthday and my husband planned a surprise treat which did not turn up. He rang again and it finally turned up late afternoon when it was no use, the staff entered the room without waiting for a reply.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~2~nan

Will definitely return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Recently renovated and looking very good. 2 big screen smart TV's in the suite with internet connection. Great king size bed and heaps of cupboard space. Fantastic bathroom, great bath tub, separate shower, double basins. Breakfast buffet was one of the best we had in a long time, huge selection, great quality.

The hospitality is excellent and the rooms meet a standard that is world class. Extremely comfortable beds, fantastic amenities and with the right room a gorgeous balcony with a view of the brisbane city sky line. If you are staying here, spend an extra little bit and get that king suite with river view, it's definitely worth it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465171518~“Great Hotel in great location!”~We enjoyed our 3 nights at this hotel. On the 11th floor in a Junior Suite. Nice big lounge room/kitchenette, with separate bedroom..BUT tiny bathroom!! work that out??!! Fantastic balcony with wonderful views overlooking the Brisbane river and city. Elevators in building were rather slow. Very enjoyable breakfast in the Bacchus Dining area, with plenty of variety. Pity the kitchen closed at 10am. Bed was comfy as, but pillows were thick and hard. No free water in room. Overall we couldn't complain about the service, and would stay here again. Location is great for all the restaurants on the SouthBank and short walk across the bridge to the city mall.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_464965161~“Just another convention hotel”~I was here for work for 1 night - the hotel is convenient to the Convention Centre but is otherwise a generic hotel with little to distinguish it from any other. The 3rd floor room had limited desk/ work space which did not assist.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464917815~“Another enjoyable stay...”~Third time we've stayed here and once again impressed with the standard of customer service. The location is great for dining out and/or going to the theatre. The tap in our bathroom wasn't working when we checked in but informed them when we were on our way out for the night and was fixed by the time we got back. Concierge are excellent and will continue to stay there when we are in Southbank next time.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_464637331~“Right in the heart of South Bank”~We recently stayed here overnight prior to an international flight the following morning. The hotel is in a very central location. Easy walking distance to great restaurants and bars. We had a superior twin room with two queen beds in a room that was larger than average. Our balcony overlooked the Brisbane wheel which is lit up at night. Valet parking was additional but was at a reduced rate because we booked directly with the Hotel over the phone. Our family will definitely return!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464230052~“Great hotel for convention centre attendance”~I stayed at this hotel for one night while exhibiting at the conference centre. The hotel is joined to the centre making it very easy to go between your room and the exhibition hall. The hotel was very clean with corporate styling. My room was on the 10th floor and although it didn't have much of a view, it was modern, very clean and definitely suitable to what I was looking for. I didn't get the chance to eat at the hotel, but the wireless in the room was free and worked well, it had a nice big tv screen and tea and coffee. Oh, and the bed was extremely comfortable! Couldn't ask for much more for a business stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_464150375~“Nice hotel in a fantastic location”~The Rydges hotel in Brisbane is a good quality organization with nice accommodations. The room I had was contemporary and attractive. It was generally comfortable, except even after 5 nights of stay I could not get the air conditioning to be warmer than sub artic temperatures.  The staff were helpful, friendly and attentive. We had a delay with a computer glitch on check in, but the front desk staff came up with good alternatives will we waited.  What tips my review to five stars is the location. It has easy access to the convention centre, tons of restaurants and a short walk to the South Bank area of the river where there is plenty to do.  I will definitely stay here next time I am in Brisbane!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463913328~“Great Hotel in a Fantastic Location”~We stayed here for our wedding Anniversary last week and were delighted with our room on the eleventh floor with a great view.The location of the hotel, so close to all the restaurants, the city, Theatres and the promenade along the river was fantastic - no need to drive anywhere. The staff were excellent and the breakfast was great. We had some trouble with noise from the adjoining room when a group of ladies came in late with lots of laughter.It would be good policy for Rydges to not put groups of young people in an adjoining room where the door is no where near soundproof. But I must say just one call to the night manager and the problem was rectified. However, I was not impressed with Rydges taking a fee of $100 from my credit card for security. I could understand if this money was reimbursed the next day, but having rang Rydges I am told it will not be reimbursed for at least 5 working days.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_462779918~“Overnight stay”~This was a gift from our daughter and it was an overnight stay with buffet breakfast included and a bottle of bubbly on arrival. We have stayed here before but I noticed a significant improvement in amenities and service. Our room was on the 6th floor with a private balcony and good views over the river and across to the city. Even better at night. The buffet breakfast was excellent and very well layed out. You could set yourself up for the day with this ample breakfast.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_462569938~“Convenient location to Convention Centre, Lyric Theatre etc”~Excellent room & we were upgraded to a balcony with river views. Unfortunately at 5pm we decided to have our showers & the water was cold. The CBD cafe had skeleton staff & waiting times approx 15 - 20 minutes for Food & Drinks order. I informed the young girl serving that I would offer feedback as I observed the pressure she was under. A Monday night but a lot of people having a quick bite to eat prior to attending concert at Convention Centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_462134819~“A TOUCH OF LUXURY RYDGES SOUTHBANK”~We have just enjoyed a seven night holiday in Brisbane staying at Rydges southbank we had a queen delux river view with stunning views of the river and at night postcard views of the Brisbane Skyline. The moment you walk in the foyer you are not a hotel guest you become a rydges guest and the staff at all levels extent to you a warm pleasant level of service that other hotels can only aspire to, We flew in from Sydney and given the time difference the hotel had our room ready. The breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant is the best I have seen we have experienced hotels from Hawaii to Australia nothing compares from the restaurants decor to the leather chairs the restaurant itself is a Brisbane icon. For that perfect holiday in Brisbane Rydges Southbank delivers style decor location and a level of service that is a credit to the Rydges brand.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462108928~“Great hotel for people requiring wheelchair access.”~We always choose to stay at Rydges Southbank when staying in Brisbane as my son is confined to a motorised wheelchair and the wheelchair access is excellent and the disabled accessible rooms are very spacious with plenty of room for extra equipment that we travel with such as hoist, shower commode and powered wheelchair. The bathroom is very spacious and makes it very easy to access with the shower commode or wheelchair.The staff always go above and beyond to make sure our stay is as comfortable as can be and nothing is too much trouble for them. The hotel even provided longer legs for the bed so that my sons hoist was able to fit underneath the bed easily. In both the CBD bar and Bacchus restaurant the staff even remembered from previous stays that my son has his coffee made warm and not too hot and provided a straw without even asking which is just a nice little extra touch.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_462079382~“Amazing location, great hotel, great visit to Brisbane”~Recently stayed here, and chose a Deluxe Suite River View room. It was roomy, and comfy, with a convertible sofa bed for the kids. The master had a plush king size bed, with nice linens. We had a wonderful stay. The room has two large screen TVs, each with two USB charge ports beneath them, so we could charge our devices without adapters. For a connected family, this was a big convenience. The room, despite being a bright, sunny corner, was kept cool with well-functioning, quiet A/C, and black-out blinds. We slept very well in the cool darkness, despite the hot exterior temperatures. The room had a Nespresso machine and milk frother, but used off-brand coffee pods. Three were provided three pods each day, but one was de-caf. The off-brand pods were fine, but given the price of coffee shops in Australia, I'd suggest bringing a sleeve of Nespresso pods from home. Long-life milk was provided in the fridge daily. Needless to say, there is also a mini-fridge in the room, and a microwave. There is also a wet bar in the coffee area, the extra sink came in very handy. Nightly herbal teas and biscuits were brought to the room too. This was a nice touch. If you've not stayed at Rydges before, sign up for their PriorityGUEST plan before making your booking. You'll save a bundle this way. Also, upon check-in your get a gold card that entitles you to 20% off the hotel restaurant menu prices (but not breakfast at the CBD on the ground floor).  This hotel is adjacent to the South Bank Parklands, which is a hive of weekend activity. It was a great location. The kids loved the proximity to the pools and playgrounds, and we loved the variety of great restaurants. The hotel provided a cooler full of bottled water just outside the main door at the weekend. Grab a few before heading out. The staff was also great and helpful. They were very informative and helpful when we made a hired car rental through them, and making sure it was at the hotel at the agreed time.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461877299~“Room with a (superb!) view”~Ours was a last minute booking but we were lucky enough to secure a room. We were going to a show at the Convention Centre so the location was superb - only two minutes walk. The first thing we were presented with at check-in was a room upgrade! Then for a few extra dollars we had valet parking for the night - great service. We made our way to the 11th floor, entered our room (well, suite really) and were presented with a spacious living area and a huge bedroom with king size bed and ensuite bathroom. Wow! The view of the Southbank Parklands, Brisbane River and city skyline at night blew us away. I've never seen Brisbane look so pretty with its floodlit buildings of different colours. The bed was comfortable enough, but it's getting a bit old and needs replacing. We still had a great night's sleep. Tea and coffee making facilities were adequate. Perhaps a selection of teas might not go amiss. The coffee maker was good. Too many hotels still rely on instant so it's a nice change to have 'real' coffee. The only thing we were disappointed with was the bar closing so early. We were looking forward to a nightcap after the show, but the bar was closing as we got there at about 10:30pm. All in all though, a great stay that we would recommend and will probably do again in the future.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460595394~“Unable to book - reservation service miserable!”~Very frustrating trying to book a night at Rydges at South Bank. I gave up in disgust at the multiple electronic steps to be finally put through to the Reservations area at South bank in Brisbane, only for the phone to ring endlessly until someone chose to pick it up and then (no name given) explain she was covering for the Reservations team who were not available. I said I was trying to book a night with a gift voucher and that was perhaps the wrong thing to say - I was then promptly told their was no accommodation available on the night I requested.~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
review_460511829~“Great Area to Stay in”~Hotel was fabulous - rooms were very clean and spacious. Great for families with the pool and bar area, something for everyone. Hotel is in a great location at Southbank so much to do and see the kids were entertained the whole holiday - which is half the battle!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460508266~“Brisbane conference ”~Great room, very comfortable. Very friendly staff who were polite and efficient. I recommend that if your visiting Brisbane and looking for somewhere in the Southbank precinct this hotel is excellent. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460461454~“Keep Returning”~Check in and check out can be a little slow at times but generally I enjoy staying at Rydges Southbank which is why I keep coming back. Also as a GHA Black member I receive an upgrade to a suite which is most appreciated.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_460340596~“Never Again”~I had the unfortunate displeasure of staying at this hotel for business in Feb 2017,the issues simplified are. -Extremely poor service. -Under renovation during whole 2 week stay while not advised when booking. -Gym and spa usable due to cleanliness. -Rude/ unhelpful valet service. The only good part of this stay was a conversation had with a duty manager.~1~nan~5~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_460312395~“Great location, excellent room and fantastic breakfast”~Had a wonderful night here for Australia day fireworks. The perfect place to access all that Southbank has to offer and an awesome view of the fireworks from the Riverside suite rooms! Very nicely done room, totally private in the corner suites with no noise from outside or other guests at all. Breakfast was amazing and the staff really helpful and friendly.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_460298487~“Very positive”~Great breakfast, cool poolside area, superb localization in the centre of the town, comfortable rooms, helping concierges. The localization near railways station helps to get to the beaches in one hour, localization near to the river helps to use ship trip to Coala Sanctuary - one of the best Brisbane's experience. Not far away from Eagle street and its great restaurants there.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_460295749~“Even better than I expected”~I had booked the most basic room but was delighted to find upon arrival that my room had been upgraded to a very spacious room with a beautiful view. The room was immaculate and the bed was super comfy. Check-in and check-out was very efficient. The only (very minor) criticism would be the long wait for the elevator at times.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459885600~“Xmas time brisbane”~Great Hillsong concerts, fireworks, Southbank beach and outside movies - the city a walk across the bridge - we had a blast staying in the junior suite. Thanks Rydges for our wonderful family holiday.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_459824733~“Professional front desk staff”~Having spent the afternoon / evening out with friends I had hoped to just sit and relax on the P (Pool) level to enjoy a last drink of the evening by the pool. Having found a quiet place to relax I was rather rudely told by security staff that I was sitting in an area of a private function and I would need to 'MOVE ON!"  It surprised me that such an high end hotel would require such aggressive security personnel to MOVE ON... a single woman sitting alone having a quiet drink.  I of course was happy to move, if I was indeed in a restricted area, but wasn't impressed by way It was requested.  On checking out, however, the issue was mentioned to front desk staff who were very keen to apologise and offered us a free coffee while we waited for our car to be brought up.  My faith was restored... Well done Front desk :)~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_459593669~“Awesome!”~Stayed 5 nights for a bit of down time with friends-was up graded. Staff were absolutely lovely!!!! Stay here! The food was fantastic, pool area small but relaxing. The friendly helpful staff made this stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459484800~“Worked out great”~Rydges facilities are straight forward and typical of a four star hotel in Brisbane. Staff were courteous and professional. Tariff was reasonable for level of service and amenity. Pay parking is something that was disappointing.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_458820854~“Would stay again for leisure at the right price”~I have just completed a one night stay for work and I must say I was thoroughly impressed. Granted I was 'upgraded' to the top floor (floor 11) with city and river view which was a more than exceptional 180 degree view over several CBD suburbs but I must commend the hotel since renovating, the room itself regardless of the view was very very nice. Large rooms with beds were very comfortable with a range of pillows, tasteful furniture and decor, bright and stylish (albeit small) bathroom. The highlight for me was the carpet, very soft and lovely to walk on with bare feet. The food served over the 2 days was good, dinner was the standout. I really like it when a kitchen is able to cater for 50 or more people yet still cook the meals to a high standard. Bacchus breakfast buffet options were standard but not bad. I have had dinner here previously and it's s completely different standard. Overall, for the right price I would stay here again on a personal visit given the hotel ticked all the boxes.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458554117~“No, No, No”~I just completed a 5 night stay here for a work conference that was being held next door at the Brisbane Convention Centre. I'll start out with the plus- location- if you need to be at the convention centre or South Bank the location could not get better. That said, there are other, and in my experience, much better and less expensive options.  The new lobby is a facade for what is otherwise a low quality and overpriced experience. The staff at the front counter have a very "up themselves" attitude in general and that starts a customer off wrong and ends things wrong. Clearly they have not had training in how to do customer service - and I didn't ask for anything special! The rooms are basic but I had a suite that I paid way too much for and it lacked typical amenities- like some silverware, complimentary teabags, not even drinking glasses. The first night they had forgotten the towels and face washers and it took 45 minutes to get a towel at 9:30 at night... just lack of care and checks and balances. The gym is tiny, worn out and dirty equipment, air conditioner was weak, no mats to do any stretching etc... pool is tiny... Way overpriced for what it is.... one of the most frustrating hotel experiences on check-in and check- out that I have had in years... and I travel a lot. I will not stay here gain, many other "better value" experiences- steer clear...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458441567~“Convenient Conference Hotel”~The hotel itself is nothing to write home about, but also does everything moderately well. The only issue is that the doors are not sufficiently insulated and people walking out in the hallways can wake you up in the mornings. It is, however, very close to the Brisbane convention center (you don't need to leave the building) - and located in one of the nicest parts of Brisbane. Recommended for conference guests, but there may be better choices otherwise.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_457482414~“happy days”~Spent the Saturday night here. The reception was good and quick as was the valet parking. Complimentary drinks in the bar was a bonus. The room a King Suite was perfect lots of room and very clean and tidy Lovely balcony to watch over South Bank Very comfortable bed no complaints so far. Sadly the morning breakfast was not on the same level as the rest of the Hotel. The receptionist could learn to smile and loose the prison officer attitude. The breakfast buffet style was most probably the worst i have ever had in a hotel nothing good to say sorry~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_457271734~“Great experience”~We are a family of four and enjoyed the Family Matters package which included a twin room, valet parking, treats tray for the kids and they ate breakfast for free. Excellent value and so handy to QPAC where we were seeing Matilda. Staff were helpful, room was very comfortable, and the extras we ordered (choc-dipped strawberries, cheese platter, and fruit platter) were all delish. Brekkie was great too. We'd love to come back next time we are in Brisbane.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_456857588~“Very good location surrounding restaurants,cinema and parkland”~Really good location,easy access to Parkland,museum,convention centre,city cat ferry ,cinema and restaurants bars and pubs etc .Easy to get taxi just cross the road,valley parking is not that expensive for a day and you still can park your car in the hotel until 1 pm even you are already check out just go ask the front desk they will help you. The junior suite is perfect for family ,1king bedroom and 1 sofa bed double bed size,2 big TV,desk,dining table for 4 people ,room per night is very good for that size of the room,but only 1 bathroom,if there is 2 toilet it would be perfect.the restaurant by the pool  is average and expensive .anything else is good.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456609889~“Nice hotel but don't expect access to the pool at all times”~the staff were all very nice and helpful. We got upgraded to a king suite for another $20 per night which was great. The hotel was being renovated so some facilities were not available which is understandable and not a negative but, after a long and tiring day out we were looking forward to relax in the paddling pool (swimming pool) which was the only drinking facility left on site because of the renovations and having a drink at the pool bar then ordering room service for dinner. On arrival at the pool bar we found we were bared until after 10 pm because it was booked out to a private party. In their brochures etc it stated the pool bar was only for guests of the hotel??? We then only had one place to go and relax on site and that was our room with the bar fridge and room service. Unfortunately when I phoned room service they did not answer the phone so after trying for 15 minutes I decided to ring guest services to get our fridge restocked but same thing, no answer. Phoned reception and was told they would handle my request. 40 minutes later still no drinks so re-phoned guest services and they said they would send someone up straight away with more beer. 40 minutes later they arrived. So over 1 and a half hours after arriving back to the hotel were we able to relax with drink in hand. I say if you have only one pool and bar facility for guests to go to and relax, DON'T book it out to outsiders and leave your guests with nothing and NO room service. Also this hotel is a non smoking hotel but we choked on cigarette smoke from the room next to us on the first night and another room on the next night. At breakfast the next morning the people at the next table were complaining about the same thing???~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~3~nan

review_455734380~“Amazing!”~Absolutely blown away by service and room quality. Amazing for the price. Valet parking attendant was so helpful and understanding of our cars needs. There is no free parking here but there are no other better options in the area to park. They gave us excellent directions to our event location and they have free bottles of water which is a nice touch.  Can't recommend it enough.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455715713~“Good Location”~We had a one night stay at Rydges South Bank very close to the city cat, cafes & restaurants. Welcoming staff with great rooms, a real luxury. The view unfortunately was part river and a lot of railway line.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_455526711~“A great location”~I stayed here overnight with my four year old grandaughter as we were seeing a local ballet production. Loved the location as conservatorium just across the road as are the swimming pools at Southbank. We enjoyed the pool at hotel too. Some room for improvement with room service dinner kids meal good but pizza way too much dough! good valet parking and pleased with early check in.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_455499117~“One of my Brisbane favs”~It might be Rydges, and a chain hotel, but Southbank is one of my Brisbane favourites for work.You just can't go past the location,the gyms okay, great for walking along the river after work, restaurants nearby, rooms are clean and tidy, the bed is comfy. Parking is a little walk if you don't valet.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455460316~“The best location, very comfortable and good value”~We stayed here for three nights and found the hotel in the perfect location across the road from South Bank and all the restaurants. The only small downside is that they did not replace the soap in the bathroom, apart from that it was perfect.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455185346~“Service issues addressed”~Allowed slightly early check in to room on backside of hotel--don't remember floor-4? could not hear trains with a/c on and a/c was necessary plus block out curtains for afternoon sun. Room was clean and comfortable. Lots of service issues--safe, light, thermostat--that I did not notice until in for the evening and the staff had gone home for the night. All fixed the next day. Lobby level cafe is closed for renovation, so bar at pool serving as cafe and bar. Stood in line for 15+ minutes in the afternoon just to get a drink. Staff overwhelmed. I decided not to try it for a quick breakfast before airport--I didn't think it would be quick and it was too hot outside. Hotel was busy, so waits for elevator, front desk; lots of people at the pool. Only a couple of blocks walk from the train station, museums and theaters, and the waterfront. Many restaurants in the area. A bit further to access an IGA and further for a larger grocery.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_455075324~“Comfortable, elegant and perfectly located in Southbank”~My Queen River View Room looked out over Southbank and Brisbane and the view was spectacular day and night. The room was large and airy, comfortable with everything provided, including great discreet room service. I enjoyed the pool bar, the downstairs cafe for dining for breakfast, and dinner, and the ease of going everywhere. Located near the station and across the bridge to the city of Brisbane and great for Southbank. I had Christmas at Rydges~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_454425606~“My Southbank Trip 2017”~Ridges is a comfortable Hotel to stay in at Southbank. We went to the Theatre so it is easy to walk to all venues. You can have valet parking for $30 a day which is good value and safe for your car! The room was clean and comfortable and a Continental Breakfast to the room was only $28 plenty big enough for two adults. Renovations were taking place but staff were very helpful. Only downside is they hold $100 on your credit cRd after you have left for a number of days- they forgot to mention this to us and we did not see it on their information!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454167585~“always stay here”~stayed overnight here as I was attending the theatre with my daughter and granddaughter, we always stay here when in Brisbane, we can park the car,they have valet parking for a fee, but worth it to know my car is securely parked whilst we are there, then walk everywhere. we were on the ninth floor with river views, refurbished room was lovely, we had a balcony, which is nice though I must say it would have been better had there been maybe a small table and a couple of chairs on the balcony to enjoy our view. we had the buffet breakfast for the first time, not cheap but the variety of food was really good. beds are really comfortable. enjoyed our stay and I imagine I will stay here again next time.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_454158072~“Great place to stay, but ask for a river view”~Recently stayed here with the family (two rooms) for a period of 6 days, rang up to confirm booking a few days prior and was told we had been upgraded to a larger room for no extra cost. We were in the two last rooms on the southern side of the building, we had a river view and the boys had the rear view. My only two negatives i can say about this hotel is  1) The hotel backs onto the tramline - so make sure you get a RIVER VIEW room otherwise you will be woken up by the trams.  2) Although the Soleil Pool Bar is a magnificent place for a drink, the pool is a little small for the bigger kids!  Other than that i would highly recommend this hotel for a stay, i would definitely stay here again. We had valet parking with the hire car and whenever you needed the car you just rang up 10 mins beforehand and it was there out the front waiting for you. We had breakfast in the Bacchus restaurant on 3 of the mornings which was very nice and they had a large variety to select from. Southbank is the place to be, plenty of restaurants with a large choice of cuisines and the kids had a ball in the man-made beach (i wish Adelaide would do something similar)~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
