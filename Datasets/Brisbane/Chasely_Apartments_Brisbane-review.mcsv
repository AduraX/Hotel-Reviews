review_477310116~“CAR PARK FLOODS”~Do not stay here if it is raining, the car park floods and you cannot get your vehicle out. I normally do not write negative reviews, however I really need to let people know about the car park and the rude hosts. In a very stressful situation with my elderly mother in hospital, we had to check out suddenly as the car park was flooding. The very RUDE woman in reception proceeded to have a 5 minute "Social" conversation with some one whilst I stood at the counter waiting to be served. The bed and pillows were terribly uncomfortable and the cleaning left a fair bit to be desired. The laundry was shared the bathroom along with a toilet, the 2nd bedroom had an ensuite. There was a very steep hill to walk up to the Wesley Hospital. There was also a lot of traffic noise. Very disappointed as strangely there were good reviews.~2~nan~2~nan~2~nan~1~nan
review_379537254~“Close to Wesley Hospital”~My husband and I stayed here for two nights in May so my husband could attend a specialist appointment at the Wesley hospital. The hospital was a 5 minute walk up a steepish hill. Not too bad. We were given a room on the top floor overlooking the river. The room was a little tired looking however quite spacious. The bed wasn't the best we've slept on however it wasn't the worst either. There was a full kitchen with dining table and ok chairs. The couch wasn't too bad. There was a washing machine and dryer in the bathroom which was a real bonus. There is undercover parking however the roof is very low at 1.8m. This is the only accommodation that we have stayed at that offers genuine free wifi. Thanks for that.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_370855755~“Could be a whole lot Better the money ”~My husband and I stayed there so we could be close to the hospital when he had his operation. It was so uncomfortable I as booed for 3 nights but cut it short so I could have a good nights rest and to stay here was a Big mistake with only few positives  Which were the managers they were wonderful  It had a washing machine and dryer And close to the hospital  """ But the negatives FIRST THE ROAD NOISE WAS UNBELIEVABLE!!!  The room smelled musty and old The bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. ( I truly wish management would sleep in these for a night to on just how bad they are you could feel the springs and when I looked at the mattress it was old very very old.  When I pulled the bed out to use the power point there was so much build up of fluff and dirt and dust is was disappointing to see. And been charged $150 per night was over priced and disappointing.  The bath over shower is a little bit of a challenge if you were unsteady in your feet.  I really don't have a it of good things to say about this place. Unfortunately. Because like I said management are lovely.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342442415~“Fantastic Management and location”~Stayed for 5 nights and great support from management staff. Close to Wesley Hospital and Toowong Village. Room set up are clean and practical. Nice river walk and it is closed to bus and train stops. We have had a very satisfying stay. Thank you to the staff and we will return again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_310428875~“Close to Wesley Hospital”~The apartment was very nice really, nicely decorated and well equipped. The kitchen and bathroom were very clean, as was everything else. The bed was comfortable, the lounge reasonably so, the TV worked fine, it has a full stove and fridge, a kitchen table and four chairs, also a washer and dryer in the bathroom - not that I needed that. The only thing lacking was a bottle opener and as I had bought a bottle of beer from reception I could not open it. Since I was at that stage in my pyjamas I didn't go back to reception to get one. It is just a few minutes walk to the main entrance of the Wesley, though up a steep hill so suitable to walk only if reasonably fit. People who are light sleepers should ask for a room not at the front since Coronation Drive is a very busy road. Parking is fine under cover. WiFi is very slow. Actually a very nice unit though.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_297404595~“Good location near the city”~I traveled in a group of 4 and booked the 2-bedroom apartment. The apartment looked old and worn out. But other than that, it was clean, tidy and comfortable. Other reviews said it was noisy at night but we had no issues with that. It was rather quiet (maybe we were facing the right direction?) so we had a great night's sleep. The location is good as it was near the city centre and just beside the Brisbane river (makes for a great view at night).~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_284036413~“Perfect location for the Wesley”~The apartment was spotless with full stove, washer and dryer. There was comfortable seating and the bed was firm with good quality bedding. The shower had great pressure. There is parking up the ramp for higher vehicles. If you are unwell you won't be able to walk to the Wesley as the gradient on the hill is too steep. Apartments at the front of the building are affected by traffic noise. I would stay again in a rear apartment.~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_279196648~“Great stay”~Thank you to the managers of these apartments. Clean, tidy and close de to the hospital. Close to great dining so we recommend the apartments.

review_242377773~“Satisfactory apartments close to city”~Older style neat and tidy, close to the city. Little noisy as right on main road, but not too bad if you close the windows. Really nice large open windows creates great light in apartments, no fly screens on windows though, which I though a little odd.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_242171907~“Good”~Had a very nice stay in an apartment that had everything including washer and dryer. Reception was very helpful and friendly. The location is good for hospital across the road and the bus stops outside to get to town,which is around 10 mins. Had a lovely view of the river from our high floor. Not good wifi in the room though.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_224457214~“Had everything I needed”~Handy to the Wesley Hospital, Auchenflower Station, buses on Coronation Drive. Has a full kitchen (other serviced apartments around the area only have kitchenettes ) and washing machine plus dryer. Walking distance to Toowong Village for grocery shopping etc. Complimentary wifi, tv and my apt was clean!! It is a no frills place and has no restaurant but the Regatta is only 5 mins walk down the road.~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_216758921~“Great Managers but housekeeping very poor”~No hot water on one of Brisbane's coldest days - "too many guests " as advised by receptionist is not good enough excuse - price compares with apartments with much better services & cleanliness - thought that room was serviced daily as advertised only to be told by reception that daily service is dependant on your room rate.~3~2~3~nan~2~2~3~nan
review_203791216~“Mouse poo in one of the single beds!”~We paid $205 for a family room, which is a lot of money for our family, and there was a big stain in the carpet outside the room even before you entered room 213. It was very noisy on Coronation Drive. The kitchen bench had a big crack in it with walls that had cracks and paint off in places...definitely will never stay there again!~2~1~2~1~2~2~3~nan
review_198951419~“Handy to Wesley Hospital”~My family and I have stayed at Chaseley Apartments on many occasions when one of us have been in patients at the Wesley. The location is 2 minutes from the hospital and 1bout 5 mins to the train and on the main bus services along Coronation Drive. A short walk to the Regatta Hotel and City Cat service. The management are always polite and helpful. Parking on site. Rooms are clean and have full cooking facilities. TV and phone in room. No radio in room. In house wireless available free of charge and is mainly reliable. Short and long term tariff available.Recommended.~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_168008994~“Handy to the Wesley Hospital but noisy”~This hotel is very convenient to the Wesley Hospital. The apartment that we had was spacious and contained all necessary amenities including a full kitchen and washing machine and dryer. There was a separate bedroom containing a queen sized bed. Although not brand new, everything that is required for a stay is there. The down side is really the fact that it is on a very busy road and even though the windows are 'triple' glazed, considerable road noise penetrates the room. There is free on site parking and free wifi. They also sell snacks and alcohol while reception is open. Reception service was very friendly and helpful.~3~3~5~2~3~5~4~nan
review_164105551~“Close to Wesley Hospital”~Stayed for 3 nights as we needed to be close to the Wesley. Would not stay here for any other reason. We had a corner apartment close to the roads, triple glazed windows still didn't keep the noise out. The aparment had adequate facilities although the bed was hard, some revamping but mostly dated. The hospital is on top of the hill and the apartments are at the bottom. Beware, the hill is very steep. Witnessed an elderly lady fall down the hill. There are no shops, you can buy your supplies at Toowong shopping centre, which is the next stop for the train. Good transport, train, bus, ferry. Train stops at Auchenflower, on the other side of the hospital.~3~3~4~2~nan~3~3~nan
review_160116476~“Handy to Wesley Hosoital”~Very handy if you need to be near Wesley Hospital. Accommodation is adequate and comfortable. Free parking is good and easy access from city. No meals in house other than breakfast packs. Great meals at the Regatta hotel if walking and Toowong Shopping Centre is within walking distance if making your own meals. We would stay again when returning to the Wesley Hospital.  Be warned the walk to the Hospital is up a very steep hill, a we have a wheelchair, the alternative was to head up Corrination Drive then cut through the park to the rear of hospital and use the carpark lift.~3~3~4~4~3~3~3~nan
review_146659555~“More than adequate”~The building is a lttle tired, but it has a good position, especially if you are tie d to the Wesley Hospital. The Regatta Hotel is a short walk away and the Auchenflower/Milton restaurants are nearby. Good views of the river traffic, free secure underbuilding parkingand WiFi. Traffic noise from Coronation Drive was a problem for the first night but seemed to fade the longer we stayed. Good value for money and the owners are very friendly and helpful. Recommended.~3~4~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_143304832~“Disappointing in many ways.”~We visited for a couple of days earlier this month in a three week tour of eastern Australia. Firstly the positives - there is free car parking and wifi, which we found very valuable. The property was also clean and tidy and we had a lovely view of the river. The negatives were, however, frustrating because these apartments could be so much better. I gather the property is popular with visitors to the adjoining hospital and perhaps that is why we felt that it had a hospital atmosphere, with drab furnishings and colours. We didn't think that the green chairs and paintwork worked with the 'new' brown carpet and red ochre settee. Indeed the chairs and beds looked as if they had been purchased as part of a hospital job lot. There was also a 'hospital smell' in the corridors, but if it was disinfectant, that is no bad thing. Our view has generally been that you don't spend much time in a room, so the decor is maybe not so important. The furnishings do look to have been assembled on the cheap and this leads us to the main downsides. We met one of the proprieters on check-in and she seemed a nice lady, however it did feel a bit like being at school as we looked around the apartment. Notices liberally placed around the apartment and especially on appliances were the kind of 'don't do this' or 'do that and it will cost you this' signs that are hardly welcoming. They informed of charges of $30 for unclean dishes, $200 'refreshment charge for smokers, and a warning that if the fire brigade were called out (bizarrely), the cost would be $1020. I have never seen such signs in any other apartment. I have attached photos of these. Would we return or recommend the apartments? No, we just felt that the place was too depressing and a little disconnected from the centre. I suspect that the private owners do not have the resources to improve, which is understandable in the current climate. However, decent investment could transform the apartments. For us, though, it was the worst accommodation we stayed in throught our visit to Australia and, unfortunately, every other place got compared with 'the Chaseley'. I hope it works out for the owners, but I would recommend that if they get an interior designer, good beds and furniture, they could be on a winner. Sadly, it didnt reach that level for us the way it is at the moment.~2~3~3~3~3~4~3~nan
review_143149409~“Clean, spacious”~The apartment was fairly average but spacious and clean. TV was old but had some foxtel channel, internet worked well, strong connection and didnt drop out and was free however you were asked to be consious of your usage amount. I was given a nice room with a view and the windows were thick so didnt have a problem with noise. Kitchen was stocked and clean, the bathroom was very clean and spacious and included a washer and dryer. Main problem was that it had no opening windows so might not be great for a long term stay but the airconditioning worked however only in the living room. The staff were not that friendly and the housekeeping staff took away my do not disturb sign which i thought was very rude.~3~3~3~5~3~4~2~nan
review_141381456~“Extended stay for hospital treatment”~I had a 7 week stay in a one bed apartment while I had treatment at the Wesley Hospital. The apartment was very comfortable with great views over the river. Such a great location and fully self contained with every convenience.i would love to recommend this accommodation to anyone who has to have an extended stay for hospital treatment. It is so convenient for the hospital but also to local shops and for transport into the city. The bonus is the on site managers Elizabeth and Marcus who make sure that their guests are so well taken care of . Highly recommended~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_139127981~“good choice”~Very comfortable and convenient. We stayed 2 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment, with family and 2 nights in 1 bedroom. Both good but the 2 br was noisy because it overlooked Coronation Drive on a Saturday evening, which was extra noisy. The 1 br had noise reduction double glazing and that was fine. We would stay there again as it is convenient to the city and the nearby suburb where our son lives. We enjoyed travelling on the City Cat to Southbank which is only 2 stops.~4~4~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_138720576~“Great location,but a bit noisy....”~We stayed here's for two separate nights during August, the location is fantastic, right on the river. The rooms are reasonable, comfortable and fairly well set up for a short stay with the ability to self-cater. There is a very good selection of breakfast packs and microwave meals at reception. There are many restaurants in the area as well as the shopping village close by in Toowong. The managers are very nice and overall it was a comfortable place to stay. Would I stay again, perhaps as a business traveller but unfortunately probably not as a leisure traveller; the noise factor from Corotation Drive is just too loud for me, I slept in the second bedroom, which in my opinion, seemed a bit noisier than the main bedroom. I realised the location means you will be close to a main road and I live in a big city so would not regard myself as overly sensitive to road so it is a real shame. Otherwise it was a good stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_132921940~“Very nice place to stay”~This is a very compfortable place to stay, even with young children. We had to find a place to stay in the City for one night to catch up with some overseas friends that we had no room for at home. The managers were very accommodating when we asked if we could stay on the same floor as our friends. Marcus and Elizabeth even made sure they had some modern kids movies for our kids to keep them amused. We were put into an appartment that faced the river and was great to just watch the world go by outside. Appartment was reasonably new with a new bathroom and full kitchen facilities which suited us perfectly. Marcus and Elizabeth went out of their to make us and our kids feel compfortable for our stay and our kids talk about going back just to see the managers. We will be back.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_130848604~“Excellent Hotel for a worker”~This is an excellent Hotel for someone like me who had work in Brisbane over the last few months. The value for money is excellent. I would leave at 6am and arrive back at about 6pm so I missed most of the traffic times, it usually slows down at midnight and starts again around 6am. The unit suited me very well with the laundry and kitchen. I found both Marcus and Elizabeth to be wonderfull always happy and cheerful. Had a broken part in the microwave the last time I was there and after a call to reception it was fixed immediately. The location was excellent, as I was working at Eagle Farm, Milton and acacia ridge, I was able to drive there with ease mainly because at 6am there is not much traffic on the road.~5~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_127573412~“Excellent location if you need near the Wesley Hospital”~We chose Chasely Apartments because it is located right next door to the Wesley Hospital. Yes, it is in walking distance, but be warned, the walk up the hill to the hospital entrance is very steep and may not be suitable for everyone. I've seen in other reviews that the managers sometimes drive guests who cannot make it up the hill to the hospital entrance. That's a very nice service. We arrived in Brisbane on an early flight and our room wasn't available yet. The managers were very gracious about storing our luggage for us until our room was ready.  The apartment was clean and had a full kitchen. The bathroom looked brand new and had a washer and dryer in it. For the price of the accommodation and the location right on the Brisbane River in the CBD, we felt we got good value for this accommodation. We stayed in a room facing the river and it was nice to watch the City Cat cruising past. It definitely served it's purpose on location and had all the room facilites you would need for a longer stay. If you order a cab to pick you up here, don't wait out front on Coronation Drive. The cabs pick up at the rear of the building at the car park entrance. We almost lost our cab to another couple as we were waiting in the reception looking out towards Coronation. I noticed a cab turn the corner so I asked the manager where the cabs pickup and they advised us cabs won't stop on Coronation Drive. Luckily, when we ran out of the back door the other couple realized it was the cab company we had booked with and not the company they had called. It was a busy traffic morning and the some of the train lines were down which added to the load on the cabs. It was a bit nerve racking as the unforseen cab delay could have caused us to miss our flight.~4~4~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_125828506~“"Very Convenient"”~My Cousin and I stayed at the Chasely Apartments for two nights, while visiting her terminally ill brother at the Wesley Hospital. We found the Apartments on line and also booked online, being a bit worried about some of the negitative reviews we had read online. That stopped immediately after our very warm welcome on arrival. We had a two bedroom apartment, it wasn't five star but it was very comfortable, clean and there was everything there that we needed. It served our purpose well. The staff, Elizabeth and her partner where extremely caring and asking after my cousin on our return from our visits with him. I have problems with my knees and although the Chasely is very close to the Hospital, there is a very steep hill to walk up, and with Elizabeth knowing this, she drove us up to the front door of the hospital each time we needed to visited him. I would have no problem recommending the Chasely, and would definitely stay there again.~4~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_120137181~“Thank you Chasely apartments”~Fortunately, they are close to the hospital where one of my relatives was being treated for cancer and I have to say a BIG thank you to the staff at the apartments.  I felt extremely vulnerable at this time and the staff were very sensitive and helpful. The manageress always enquired after my relative and even bothered to ask me how I was coping everyday.  The rooms were bright, clean and well maintained. Pricing was good value and overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the apartments to anyone, whether it be for a holiday or as a welcome retreat from the toils of the day visiting sick relatives.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_120065259~“Worked well for us”~I had previously stayed in a nearby set of apartments when needing to be close to the Wesley but the Chasely was much much cheaper. After I booked this apartment I read the reviews and then I was a bit worried. But our stay was pleasant. I can't say what the managers used to be like but we found the current ones to be quite nice (even if they are Kiwis, haha). The 2 bedroom apartment we stayed in appears to have been recently refurbished with updated bathroom, bedspreads (possibly beds as well?) and furniture in the lounge. Kitchen appliances a bit dated but worked just fine. Noise from Coronation Drive was about the same as the last place I stayed which was up the hill and not right on the road, so I expect all the apartments in the area have the same kind of issue. Anyway I found that the "white noise" from the central aircon pretty much drowned out the traffic. The apartment was very handy to the Wesley, easy walk to the Regatta ferry and bus stop and close to Toowong shops.~4~5~4~3~4~4~3~nan
review_118651050~“Basic apartments”~We stayed for two nights in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was very clean and well equipped. However, I would appreciate it a lot more if the room was serviced on a daily basis. I'm not sure if our room wasn't serviced because we only stayed two nights. You also have to take the rubbish with you and deposit them in the bins downstairs upon departure. The windows are not sound proof which is definitely a big negative for me as I was woken up early in the morning by the morning traffic on Coronation Drive. Overall, I think it is a basic clean apartment. However, I probably won't stay there again because of the noise factor.~3~3~5~2~3~5~3~nan
review_115923560~“Enjoyed my stay”~I stayed a week at Chasely as I was in town for a conference, and was also visiting my brother. The apartment was spacious, modern though not 'flash', and was well-equipped. It had a small kitchen, nice bathroom which also had a washing machine and dryer, and a lounge with TV. It both heated and cooled well, which was important because it could be absolutely sweltering at times! Do note that it is just an apartment - no pools or restaurants etc. You go there to sleep and get ready to go out, basically.  It was modest and affordable, and a very short walk to the bus stop, as well as the City Cat stop, and only about 20-30 minutes walk from the closest shopping centre. The only negatives were that despite the double glazing, being on a busy street meant you could still hear traffic (didn't bother me but I know it's a factor for some) and the lock on the bedroom door was hard to latch. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay there and would go back again.~4~5~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_35991425~“Small but handy to everything.”~We stayed here 3 nights for a variety of reasons - catching up with friends and family and a night out at the footy at Suncorp stadium. Location wise, the Chasely apartments were perfect. Right on the river, a short hop from ferry, rail and bus stations and very close to Suncorp. The apartment was adequate, nothing more. 2 bedrooms, a very small living area, and a basic kitchenette. There were 2 bathrooms which was nice. The main bathroom had a washer and dryer. We weren't there much, thank goodness, as it was crowded for a family of four, but if you were staying there while a family member was in the Wesley hospital next door, it would be quite ok. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly and there were frozen meals, drinks etc available for purchase in the foyer.~3~3~5~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_25730723~“Wonderful staff, very neat and tidy, and very handy to all”~Stayed there with my partner found the place to be spotless the staff/front office couldnt have been more helpful, caring and just really nice people. I would stay there any time and would tell all my friends about to do the same. Price was good. New lounges and had a great night sleep  Thanks heaps Chasely Apts~4~4~5~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_8485278~“Ok, I guess”~Well, actually the place gets mixed reviews from my perspective. The managers are really nice, and they are trying really hard to make this a good place to stay. The place was freshly painted and quite spacious (we had a 2 bedroom/2bath unit). The carpet & furniture desperately need to be replaced. While the unit itself was not half-bad, the shabby carpet and stained furniture were real detracters. There was also a strong scent of cooking or fried food in our unit - probably engrained in the carpet. We also had some difficulty with the mattresses. The master room was not bad, but the twin mattresses in the other room were so bad (twanging springs and lumpy) that we had to stack two mattresses together in order for the third person of our party to get any sleep. There is no pool or any services - this is purely an apartment in a neighborhood. It was a 15 minute walk in either direction to get to any restaurants or shops. There is a cute neighborhood with some outside cafes, etc. about a 6 "country" block walk outside and to the left of the unit. The hospital is right across the street. The views from the unit of Brisbane were spectacular. The unit had a lot of windows that made it bright and pleasant in that regard. The windows however were not very soundproof - therefore there was road noise as the place sits right on Coronation Drive overlooking the river. Taxi's in Brisbane were not cheap. There is a bus stop right out front and the City Cat Ferry is a short walk away. There is free wireless Internet in the entire building of the Chasely. So, if you are looking for a cheaper place to stay and are not interested in the usual hotel amenities - then this may be a good choice for you. Just be aware that the walks to the restaurants could take you a bit (especially in driving rain, which is what we found in Brisbane for the entire 6 days we were there). If you want to ex[lore Brisbane CBD - then get familiar with the Ferry or the buses or the Taxi's before you get there. ~2~nan~2~nan~2~3~4~3
