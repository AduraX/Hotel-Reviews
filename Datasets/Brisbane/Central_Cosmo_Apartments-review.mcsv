review_472833356~“Location! ”~Less than a block from our office in Milton you can't get much better. Heaps of restaurants on Park St & right across from the river.  Not sure I'd stay if I wanted to explore Brisbane as it's a bit of a hike into the CBD but there are buses outside the door.  Room have all the basics, like a studio apartment.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471992762~“Not bad, not great”~Stayed for 4 weeks in a 1 bed apartment as had business nearby. Rooms are fine, place is quiet, bed was comfy. Staff were all helpful and good standard of room clean. Issue is internet if you are here with work. 1 GB a week will run out very quick! Should just do unlimited. Rooms was small (but knew that), gym / sauna not worth bothering with. All in all not too bad for money and location. I'm putting very good as I always slept well here which is important.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471547745~“Was given a dirty room”~Stayed for one night and was given a room that hadn't been cleaned, the bed wasn't made, not all towels were clean and there were old soaps left next to the sink in the bathroom and in the shower. When I complained the reception staff were uncaring and advised that their manager would give me a call later in the day to discuss, however, I never received a call. Certainly wouldn't return.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_469913006~“COMFORTABLE AND CONVENIENT”~One is never completely certain about accommodation booked on the internet until one arrives, and having to make a quick trip to Brisbane to meet a new grandchild I was looking for something moderately priced because really, we just needed a bed. What a pleasant surprise! This apartment block is incredibly well situated, 20 minutes from the airport, one block back from the river and close to plenty of restaurants and cafes. As a bonus, it's just across the road from the "city cat" ferry service - a great way to travel into the city and one we wished we had used earlier in our trip. Our studio apartment was spacious and comfortable and would suit a longer stay since it was equipped with a washer and dryer. Rooms are serviced daily, in spite of its location on a fairly busy road it is very quiet - I will stay here again. Oh, and by the way, staff are great too.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465433308~“Wonderful Stay!”~Wonderful hospitality.  Our room had a balcony facing the beautiful Brisbane River. The hotel is close to transit and walking distance to shops. Highly recommend!

review_461932382~“Dated and dirty”~Stayed in 1 bed King 508 over 6 nights with family of 3. 1. Bedside light bulb requiring replacement before first night 2. Dust all over the place (on floor, on TV screen, on shelves) 3. Dirty tea cups with marks from tea sediment 4. Someones's Elastoplast in bathroom 5. Cigarette butts on the balcony 6. Stains on curtains 7. Size of fridge too small for a family of 3 8. Tire appliances (dishwasher, very loud) 9. Dangerously unstable heavy granite bar counter-top in the kitchen 10. No separate dining table and chairs  11. Car parking has to be paid separably, on top of room rate 12. Hotel wifi network is not secured, rendering free coupons useless~2~nan~4~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_459462800~“Comfortable, good value hotel by the River”~We booked a studio apartment for the weekend it was adequate for what we wanted plus a kitchen but no cooking facilities. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Milton City Cat wharf and about the same to the Milton Train Station. We had tickets to the Rugby 10s at Suncorp Stadium which was a 15 minute walk. Some nice restaurants in Park Road also the chinese restaurant at the hotel, which we didn't go to, but it was very busy every night. Would certainly go back if requiring a room on that side of the city.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_451136594~“Close to what was needed in Brisbane and great views.”~We stayed in the large one bedroom apartment just the two of us for a shopping trip. Ate dinner at a very nice restaurant in walking distance. Rooms were quiet and the bed was comfortable. Would stay again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_448474536~“Great location, value for money”~The apartments are located close to the ferry terminal and bus stops which made it easily accessible. It is also within walking distance to a slew of shops, cafes and restaurants along Park Road which was fantastic. The 2-bedroom apartment we booked was of adequate size for us 3 adults. The room, we felt, was a little dated but it served our purpose and it was value-for-money. We will definitely consider this place again if we happen to be in Brisbane in the near future.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_446176598~“Great location ”~Flew in to see Coldplay and needed accommodation, this place was great. Very clean appartments with basic kitchen. Close to Milton restaurants and stadium.

review_441840659~“So accessible”~We had to be in Brisbane for a function in the City. The Central Cosmo Apartments was a great place to stay. A 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities and undercover parking was perfect. Continental breakfast packs are available but don't bother. Just step into Park Road and you'll find any number of places for coffee and lift to full breakfast options. When time is short, you can still shop for shoes, fashion accessories, clothing, jewellery, stationery and much more. Just explore Park Road. We stayed in room 409 and had the delight of watching a storm brewing over the hills with its magnificent cloud formations and lightning. Then the rain raced down the river and engulfed the suburb. It was magic.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_440499792~“First but not last time”~Single night stop over in Brisbane made that much easier staying in place that understands what business travelers are after - quality rooms, space, friendly staff and quality local restaurants that get you out and turn off.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_436235075~“Everything we needed - will stay again”~Stayed for 2 nights - we would normally stay in the CBD on our regular visits to Brisbane however this time we thought we would give the Central Cosmo a try. Rooms are a good size, clean, comfortable, a small balcony, a bit outdated but had everything we needed including a small kitchenette and a washing machine. Comfortable beds, quiet and we got a good nights sleep. Free WiFi, pool and a small gym. On site parking at $7/day, easy access to the city on either the ferry, train or walking. Close to a great choice of restaurants and other amenities - an all around good location. Good value, friendly staff and will definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_435951078~“Views of river”~Roomy apartment with seating and dining table. Large bedroom with comfortable bed. 27 outside as was good to have air-conditioning inside. Washing machine and dryer.

review_435217541~“Great apartments and location”~Great 3 day stay. Loved layout of apartment 405 with river views from both balconies and bedrooms. Very quiet apartments with no noise from other apartment, beside or above. Frequent Rivercat service directly across road provides a cheap, quick and enjoyable ride to CBD,( one stop), and to the lovely and interesting Southbank area. Delicious food from downstairs restaurant. A special and big thank you to wonderful Hannah on the front desk who went beyond her call of duty to spend quite some time to help us organise our airport transfer. All in all a wonderful stay.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_434226814~“Great Weekly Business Stay”~The apartments are in a perfect location, close to all amenities and transport and only a short ferry trip into the city. Comfortable and clean with good sized rooms. Would stay here again for business or for a holiday. The apartments are well suited for longer stays when you might need some kitchen facilities.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_429055653~“Great location”~We had three nights in a one bedroom apartment at the back of the building on the first floor. Lovely and quiet despite being very close to busy Coronation Drive. Very close to Milton City Cat which makes for a lovely trip on the Brisbane River with lots to see at the stops along the way. Also only a five minute walk to Milton railway station. Lots of great restaurants in this street and a ten minute walk across Milton Road to a very well stocked supermarket. On site parking at a reasonable cost, although the spaces are more suited to small cars. The apartment was well appointed with good kitchen appliances as well as a washing machine and drier. Very comfortable bed and very good hot water pressure. Only problem was wardrobe access was awkward due to narrow space between bed and wardrobe. Enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_428652773~“Great location”~I stayed in Cosmo for 4 nights in mid Oct. It is a great location if you're working in or near Milton. It's near a lot of restaurants and you can charge back to your room for a lot of the restaurants. Check in & out was trouble free - the staff are very friendly. You get 2Gb of wifi data per week to use which isn't bad. My queen studio had a bit of space. The room also came with a washing machine & dryer. I was based on the 4th floor and had great views of the river. It's walking distance to the train station too. All in all I'd say it was very good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425227650~“We liked it”~We stayed for one night before we flew back to Melbourne. We had a friendly greeting by the assistant behind the counter and he was very helpful. Our room was on the 4th floor. From the balcony we could see the mountains to the left and slight city views to the right. The room was well appointed and the bed was very comfy. Secure undercover parking was only $7 and we had free wifi.  I loved the atrium type layout of the hotel, and how you can look down into the foyer from the hallway. Oh, and I liked the cute old fashioned ding of the elevator!  The hotel is not right in the hustle and bustle of the city, which we liked, so getting out and about in the car was less stress.  We walked across the road and along the river to the Museum of modern art and Southbank. It took us about 20 minutes.  There are cafes and restaurants very close by.  We enjoyed our stay at Central Cosmo, and hope to return again someday. Thank you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423350272~“Great location”~Stayed 3 nights on business and found the room comfortable and well appointed.

review_421618202~“Brisbane accommodation ”~For our Brisbane trip accommodation my wife choose Central Cosmo Apartment. It is located in quiet area close to my daughter competition place and close to city. Also not fare from Airport. On ground floor placed very good "Chinese Sea Milton" restaurant. Apartment includes living room with TV and small kitchen/bar, where installed all necessary appliances. Two bedrooms, one with single bed and wardrobe and second one with double bed, wardrobe and TV. It has a great river view from living room balcony. Bathroom in my opinion a little bit small for 3 people. When we arrived evening time we found that some lights weren't work, we informed reception and next morning everything was fixed, because maintenance people don't provide services evening time. Room cleaning wasn't provided during 4,5 days of our accommodation. On the other hand we were informed by reception that towels can be replaced upon our request.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The location was great with easy access to Toowong and Indooroopilly and Park Rd restaurants. The room was of a high standard with no noise and everything you need. I felt safe here at all times. Parking is great too. Its my go to place in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399919358~“Comfortable stay”~Pros - comfortable room, quiet room, great location, helpful staff Cons - no pool (wouldn't normally bother me but was very hot and humid) Stayed here for work, comfortable stay and well located close to ferry and a few blocks to the train station and Suncorp. Numerous take away and restaurants nearby, an IGA a few blocks away.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_391924359~“Well located Hotel”~Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment suitable for 3 people as second bedroom has only a twin size bed, Rollout bed available for an extra $35 per night, not sure where it would fit as not a lot of space in the living room. Lovely view of river from main balcony and view back towards Milton from the bedroom balcony. The new Milton Ferry Terminal is just across the road and the Milton railway station is within easy walking distance, so makes for very easy use of public transport. Secure Underground Parking is available at $7 per day. Apartment though not spacious was more than adequate for our needs, clean and comfortable. Surrounded by a large number of Restaurants all tastes are catered for. Free WiFi was a bonus.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_391532336~“Weekend Away”~My wife and I booked a 2 night stay for a well deserved break. Upon arrival on Friday afternoon we were greeted at the desk by Ian. He was very friendly and was happy to assist with any inquiries. The Cosmo Reception area was welcoming and clean. Our room was was excellent, and the kingsize bed was very,very comfortable. On Saturday, we tried to use the drier in the room, but could not get it to work. We spoke to Maggie at reception, and she was very helpful with a bubbly personality and very willing to help. We went out for a few hours and upon our return, the drier was working and all was good. Overall, I would recommend the Cosmo and Park Road has many options for meals and great coffee. It is close to Suncorp Stadium, and a City Cat Terminal is just across the road to enjoy a cruise on the Brisbane River. We had a great weekend and I think you would be very happy if you stayed ther. AA+ for this location. The one thing I did find was the parking on-site was much cheaper than all others we looked into. There was plenty of parking and only $7 a day. This was compared to others who were asking $25 a day to park. So the Cosmo wins in all areas.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_387960997~“Great location close to the city”~My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights for the State of Origin.  We were both very pleased with our stay. Location was great- situated on Park Road Milton which has a number of restaurants, bars and the Milton train station which is a 3 minute walk from the Hotel and only 2 stops from the city.  We took a nice long walk along the Brisbane river and ended up at the Regatta Hotel for an afternoon drink and snack before heading back to Park Road for dinner and dessert.  Room was split into a lounge room, small kitchen and large main room which had a balcony for fresh air. Everything was clean, well maintained and comfortable. The only downside was there was no TV in the bedroom. Staff were friendly and attentive which made for a pleasant stay. We will definitely be back, especially if we have an event at Suncorp Stadium.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_379181728~“Very Close to Suncorp”~Fantastic accomodation, within walking distance to Suncorp Stadium.

review_378453643~“Big rooms - best sleep”~Only stayed for one night and was quite disappointed to be on the first floor with a look out over industrial area and other very close buildings, however, the room was really big, well appointed and I had the best sleep on a king bed with little noise from adjoining rooms, street noise etc. Great choice if dining downstairs at the popular Chinese restaurant or very close to the bridge to West End. Full sized kitchen with mini bar which was great.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_378187233~“SUPERB APARTMENTS, LOCATION and AMBIENCE making for a memorable holiday in Brisbane”~CENTRAL COSMO APARTMENTS (4 nights - Fifth floor) Past experiences have taught me that one can already gauge the quality of an establishment through the initial contact with the reservation team and I was not disappointed. All email queries were responded to quickly and I would like to make a special “thank you” to Maggie (front office) for making our visit to this beautiful city extra special. We contacted Central Cosmo on the recommendation of friends very familiar with Brisbane (also being regular guests) and what a delightful discovery! The apartment had everything required to facilitate an enjoyable holiday – including a view of the river on one side and the hills on the other. What makes the Central Cosmo really stand out is that this is not a hotel – and as such, devoid of noisy reception and dining areas, bars, etc. etc. How pleasant it was to return to a quiet environment after a busy day of touring and sightseeing, sitting out on the verandah with nibbles and a glass (or two) of “red”. Without doubt, Milton is also one of the best city locations – the City Cat terminal directly across the road (one stop to central city) or the train station some 10 minutes walking distance. A 20 minute walk along the shared bike/walkway provides a stunning view of the city skyline and takes you directly to the Queen Street Mall or to the South Bank precinct via the Victoria Bridge. Also consider “touring” the Brisbane River using the City Cat boats. Because Milton is in Zone 2, this enabled us to travel right down to the St Lucia terminal (and back) and on another day downstream to Northshore Hamilton (and return). A most enjoyable (and cost effective) way of seeing this beautiful city from the river. There are a myriad of good eating places along Park Road (La Dolce Vita, etc.) but for something special simply take the lift down to ground floor and dine on site at China Sea – excellent Asian cuisine. On-site parking is $5 per night – incredible for a large capital city in Australia. Mobility access: via lift in Reception lounge directly to all floors or via basement car park lift direct to all floors – but park on same level as lift doors to avoid steps. Recommendation – showering inside bath tub: as part of the Groups’ Risk Management strategy, we suggest that grab rails be installed adjacent to the shower to provide stability and support when climbing into/out of the bath tub. This would eliminate the possibility of any injury and adhere to all WH&S requirements. Exceptional apartment in an outstanding location!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_377830186~“Great location”~We stayed the weekend in a two bedroom apartment. It's only a small unit but more than ample for our stay as we weren't in the room apart from sleeping. Room had a queen bed and single bed, one bathroom. Also had a kitchen and washing machine for longer stays. Great location - ferry terminal just across the road, train station within easy walk and bus stops were available as well. Suncorp Stadium was just up the road so the perfect hotel to stay when attending the football as no need to worry about transport. Staff were friendly, elevators were extremely fast. There is a restaurant on the premises which we will try next time. There is parking available for $5 per night which is not unreasonable. I'd stay here again simply for the location. Lots of local restaurants if you didn't want to go into the city. Ask for a top floor with river view - we were on the fifth floor and had an amazing view!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_377792767~“Cosmo for a Week”~During our stay at the Cosmo apartment we were comfortable in knowing that our stay almost felt like a small home. We had a one bedroom apartment which was by all means tiny but cozy. The balcony was facing the back which was very lovely and had a nice little peek at the city. We however have some problems with the place which got tedious at time.  The rooms bathroom was as any normal bathroom would be but felt a little off. The toilet paper was placed almost behind the toilet, as well as the shower being almost to small. We wanted to have a bath while we were there but could not find the plug... The living room had a very cramped feel to it and the television was very close to where you were sitting. The kitchen was nice though we did read that if you make the smoke alarm go off you would have to pay the small fee of $1000, honestly that just made us paranoid to cook. Our bed was fairly hard and the pillows not so much on the comfortable side either.  Last but not least of this complaint list is that the room came with only 2 GB for 7 days. 7 Days!!! In this day in age it should be more or unlimited with slower speeds. I know there is the additional option to pay for more but if you have a look at the prices for just one gig you will understand the level off anger I experienced. The good is that it's location is by far amazing. Everything is at the top go your finger tips here and the city is your for as long as you can stay. Room service is very nice a tidy if you bought it and will take care of things for you if you allow then too. Nice restaurant down below with a somewhat private gym and sauna. In this case it's mainly location location location. The staff are friendly and we really did find it to be a small vacation home that was comfortable and right. I'm a hard judge so I'm giving this a 3/5 but in all honesty it was leaning to a 2. Small things that matter usually matter most.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_369715041~“Lovely stay”~Nice apartment with all the necessities for a short stay.  Unusual room layout though, with only 1 TV, and that being in the lounge area, at waist height??? There was no TV in the bedroom.  Handy to transport and the city.  Well appointed small kitchen and laundry.  Clean, modern with friendly staff.  A big, big plus is on site parking at a realistic price. That alone would take me back for our next stay in the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369091806~“Fine for overnight business stay.”~Booked a room for one person for one night. Small room and balcony with a view of building rooftops and road. Washing machine and dryer came in handy. It was fine for one night but the room I had would be too small for longer stays. Room and surrounds were clean and check-in and -out were fine. Overall I would say it was basically a motel room with laundry facilities.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368096653~“Perfect unit for a small family”~Arrived the first night around mid night hence was not able to order a baby cot for the room. The receptionist works office hours however managed to gain access and obtain key card relatively unhindered. Room is nice with a fully equipped kitchen. Cleaning of the room could have been more thorough as insect droppings were seen on the corners of rooms and certain corners were pretty dusty. Overall size of the unit was perfect for my small family with a living area for son to play. Didn't not manage to get a river view but did get a view of the neighbours pool. Recommended apartment!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_351212401~“Our Brisbane "home away from home"”~During 2015 we stayed here in June in a queen-bed one bedroom apartment and in October in a king-bed one bedroom apartment, both on the 5th floor. The apartments are all well-equipped with kitchens or kitchenettes, depending on the room type and each has its own laundry. There is secure parking available beneath the building, which is important for us as we usually drive to Brisbane (this was free when we first started staying here but now costs a very reasonable $5 per day). Free wi-fi is also included. The rooms are serviced each day which we like, however it is possible to have a non-serviced room, I believe. Staff are all very helpful and friendly. Park Road has many and varied cafes and restaurants and there is also a Chinese restaurant within the building, which is quite good. The Milton shops are not very far away and have an IGA, and many small shops and takeaways. It is within walking distance of the city and Southbank (a lovely walk along the river), and if you don't like to, or can't walk so far, there is ample public transport close by - trains, buses and now a CityCat stop at the end of Park Road, which is the way we mostly get around now as we love travelling on the river. We highly recommend these apartments and are looking forward to our next stay.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_327075165~“Great location”~Great location for getting around Brisbane, with secure onsite underground parking and very comfortable bed. However, this isn't a true 1 bedroom apartment (as advertised) as the bedroom isn't properly separated from the living area and the sliding louvred door between the rooms lets in light and sound. Unfortunately there was a problem with cleanliness. The bath was grimy, a coffee mug was coated in food particles with a hair in it, the microwave was grotty and there was a dying cockroach in the hallway for a day. We noticed significant noise from Coronation drive, so best ask for a room off the street if you're easily woken up. (We were also woken up at 6am on a Sunday morning with the crash of bottles from the restaurant downstairs being picked up by the recycling truck so this is something to keep in mind).~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan

review_315734358~“Great value 4 star apartments won't break the bank!”~Straight to the point: great, clean, affordable inner city apartments. We stayed for 3 nights in 2 bedroom apartment, girls at front desk were lovely, housekeeping lady was great too. There's a great cafe/restaurant 500m down the road La Dolce Vita, chinese restaurant opposite reception in the main foyer. Parking is very cheap ($5 per night) compared to other city apartments we looked at that wanted $25!! Nothing at all I can really complain about, but would suggest the mini bar had more variety LOL as there isn't any supermarket nearby, just a coles express servo. If u are looking for good accomodation in the city I would definitely recommend this~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

CityCycle bikes were located nearby so plenty of easy ways to get to the city and South Bank. The studio apartment that we stayed in was well set up for a short city stay and staff were friendly and helpful. There are plenty of restaurants in the street so everything within easy reach. We would certainly stay there again if visiting Brisbane City and surrounds~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
