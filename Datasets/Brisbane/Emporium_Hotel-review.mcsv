review_477319060~“Lovely but Dated & Overpriced”~Having gone to Uni in Brisbane in another time - the Emporium has always been on my must stay hotel list. Overnight on way back to Hong Kong provided this opportunity. It's stylish and the concierge fellow was lovely. The lobby and room appear very stylish but in closer inspection the rooms show they are rather dated. They were ok. It certainly not consistent with the high end of town rates they demand. Surrounding area is nice and plenty of restaurant offerings. Loved James Street and Spoon.  Check out was a shock with car parking at a big 45 dollars - whaaaa? Recommend? Honestly - not really. It's fine but overpriced with plenty of better competitive and more current hotels nearby.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452833257~“Emporium Elite”~Well you do feel special, when you arrive out front of this hotel. We drove up and where greeted by a lovely concierge and valet and then shown into the stunning foyer. The staff on the front desk so warm and welcoming, prompt check-in. Once in the room did not disappoint. Plush furnishings, comfy bed and pillow. Quiet nights sleep and block out curtains. Lovely bathroom. Quiet aircon in our room.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477316810~“Comfortable stay.”~Family of three, 2 x adults and our son aged 11 in a king room (rollaway + $35) staying one night.  Overall a comfortable stay in a well designed and fitted/furnished room with a decent sized bathroom. Large shower with good water pressure and abundant hot water and room size was adequate. Electrics, air con and TV all very good. Perhaps if you're going to offer a coffee machine, leave more than two pods in the room and some washing detergent for the sink would also help (we did note there was dishwasher powder but weren't going to use it for a few cups and a plate). The only staff we had dealing with were reception and valet parking. Check in was prompt and courteous but not overly personable or friendly - check out equally prompt and much more friendly. Valet parking staff x 2 were very friendly and helpful... but would prefer you didn't use the horn on our car to blast the taxi parked in the drop off/pick up area because it's very loud when the three of us are standing just near the front of the bonnet! We agree the cost of valet parking here is too expensive, something they need to look at. We used it knowing full well the price, but for many it's price prohibitive and that (with the minor issues noted) would probably have us staying elsewhere next time and it falls short of a 'five star' review. A comfortable stay in a very good room and while the price wasn't an issue for us, for mind it's probably priced a little high.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476932212~“A little dated but excellent service”~A very easy stroll to Fortitude valley shops and down to the riverwalk for a morning walk. Small gym unfortunately but great sauna and pool - really enjoyed a workout., sauna, dip in the pool then a snack by the pool getting emails done. Its showing signs of wear which is completely to be expected and not in excess of what you would expect a 10 year old venue to show. The team of staff though were fantastic! So handy having a variety of eateries downstairs too. Bed super comfy and big bathroom. Minimal noise from outside. Will definitely be back next trip. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476277691~“Shame ”~We booked into the hotel for a 4 day break in a suite. Firstly upon arriving we basically were met by a receptionist who was effectively dismissive of us checking in. Looking down on us stated 'since you have booked a corner suit I will hold $800 on your card just in case!'. Unsure what2 females over the age of 40 would do! I have stayed in 5star hotels and never had to put down a deposit or be treated in such a way - the car we hired only needed a $250 deposit. The hotel is very much like the Art series in Melbourne and is very stylish. Pillows and bed very soft. No turn down service others mentioned and whilst the cocktail bar is awesome it lacks any sort of atmosphere - bright lights and bored staff don't help. Location is good and lots of choices outside. Valet parking the next day was great and agree with other comments about the team here - very genuine. Such a shame and wonder if the number one rating has made everyone forget the customer comes first and does have a choice. Would not go back simply due to staff attitudes.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475970374~“Beautiful But...”~I loved this hotel. Beautiful foyer, lovely room, amazing spa bath in room.  The pool let me down though. We booked here to enjoy a swim and it was way too cold. I feel like a hotel like this could afford to keep it heated. My only gripe!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475407035~“Best Hotel in Brisbane”~This hotel was everything all the reviews said it would be. Great Staff. Very helpful in all things and the concierge was great helping us make dinner reservations and with his suggestions for restaurants. Great Bar with a good selection of bar snacks. We could not ask for more in hotel. We were driving and they had valet parking into their garage with very quick delivery.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475406742~“Service is second to none - Nice hotel”~This is a nice hotel....I stayed in the king spa suite...I wouldn't exactly call it a suite, per se. but it is a very nice room. I was disappointed not to have a balcony like I saw in the pics. I was hoping for chairs and a table to sit on and take in some fresh air. All I got was a half metre wide ledge/balcony that you could stand on.... Bed was reasonably comfortable Room was clean Molten Brown shower products were awesome Spa was nice (pic attached). The best (by far) part about the Emporium is the level of customer service. It was second to none. I have stayed at nearly every 4-5 star in Brisbane, and this is the best customer service I have received, to date. The pool deck is nice....privacy curtains are a great idea.... I wasn't impressed with the Wi-Fi I also didn't like how I could hear all the noise in the corridors from my room. Every single door that opened and closed, and every single conversation that went past. Some hotels seem to a better job of making these rooms quieter. This is a quality hotel that I'd rate at 4.5 stars.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_475404035~“Good but expansive”~The king sized bed was very comfy, but no more so than the Novotel, where we usually stay; not worth the extra $100. Also: car parking. There is valet parking at the hotel for $45. Before we arrived, I asked if there was any other option nearby. The hotel said, and I quote "Unfortunately there isn’t too many options for parking thus we recommend valet parking. The only other option is on-street parking around the hotel, however it is metered in some areas". This is not true at weekends: we parked directly outside, on Wickham Street, which had FREE unresticted parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475198888~“3 1/2 really”~Nice rooms & good location. Not my taste in furnishings or decor but that's a personal thing really. My main gripe was the feeling I got that they were intent on charging me for literally everything I looked at. From the TV menu to the minibar it's all absolute extortion! I ended up bringing back a bottle of wine from dinner & moved a few things around in the minibar fridge to make it fit. The next day I was immediately charged for the items I moved, even though they were still in the fridge! I got a refund after complaining but it left a bad taste in my mouth & I left with the feeling I was just a walking wallet to them. I won't be back~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475166358~“Blown away”~We recently stayed at the emporium and were blown away. The hotel itself was superb with each room although looking like just a great room revealed much more. Hidden behind cupboards we were amazed to find a small kitchenette area and even laundry facilities .mthis is fantastic for business and pleasure as it gives you options. Even more spectacular than the room itself was the service we received we were astounded . Friendly efficient , unassuming, we would definitely stay again and have made anoint in recommending to friends. They made our weekend break an absolute pleasure.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474268545~“Memorable stay”~Never been to this location heard a lot of great reviews so lets give it a go. ENJOYED from the moment greeted at the door by Great friendly staff. Was our chance to get to reconnect with each other. Worth it...Luxurious room, Great outlook, Exquisite location. Time to unwind, wonder the area & connect.

review_473493120~“Awesome hotel with awesome service”~I stayed at the Emporium last Saturday 1st April as a last minute booking, i have previously stayed there and was impressed then and i am still impressed, the location is great and the rooms exceptional, the beds and pillows are that good on the Sunday i checked out i purchased a pillow and then went to 40 winks and purchased a new bed and mattress the same as the Emporium, the cocktail bar is exceptional as well and the surrounding restaurants offer a great variety of different foods...~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473486549~“Everything its meant to be.”~We dont often go all out and stay at these kind of places, but for our anniversary we decided to give it a go especially as we did not need to drive anywhere for dinner as there are over 10 different dining options within the emporium complex. The roof top pool area is fantastic and the whole place is very well maintained, along with the rooms which are divine.  We got breaky included which was delivered to our door (on xmas day mind you) hot and really well cooked..  The emporium complex is a bit away from the normal hotel areas and not within walking distance to the city, but it made a exquisite change to the normally CBD get away that we do a few times a year.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473094075~“Disappointed given the hype”~I thought it was nice but not exceptional. The staff seemed aloof and I thought the pool and gym facilities were disappointing. I expected more given the cost. The location is not ideal for many of the city's attractions. The bar is definitely worth a visit, serving some interesting cocktails.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472836457~“Quality hotel in excellent location”~Fantastic hotel in central location - full amenities and staff are outstanding for service..couldnt fault any part of my two night stay and guests are treated well. The ultra modern surrounds and exclusively appointed bars and foyer will remind you are in a quality hotel. I totally recommend staying here, I'll certainly be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472027385~“Love, love, love. ”~Things we loved about emporium - everything! Including, but not limited to - the location, the super helpful and lovely staff, the lush room, the surrounding dining choices, the comfy bed, pillow, and sitting area, and the ability to control temperature.  It's not often that we stay places and have not a single little thing we'd change, but this was one of those times.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471444335~“Excellent service and very cool”~We have stayed here a few times for business and pleasure. The rooms and the hotel generally is very cool, well appointed and the service is outstanding. Nothing is too difficult.  I had some problems with wifi when we get here and they sorted it immediately.  If there is one opportunity it would be breakfast options. They only serve breakfast in your room - the alternative is the choice of two Cafes just next to the hotel which You can charge to your room - one cafe has very limited choices and Buzz (the other one) has good food but it's not the quality of the hotel... Great location with James street a five minute walk.  Very cool and good alternative to the city!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471043192~“Wedding”~Nice modern hotel in a great location. The staff were polite and very helpful. Was worried about lift noise in room 502 but it wasn't a problem just the air con clicking noisily on and off all night. Plenty of cafes and restaurants around in the immediate area. Would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470036057~“Amazing!!! Stay here ”~The Emporium revitalizes that feeling that you are taken care of the second you step foot into the hotel. From the devour to the attentive staff, I can almost guarantee you will have a fabulous time at this hotel. Michael out!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469983702~“Above and beyond”~We stayed only 2 nights in Brisbane as it was the end of our trip. We will definitely return to the Emporium and stay longer. My wife has special needs and the hotel catered to them perfectly. The managers were very understanding to her needs and all the staff went out of their way to assist. We are both grateful to all the staff for making our stay enjoyable. The rooms were very clean comfy and luxurious. Ask for anything and they will try and make it happen.6 star.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469472649~“Luxe getaway”~We truly enjoyed our king suite, the room had a sense of luxury and seclusion from the world. Staff were attentive in perfect measure. Little things like the coffee machine and particularly nice bathroom treats were appreciated too. It is ideal for couples and business. The bar / tapas downstairs is easily charged to your room.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_468224407~“Outstanding service”~This was our first stay as we usually stay in the CBD and we weren't disappointed. The first thing we noticed is how lovely the staff are. Even offering to book dinner at the Italian restaurant next door for us. Then we got a free upgrade as we were staying for my birthday. The king room was beautiful and has a very comfy bed. We were on the first floor and did not hear any road noise at all. The highlight of our night was the cocktail bar which is located within the hotel. It was the perfect spot for after dinner drinks! Thanks again for an amazing stay! We will be back!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467133484~“Do it!”~Normally I pay $160 but jumping to the $200 level for 5 nights was well worth it. Concierge came out today and walked across the car park to help us with our shopping, who does that? Any time of the day these guys are so helpful, I know it costs to park but dropping your car at the door truly is easy...check in is efficient and friendly and NOT pretentious for this level of hotel. The emporium area has great variety of quality restaurants, good bar and even a 7/11 for that late night ice cream or toothbrush I forgot. Cleaning staff polite, actually seem happy and their work perfect. Kitchenette great option....capsule coffee machine rocks..in summary awesome place....~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467094139~“We can't be more grateful to Nick”~We can't be more grateful for Nick's kindness when my son had a seizure at Bell Epoque Cafe which is a part of the hotel yesterday. Nick came to assist us when I asked one of their staff members to call ambulance. He did everything he could to help us. He organized valley parking while we had to leave my car to go to a hospital.  We were not actually stayed at the hotel, however, we had an opportunity to have a tour of the hotel when we attended a seminar. Their rooms and facilities were fabulous! All staff members were friendly and I highly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_466450046~“Recommended”~Our room had a kitchenette and washing machine/dryer. Room service food very good. Service friendly and nothing ever too difficult.

Already making plans to go again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464631692~“Almost made 5 stars.”~Our last stay here at the Emporium was outstanding. This visit however didn't quite cut it. The staff were fantastic and many were the same as when we stayed here two years ago. However the points that cost a star were 1/ the air conditioner that went on and off every 30 or 40 minutes through the night waking us both up many times in 8hours 2/ the power point didn't work I just got a washed out red light on my hair straightener and no power, and 3/ even though there are black out curtains, the room is such that at dawn there is a band of light that reflects in right on your sleeping head, so no sleep in. Nice place but won't be back.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464228451~“Nice boutique hotel but a bit meh...”~Lovely boutique hotel. Super reception area – very glamorous. Fabulous cocktail bar. This is our our first trip to Brisbane and think we might have made a Tripadvisor driven mistake. If you know the area this could be your perfect hotel. Certainly loads of nightclubs nearby - but not for us.  Our room was on the 7th floor and had a balcony which was very welcome and much used – albeit very noisy with either parrots at dawn or the road all day. Really - the road was there all the time. The view was .. er .. of a car dealership (Maserati). The area is where all the luxe car dealerships are and not part of the city.  There is no restaurant in the hotel but the café around the corner was nice for breakfast and there are options in the area.  Great concierge. Very helpful.  For tourists like us I think with hindsight we would have preferred to be down in the CBD as the location is very city cool rather than the fabulous Brisbane views available by the river. Two coffee capsules (not replenished without phone call) is a bit mean for two people. Particularly as they were super weak. No turn down service. Slightly damp smell in room (but we’re super sensitive).  But when it all boils down to it a very nice offering but nothing special – except the lovely concierge.~3~nan~2~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463599352~“Outstanding”~What a wonderful experience. This hotel does every little thing properly. There are pleasant surprised everywhere. The bed is by far the most comfortable my wife and I have ever slept in. We wanted to extend our stay to just sleep longer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463354718~“Simply the best!”~I stayed at the Emporium for a business trip over the weekend of 25-26 Feb. I have stayed here several years ago, and was happy to see that the Emporium has not lost its touch.  The beds in the Emporium are sensational. I think they use sealy posturepedic mattresses, and I had the most amazing sleeps. The room is both stylish and functional, with dishwasher, washing machine, large showers, and a nice selection of drink and food from the mini bar.  I also loved the roof top pool and enjoyed the view at sunset. But what I liked best was the customer service. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful,and makes you feel very welcome and special. I'm already looking forward to staying here again on my next visit to Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_463301474~“A wonderful stay”~A wonderful stay. We keep coming back. Our family of 7 is very well looked after. Nothing is too much trouble. Everything you could need is at the doorstep...plus the top Italian restaurant in town, Tartufo. Breakfast at Buzz for great coffee and sumptuous meals. We rate it the best luxury stay in Brisbane.Thanks to all the E-team.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462828974~“Great value for money”~I stayed here for 2 nights. The King Room was a very large size with a very large bathroom. The room comes with amenities such as a kitchenette and washing machine. The room presents very well and is extremely comfortable and even has large arm chairs (rare in hotel rooms these days). The hotel has a rooftop pool which is quite nice, although there needs to be more chairs or something you can put your clothes and towel on as the deckchairs fill up and there are only a few of them. This area also needs to be serviced more often as a few times there were still plates and glasses left from earlier guests and dirty pool towels on the deck chairs. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, especially Harry on the Concierge Desk who went out of his way on my departure with my bag, charging my phone and offering me a bottle of water while I waited (even offering to find a colder one if I wanted it). The hotel is very good value for money for what I paid. The location is good despite being a walk from Fortitude Valley and transport because it is within the Emporium precinct which has restaurants and cafes including Grilld, Guzman & Gomez and Movenpick. Buzz Cafe is really great for breakfast- slightly on the expensive side but the food is really good and it seems quite popular. I would happily stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462799437~“A very fine experience.”~Really enjoyed our 2 nights 15th and 16th February. The staff were very good and so professional. Nothing was too much trouble. A problem occurred with the washer/dryer when we had a load on -not our fault!!! Graham from the concierge desk arranged for our clothes to be washed and dried and returned to our room. We had an accessible room due to my husband 's mobility issues. The bathroom was wonderfully easy to access. Our only complaint is that there needs to be some shelving for bathroom bags etc near the basin. I had to go out one evening and arranged for a room service meal to be delivered to my husband. I explained that he would be quite slow reaching the door. The staff said not to worry. They would get someone from the concierge desk to accompany them, open the door and set up the meal for him. Which they did.  Overall a great service. Would willingly stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_460283007~“Trendy hotel in great location”~Booked the Emporium in Fortitude Valley as tired of staying in CBD with no atmosphere. Great hotel with very friendly staff. Hotel room is very modern (although dark colours are a bit different) with great bed and choice of pillows. Even has a washing machine and small sink in room. Bathroom is very spacious and whole experience was excellent. Outside so many great cafes and restaurants at your doorstep. All very trendy and good. Harvey Norman a 1 min walk and main mall at Valley only 5 mins walk. Will definitely be back~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459888577~“Very nice”~Excellent service from all staff in all departments.  A little far out of the CBD but just a $10 Uber ride to the centre.  An enjoyable rental bicycle ride from the hotel (public bike hire rack just outside) to the CBD along the river.  Washing machine/drier in room a big bonus.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459865861~“True Romance”~Booked the day before Valentines Day as a last minute Splash out on my lover.  King Spa Suite and some chocolate covered strawberries.  Arrived after work, greeted by the wonderful concierge that during the day organised for a Couples Massage to arrive that night to our room. The décor of this building is priceless. There is no where else quiet as stylish, modern and sophisticated like this in Brisbane.  The comfort of the beds is luscious - I just didn't want to get out. The Room Service attendant we had was just impeccable. He attended to our needs in the afternoon with bringing us Cocktails and Cheese Platters by the Rooftop Pool, he had such a great attitude and full of energy. The concierge did recommend Dinner Reservations next door to the wonderful Italian Restaurant, however we decided to enjoy the room this time and stay in. We call Room Service for the yummy Wagyu Burger. 20 minutes later it arrived. The Massage Therapist provided by Michelle’s at Paddington – These lovely girls were so accommodating to take the night away from their loved ones to pamper us on Valentines Day. Wow! So we felt so incredibly relaxed, I actually fell asleep. The Spa in the room is perfect for two and the little extra Bath Salts provided were a real sweet treat. Valet parking onsite - plenty of restaurants to choose from in the area. (the authentic Italian next door is to die for) I love hanging out at the Emporium Precinct, so it was just divine to stay the night here too.  We didn't go to the Lobby Bar this occasion, however, the staff, the drinks and the entertainers here are always over and above anything else in Brisbane.  I just love it here!! Do I really have to leave?~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458171437~“Unexpected excellence”~Rather late around 9 pm i booked a room at the emporium. After my usual trip advisor search the reasonable price and location was perfect, a bed, kitchenette, bathroom, TV is all I needed. I actually avoid staying at hotels because it's usually for 2-3 nights and I like a comfortable space that has everything I need like home, I can make coffee whenever or heat something. Maybe wash something I wanted to wear. Hang my nice clothes up and have space to keep all your travelling requirements organised especially being a woman!  But the Emporium absolutely changed this with the details that has gone into the running of the business as well as the amazing design and functionality of the room. A dramatic entrance at the emporium and I was greeted with ease. It seemed the quickest check in ever and I was upgraded to the king suite yay! I was just eager to shower and go to bed. I Open the door to lovely cold air, a massive welcoming bed that even has a cute list of the different pillows, a kitchenette that had everything I could think need as well as a great selection in drinks and nibbles even including gluten free biscuits, something I appreciate. Everything in the room had lists or instructions which I love and even the hotel TV system was easy to use. It was a large long space with plenty of room for relaxing and working and realised later there is even a small balcony overlooking the dining options that surround the hotel. But the bathroom... wow. Splashed in marble with wall to wall mirrors, a double shower and vanity, heated floor, a makeup mirror light, quality toiletries and I even noticed a washer and dryer tucked away discretely. I was actually disappointed I couldn't spend more time in this idyllic space as there was so much I didn't see. Staying at the emporium absolutely changed my perception of hotels and hope to see some 2+ night specials to make my Brisbane visits a five star experience every time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456848488~“Absolutely Fabulous”~I feel like Edwina and Pats here this place is quirky in a very very classy way all red and glass amazing. The rooms are incredible we stayed in a king suite incredible price we got it for $206 for a room that offers a Pillow Menu amazing bed and the best in room mini bar I have ever seen. The cocktail lounge with music and a staff member for every guest I cant wait to stay again and it will be for more than one night. so close to so many restaurants and bars cant wait to come back.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_455536223~“Excellent hotel for couples weekend”~We spent 2 nights at the Emporium for a couples weekend away from the kids, with a pretty last minute good deal. The hotel is one of the best that I've stayed at (and I've stayed at quite a few 5 star hotels on business).  We had a king suite, which had quite a large room, with king bed, table/chairs, kitchenette, TV, Bose sound system, and a well designed bath room. The bath room had a walk in shower (much preferred over the bath/shower combinations common in hotels), his and hers sinks, and a very useful night-light just above the floor. The Molten Brown toiletries are also very good.  The rooftop terrace has half-decent views, a small gym, pool with waterfall feature, and sauna (which if off takes 20-30mins to warm up). It is designed so that the loungers are always in the shade, which is good when the UV index is 17.  There are loads of restaurants nearby as part of the same complex, 10 mins walk to James Street restaurants, and 15 minutes walk to Fortitude Valley (and train station). An IGA convenience store is also only a few minutes walk away.  Staff were friendly and courteous (and thankfully not snobby). We ordered some different pillows from the pillow bar, and these were delivered quickly.  Room was in good condition and very clean.  The only downside was lack of bowls in the kitchenette.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_454109596~“A hotel you don't want to leave”~From the moment you check in you realise this hotel is going to be an amazing experience. I made this booking direct with the hotel for 2 nights and the rates for a Saturday and Sunday night were much better than the rack rate. Check in was fast and simple and first impressions of the staff from this point was they know what they are doing. The staff member checking me in answered all my questions. This is an exquisite and funky hotel and extremely enjoyable.  I was located in room 506 on the northern side which is well appointed and spacious. The room was spotlessly clean with no signs of wear or tear. There is a small kitchen area which can be closed off with a sink and dishwasher which I never used as the precinct has a number of great eateries and facilities. There is a pillow menu and if you can't find one that suits from the election you are fussy. The bed is amazingly comfortable, I fell asleep and woke up in the same position. The black out curtains are very effective with no gaps and sneeky light getting into the room. A very important factor when sleeping in after a 40th birthday the night before. The facilities in the precinct where good with plenty of choices to meet friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The rooftop terrace while small was very comfortable and I spent 4 hrs lounging around reading a book and swimming. I ordered lunch from the pool phone and the Wagyu Burger and chips filled the spot. An extremely relaxing afternoon. There is a sauna and gym adjacent to the pool and terrace. It is a small gym but enough to keep the heart rate up. This is one of the most enjoyable bars I have been to, service was prompt and courteous although on this evening it felt a little warm and the AC needed to be turned down a little more. I ordered a Hendricks G&T and it was made to the recipe including the cucumber, doesn't happen that often in Australia. This is a hotel I didn't want to leave, it felt like you were away from home with all the comforts of home, very pleasant ambience to capture.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_454013365~“Fantastic Overnight Stay at Emporium”~Had a great one-night stay at Emporium.  Valet parking was quick, easy and reasonable, friendly check-in from both reception staff and the porter. Our room was great, lots of amenities - free wifi, powerful shower and a comfortable bed. The room was stylishly presented - it would have been nice to spend more than just one night! We arrived reasonably late on a Sunday but there was still plenty of food options around. We didn't get a chance to explore the local area properly but it looked like it was in a fairly cool part of Brisbane. Fantastic view of Brisbane from the rooftop too. Would have been nice to have enjoyed the rooftop pool. No complaints at all!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_453697877~“Glitzy fit out ”~I work opposite and have always considered the emporium hotel a favourite for a quite coffee or beverage. They have a very well appointed bar with modern fit out, friendly staff and good alcohol. It's secluded and well run with easy accessible bathroom facilities which have always presented as being super clean and fresh smelling. I also use their boardroom facilities on level 1 which is a great option when wanting some locked down concentration time. They have decent AV and always provide fresh tea and coffee options. We also used their ballroom recently for a work conference whi h was no fuss and we'll managed~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452908299~“Lovely boutique hotel”~We had a great 4 night stay at this boutique hotel in Fortitude Valley. Comfortable, spacious rooms with small kitchen area, dishwasher and washing machine. Lap pool on the rooftop which was great for cooling off. Gym very small which was the only disappointment. Staff, especially at the concierge desk (special mention to Graham), were extremely helpful. Wifi mostly reliable but you did have to sign back in every day. Area is very lively, with a great Italian restaurant attached to the hotel. Many other restaurants close by. I can highly recommend this property whether for a personal or business stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452478929~“Very comfy hotel”~A little out of the city hub but not far. This hotel ticks all the boxes, good sized rooms, mini kitchen and laundry, mini bar,aircond and a good bed. We arrived a few hours early but were shown to our room which had already been prepared. No restaurant in the hotel but a great bar. Room service however was available as were a selection of restaurants and cafes within 100 metres from the front door.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_451994344~“Cannot fault anything”~Stayed for one night prior to a cruise. Sometimes in hotels of this calibre the staff can be a bit stuffy but the staff here, all of them, were amazing. They were so friendly, helpful and happy. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was amazing, even had a microwave and dishwasher and you're encouraged to take the bathroom toiletries (Molten Brown) and slippers. Turn down of the bed was completed and we were left with a chocolate heart and bottle of water. Room was silent and beautifully cool and I couldn't fault a thing, which is unusual for me. The hotel is in a small precinct with lots of restaurants, cafes, shops etc. Lots of choice. Would definitely come back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451521649~“Modern, clean, great location, perfect room and helpful staff”~I booked this hotel after reading the positive reviews on line and it did not disappoint. I arrived around 11am from a European flight so I requested an early check in which they kindly granted to me. Much appreciate after 30 hours of travel. The room was super, not big but enough room. Bedding is fantastic!! There was a refrigerator, washer and dryer, coffee and tea machine, microwave which was nicely included as I knew I would wake up early jet lagged so the early morning tea was needed. The concierge, Paul, was very helpful in suggesting and booking a day tour for me (front desk printed out the ticket, gladly). The location initially looked kind of random but good after exploring around, there are plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars just around the corner. The roof terrace is not big but suitable. Plenty of shade which is good because it was so hot and the bar downstairs was nice. Good drinks, friendly staff and a large screen for entertainment. I would suggest this hotel for your Brisbane stay,~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450513627~“Beautiful room”~The hotel is very swish and our room super luxurious. It was huge with a giant bed and lovely spa bath. The location is great too if you want to explore Fortitude Valley- shopping, restaurants, breweries and river walks. Also the French patisserie underneath the hotel made the hotel worth it on its own!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449725273~“Good Location”~The hotel is well located near the night life and trendy James Street precinct. The rooms are quite small but the staff were friendly and helpful.

review_448737735~“Excellent Experience at Emporium”~Emporium Hotel embodies what a luxury boutique hotel is all about. Their suites are huge and tastefully appointed. It seemed to me that the management took careful thought of what a traveler looks for by way of accommodation, and then provided all of these.  My suite had a kitchenette complete with microwave oven and espresso coffee maker. The bathroom amenities, towels, bathrobes and slippers were top class. My queen-sized bed was oh so comfortable. They have a pillow menu where you can select the type of pillow you want to use. I chose the goose-down pillow, and it was fabulous.  While the facilities are great, it is the staff service that makes this hotel exceptional. Everyone - from the GM who welcomed our group during our poolside cocktails - to the housekeepers, waiters, concierge, bellmen, and front office staff whom I had the opportunity to encounter - were pleasant, professional, helpful, and happy to assist. I want to give special mention to Nick from the Front Office, who was especially efficient, helpful, friendly and always smiling.  All in all, I would give Emporium 2 thumbs up. A wonderful place to stay in when you're in Brisbane.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_448468026~“For something a little special......”~Having stayed in some great boutique hotels before we were hoping to find another favourite right in Brisbane. Emporium was a great find. Excelllant location, nearby cafes and restaurants and the snazzy James St Precinct. The details matter at Emporium : bath robes, nice toiletries, espresso machine, bed turn down and chocolate, make-up mirror, Bose sound system, pleasant furnishings, good linen and large marble bathroom with twin vanity. Friendly and genuine staff. Excellent bar and decor. Only downer was that we didn't realise there was a phone ordering system at the pool for drinks. We could have made use of that! Overall a fantastic New Year Eve was had. We hope to return. It was good value for inner city and something a bit special.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_448198688~“Great rooms, wonderful customer service ”~We booked a room relatively last minute for New Year's Eve so we didn't have to fight the Uber crowds to get home and I'm glad we picked Emporium. It was handy to the venue we were at (Eleven) but also easy to get in and out of and parking was included in the room rate. The room was huge (king suite) and well appointed with enough kitchen appliances to suit a stay of a few days or more (including microwave, dishwasher drawer and washing machine). The bathroom was large and well laid out. They have room service but the cafe next door does a great (simple options) breakfast if that's what you're after and of course the Emporium complex has plenty of restaurants and cafes to choose from. The hotel staff were all very friendly and couldn't do enough for you, from the check in process to room turn down to the valet parking. We didn't go to the pool but there is one on the rooftop. Overall I was very impressed with this hotel and if we need to stay in the city again in future I'd certainly include this hotel at the top of my list of options.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447422494~“Good hotel, excellent attentive service!”~We spent a four night break at this hotel and found it extremely comfortable. The quality of the bed and the room in general was of a high standard. The staff could not be more helpful and attentive both room service and front desk. The hotel itself is surrounded by restaurants and several other helpful shops needed to make a good experience all round. Our only one small complaint was the AC in our room (302) was a little noisy but we do know that this is not the case in some of the other rooms occupied by other family members. Worth a visit if in Brisbane.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_447021855~“Great for long stays”~I have only been at the Emporium hotel once on a business trip. The room was well equipped with a microwave, dishwasher machine, washing machine, nice shower and a very cozy room. I was quite lucky to find notes from staff every night wishing me well, which made a long business trip friendlier! But I am aware others may find this creepy. All personnel are very friendly and attentive to provide you with assistance. Location is perfect and only two blocks away from James Street, where you can find nice restaurants or 5-10 min walk to WoolWorths in Gasworks, one of Australias classic supermarkets. Quite comfortable and great service for a long stay.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_443226482~“Christmas party”~Was a good venue in the cocktail bar however the appetisers were late and we're not that appetising. The prawns on rice was gluggy, a little raw and bland. The vegetarian options were minimal and again cold. For a place this expensive.i would have expected more.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_440726937~“5 Star Brisbane Stay”~I love staying here at the Emporium. I got a great deal through Qantas Hotels. The room is very large - great king size bed with choice of pillows, very quiet as it is boutique hotel. The bathroom is awesome - huge! Clean and spacious. The best part is the roof top pool and cocktails that they bring up to you while you laze in the afternoon sun.Great location, friendly team. Beautiful breakfast downstairs at the cafe and dinner at the Italian restaurant.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440001054~“Nice break from the big hotel chains”~The Emporium is a lovely luxurious hotel in the city. There's no doubt about it this hotel is beautiful from the moment you step into the lobby until you lay down on the ridiculously comfy bed. We stayed in a King Suite which is huge with all the amenities you could want. The little touches of a robe and slippers combined with a kitchenette and washing machine is what truly stood out for me. Luxury and practicality rolled into one. And the staff are only too happy to help - service with a smile :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439398419~“Need Luxury ?”~Need a holiday but can't really get away ? The Emporium gives us that luxury at our fingertips in Brisbane . Close to city shopping , fabulous restaurants and bars and accommodation you'd like to live in !~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439156821~“Pleasant experience”~This hotel is lovely. It has a boutique nature while simultaneously being clean and efficient. They have an elegant little bar downstairs, where you can also order off a limited (but perfectly sufficient) menu. Housekeeping is prompt and effective. They also provide tiny kitchen appliances in the room; thus, making it comfortable. Although the gym is tiny, the rooftop pool is lovely. Service is friendly and employees are particularly attentive. Finally, the hotel is located in Fortitude Valley, so very close to Teneriffe and fairly convenient to the center city.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_436707671~“Gorgeous Boutique Hotel”~Stunning luxury boutique style hotel on our stay in Brisbane!  Lovely red themed decor with gorgeous rooms and stunning pool and sauna amenities. Greeted by a charming luxurious lobby. The outdoor pool was absolutely stunning. The hotel was quiet during our stay which was fine with us. The hotel staff was amazing. Very accommodating and service was very fast if we needed anything up to our room. Our bell boy also showed us all the info in our room where we could find local fare, things to do or shop nearby.  Area was very quiet around our hotel which is great for travellers seeking quiet hotel stays.  All in all this hotel was a great luxury boutique hotel for the Brisbane area.  Suites were very modern and state of the art. Very nice amenities and stunning bathrooms featuring great local products. Outdoor rooftop stye pool was incredible with a great relaxing atmosphere.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_435150992~“Not up to standard”~Have stayed here several times before and everything was 100%. This time there was mould in the shower in several places, pillows in bed were musty and smelly and the rooms aircon was not working properly.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434735416~“Quick 1 night stop over”~A beautiful hotel that truly offers a luxurious feel. Unfortunately we only had a quick overnight stay, we arrived at 9pm and checked out 4am, so not enough time to fully experience this property. We stayed in a King Suite which had plenty of room and was nice and quiet. I loved the marble bathrooms - just beautiful.  The only recommendation I have is that the staff greeting at reception needs some polish - for a 5 star hotel, what we received was just not up to standard. I felt like I was being greeted by someone at a supermarket checkout! Just not good enough.  I will definitely come back for a longer experience.

review_434202829~“Attention to detail - beautifully designed boutique hotel”~Beautifully designed and well appointed rooms presented in a modern luxurious style that gives this hotel a very nice 'boutique' feel. There's real attention to detail and great consistency in the experience. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel's in a great location for accessing places to eat and shops etc.  I really enjoyed my stay. If ever I returned I'd have no hesitations in rebooking. Beds and pillows were excellent. The bathroom was spacious, the shower was huge and had great water pressure. The towels were soft and high quality. The bar area was lively and the patisserie was terrific. Great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_433120231~“Michael”~I booked a room through Lastminute.com.au for a business trip. Unfortunately, I'm now unable to attend. Its quite reasonable that I wouldn't get a refund but when I call the emporium they told me I had to go through 'last minute'  So I called and they said I needed to contact the hotel because it was out of their hands. After calling the hotel, they told me that it was now too late to change my booking date because it was after 4pm... They could have told me that when I called at 10am this morning!! After speaking with a guy from their reservations, he told me that there was nothing else they could possibly do  Like nothing ... Since the prices have dropped for tonight I'm sure they have plenty of spare rooms and they could have changed the date.. I tried giving away the room to friends but nobody wants to stay there. I guess it's just an average hotel but can promise that not myself or any of our staff will ever reserve a room here again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433097484~“A great find”~We spent one night at the Emporium recently and wished we had had longer. The staff could not have been more helpful.

A great spot if you don't want to stay right in the middle of the city.~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_431644550~“Beautiful Boutique Hotel”~Having stayed for one night after seeing a show.

review_429891816~“KID FREE NIGHT”~One of our favourite hotels in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley the Emporium offers a pleasant, classy and relaxed environment in which you can unwind and enjoy an evening without the kids. The hotel is bright, new, and somewhat funky making it all the more memorable. Staff are professional, friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure your stay is as good as it can be. Situated in the heart of Brisbane's Fortitude Valley the Emporium is surrounded by restaurants, night clubs and bars with plenty of options to choose from. The rooms are first class and it doesn't really matter which one you get they're all good. So if your'e looking for somewhere to stay where you can kick up your heals and then retire to a Beautiful room when your'e done the Emporium is for you.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_452833257~“Emporium Elite”~Well you do feel special, when you arrive out front of this hotel. We drove up and where greeted by a lovely concierge and valet and then shown into the stunning foyer. The staff on the front desk so warm and welcoming, prompt check-in. Once in the room did not disappoint. Plush furnishings, comfy bed and pillow. Quiet nights sleep and block out curtains. Lovely bathroom. Quiet aircon in our room.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477319060~“Lovely but Dated & Overpriced”~Having gone to Uni in Brisbane in another time - the Emporium has always been on my must stay hotel list. Overnight on way back to Hong Kong provided this opportunity. It's stylish and the concierge fellow was lovely. The lobby and room appear very stylish but in closer inspection the rooms show they are rather dated. They were ok. It certainly not consistent with the high end of town rates they demand. Surrounding area is nice and plenty of restaurant offerings. Loved James Street and Spoon.  Check out was a shock with car parking at a big 45 dollars - whaaaa? Recommend? Honestly - not really. It's fine but overpriced with plenty of better competitive and more current hotels nearby.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477316810~“Comfortable stay.”~Family of three, 2 x adults and our son aged 11 in a king room (rollaway + $35) staying one night.  Overall a comfortable stay in a well designed and fitted/furnished room with a decent sized bathroom. Large shower with good water pressure and abundant hot water and room size was adequate. Electrics, air con and TV all very good. Perhaps if you're going to offer a coffee machine, leave more than two pods in the room and some washing detergent for the sink would also help (we did note there was dishwasher powder but weren't going to use it for a few cups and a plate). The only staff we had dealing with were reception and valet parking. Check in was prompt and courteous but not overly personable or friendly - check out equally prompt and much more friendly. Valet parking staff x 2 were very friendly and helpful... but would prefer you didn't use the horn on our car to blast the taxi parked in the drop off/pick up area because it's very loud when the three of us are standing just near the front of the bonnet! We agree the cost of valet parking here is too expensive, something they need to look at. We used it knowing full well the price, but for many it's price prohibitive and that (with the minor issues noted) would probably have us staying elsewhere next time and it falls short of a 'five star' review. A comfortable stay in a very good room and while the price wasn't an issue for us, for mind it's probably priced a little high.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476932212~“A little dated but excellent service”~A very easy stroll to Fortitude valley shops and down to the riverwalk for a morning walk. Small gym unfortunately but great sauna and pool - really enjoyed a workout., sauna, dip in the pool then a snack by the pool getting emails done. Its showing signs of wear which is completely to be expected and not in excess of what you would expect a 10 year old venue to show. The team of staff though were fantastic! So handy having a variety of eateries downstairs too. Bed super comfy and big bathroom. Minimal noise from outside. Will definitely be back next trip. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476277691~“Shame ”~We booked into the hotel for a 4 day break in a suite. Firstly upon arriving we basically were met by a receptionist who was effectively dismissive of us checking in. Looking down on us stated 'since you have booked a corner suit I will hold $800 on your card just in case!'. Unsure what2 females over the age of 40 would do! I have stayed in 5star hotels and never had to put down a deposit or be treated in such a way - the car we hired only needed a $250 deposit. The hotel is very much like the Art series in Melbourne and is very stylish. Pillows and bed very soft. No turn down service others mentioned and whilst the cocktail bar is awesome it lacks any sort of atmosphere - bright lights and bored staff don't help. Location is good and lots of choices outside. Valet parking the next day was great and agree with other comments about the team here - very genuine. Such a shame and wonder if the number one rating has made everyone forget the customer comes first and does have a choice. Would not go back simply due to staff attitudes.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475970374~“Beautiful But...”~I loved this hotel. Beautiful foyer, lovely room, amazing spa bath in room.  The pool let me down though. We booked here to enjoy a swim and it was way too cold.

Very helpful in all things and the concierge was great helping us make dinner reservations and with his suggestions for restaurants. Great Bar with a good selection of bar snacks.

review_475406742~“Service is second to none - Nice hotel”~This is a nice hotel....I stayed in the king spa suite...I wouldn't exactly call it a suite, per se. but it is a very nice room. I was disappointed not to have a balcony like I saw in the pics. I was hoping for chairs and a table to sit on and take in some fresh air. All I got was a half metre wide ledge/balcony that you could stand on.... Bed was reasonably comfortable Room was clean Molten Brown shower products were awesome Spa was nice (pic attached). The best (by far) part about the Emporium is the level of customer service. It was second to none. I have stayed at nearly every 4-5 star in Brisbane, and this is the best customer service I have received, to date. The pool deck is nice....privacy curtains are a great idea.... I wasn't impressed with the Wi-Fi I also didn't like how I could hear all the noise in the corridors from my room. Every single door that opened and closed, and every single conversation that went past. Some hotels seem to a better job of making these rooms quieter. This is a quality hotel that I'd rate at 4.5 stars.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_475404035~“Good but expansive”~The king sized bed was very comfy, but no more so than the Novotel, where we usually stay; not worth the extra $100. Also: car parking. There is valet parking at the hotel for $45. Before we arrived, I asked if there was any other option nearby. The hotel said, and I quote "Unfortunately there isn’t too many options for parking thus we recommend valet parking. The only other option is on-street parking around the hotel, however it is metered in some areas". This is not true at weekends: we parked directly outside, on Wickham Street, which had FREE unresticted parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475198888~“3 1/2 really”~Nice rooms & good location. Not my taste in furnishings or decor but that's a personal thing really. My main gripe was the feeling I got that they were intent on charging me for literally everything I looked at. From the TV menu to the minibar it's all absolute extortion! I ended up bringing back a bottle of wine from dinner & moved a few things around in the minibar fridge to make it fit. The next day I was immediately charged for the items I moved, even though they were still in the fridge! I got a refund after complaining but it left a bad taste in my mouth & I left with the feeling I was just a walking wallet to them. I won't be back~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475166358~“Blown away”~We recently stayed at the emporium and were blown away. The hotel itself was superb with each room although looking like just a great room revealed much more. Hidden behind cupboards we were amazed to find a small kitchenette area and even laundry facilities .mthis is fantastic for business and pleasure as it gives you options. Even more spectacular than the room itself was the service we received we were astounded . Friendly efficient , unassuming, we would definitely stay again and have made anoint in recommending to friends. They made our weekend break an absolute pleasure.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_473493120~“Awesome hotel with awesome service”~I stayed at the Emporium last Saturday 1st April as a last minute booking, i have previously stayed there and was impressed then and i am still impressed, the location is great and the rooms exceptional, the beds and pillows are that good on the Sunday i checked out i purchased a pillow and then went to 40 winks and purchased a new bed and mattress the same as the Emporium, the cocktail bar is exceptional as well and the surrounding restaurants offer a great variety of different foods...~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473486549~“Everything its meant to be.”~We dont often go all out and stay at these kind of places, but for our anniversary we decided to give it a go especially as we did not need to drive anywhere for dinner as there are over 10 different dining options within the emporium complex. The roof top pool area is fantastic and the whole place is very well maintained, along with the rooms which are divine.  We got breaky included which was delivered to our door (on xmas day mind you) hot and really well cooked..  The emporium complex is a bit away from the normal hotel areas and not within walking distance to the city, but it made a exquisite change to the normally CBD get away that we do a few times a year.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_473094075~“Disappointed given the hype”~I thought it was nice but not exceptional. The staff seemed aloof and I thought the pool and gym facilities were disappointing. I expected more given the cost. The location is not ideal for many of the city's attractions. The bar is definitely worth a visit, serving some interesting cocktails.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472836457~“Quality hotel in excellent location”~Fantastic hotel in central location - full amenities and staff are outstanding for service..couldnt fault any part of my two night stay and guests are treated well. The ultra modern surrounds and exclusively appointed bars and foyer will remind you are in a quality hotel. I totally recommend staying here, I'll certainly be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472027385~“Love, love, love. ”~Things we loved about emporium - everything! Including, but not limited to - the location, the super helpful and lovely staff, the lush room, the surrounding dining choices, the comfy bed, pillow, and sitting area, and the ability to control temperature.  It's not often that we stay places and have not a single little thing we'd change, but this was one of those times.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471444335~“Excellent service and very cool”~We have stayed here a few times for business and pleasure. The rooms and the hotel generally is very cool, well appointed and the service is outstanding. Nothing is too difficult.  I had some problems with wifi when we get here and they sorted it immediately.  If there is one opportunity it would be breakfast options. They only serve breakfast in your room - the alternative is the choice of two Cafes just next to the hotel which You can charge to your room - one cafe has very limited choices and Buzz (the other one) has good food but it's not the quality of the hotel... Great location with James street a five minute walk.  Very cool and good alternative to the city!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471043192~“Wedding”~Nice modern hotel in a great location. The staff were polite and very helpful. Was worried about lift noise in room 502 but it wasn't a problem just the air con clicking noisily on and off all night. Plenty of cafes and restaurants around in the immediate area. Would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470036057~“Amazing!!! Stay here ”~The Emporium revitalizes that feeling that you are taken care of the second you step foot into the hotel. From the devour to the attentive staff, I can almost guarantee you will have a fabulous time at this hotel. Michael out!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469983702~“Above and beyond”~We stayed only 2 nights in Brisbane as it was the end of our trip. We will definitely return to the Emporium and stay longer. My wife has special needs and the hotel catered to them perfectly. The managers were very understanding to her needs and all the staff went out of their way to assist. We are both grateful to all the staff for making our stay enjoyable. The rooms were very clean comfy and luxurious. Ask for anything and they will try and make it happen.6 star.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469472649~“Luxe getaway”~We truly enjoyed our king suite, the room had a sense of luxury and seclusion from the world. Staff were attentive in perfect measure. Little things like the coffee machine and particularly nice bathroom treats were appreciated too. It is ideal for couples and business. The bar / tapas downstairs is easily charged to your room.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_468224407~“Outstanding service”~This was our first stay as we usually stay in the CBD and we weren't disappointed. The first thing we noticed is how lovely the staff are. Even offering to book dinner at the Italian restaurant next door for us. Then we got a free upgrade as we were staying for my birthday. The king room was beautiful and has a very comfy bed. We were on the first floor and did not hear any road noise at all. The highlight of our night was the cocktail bar which is located within the hotel. It was the perfect spot for after dinner drinks! Thanks again for an amazing stay! We will be back!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467133484~“Do it!”~Normally I pay $160 but jumping to the $200 level for 5 nights was well worth it. Concierge came out today and walked across the car park to help us with our shopping, who does that? Any time of the day these guys are so helpful, I know it costs to park but dropping your car at the door truly is easy...check in is efficient and friendly and NOT pretentious for this level of hotel. The emporium area has great variety of quality restaurants, good bar and even a 7/11 for that late night ice cream or toothbrush I forgot. Cleaning staff polite, actually seem happy and their work perfect. Kitchenette great option....capsule coffee machine rocks..in summary awesome place....~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467094139~“We can't be more grateful to Nick”~We can't be more grateful for Nick's kindness when my son had a seizure at Bell Epoque Cafe which is a part of the hotel yesterday. Nick came to assist us when I asked one of their staff members to call ambulance. He did everything he could to help us. He organized valley parking while we had to leave my car to go to a hospital.  We were not actually stayed at the hotel, however, we had an opportunity to have a tour of the hotel when we attended a seminar. Their rooms and facilities were fabulous! All staff members were friendly and I highly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_466450046~“Recommended”~Our room had a kitchenette and washing machine/dryer. Room service food very good. Service friendly and nothing ever too difficult. Pool area very nice with shaded area too. Housekeeping very good. Small criticism/suggestion... a couple of the doors seem to open the wrong way ie should open toward you rather than away, bathroom door in particular.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466417425~“Great Night Away with Friends”~Stayed at the Emporium for a weekend away. Rooms are fresh and modern. Staff very attentive. Service was awesome. After we went for dinner spent some hours in the amazing cocktail bar down stairs. Was lovely after many cocktails to be able to catch the lift to our room. Already making plans to go again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465235014~“A weekend at the races”~Met some friends for the weekend at this hotel for a day at the races and a weekend in Brisbane. Centrally located in Ann st FV it has several very good restaurants surrounding the hotel after you have had great cocktails in the ground floor bar. Hotel staff , great...bed fantastic, will stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465112479~“Very Modern”~Visited for a conference. We drove past before we found it. Free off street parking which is a plus. Very modern decor, friendly staff, reasonable food. We had to ask directions twice on how to find the presentation room, so maybe better signage would help.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_464228451~“Nice boutique hotel but a bit meh...”~Lovely boutique hotel. Super reception area – very glamorous. Fabulous cocktail bar. This is our our first trip to Brisbane and think we might have made a Tripadvisor driven mistake. If you know the area this could be your perfect hotel. Certainly loads of nightclubs nearby - but not for us.  Our room was on the 7th floor and had a balcony which was very welcome and much used – albeit very noisy with either parrots at dawn or the road all day. Really - the road was there all the time. The view was .. er .. of a car dealership (Maserati). The area is where all the luxe car dealerships are and not part of the city.  There is no restaurant in the hotel but the café around the corner was nice for breakfast and there are options in the area.  Great concierge. Very helpful.  For tourists like us I think with hindsight we would have preferred to be down in the CBD as the location is very city cool rather than the fabulous Brisbane views available by the river. Two coffee capsules (not replenished without phone call) is a bit mean for two people. Particularly as they were super weak. No turn down service. Slightly damp smell in room (but we’re super sensitive).  But when it all boils down to it a very nice offering but nothing special – except the lovely concierge.~3~nan~2~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463599352~“Outstanding”~What a wonderful experience. This hotel does every little thing properly. There are pleasant surprised everywhere. The bed is by far the most comfortable my wife and I have ever slept in. We wanted to extend our stay to just sleep longer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463354718~“Simply the best!”~I stayed at the Emporium for a business trip over the weekend of 25-26 Feb. I have stayed here several years ago, and was happy to see that the Emporium has not lost its touch.  The beds in the Emporium are sensational. I think they use sealy posturepedic mattresses, and I had the most amazing sleeps. The room is both stylish and functional, with dishwasher, washing machine, large showers, and a nice selection of drink and food from the mini bar.  I also loved the roof top pool and enjoyed the view at sunset. But what I liked best was the customer service. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful,and makes you feel very welcome and special. I'm already looking forward to staying here again on my next visit to Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_463323395~“Great value, great service - always a plesure”~Really enjoyed my last stay here, from the moment I arrived to when I left. For the few dollars extra its really a great experience with great staff with personality. Loved that when I collected my car they had put two waters in car..good service!!!! Thanks :-)~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459888577~“Very nice”~Excellent service from all staff in all departments.  A little far out of the CBD but just a $10 Uber ride to the centre.  An enjoyable rental bicycle ride from the hotel (public bike hire rack just outside) to the CBD along the river.  Washing machine/drier in room a big bonus.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459865861~“True Romance”~Booked the day before Valentines Day as a last minute Splash out on my lover.  King Spa Suite and some chocolate covered strawberries.  Arrived after work, greeted by the wonderful concierge that during the day organised for a Couples Massage to arrive that night to our room. The décor of this building is priceless. There is no where else quiet as stylish, modern and sophisticated like this in Brisbane.  The comfort of the beds is luscious - I just didn't want to get out. The Room Service attendant we had was just impeccable. He attended to our needs in the afternoon with bringing us Cocktails and Cheese Platters by the Rooftop Pool, he had such a great attitude and full of energy. The concierge did recommend Dinner Reservations next door to the wonderful Italian Restaurant, however we decided to enjoy the room this time and stay in. We call Room Service for the yummy Wagyu Burger. 20 minutes later it arrived. The Massage Therapist provided by Michelle’s at Paddington – These lovely girls were so accommodating to take the night away from their loved ones to pamper us on Valentines Day. Wow! So we felt so incredibly relaxed, I actually fell asleep. The Spa in the room is perfect for two and the little extra Bath Salts provided were a real sweet treat. Valet parking onsite - plenty of restaurants to choose from in the area. (the authentic Italian next door is to die for) I love hanging out at the Emporium Precinct, so it was just divine to stay the night here too.  We didn't go to the Lobby Bar this occasion, however, the staff, the drinks and the entertainers here are always over and above anything else in Brisbane.  I just love it here!! Do I really have to leave?~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458171437~“Unexpected excellence”~Rather late around 9 pm i booked a room at the emporium. After my usual trip advisor search the reasonable price and location was perfect, a bed, kitchenette, bathroom, TV is all I needed. I actually avoid staying at hotels because it's usually for 2-3 nights and I like a comfortable space that has everything I need like home, I can make coffee whenever or heat something. Maybe wash something I wanted to wear. Hang my nice clothes up and have space to keep all your travelling requirements organised especially being a woman!  But the Emporium absolutely changed this with the details that has gone into the running of the business as well as the amazing design and functionality of the room. A dramatic entrance at the emporium and I was greeted with ease. It seemed the quickest check in ever and I was upgraded to the king suite yay! I was just eager to shower and go to bed. I Open the door to lovely cold air, a massive welcoming bed that even has a cute list of the different pillows, a kitchenette that had everything I could think need as well as a great selection in drinks and nibbles even including gluten free biscuits, something I appreciate. Everything in the room had lists or instructions which I love and even the hotel TV system was easy to use. It was a large long space with plenty of room for relaxing and working and realised later there is even a small balcony overlooking the dining options that surround the hotel. But the bathroom... wow. Splashed in marble with wall to wall mirrors, a double shower and vanity, heated floor, a makeup mirror light, quality toiletries and I even noticed a washer and dryer tucked away discretely. I was actually disappointed I couldn't spend more time in this idyllic space as there was so much I didn't see. Staying at the emporium absolutely changed my perception of hotels and hope to see some 2+ night specials to make my Brisbane visits a five star experience every time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456848488~“Absolutely Fabulous”~I feel like Edwina and Pats here this place is quirky in a very very classy way all red and glass amazing. The rooms are incredible we stayed in a king suite incredible price we got it for $206 for a room that offers a Pillow Menu amazing bed and the best in room mini bar I have ever seen. The cocktail lounge with music and a staff member for every guest I cant wait to stay again and it will be for more than one night. so close to so many restaurants and bars cant wait to come back.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_456560702~“Continualy Good”~Good to see new TV and good choose of movies. ( although a bite expensive)  Rooms are still in excellent condition and cleaned properly. Pool and sauna are kept in good nick.  The Valley is a go a go ahead location.~5~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455536223~“Excellent hotel for couples weekend”~We spent 2 nights at the Emporium for a couples weekend away from the kids, with a pretty last minute good deal. The hotel is one of the best that I've stayed at (and I've stayed at quite a few 5 star hotels on business).  We had a king suite, which had quite a large room, with king bed, table/chairs, kitchenette, TV, Bose sound system, and a well designed bath room. The bath room had a walk in shower (much preferred over the bath/shower combinations common in hotels), his and hers sinks, and a very useful night-light just above the floor. The Molten Brown toiletries are also very good.  The rooftop terrace has half-decent views, a small gym, pool with waterfall feature, and sauna (which if off takes 20-30mins to warm up). It is designed so that the loungers are always in the shade, which is good when the UV index is 17.  There are loads of restaurants nearby as part of the same complex, 10 mins walk to James Street restaurants, and 15 minutes walk to Fortitude Valley (and train station). An IGA convenience store is also only a few minutes walk away.  Staff were friendly and courteous (and thankfully not snobby). We ordered some different pillows from the pillow bar, and these were delivered quickly.  Room was in good condition and very clean.  The only downside was lack of bowls in the kitchenette.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455502344~“Great Stay!”~My partner and I stayed for one night for our anniversary. The Emporium Hotel was amazing. The staff were really friendly and the room was lovely and comfortable. Convenient location to where we had planned to go for dinner (Gerard's Bistro - which was also amazing). We will be back and would definitely recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454109596~“A hotel you don't want to leave”~From the moment you check in you realise this hotel is going to be an amazing experience. I made this booking direct with the hotel for 2 nights and the rates for a Saturday and Sunday night were much better than the rack rate. Check in was fast and simple and first impressions of the staff from this point was they know what they are doing. The staff member checking me in answered all my questions. This is an exquisite and funky hotel and extremely enjoyable.  I was located in room 506 on the northern side which is well appointed and spacious. The room was spotlessly clean with no signs of wear or tear. There is a small kitchen area which can be closed off with a sink and dishwasher which I never used as the precinct has a number of great eateries and facilities. There is a pillow menu and if you can't find one that suits from the election you are fussy. The bed is amazingly comfortable, I fell asleep and woke up in the same position. The black out curtains are very effective with no gaps and sneeky light getting into the room. A very important factor when sleeping in after a 40th birthday the night before. The facilities in the precinct where good with plenty of choices to meet friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The rooftop terrace while small was very comfortable and I spent 4 hrs lounging around reading a book and swimming. I ordered lunch from the pool phone and the Wagyu Burger and chips filled the spot. An extremely relaxing afternoon. There is a sauna and gym adjacent to the pool and terrace. It is a small gym but enough to keep the heart rate up. This is one of the most enjoyable bars I have been to, service was prompt and courteous although on this evening it felt a little warm and the AC needed to be turned down a little more. I ordered a Hendricks G&T and it was made to the recipe including the cucumber, doesn't happen that often in Australia. This is a hotel I didn't want to leave, it felt like you were away from home with all the comforts of home, very pleasant ambience to capture.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_454013365~“Fantastic Overnight Stay at Emporium”~Had a great one-night stay at Emporium.  Valet parking was quick, easy and reasonable, friendly check-in from both reception staff and the porter. Our room was great, lots of amenities - free wifi, powerful shower and a comfortable bed. The room was stylishly presented - it would have been nice to spend more than just one night! We arrived reasonably late on a Sunday but there was still plenty of food options around. We didn't get a chance to explore the local area properly but it looked like it was in a fairly cool part of Brisbane. Fantastic view of Brisbane from the rooftop too. Would have been nice to have enjoyed the rooftop pool. No complaints at all!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_453697877~“Glitzy fit out ”~I work opposite and have always considered the emporium hotel a favourite for a quite coffee or beverage. They have a very well appointed bar with modern fit out, friendly staff and good alcohol. It's secluded and well run with easy accessible bathroom facilities which have always presented as being super clean and fresh smelling. I also use their boardroom facilities on level 1 which is a great option when wanting some locked down concentration time. They have decent AV and always provide fresh tea and coffee options. We also used their ballroom recently for a work conference whi h was no fuss and we'll managed~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
