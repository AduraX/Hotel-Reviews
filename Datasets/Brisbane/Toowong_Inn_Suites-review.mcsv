review_478171600~“Never again”~We stayed here for 2 nights, along with family members for a wedding. We had requested rooms next to each other and were told it wasn't a problem. When we arrived we were told we were in an 'executive' room, which was towards the back of the hotel, away from all our family who were all staying in the front, our room was smaller then theirs, but the real shock was the noise! When we opened the door to our balcony there is full on building construction. Grinders, honking trucks, grinders, men yelling... the lot. When we mentioned it to reception she made a joke and said that they wouldn't be working the next day(Saturday). Didn't offer a different room, or any type of discount for the room. Other guests who checked in after us were given rooms at the front of the building so there were obviously rooms available.  We were woken at 6 am on Saturday morning from construction work.  The bed was hard, there is no toasters in the room, there was no fresh air in the room as we couldn't open the sliding door, the foxtel channels only consisted of a couple of sports channels, not that we could hear the tv over the noise and the free wifi wasn't worth the effort. I understand construction can't be helped, but advising guests prior to arrival, or not using the rooms if possible, or offering better customer service is possible.  I will never stay here again.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467059709~“Convenient and clean.”~My husband and some of our family booked into this Inn for the weekend to attend a family wedding. It was easy to find. Parking is excellent and our rooms were extremely clean and well appointed. I had occasion to ring and ask about the facilities and to book in earlier than normal and the gentleman on reception was very obliging and friendly. We had the king room which had one of the most comfortable beds we have experienced anywhere. Very roomy and AC really efficient and quiet. We would recommend this Inn for anyone visiting Brisbane area. Very reasonable price for a major city with easy access to the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_456561204~“Clean, tidy, well equipped.”~Clean and Tidy. Self Contained - everything you need away from home.  Very spacious, good location, close to eateries & conveniences. Not far from Indooroopilly Shopping Centre. Undercover Secure parking. We would definitely stay again.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454127255~“Clean, tidy, reasonably priced”~We stayed in a family sized room with a large double and single with well resourced kitchenette. Off the main drag but with very easy access through the back car park of Toowong Village which has an excellent range of shops. 10 minute walk to The Regatta pub which we really loved. On site underground parking and very friendly and helpful staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445724516~“A Handy Little Haven”~My sister has been using this hotel for years as her base in Brisbane. She raves about it. After a recent visit, I agree with her choice. It is about 500 metres from Toowong Shopping Centre and Toowong Station. Many pleasant cafes line the next street. And not many stops by train from Central Brisbane. The rooms were clean, cool and the undercover parking was good. The staff were pleasant and most helpful. Wi-Fi was included. A pleasant little pool, washing machines and BBQ area. What more could you cant?. I loved it and give it five stars.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_441739416~“Convenient but tired”~Good location for visiting Brisabne and the surrounding area. Local shops and restaurants are satisfactory.

review_441411748~“"There''s NO Place Like Home...!!!"”~There are plenty of VERY nice things to say about the "Toowong Inn" but, the TOP NICEST thing to say can be summarized in one word... ..."Gregory"! Gregory is a true Gentleman and HE and his very kind, sweet, and truly caring staff are why I will ALWAYS stay @ the "Toowong Inn" any time that I visit the Brisbane Area! In addition to being a perfect gentleman, Gregory is the Very Best Concierge for the entire Brisbane Area, Australia, and quite possibly, the better part of the world! He will tell you all of the very best places to see and what are the very best in local restaurants! In addition to Gregory, I made so many nice and amazingly interesting contacts and friends @ the "Toowong Inn" because "anyone who knows anything" about Brisbane always makes a habit of staying here! The "Toowong Inn" is perfectly located very close to Downtown Brisbane, South Bank, Queensland University, etc.   Toowong is also a very nice area to stay in with plenty of all levels of shopping (toowong Village) and Gregory will tell you the very best places to eat for your money! My favorite in the area is "JackPot Noodle", in fact I ate there a majority of my evenings while in Toowong! Also check out "the Boatshed @ The Regatta Hotel"!!! Anyway, my bottom-line...??? Five Stars and My VERY HIGHEST "TripAdvisor" Recommendation to The "Toowong Inn & Suites" and Gregory!!! LEE~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_431745401~“Our Overnighter ”~Stayed here twice now and always good value. Clean and tidy and always friendly service. They even let our group of 4 rooms check in early so we could get ready for an early wedding. Handy walking distance to the shopping centre too. Always a good Overnighter..~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405949069~“Good accommodation close to the University”~Stayed for one night. Comfortable, quiet, clean & modern accommodation, very close to Toowong shopping plaza (lots of shopping & eating options) and Toowong station (easy connections into Brisbane). Friendly and helpful staff. Just a short taxi ride (or long walk) to UQ campus, St Lucia. Very sparse "continental breakfast" option but really not needed as in-room facilities are good and shopping centre is very close. Secure parking is available. Moderately priced with discounts for longer-term stays. Free Wi-Fi provided.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_401098114~“Clean, comfortable, well managed.”~Stayed here as our normal corporate preferred option was not available. Greg the manager is very personable and very helpful. The rooms are a little dated, but they have all the essentials and are clean. The bed I had was comfortable, the continental breakfast was a great start to the day and the coffee machine was good. Well located one street back from the main street in Toowong and close to the back entrance to the Toowong Plaza Shopping Centre and railway station. Plenty of undercover parking, has a nice pool for summer visitors. I'd stay there again.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_395297362~“Excellent location and service”~The location is right behind the village main shopping and transportation center, which made it convenient for shipping, dining and train access. The manager on duty, Greg, was excellent with dinner reservations and knowledge of the area. He also was extremely helpful in getting us around the town. It is a great values and service if you are in the Toowong area.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393401267~“A great place to stay with families”~This is our accommodation of choice in Brisbane. The loft suites are perfect for families, they are spacious and always spotless. The Management and staff are always friendly and helpful. Across the road is a shopping centre and the train station whilst, the city cat is only a short walk away. We always look forward to staying here and our visits this weekend past was no exception.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_364510632~“Great place to stay”~This is a great place for families. It is easy to get into the city and the staff are ever so helpful. Our room was clean and the self contained cooking facilities and equipment makes it easier to feed the family instead of eating out all the time. Family of 5 or more!! Just fabulous. Thanks so much!!~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_350104521~“Good location, but pricey and not friendly”~My wife and me stay here for 4 days due to there is free parking. It is near to Toowong village, and train station. Also not too far from university of Queensland where my son is going. Beside this, compare to a city apartment where we moved to after 4 days(after we return our rented car), it is about 50% more to stay here. Also, the temp staff is friendly but the others not. Even we greeted him in the morning, he just ignore us.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_346012171~“"Comfortable, clean, friendly and close to amenities"”~Multiple stays at this property due to the family friendly atmosphere (home away from home) and close proximity to the railway station and Toowong shopping centre. The manager and staff are most helpful and considerate of your needs - early check-ins and late check-outs not a problem if notified in advance, they will take the time to provide the best local advice and ensure a comfortable visit. Highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_344646861~“Basic but comfortable”~We three adults stayed for three nights in a loft apartment which gave us two bedrooms with comfortable queen beds. One bed was on the lower area and was like a studio room with kitchen/dining/lounge all in one. The other bed was upstairs in the loft. A small balcony overlooked the street and contained two chairs and a table. There were some kitchen utensils missing but the manager, Greg, quickly replaced them. The decor was a little tired, but the unit was clean and tidy. A breakfast room beside the pool was supplied with fruit, cereals, toast, spreads, tea and coffee. Having the Toowong Town Centre across the road meant easy access to a supermarket and an excellent green grocer/delicatessen. We didn't use the pool but families were enjoying it. A laundry contained several washers and dryers at a cost of A$6 per load. Transport is within walking distance, making this complex close to the CBD, Southbank and university. We would stay here again.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_344157194~“There were problems but Manager was eager to please.”~I stayed for 3 nights and found the facilities mainly operational. The decor was a bit of a mixture. All the levels are serviced by stairs or an elevator. The area is quiet even with the main shopping centre backing on to motel. The pool and outdoor areas were well kept and inviting but I did not see anyone using them. The room was clean and all fixtures and appliances though of low quality were operational. Like most self serviced apartment motels the consideration for refigeration is "a small one will do' but as this motel only supplies a microwave for cooking the freezer compartment was totally inadequate being very small.  I had trouble with the internet connection. The motel should scrap "Ezi-Web" and handout WPA codes instead. I only met one staff member and he was friendly and helpful. The biggest dissapointment were the 2 chairs provided as part of the 2 person dining. These chairs are metal frame with a cane seat & back and are more designed for outdoor lounging  than sitting forward at a table. After 10 minutes on the computer I had sore legs from the metal fame. On the whole the motel was just OK value. You could do better but this motel will satisfy your requirements. I doubt you will be disapointed with your decision to stay here.~4~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_343182680~“So handy!”~We stayed here as a family of 6, and it was brilliant! Literally across the road from the Toowong Village shops, the train and around the corner to the ferry. The rental car spent the week parked up because we didn't need it! Easy as pie to get to the city, Southbank Beach and to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. The room was comfortable with heaps of space, and the pool was a huge hit with the whole family. I'd highly recommend staying here for a low fuss holiday~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_339497831~“THE place to stay!!!”~Convenient or what! Right in Brisbane, near the river with Toowong Village shopping centre 2 minutes across the road with everything you need. The place is superbly run by Greg who does everything possible to make the stay comfortable and relaxed. Really affordable with superb facilities with really nice units - kids on a balcony area with bunkbeds and A/C overlooking the main room beneath with kitchen, lounge, double bed, bathroom and veranda. Laundry is $6 for washing as well as drying and Greg supplies the detergent! Wi-Fi usage generous and using the place as a stop-over for international travel but needing to get things done in the city we will always stay here now. The access road is really quiet and parking underneath the whole complex so safe and secure and not on the street. You would be hard-pushed not to enjoy your stay and we would be hard-pushed not to stay longer! Could not recommend this place highly enough.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_336312337~“Good location”~I went to Brisbane for a work trip, and stayed here because it was the closest to UQ. The room was comfortable, and the location next to Toowong shopping centre and train station is excellent. I found the hotel a bit noisy; I heard lots of guests standing in the hallway talking. I also had to close my windows because people were smoking outside. The dining table was far too small to have a comfortable dinner. Given the great location I will come back though, I will just need to insist on a room on the higher level.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_332775115~“Convenient location with secured parking facilities”~Stayed with family for a short visit. Wifi was "choppy" as logging in took some time. However, the room was clean and the balcony was a good size for us to sit outside. We enjoyed the close proximity, less than 5 minutes walk to the shops especially the supermarkets and good restaurants and public transport.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_297030456~“Convenient location.”~Convenient location and secure parking were our reasons for staying here recently. Rooms are spacious, clean and quiet but they are a bit dated - not a deal breaker by any means. The bed was certainly firm. The bathroom could be challenging for some - we had to climb up and into our shower/bath. The small balcony was a convenient location for a morning coffee and a read of the paper. Location was perfect for us as the train station was literally a 5 minute walk from our room.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan

review_278217888~“Family friendly”~We were here 2 years ago and what a pleasant surprise to return to today. New comfortable beds, lofts with bunks and/or double beds. Refurbished self contained units are fantastic and family friendly. Located right beside the newly renovated Toowong Village shopping centre. A short walk to the Regatta Hotel and 7 eleven convenient stores. Ideal location for commuting via train/ city cat to cut costs heading into the Brisbane CBD.

review_267497040~“Great self contained Appartment”~Stayed here when my boys were playing in their basketball State Championships at NAB stadium. Easy walking distance to the stadium. Across the road from shopping centre with great food court and Sizzlers. A lot of different teams were staying here and there was a great atmosphere. Staff were very friendly. Large outdoor area for BBQs and good pool. Very well set up laundry. Rooms are very clean and well set up. Not all rooms have a full size fridge but ours did. Great big bath. Only thing that would be good is a small light on the stairs if you have a loft room. I was a bit worried about the kids coming down during the night and tripping so we left the bathroom light on. Have already booked again for June!~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_257388825~“A lovely place to stay!”~We stayed here for three nights in a standard studio room. The room was spotlessly clean and the service was outstanding and very friendly. The motel is centrally located close to the University, and just across the road from the shopping centre. We would definitely stay here again. The only issue I have is that they charge $6.00 to use the washing machine and $6.00 to use the dryer. That is really a bit steep!~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_255918861~“Needs an upgrade”~Whilst the property is quiet, clean and tidy the loft suites definitely need an upgrade. The bathroom for a family of four is cramped, very dated and quite dangerous getting in and out of the shower/bath. The dark brown shower curtain makes you feel claustrophobic and very dreary. The beds were comfortable, air cond. worked ok. Wardrobe space was very limited. The room rate was also quite high for the quality and standard of room.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~3~nan
review_253014317~“Great place to stay”~I chose this hotel because it was near the Wesley Hospital. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and the room even had a microwave, a rarity in Brisbane.

review_249377541~“Stayed there for 8 days”~We stayed in a loft suite - 2 adults & 3 kids. The cleaners were lovely and friendly. But it was so hot & muggy in the room because the air conditioner was way to small for the room. The manager did go & buy 1 cheap fan but that did nothing to help the situation, it was even stinking hot upstairs where the air con is situated & we were out of the room all day, everyday. The only Foxtel was a couple of sports channels & the WiFi was crap. There also was 3 washers & dryers but every single time I went to do a wash they all were taken up with the hotel towels & curtains. I had to hand wash once & then the next time I hung out in front of the laundromat for 2 hours to wait for someone to finally grab their washing. We picked this hotel for the laundry, foxtel, wifi & aircon & we got none of it. The whole room stunk of mould  The worst was my children & I were getting electric shocks from the light switch in the bathroom & the manager didnt really care. He said that he had an electrician "look" at it & said it worked fine but as I told him it was after showers it happened & he just shrugged his shoulders!! NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. This is a safety hazard!!!! I will never return. Worst hotel stay ever!!!~1~nan~5~1~nan~nan~1~nan
