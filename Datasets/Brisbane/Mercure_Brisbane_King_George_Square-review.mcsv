review_475504196~“Overnight Stay”~Excellent Service from Check in, concierge and housekeeping. Lovely thoughtful team of people. Only one concern - the bacon at breakfast was under cooked and the staff (or lack of) weren't very attentive on the breakfast shift. Also, it doesn't mention that parking is an extra cost - well no where obvious, so that did catch me out! Other than that, was a great stay.~4~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_474064701~“Don't expect much”~THE GOOD - Location is a fairy quick walk to most downtown attractions. THE BAD - Rooms were very tired, somewhat broken, and in definite need of a refresh - for example, bathroom had no hooks for towels and wall-mounted hairdryer was broken; and the air conditioning in our room barely worked. THE WORST - Hotel staff was inattentive and unprofessional - leaving and retrieving our car from the valet was always a huge challenge, and overall customer service was extremely slow and with no follow through. No reason to stay here again.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~1~nan
review_472958272~“Relaxing”~Pre cruise stay, after long flight from U.K. Found the staff friendly and accommodating, considering the where many to check in. Room lovely and clean bright great view of the town hall, Enjoyed the breakfast, full cooked, continental or just bakery coffee was good, newspapers to read as well! Close to the town centre. Three night stay but the last night before join cruise, the carpet was wet by the bathroom, turns out air conditioning unit leaking, rang reception moved in 10 minutes, no issues. Fab response.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470771951~“awesome experience”~I have stayed there before and was very happy. All I can say, it is a pleasant experience staying there, the staff is helpful and friendly and the breakfast is absolutely delicious. It is in the City centre and 500m from Central Station. I arrived earlier and was able to get into my room.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470406642~“great location and rooms.”~If arriving by train get off at Roma station turn left out side the station and walk up the hill, when you see the clock tower you are at the hotel swimming pool was under repair at the time we visited but a pool was offered at a near by hotel. The breakfast was excellent with a good variety of food available.Main shopping street near the hotel a short walk across the square. .~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_470244407~“Disappointing ”~Really excited to be in Brisbane for work. Very helpful staff at chick-in and lovely foyer. After making my way up to level 10 and opening the door to my room I was still happy until I turned on the TV and found I had sound but no picture. After telling the front desk they sent maintenance up to fix but back to sound only again the next morning. Very disappointing to find mould in the shower. Room seemed clean but on closer inspection was quite dusty. We might try the Pullman side of the hotel when we're back in June.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470202030~“Just ok”~Unfair to be negative as it's a good hotel in a decent location but I was disappointed to be given a room right outside the elevator despite having asked specifically for one not near the elevator! I was only there for a few nights and as we arrived at 1am really just wanted to sleep and not mess about so didn't go back down to see if I could change.  I was however not surprised that the elevator binging in the morning and the general congregation of people outside the lifts was as distracting as I thought it would be... Rooms were OK - No views, minimal natural light and fairly functional bathrooms, but clean and tidy.  Breakfast was pretty good with a very friendly chef who made me a couple of very tasty plus sized omelettes in the morning!  Queue for the coffee machine was a bit dull at times. As was the coffee itself! Overall a good stay at a decent budget hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469803914~“Very affordable central location”~Myself & my wife stayed here for 2 nights and were pleasantly surprised with what the Mercure had to offer for the price, compared with other similiar hotels in the area. The bed was comfortable, zero noise from any outside traffic with our room being opposite the clock tower & found every staff member we talked to were absolutely delightful. They even currently have a shuttle service to and from the Sofitel (another Accor hotel) as the pool area (although still quite usable at the Mercure), has some sort of maintenance being carried out. The full buffet breakfast was great - with a chef to make omeletes any way you like. The room and corridors probably needed a bit of a touch up with some paint here and there, but that didn't detract from the overall experience and we will be staying here next time we visit Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_468417289~“Friendly and helpful staff”~Thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay, with very friendly and helpful staff. Ideally located in the city centre. Buffet breakfast very good. Our room, though on the small side, was very welcoming, quiet and nicely furnished. Ensuite excellent. Fabulous view over King George Square. Being an Accor loyalty member, our welcoming drinks and snacks - including oysters - were much appreciated!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_467760570~“Central Brisbane location with everything on your doorstep”~I stayed here in February 2017 with my husband and parents. It is a very central hotel with lots of restaurants, bars and shopping right on the doorstep. The room was quite small but clean and overlooked King George Square. Their is a swimming pool on the roof of the hotel but it is very dated and needs a complete makeover. Work was underway adjacent to the pool and although not sure what was happening it looked like perhaps a Jacuzzi may be going there.  Breakfasts were good with a great variety to choose from - fresh fruit, yoghurts, bread, cheeses, hams along with all the hot food and fresh coffee and tea. I would not hesitate to stay here again. I recommend the free Brisbane Cityhopper to sail along the river. We walked to the stop beside the casino and only took about 15-20 minutes and was not a strenuous walk.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467439506~“Good hotel in a great location for seeing Brisbane”~I stayed here recently for an overnight business stop and would definitely stay here again. The service was good, the room was clean and spacious and the location provides excellent access across the road from King George Square and a short walk to the main mall of Brisbane. It is also easy to access trains and buses to gain access to the wider areas of Brisbane~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_465822576~“Short stay”~Stayed at this hotel for two nights. Room overlooked the square and the clock tower which was nice but that was about it. The room is badly in need of redecorating, it was dusty and generally grubby. The bed was made up on the second morning but the bathroom was not cleaned nor were the wet towels changed. Breakfast was good but the coffee was dire. Room service food was good and there was a good choice of movies. The roof top pool area was being refurbished and the pool needs repainting. Not the best hotel. Staff attitudes were mixed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465393785~“Briliant Location”~This venue is superbly located in the heart of the city and has good in house facilities which include a spacious bar with an outdoor space as well, rooftop bar with fabulous views and a great restaurant downstairs. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Lovely comfy beds and a bathroom with lots of space around the basin. The hotel has a lovely feeling of spaciousness and whilst I was there, it included an interesting collection of art on display downstairs. Would really recommend this place.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_465284185~“Well-located hotel to King George Square, Town Hall & Roma Street Station, Brisbane”~I stayed at Mercure Brisbane Roma Street for 2 nights over a weekend in March 2017; very-well appointed room on 8th floor; good location for Roma Street Station and shopping malls; only a short walk to South Bank. Pity the tariff did not include Breakfast.~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_464633546~“Great location ”~Stayed here for work while in Brisbane and loved the location. Close to all amenities, one street over from Queen St and over the bridge to Southbank.

review_464606176~“One night was enough”~We stayed here for the Adele concert and I am glad it was only one night. A triple share room, we got 2 towels, 2 cups, 2 of everything really... the beds were hard and the pillows were probably made out of cement that had not yet been mixed with water. Stuff are friendly and more than willing to help out. Coffee in the cafe is pretty good too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463997862~“Fabulous place, fabulous staff, fabulous location!!!!”~This is one of the best places we have stayed in Brisbane. It is in a great location close to the Queen St Mall for shopping and restaurants, South Bank, Treasury Casino and Central Train Station. The rooms were nice and big and we had one with two double beds which was fantastic. Lovely views too! We had our car and it was easily accessible with very safe parking on site. The staff were fabulous. Always happy and very polite and very willing to please. I honestly could not complain about our whole experience there. We loved it!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463113404~“City Break ”~Had a night booked for Hubbys Bday and we were in Bne (live in Sydney) and a co worker suggested to stay here. We stayed on the Mercure side which was compact, clean and had everything we expected in a hotel room.  staff were welcoming on arrival and upon the Duty Manager discovering it was my hubby's bday went the extra mile to make the evening a special experience. Not long after checking in a bottle of wine was kindly delivered for us to have a birthday toast before we heading up to the roof top bar for pre dinner drinks. We then had a sensational dining experience at the hotel restaurant. It was not just the food that was outstanding the service was extraordinary! You know the food was going to be sensational when the table of hipsters near us were instagrammig their meals.  A special mention to Dillion who not only knew the menu and beverage list inside out . Ensured my meals were customised wirh my very unique dietary requirements.  His level of commitment to the customer experience was commendable and an asset to the Accor Group.  I am a regular traveller and stay at Accor hotels are least once a quarter and this was by far my best dining experience to date.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462751727~“Small old room, great location”~Small old room with not such a flash bathroom however the location is amazing. The staff were attentive and the roof top bar was nice. Pool undergoing renovations however the kids still managed a swim..... I would consider it for short stays but certainly not long ones with kids in these little rooms!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462142904~“Not bad, but could be improved”~Great location, small rooms but they have everything you want. Was disappointed that there were marks all over the mirror in the hallway, would have thought housekeeping could have sorted that before the room was deemed ready. The room service was ok, probably wouldn't choose it if there were other options. Breakfast in the restaurant was nice. Had a lukewarm shower which was a bit rough. Bed is hard and pillows too, would be nice to have a few different pillow choices. All staff were really very professional and friendly.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461312727~“Great location, helpful staff”~Hotel was in a central location right near a train station or an easy uber/taxi ride to other parts of town. Easy walk to South Bank and museum and places to eat. Pillows were a little uncomfortable for me but otherwise the room was quite comfortable, bathroom was a little dated but perfectly functional. Pool, bar and gym were good. Staff were fantastic very helpful overall a good stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460191850~“Great location and service”~Although the rooms are showing their age a little, everything was beautifully clean, service was excellent, breakfast was diverse and good quality.

review_459095055~“Very handy location but showing its age”~Pluses: 1. Great location opposite Queens St Mall 2. Great value for money, partly because there are so many hotels in BNE now 3. Spacious, older style room Minuses: 1. Hotel is showing its age, bathroom interiors were quite underwhelming 2. Hotel room corridors and doors narrow - would be hard for someone in a wheelchair 3. Not much of a view - the windows were tiny~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_459022902~“ITS ALL ABOUT THE CLIENT SERVICE”~Recently switching from another Brisbane hotel, I was delighted to find a much more personalised experience for my stay. I was called prior to travel to confirm my booking and answer my questions. Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted and used the valet parking, which was excellent on departure also. I was invited to a cocktail hour "meet and greet" as an accor member. The canapes included sushi and oysters on shell and decent wine. The staff in attendance were very attentive and wonderful to chat with. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and offered me too many options. I received loyalty drinks vouchers which were usable at the coffee shop, not just alcohol, and the barista was absolutely lovely. The room was practical in its layout and clean. Complimentary water and a fruit plate delivered personally, made me feel that I was being looked after very well, and my level of comfort was therefore immediate. I look forward to my next visit and have obviously now switched hotels to the Mercure.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_458228812~“Good location”~Stayed there for 4 nights, great location right opposite train station, close to shopping center and walking distance to Anytime fitness. Decent size for the room and equipped with standard hotel amenities. I had some issues with TV and telephone, reported to the front desk and got it fixed by Mark the maintenance. Many restaurants to dine out around the hotel, not far from night clubs area which is about 10 minutes away by Uber. The rooftop bar is a pretty cool place to catch up with mates. Overall great stay, nice location, and friendly staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_457930966~“Short Stay”~Well located with helpful staff. Close to Central Station so easy from the airport.

review_457245247~“Lovely!”~Tastefully decorated, spacious, with, fridge, desk, air con,tea making facility, SAFE, Free WIFI. Good size bathroom with shampoo etc. and without the horrible dispenser type cleansers & shampoos. Close to everything. Easy walk from Roma Street, railway station, King George Square and the mall. The river Catt is easily accessed from here as well at Nth Quay terminal. If going on a cruise and do not have any mobility problems then this is a great spot. Take the River Catt / Ferry from Nth Quay to Brett's Wharf and then it's only about 300m to the ship terminal checkin. We loved it here and will certainly return.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Cafe in foyer was awesome. Well appointed for trains and buses or if you just wish to stroll through the CBD. Swimming pool and gym on 16th floor and well used. Great views from this area. Breakfast was a hit and miss affair with staff not really with it.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan

review_449738262~“Very Disappointed”~I was a Silver Le Club and Advantage Plus member. Checked into the Mercure Brisbane King George Square on 31Dec2015 for one night. Disappointed with the cleaniess of room, coffee spilt stains on wall behind the desk which was visible sitting on the bed, holes in the bed sheets, hotel toiletries appeared to be previously used. Tried to use my Advantage Plus card for breakfast - told I couldn't use it. I wasn't advised at check-in that I could not use it. Tried to order a club sandwich from room service. Couldn't get one! Checked out straight away. Bought breakfast elsewhere. Haven't been back, never will and did not renew Advantge Plus membership. C.Arendsen~2~nan~nan~nan~2~2~1~nan

The room was ok in size, the bathroom was dated and the TV was poor quality. Everything was an additional cost and tv channels available were basic local tv only. We booked for 3 yet only 2 towels were provided in the bathroom. We had to wait 10 minutes for concierge when we collected our bags. When finally served by the concierge team leader we were asked if we could see the bags. When we pointed them out he indicated for us to make our way past and move other peoples bags to retrieve ours ourselves. Not the service or stay we expected.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
