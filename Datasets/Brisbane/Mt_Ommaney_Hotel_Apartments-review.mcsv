review_477868099~“OK Motel”~The rooms were clean but old. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and at the back of the complex a bit noisy as it backs onto a freeway. The shower is over the bath, so be aware of that (at least in the room we stayed in!). The buffet breakfast was nice, but a bit pricey for what was available (not a lot). A short, easy walk to a very large shopping complex and lots of access to public transport. Overall a pleasant stay and would probably stay there again as is very convenient to family.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_443620864~“Perfect stay”~My wife and I stayed at the hotel on a Saturday night. We were surprised to discover we had booked a deal that meant we got a full buffet breakfast. The room was lovely, staff were great and breakfast was perfect. They even have gluten-free toast!  Thank you for a very pleasant experience. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414493763~“Weekend visit”~Stayed for 2 nights to attend a friend's party near by. Easy to get to by car. Handy location near Mount Ommaney shopping centre, about 5 minutes walk. Reasonably price. Found the room clean and comfortable, with all the necessary requirements. Staff were friendly. Had the buffet breakfast at $22 each, basic but quite delicious with friendly and helpful staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_411147086~“Great rooms and very clean”~Stayed here in June for Business. On check in you are provided with WIFI codes Firstly, the room was a Superior One Bedroom Apartment, room was massive own little kitchen area, lounge room area , bathroom and bedroom I was on ground level, other levels had balconies, but mine had little area with table chairs to sit outside room. Secondly - They only do Breakfast Buffet, has all your breakfast requirements and can also ask the service person to do eggs for you the way you like them. Thirdly there is no dinner on site - For dinner the hotel provides a shuttle bus to a local pub, local Thai food Place and another place. The shuttle bus leaves certain times and all this information is in the room. so you can have a few drinks and have the shuttle collect you from the local pub. Last Shuttle back to hotel is around 9.15pm. Also you are directly across the road from a massive shopping centre. Overall this was a good pick~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_363279868~“NO Restaurant, No Bar, No Way!!!”~No restaurant, NO Bar they want you to take a bus around the locals after working all day, then when you go to the room NO BAR Fridge!!! I thought prohibition went out years ago. I stayed here last October all was good then, must have new owners who no nothing about customer service. And by the way did I mention that the room rates have not been adjusted down to meet the lack of amenities, funny that. I had booked a meeting with 10 interstate visitors, I have canceled as I don't want them eating out of a bag and taking a bus to the local, not good for business. Other hotels to choose from, I wont be coming back~1~nan~2~nan~nan~2~1~nan
review_350122763~“Suburban holiday”~Mt Ommaney Hotel Apts offers the best quality of very little choice of accommodation in this suburban Brisbane area.  A short 5 min walking to the Mt Ommaney Shopping Centre and quick drive or bus to the city - the location is handy but a bit noisy when morning traffic hits the freeway.  The friendly welcome included a free drink at the bar and free wifi. Parking is aplenty and the room large. The size of the TV probably a bit small to watch from the bed but there were two chairs to sit comfortably to watch while enjoying a night time snack. The pack of disposable cutlery was very handy for the cheese and biscuits we had brought with us. The bed was comfy and the room clean. Air con quiet and controllable.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_340410347~“Noisy, rattly and saggy. ”~Noisy location right next to the Centenary Highway.  Free WiFi.  Undercover parking close to rooms.  Large spacious rooms but in need of a face lift.  All the beds very saggy in the middle and need replacement.  All rooms had old style air-conditioning that was noisy and rattled when operating.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_320333102~“What's that smell? ”~The room smelled. I couldn't put my finger on it but it wasn't pleasant and made it very difficult to sleep. The water pressure in the shower was non - existent. It was no morw than a dribble. Will not be returning in a hurry.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_297313757~“Comfort and Friendliness”~The perfect place to stay. The friendliness of all the staff was just wonderful. The room was on ground level and with the door open out onto the grounds it was like being in a tropical get-away - tennis court and pool or a stroll around the grounds. The bed was just so comfortable and the room was large, bathroom comfortable and it all looked so new and clean and smelt clean. Breakfast was just scrumptious! We would definitely go out of our way to stay here when we stay in Brisbane in the future. Thank you to all for a lovely break in the lovely city of Brisbane. The door key was a bit annoying as it was hard to put in the key hole - the only negative.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_293501057~“Lodge Accomodation”~I stayed at this hotel due to its proximity to the place where I had business meetings. Very good service but remote location and no restaurant service on Weekends means that it is malnly a bed & breakfast establishment. The shopping mall accross the road also closes early leaving food delivery service as the only option if you do not have transport. Good size rooms and bathroom. Room and aircon require upgrade. unlimited Free Wifi is a plus.~3~nan~2~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_277108023~“Wedding”~AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!! Exceptional staff, friendly, helpful, highly professional, I honestly couldn't fault them. They went above and beyond to make it a beautiful wedding day for my mother and father in law. So thankful.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_258685438~“Country Motel”~Definitely need an upgrade, for the price they charge. The room I stayed is big, but outdated, smelled stale. And because it is on the lowest ground level I did not want to open the curtains. Supplies are minimal, towels are tired, bed sagged  Breakfast was the best surprise. Lots of varieties and they even have fried/poached eggs on order. Fresh fruits and the typical hot food. The coffee is a bit disappointing, but at least my breakfast comes free with the rate. There is shopping mall within walking distance, but with the convenience of parking in front of your own door, why not drive? Wifi is slow so couldn't really use it; TV too small fro that size of room. Only stayed there because of a function nearby.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_249547581~“Needs a renovation”~Please note: we were booked into this accommodation through a government removals process for job relocation. We did not choose this accommodation, it was provided to us free of charge. Please keep this in mind as you read my review. I believe we stayed in a double 'motel' room #263. This room is upstairs and large but does not contain a kitchenette. It has a bar fridge and kettle only. Car parking is available reasonably close to the room.  The room has all of the original wooden cupboards and furniture from whenever the hotel was built. This makes it look outdated. The room smelt a bit stale. It also has an old boxy air conditioning unit which is effective but very noisy and makes a weird loud noise every 20mins. There is no fan in the bathroom, only a window to the walkway outside. Because Brisbane is hot and humid in summer, and using the shower makes the bathroom hot and humid, we to leave the bathroom door open while showering or it became too stuff. The bed was also a bit saggy in the middle. We didn't have any meals while there. They did offer two complimentary drinks and free wifi (so long as you provide your details on the login page). The hotel is located right near Mt Ommaney Shopping Centre which is quite big and the Centenary Hwy which takes you into the city. There is also a bus stop nearby.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_246449144~“Amazing Diverse Breakfast Buffet”~My fiancé and I stayed at the Mt Ommany Apartments for one night as we were visiting family near by. The hotel room itself was ok, however, the breakfast buffet was the best I ever had. They have a 24 hour reception so there was no problem with us turning up late in the evening to check in. The hotel room was the furthest from the reception and I don’t think there was anybody staying in the room next to us as it was very quiet. However, there was a lot of traffic noise as centenary highway is next to it. It was rather hot on the day as we turned up so we had the air con on. Unfortunately It was very powerful and rattly which made it difficult to sleep. The room itself was very small, but had a few tables and mini fridge, tea bags and few other beverages you could purchase. The bathroom had a very bright white light that was very blinding. It also looked very old with a window, but no fan causing the bathroom to get humid quickly. The shower pressure and bed quality was OK. The next morning we made our way to the buffet. There was a huge array of different cereals, breads, crumpets, different spreads, full fruit, chopped up fruit, yogurt, black teas, herbal teas and a coffee machine that made different coffees and hot chocolate. There was also cooked food such as eggs, bacon etc and more. We advised them my fiancé is lactose intolerant and they kindly supplied a generous amount of soy milk. What a great brunch to start the day!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_242357810~“Fairly Good”~Rooms are a good size. Breakfast was brilliant, very tasty with a fantastic selection. Dinner was a rip off, especially the beverages. The restaurant is closed Friday to Sunday nights. Can understand Saturday and Sunday as they obviously mainly cater to the weekday traveller but how hard to have a smaller area of the dining room open? Wifi connection very unreliable, even though my room was near the office and in sight my room was full of dead spots. Their laundry service is very expensive. $3.50 for a pair of gruds or socks, $10 for a polo, but on the positive you may get a newer item back than what you'd sent.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_223579002~“Disappointed”~My family and I spent 4 nights at the hotel as we were visiting Brisbane for my cousins wedding. Went out for the day and came back to find a plastic bag full of dirty clothes missing including the dress I wore for the first time to the wedding. Told the manager about it in the morning who was very pleasant but stated they were not liable for missing items. They went through the linen etc, brought the cleaner over to tell me she would surely have noticed it. Since the only people in the room that day were staff and I knew for certain the bag was there when I left (I don't usually carry my dirty laundry around with me during the day), I thought it was reasonable for the cost to be reimbursed- especially considering how overpriced the accommodation is. But no, not liable. Have tried to get onto someone from the Charlton Hotel chain but apparently the phone number they advertise doesn't exist anymore. So overall a pretty disappointing stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_215836776~“Handy to Centenary Freeway”~Stayed here overnight for convenience. Tidy clean room with table and chairs outside. Old wall type air conditioner which was noisy but effective. Saturday night but restaurant wasn't open, however a lovely meal served to the room. Bed not comfortable and could do with updating. Breakfast was buffet up in the function room and all we would have wanted. Staff pleasant.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_213422568~“Convenient, spacious accomodation.”~Staying in a one bedroom apartment, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. Even with its proximity to the highway, it was not overly noisy. Some rooms have a nice view out onto the well kept gardens. The restaurant served great meals, and the buffet breakfast was lovely. The inclusion of a complimentary drink on arrival was a nice touch. Staff were very helpful, and friendly. The aircon units are quite noisy, although they heated the rooms well, on a cold night. Blockout curtains provide for a peaceful sleep. Will definitely return!~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_208934897~“Business trip”~This property which chosen because of a early morning appointment in this area of Brisbane. Was overpriced for what you got, cheap towels, old pillows, a plastic type bath, which was very strange to stand in while showering, noisy air con. Light outside the room flicked on and off all night, we did have dinner in our room which was passable.~3~2~3~2~3~3~3~nan
review_207220736~“Staff are great... shame about the accommodation”~The staff are all just lovely - helpful, friendly and polite. As a function centre it's hard to fault - the upstairs function rooms have a lot of natural light, the facilities are modern and the food is very good quality. Jon is an exceptional function manager and deals with every situation swiftly, professionally and efficiently. The accommodation needs work; definitely an odour of 'old' in the room despite it being very clean. Decent size bathroom, comfy bed (firm mattress) but thin towels have seen better times or were just cheap to start with. The TV reception was awful, with fuzzy sound on every channel. I can't imagine any room being quiet so take ear plugs. Book online to get breakfast included. It's a reasonable range: cereal, yogurt, fruit, toast, eggs, bacon.~3~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_205859332~“Excellent”~I stayed here overnight in a one bedroom apartment on a recent business trip. My room was exactly as you see in the photos.  It was very spacious, spotlessly clean and very quiet considering the hotels close proximity to the motorway. The bed, whilst firm, was also very comfortable and the blockout curtains in the bedroom kept the room dark until well after sunrise.  I enjoyed the fact that I was able to whip myself up a quick meal in the adequately stocked kitchen, rather than venturing out on my own to have dinner by myself.  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend.~5~nan~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_199209435~“Excellent for Weddings”~Charmaine and the team looked after us throughout the whole wedding planning process. Were very helpful and accomodating. The venue was beautiful for photos and the food was praised by all who attended. No-one left hungry that`s for sure. The staff were so helpfull and friendly. They made our wedding day perfect and a day we will always remember. Extremely gratefull for the way they treated us. Restaurant was also fantastic and we will be back.~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_198122868~“needs work”~Take food and water to get to your room if you are up the back. Rooms have just had new carpet that smells a little. Needs a lot more than just new carpet! furnishings and beds are on the old run down side of reasonable. Could be worse. Book your accom from the internet to get breakfast in the restaurant free. Breakfast in the restaurant was fairly good but not cheap.~3~3~3~2~2~3~4~nan
review_193498020~“It's OK”~That's it. It's OK. The rooms are not flash, look a bit dated, old style box aircon that made noise during the night. The shower had heaps of water pressure, parking easy and the location great. I think it's overpriced but there is limited choice. In all it was OK.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_185541522~“Comfortable and quiet”~Stayed for 5 nights on business, found the room to be spacious and clean, probably a little outdated and nearing that stage were it requires a makeover but otherwise satisfied with the cleanliness of the room and bed was comfortable, as I was working nights also found the room to be fairly quiet considering its close proximity to the motorway. Close to shops also which was a big plus, would definitely stay again when next in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_181748495~“Our wedding day was Absolutely amazing BECAUSE we chose Mt Ommaney hotel apartments for our venue.”~So simple and straightforward. All inclusive packages. Our day went seamlessly because Charmaine took care of all of the difficult parts for us. Nothing was ever too much to ask for and the service provided was absolutely 5 star.

review_177325538~“Not staying there again”~This is one of the places the company I work for, books for us when in Brisbane, and it’s because of the location - very close to the office. When I got there, I was welcomed by a courteous front desk employee that even called me by my name before I could even say who I was - maybe i was the only person checking in that evening.... And it was downhill from then onwards. Room was very basic, cold and super dusty. I tried to switch on the AC on heat but it was blowing only cold air - so i managed to get a cold in less than 24 hrs from my arrival.  I am also allergic and for 3 days that I stayed there I really struggled with the dust in the room – it was everywhere!!!!!!!!!!  Pros: Good service at the front desk, breakfast place. Good location easy to access. Free WIFI and parking. Cons: Not clean, room service until 10pm only, no safety box to deposit belongings.~3~3~3~2~3~1~4~nan
review_177325349~“3 Night Wedding”~We went to Mt Ommaney for an in house wedding, stayed 3 nights. Check in was great and staff sorted out our booking to match wedding pricing. On Friday nights the little bar had a singer/entertainment and he was terrific. We had a 9 person dinner and the staff handled it well. They organised the wedding on grounds and looked after the 60 odd guests very well, the meal etc that was served was good. The room we had was large and the only complaint was no fan in the shower so every thing in the bathroom ended up wet. There is some road traffic noise with a freeway on one side and a main road on the other, but it was not too bad. Close to Brisbane and the main roads into and out off town. Large Mt Ommaney shopping centre across the road. The only disappointing thing was that the bar and rest. are not open on Sat or Sun nights but you can get room service? I would rather the rest. be open on weekends.   Would stay there again.~4~3~3~4~4~3~4~nan

review_168623102~“Fantastic place to stay”~I recently stayed here with my family while attending a wedding. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much to ask of them. We'd hired a portacot and stroller for our baby, and the staff were quite happy for us to have the equipment delivered to the hotel before we arrived, and they even took the stuff to our room for us. We'll definitely be back again.~5~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_163504276~“HIghly recommend for your wedding reception”~We recently had our daughter's wedding reception here and I can only speak highly of the venue. Charmaine the wedding coordinator went out of her way to make sure the night ran smoothly and could not do enough for us. We paid for the Adoration Package and ordered the Buffet meal. The food was plentiful and delicious with guests able to have seconds and thirds if they wished! The desserts were wonderful. We were impressed with the setting out of the venue and the food and even the pre-reception finger foods. The table service was excellent. If you are thinking of having a wedding reception here, I can only say you get wonderful value for your money. We stayed in the rooms the night before and the night of the reception and although older, they have been refurbished and are comfortable with kitchenettes. Also very good value for money.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_158970369~“Lovely place”~We originally chose Mt Omnaney because it was the closest to a wedding we were attending close by. only stayed two nights, room was very good, with our own car park, food was excellent, and staff was very helpful. Major shopping mall across the road which was handy. Only problem encountered was our GPS seemed to have a problem finding the place. Definitley would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_157581419~“Restaurant review, desert gr8, bread over priced”~We are locals visiting just the restaurant. Had a entertainment voucher buy one main get one free. Herb bread two pieces $9 way over priced. Mains, pork with noodles 7/10, noodles over cooked and not much flavour, big meal. Veal main 7/10, nice but needed more vegetables with it ,big meal. The highlight was the desert white chocolate honeycomb, delicious 9/10. The restaurant itself looks a little outdated. Without the voucher it would have been way too expensive. Kids meals $14, just nuggets or fish and chips, drink and ice cream and again too expensive. This restaurant could get more of the market if it was more family friendly in terms of its prices.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Jon the manager, and his staff are very welcoming and extremely professional. The rooms are comfortable and have everything you need for a trip away including toiletries and tea/coffee. The buffet breakfast is delicious with a wonderful variety of hot and cold breakfast items. I highly recommend this hotel.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_157260787~“Large rooms, Central Location but with nothing to walk to”~This hotel had huge rooms, they were a bit outdated, but very clean. It was located in between two motorways so you couldnt walk anywhere, but you could use the traffic circle to drive easily. It was very pricey and through easter it was shut, so we couldnt used the restaurant and bar. The tennis court was ok, but was covered in sand so the balls didnt bounce well. The staff were friendly. The air con units worked well but were very old and very loud, so loud that when they are on you feel stressed, so we turned them off, but if you open the doors you can hear the motorway noise.~4~2~3~3~3~4~5~nan
review_156936601~“Went over and beyond expectations...”~We stayed in April 2013 in the motel room which was actually quite big compared to other motel rooms I've stayed in. You also have a balcony you can actually sit on as well which makes the room seem bigger. We needed a cot ($5.50) per night - excellent price, given we were charged $20pn at Tugun, Qld the weekend before. Not only did we get a cot but a terry cloth was laid out on the bench for a change table (being higher than the bed it was excellent), plus bubba got his own towel and washer and there was also a nappy bucket set up (which the staff then had to empty - pooeee!). The room was nice and clean. It is in an excellent location near the shopping centre but maybe a bit overpriced given where it is - (and nothing much else around it other than the shopping centre) given you pay that for a hotel in the middle of Brisbane city. But overall, very nice place for 1-2 nights. We were also able to check in early and I think I had made 2-3 phone calls to reception the week leading up to our stay (to ask for a cot, then limited stairs, then the early check in request) and the staff were always super polite and friendly.~5~4~4~4~5~4~5~nan
review_155596620~“Getting married ?!”~After spending more than 12 weeks in the last 6 months, I think it’s about time to give a small review. Mount Ommany hotel apartments are convenient placed next to the highway, with a 20 minutes’ drive to Brisbane CBD.  I guess the hotel is pretty famous for hosting weddings, as there was a wedding party every (#¤!”#”!!)week-end !...don’t get me wrong, it’s very nice and romantic these weddings, but if you’re not a wedding crasher, you cannot get any drinks or food at the hotel during that week-end !. Luckily, there is a shopping mall 5 minutes’ walk from the hotel, so you’re able to play Gordon Ramsey in the well-equipped kitchen in the apartments. The apartments are decent. They are probably decorated in the 80`, where the rooms has been upgraded lately with a flatscreen. However the TV in the bedroom is still an old model, so only analog channels is showing and very few channels…Mr & Mrs Mount Ommany; please upgrade the tv´s in the bedrooms too ! The air-condition(s) in the living room and in the bedroom are noisy as “%#”, so in the summer nights, prepare to loose a few pounds in sweat or choose to have no sleep…at all. With every entry to the apartments, there is washing machine and tumble dryer, which for my part was very nice..the hotel also offer laundry service if you don’t have brought your wife with you  The surrounding of the hotel does not call for a walk in the nature, but you can on the other hand play a game or two on the tennis court, or have a “swim” in the pool. Do not expect to beat or imitate Michael Phelps here as it measures approx. 5x10 meters..and then I’m generous… The staff in the restaurant is very nice and up for a good laugh, as all aussies are. The dining is furthermore with a good variety and actually taste good for reasonable prices. Overall, it’s a nice and private place with a fairly lively atmosphere, however the week-ends you are more or less on your own…unless you´re attending a wedding.~4~4~3~3~3~4~4~nan
review_151508360~“Very expensive for run down room”~Stayed one night in a small tired room due to loss of power, phone due to floods. Bed was not made well with creased sheets and noisy until we noticed one bed caster was not sitting correctly in its holder. Shower was awful and not suited for tall people with poor water pressure- very difficult to wash your hair Furniture shows worn chipboard. Very ordinary.~2~1~1~2~2~2~3~nan
review_145704705~“Nice Hotel”~Stayed for two weeks for business. The hotel and room was nice. The internet was pretty slow and the room service menu very limited or else it would be higher.

review_135034842~“Amazing food and service but the rooms are FILTHY!!!!”~We recently stayed here for a wedding. The reception centre was great and the food was 5 star. Meals were cooked beautifully, severed hot and very nice flavours. The service was good but this motel is very let down by the accommodation cleanliness, it's truly filty! When we entred ti room, the bathroom floor was covered in hair, which clearly was NOT ours.... eeekkkk! The room was very old and just generally dirty. For the discounted price if $165 inc buffet breakfast ( which was fresh and delicious) was not worth the room we had. The pics of the motel on trip advisor make the rooms look fresh, clean and semi refurbished and I would have been very happy with one of these rooms, however the sad truth is that they need some serious attention to cleanliness and while their at it maybe some new towels that don't have ripped shreds hanging off them! Disappointing :(~3~1~4~nan~1~1~4~nan

As far rooms go we had a one bedroom apartment it was very spacious, clean and comfortable. We couldn't fault it, the place is also located near the shops if you want to duck over for a spot of shopping. The next morning we had breakfast with a large group of our family they all loved it, there was a good selection and we all walked out very very full =)~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
