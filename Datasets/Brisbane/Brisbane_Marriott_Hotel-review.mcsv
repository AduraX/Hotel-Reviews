review_477947599~“Did not think this kind of service still existed.”~From the moment I contacted the Marriott and spoke to Toby, until collected the keys for the last time from Santiago, what a professionaly run establishment. I actually felt wowed by the service and the hotel. The booking process was seamless and I was well looked after. The arrival process through the concierge was literally effortless and well run, through to the look, feel of the Marriot. The decor was unique, it looked as though this hotel had been designed and not stamped out of a factory, the building and decor was internally beautiful, a pleasure to soak in. We had an amazing view of the story bridge, and the room was warm, confortable and felt well put together. I have stayed in nice hotels but the devil is in the details and here they certainly are focused on. The pool was wonderful, although not huge, its location and design gave such an internal/exernal/ private/ in amongst the buildings, but still having bridge and sky views surrounding. The food was delicious and although hotel was very very busy. All the staff I encountered were just running like a professional well oiled service crew. We enjoyed our stay entirely, nothing could be faulted if one wished to, infact, quite the opposite, thank you Toby, you will know what the thank you is for. And I know some of this sounds trivial for what should be expected from a hotel, but I have stayed at a lot of hotels and rarely are they all in place and thats what makes an experience rather than just a stay, thanks again for a wonderful stay and experience , Marriot and Staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477909903~“Great hotel, great location, exceptional service!”~My first stay at Brisbane Marriott and I was impressed. Room was lovely with a great view of the river. Roomy, very comfy bed and well appointed for business travelers in terms of work desk and connectivity. The staff and level of service was exceptional in all areas, from check-in to house keeping to F&B. I did a site inspection of the conference rooms during my stay and was impressed with the space and the flexibility that the hotel offers to groups. Hats off to the team at Brisbane Marriott for their hospitality and proactive approach to business events. I would recommend this hotel as a great choice for individual leisure and business guests, and to conference groups.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_477861608~“Short but nice stay”~Really enjoyed the comfort and location of the hotel. We were able to utilize the pool facilities and enjoyed the rooftop. Parking was confusing at first but the staff was great at giving directions. The room was clean and well spaced, wish we could have stayed longer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477845385~“Great Marriott Experience”~I have just stayed 2 nights at the Marriott. I have been a gold member for a while. Some great things were that they upgraded my room on both occasions, the lounge in the evening has longer opening hours which is great as quite often I would miss it when I checked in later. As a gold member you can now have a complimentary breakfast downstairs as well. Great stay and would highly recommend even if you aren't a gold member. The hotel is in a great location with very friendly staff.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477598115~“Great hotel, great location!!”~This is a very nice hotel right across from the river bank, 10-15 minute walk to most parts of downtown! Service here was excellent as concierge workers extremely helpful and knowledgeable! Executive lounge was very nice and relaxing, with helpful staff and great wines! Breakfast buffet was also really good! Our room was pretty large and very comfortable with a nice view of the river and bridge! Over three days we walked all around town and only took a cab once because of rain! I would highly recommend the Brisbane Marriott for a short or long term visit!!~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_477383641~“Incredibly helpful staff”~My wife and I arrived late in Brisbane on a Friday night. Everywhere was closed. We went into the Marriot and asked the waiter Tommy where we could get something to eat and drink. He asked if we were residents. We said no and explained we had just arrived. He said “I’ll see what I can do. Wait while I ask my manager Michael.” He came back and explained that they had room service available and that even though we weren’t residents, they would be PLEASED to serve us. Incredible. We are most grateful. Michael and Tommy couldn’t have been more helpful. They are a credit to the hospitality industry. We will definitely stay there when we return to Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_476967761~“Beautiful hotel”~Good location since we were meeting friends at Eagle Street Pier. Went for a swim in the morning, nice to overlook the old church. Wish we tried the food or happy hour we saw advertised in the lift. we will definatley be back.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476954856~“Lovely river location”~This is definitely not a 5 star hotel if staying in a city view apartment - maybe if staying in an executive suite it would qualify. Stayed 2 days over Easter. The room was spacious with lots of hanging space and drawers but unusual for a hotel to advertise as "luxurious" with no mini bar, no robes, no biscuits with coffee/tea, one already used soap in bathroom and half roll of toilet paper. The buffet breakfast was very underwhelming and extremely busy. Had quite a long wait to get a seat but it was holidays so didn't mind as I wasn't in a hurry. HOWEVER, this hotel would have the most pleasant, friendly and helpful staff I have ever encountered anywhere and even though we had a room opposite the 3 lifts I didn't hear any noise at all over the 2 nights of anyone getting in or out of the lifts and there was no traffic noise at all. It was very peaceful. Even though I think it was overpriced for the quality I will stay again when next in Brisbane because of the lovely location and the service and efficiency of the staff was second to none.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475957374~“Perfect for international travellers ”~Flying to the other side of the earth from England can be daunting ..no matter how many times you do it .. we come at least once , sometimes twice a year to QLD and have done the past 12 years .. when in Brisbane we always book in here .. It's clean , it's in the CBD , its riverside so close to all the open air restaurants .. it's for a great bar , a great buffet breakfast , valet parking , typical nice clean Marriott rooms , at least the standard of JW Marriott grade in the US and the staff are professional with a down to earth casual Aussie manner for good measure .. Always a pleasure to stay here ..~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

A good hotel for business or a holiday.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474850459~“Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location”~This hotel is beautiful. The rooms are clean and comfortable but are basic square rooms. It's within walking distance to the many rerestaurants along the Brisbane Riverwalk. Its also easy to walk to the Queen Street pedestrian shopping mall. We were pleased that we could relax and enjoy the amenities of the lovely Premium Lounge.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473731723~“Great spot and staff”~Family of 4 (with two teens) stayed her for two nights. Was in a good spot with 5 minute access to Lone Pine Sanctuary ferry and river walk restaurants. Rooms were high quality, great views of river, downtown and Victoria Bridge, and breakfasts were good. What really made the hotel standout for me were the concierges we encountered. Not only were Lloyd, Naill and Sara friendly, but their help and recommendations were absolutely key to making our stay in Brisbane special. Cheers to them.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_473703688~“Staff was great, super location”~The location in the city, within walking distance of Queen Street Mall, Eagle Street, and the City Cat pier could not have been better. We had an overnight flight from Tokyo and arrived hours before the room was going to be ready. We got passes to the executive lounge and complimentary fruit and beverages, and they sped up the room preparation for us. The day before we left a cyclone hit Brisbane, and was worse than expected. We and many others were stuck in the hotel, watching the rain pour down, while most of the city was closed. The staff managed to make us all comfortable and went over the top to serve us even though they surely had concerns of their own in the storm. They even comped our dinner. I can't say enough good about the management and staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472881105~“Wonderful”~Fantastic staff. Very efficient check in and check out. Fast service at breakfast. Fantastic rooms. Very comfortable bed and bedding.

review_472832644~“Marriott delivers!”~The Brisbane Marriott is centrally located and is a short walk to a shopping district and close to the Science Museum and other great sites. The rooms are very nice and the resto on the main level is great. Try the Oysters Kirkpatrick for a start and the pork for a main. The panama cotta is a terrific desert. The dining room staff are very helpful - thanks for your recommendations Carlos! Will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

In addition we were able to relax and eat breakfast (complimentarily) in the meantime in the executive lounge. Thank you!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472298716~“Superb from start to finish. ”~I recently spent a couple of days here with my girlfriend. It was excellent! The staff were brilliant. They were really helpful and efficient with everything. They were pleasant, friendly and cheerful. Could not fault them in any way. 10/10. The food was delicious. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant with a few drinks. We both had the fillet steak. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection! Again, the staff were very accommodating, with my girlfriend being gluten free, they did everything they could to make sure this wasn't an issue when ordering. We had mushroom soup for lunch the next day and chicken wraps and Chinese beef noodles. Again, delicious! 10/10. The room and facilities were great. Very clean and impressively decorated. Literally could not fault a single thing. A great experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Nothing was too much trouble, even though we were asking for some unusual things (like, can we store our luggage then go for a bike ride then have a shower in the gymn even though we've checked out) The rooms were spacious well appointed and quiet. The breakfast buffet had a good range of foods including great fresh fruits and both often and rice porridge or miso soup.  I will be going back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471970139~“Wonderful weekend getaway”~My partner and I had a wonderful 2 night getaway at the Marriott recently. The deal included breakfast for both days, valet parking, internet, 1 nights dinner and a room with a river view. The hotel room was clean but in desperate need to be refurbish. The king size bed was very comfortable. The view was spectacular so worth the extra cost. All meals were great and the staff were attentive and so friendly. The complimentary bottle of red wine on arrival was delicious. All in all a relaxing time that I would recommend to anyone. Just be prepared for the room being a bit outdated.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471969734~“Above Average ”~My first visit in several years, the Marriott doesn't disappoint. Easy checkin & departure. Rooms are comfortable and large, the Riverview King compensates for being away from home. Directly adjacent the Eagle Street precinct with plenty of fine dining (but a bit of a drunks paradise on Friday & Saturday) the hotel in a pleasant stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471277682~“River view room”~This is a great location, right on the river. Try to get a river view room. The room itself is better than the typical Marriott. Everything was in good condition. Nice pool on the 4th floor level, shaded. The restaurant downstairs was expensive and not that great; they have a weird 2-seatings a night rule and the food was not that great. Room service food was typical. There are great restaurants nearby, down the river walk. We also ate across the street at the Mantra. The Executive Lounge served a good breakfast and was also nice to just hang about with a great view. Good wifi.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_471226004~“A little more upgrade is necessary”~The room needs a bit of refresher as its getting old. The pool was so green and cloudy, even my kids refuse to swim longer in it. Sent review to the hotel but no response at all. Slightly poor in communication.~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~4~nan

review_470774859~“A pretty standard Marriott hotel”~Location is pretty good, though worth asking for a river view as it is much nicer than the city view option. Service is very good and it has all the amenities you would expect from a Marriott. If you get a decent discount off the standard rate then it is a good choice, but if not then it is pretty over priced for a bland chain hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Wow, I arrived later in the evening and was greeted by a very enthusiastic and helpful employee at reception for check-in. She was very helpful and quick and had great advice. The room was beautifully appointed, with an especially beautiful bathroom, which I was not expecting. I had to hurry through breakfast to make my flight, but it was in a lovely restaurant and had wonderful choices, wish I didn't have to rush! The location was superb and I was sad to have only limited time to take a quick walk behind the hotel along the river. Certainly would stay there again if I had a chance!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469237576~“Perfect!”~My family stayed here a week ago and it was amazing. The hotel is obviously of the highest standard with luxury rooms and fantastic amenities. The staff were the best I've encountered in many years of travel. From valet parking and check-in through to house keepers, restaurant staff and management, everyone was extremely friendly, welcoming and ultra professional. We mentioned at some point that it was a significant anniversary for our family- I'm not sure if that was the reason, or if it's just the inherent service focus of the hotel, but things seemed to ramp up even more. We were upgraded to a magnificent executive room and were given gifts and signed congratulations cards from the hotel's general manager. My 2 young sons, in particular were blown away. The swimming pool, gym, day spa and restaurants are second to none and the complimentary breakfast we received didn't disappoint. Overall we were blown away with the service we received. Brisbane should be really proud of this flagship hotel. We can't recommend this place highly enough and will definitely go back when we visit Brisbane City again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469070895~“Comfortable but nothing 'stand out' about it.”~Location was convenient. Room was a little in need of a refurbishment, but it had a nice river view. Nice to have a bath as well as a shower. Good temperature in the room after I set the ait con to my preferred temperature. The bed was too soft for me, but the linen and towels were nice quality. I ordered room service and the chicken breast was really good. The cheese plate was over priced though. A good hotel on the whole, nothing amazing or unique, but not bad.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan

review_466710463~“Outstanding Service ”~We recently spent a baby free night at the Marriott on level 24, in a city view executive room. The most outstanding feature for us was the service, I think this is what sets the Marriott apart from its competitors. The building itself is an older building so doesn't have some of the flashy facilities of a more modern building but does include a small pool, spa, restaurant and large lobby. We booked the Marriott as we got a good deal via Groupon ($299 + $30 for a Saturday night) and chose the Executive option ($100 more than a basic room) as it included Valet parking (normally $55) and use of the Executive Lounge offering tea/coffee, canapés and free breakfast, which we felt justified the additional $100. If you join the Marriott Rewards program you also get complimentary wifi. The location is well within easy walking distance to the gorgeous Eagle Street Pier dining precinct (highly recommend Aria) and a few blocks from Brisbane's Queen Street Mall. Head the other way and you'll quickly find yourself in the Valley. There's a taxi rank downstairs (P2) and City Cats/Taxis are another close by travel option. The room itself was an older classic hotel style, but offered plenty of storage so that we weren't tripping over our baggage, and also had a full bath with seperate shower and mid-size vanity.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466651922~“Good views but rooms tired and nothing for big birthday”~The views of the river are excellent with the length of the river. The rooms are quite tired and could do with an update. The location is good if you want to be on the north end. The breakfast was very good with tea and coffee being served to you directly. It was a decade birthday event for us and I informed the hotel when making the reservation but they did absolutely nothing.~3~3~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan

The room was in really good condition as was the rest of the hotel. The location is great with easy access to the riverside walkway. The staff were really good and very attentive. The only small thing that I would comment on, is sadly the "virtual mini bar" is not the same, or as good as the real thing in the fridge. I would hesitate to say that the hotel would most likely sell more product with a stocked fridge as well.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

We had Executive room which included breakfast and access to Executive lounge - a feature which meant free afternoon canapes and drinks, perfect way to end a day of sightseeing.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463572410~“The service at the Marriott never disappoints....home away from home”~Such wonderful staff. Unfortunately I was unwell during our stay and the restaurant staff noticed I was not dining with my husband and daughter and enquired my whereabouts. They very thoughtfully gave them some soup to take back to me. This is our second stay at the Marriott and we were just as impressed as we were on our first stay. The seafood buffet was lovely. Love the relaxed bar area and the reception staff are very helpful as are the restaurant staff and cleaners. I am keen to return to try your Executive Level experience. Thanks again Marriott.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463405741~“Great Marriott Style”~Fantastic from the velet parking all the way to the Executive floor. Booked this hotel for our Wedding Anniversary and was not disappointed. Chose the Executive floor over looking the Brisbane River and it was a great chose. You have to look at the Executive packages they have on their website as it includes allot of extras. The Executive floor has excess to the lounge.... GET IT.. we didn't even go out for dinner. It included a nice buffet and all the drinks, I mean wine, spirits etc between 5:30pm and 7:30pm. Yep, had a wonderful night. Plus the breakfast on the Executive floor was included. No wonder Marriott has one of the best names in Hotels.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463398348~“My hotel of choice when visiting Brisbane”~The Marriott is always my hotel of choice when visiting a Brisbane. I am greeted and welcomed warmly at check, in the Executive Lounge and in the .Restaurant. I feel like I am greeted by friends whenever I am a guest- it is simply delightful and the reason I always return whether it be for business or to visit family in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463212029~“In and out trip”~If you are taking the Miramar Koala tour, the boat will pick you up right outside the hotel if they are notified ahead of time. Check with the concierge. Saved us a walk. The lounge food was good. The view was nice. The staff is above and beyond excellent.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463196002~“Great service and location”~The best with this hotel is absolutely the great service. From reception to cleaning and breakfast people are great. The location is good close to center and the river bed. The condition of the room could have been a bit better to give excellent rating.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_463121522~“Best in brisbane”~Thought I would try the executive level based on previous reviews. Very impresssed with stylish room with separate shower. Staff were very friendly throughout and the executive lounge is intimate and offers great river views. Usually stay at Sofitel in a club room but this will be my first choice in the future. Only downside is breakfast is only served in the executive lounge till 9am - a little early for me, however breakfast is available at no extra charge in the main restaurant till 10am.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_462588537~“Special visit”~Excellent hotel anything you want just ask and they will do it for you . they make you feel special from the time you walk in tne door, we were upgraded to a river view room just magic to watch the activity on the river and the story bridge light up at night. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462103826~“Great Position , easy Parking entrance too”~Lovely Hotel in City ,Close to River , Rooms good size , great bathroom an very nice facilities . Easy car parking entrance at Howard Street . Only problem very expensive Car parking , The most expensive of any hotel in Australia for a guest parking , most are around 25 - 35 dollars , This Hotel at $54 is a problem for Aussies who need to drive to Brisbane.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461885846~“Exterior looks much more impressive than interior”~The hotel looks quite nice from the outside, but the inside is a bit of a letdown. Upon our initial arrival to the property, I noticed a musty smell in the lobby. We stayed in a room near the Executive Lounge. The room was fine, but a bit dated. Overall, the interior of the hotel is due for renovations.  During the evenings, the entrance to the lobby and lobby itself, seemed extremely dark. This property is in a rather quiet area, a block away from the Brisbane River. It's a short walk to the Queen Street Mall and Fortitude Valley.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461323913~“Had a fabulous time.”~We booked one night in the executive city view suite for my birthday and belated valentine celebrations. One of the lovely staff Sophie organised a birthday surprise which was just the beginning of a wonderful experience. We stayed in 2803 great views even though there are buildings in the way, nice and quite, divine aromatherapy toiletries, comfortable bed and pillows. The executive lounge canapes and drinks was fantastic spotlit for choice, we loved the sweet chili sand crab. The breakfast which is included was great, everything you ask for and of high quality. The pool and spa was very relaxing once again with beautiful views of the river, story bridge and city. I have already booked my next stay. I think this will be a regular weekend away. The service is outstanding and professional at the reception, executive lounge and the valet parking. My partner said it was his favorite hotel we have stayed at. We do a a lot of travel and always stay in 4/5 star accommodation. The worst part was having to leave.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_461038147~“Marriott excellent hotel very professional”~My wife and I had an overnight stay, absolutely first class treatment by the staff, from Valet parking to check in reception the friendly and professional staff really made this a great stay. We stayed in the Executive suite and made use of the lounge that has great views and with free canapés and drinks from 5:30pm. A huge thanks to Rachael who left a bottle of sparkling and chocolates in our room just because I mentioned that I was taking my wife on a date night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460501617~“Brisbane for Business”~Great Marriott property. Very bright and cheerful interior. Great staff. Hotel bar and restaurant were average but acceptable. Gym and pool area were fantastic. The room had a brilliant view of the bridge and river front. Highly recommend and would definitely stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460450952~“Great stay”~Our go to hotel in Brisbane, great staff and facilities, friendly people, great location. We stayed in Club level this trip and the rooms are higher up in the hotel and very quiet. Facilities in the club lounge are ok, but busy on Weekend nights.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460394488~“Brisbane Marriott”~Location Excellent You can walk or take the free or pay boat everywhere. Downtown and China town 10 minute walk. Facilities are excellent. The best part of the hotel is the staff. From the Hotel manager to food service they go out of their way to make in Brisbane wonderful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460329707~“Family stay”~Hi our trip was very nice ... The stay at the Marriott very good .... Service just as good ...  However I felt the service at the front desk  couldn't have been a little more personal ...  Could do with some improvement  Thank you~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460285426~“Business night in Brisbane”~Great hotel, centrally located. I am a regular at the hotel, it is spotlessly clean, well maintained with friendly and efficient staff. If you don't want to eat in hotel there are a number of places to eat within a few metres, however the meals within the hotel are excellent.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458748944~“Weekend Away”~We have just spent a weekend away staying in this hotel as we wanted a little luxury and pampering. The room had a view of the river which was lovely and the bed and pillows were so comfy. I was very disappointed that there were no robes in the room and as you couldn't take the pool towels back to the rooms we had to catch the lift in our swimming costumes. Other people had robes. The toiletries were top quality and the shower was excellent. We had room service dinner on the Friday night and I would not recommend it. I think by the time it got to our room the fish was tough and the chips stone cold. I think charging $55 for parking is a little high as well.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458662055~“Great location on river in Brisbane City”~Lovely hotel, on river next to story bridge. Riverside walk into city centre/parks or via street. Close to all you need in Brisbane centre. Valet parking which works well. late night convenience shops across road.~5~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457813299~“Amazing”~This hotel exceeded expectations, cleam, great service, the pool and gym facilities are great! For those who are traveling for business as I did, the business centre is a little gem. Deron Wang, Front Office Supervisor was great, 5 star for service. Highly recommend and will definitely be coming back. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457721365~“Great hotel for business or seeing the city.”~I was visiting Brisbane to meet with clients in the hotel. Very good suite with separate bedroom from the lounge/meeting room. Good location close to the waterfront, I will stay here again on my next trip.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_457685168~“Great location”~This is a classic hotel with a great location for the riverside, and central to all. Very comfortable beds and linens, and got a nice upgrade to River View. There is a great promenade to the left and right, which gives great views on the river. Club lounge is worth a mention for the great staff: Wai Ling is fantastic, personable, efficient and ensures all 100%. Alvaro is another great member of their team. Charming, professional and efficient. We booked our friends in for one night, and they were given a great upgrade. It's a good business hotel, but fitted our leisure needs too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457512493~“Toowoomba Travellers”~All went so well. Top notch service in particular at breakfast and lunch. Lovely to be looked after by Toshina whose service and friendliness was outstanding. The room was clean and had a great view of the Brisbane Rv and surrounds.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457267748~“Good Hotel”~It was a pleasant stay. The rooms was good and well serviced, the food was good, the location is very central. It was an all and all good experience. I will stay at the Marriott again in the future without a doubt.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457231320~“Fantastic Service”~The hotel was clean and well set out. The food and service was fantastic and the staff go out of their way to make the experience very special. Special mention for extraordinary service provided by Ranbir, Santosh and Carlos!~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_457003759~“Central place to stay, has everything”~We stayed here for an extra long weekend, booking an executive room on the 24th level with club access. The room had a partial city and river view, nice at night looking at the lights, the room was ready for us at check in, plenty big enough for two of us with king bed, very clean and well presented.  The check in was quick and efficient, we then hit the bar while deciding what to do. Good service for the drinks. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast which cost an additional $10 each per meal, we chose this rather than take advantage of the mini buffet in the executive lounge. Reasons for doing so to follow. There was plenty to choose from the buffet, the pancakes were delicious, usual hot food offerings and as usual, cold or just warm baco, even first thing in the morning. Lots of fruit, make your own fresh juices, yoghurts etc. We visited the executive lounge on the first night, it is small, hot and crowded, and the food on offer was mediocre to say the least. So we stayed for a soft drink and left. That's why we decided a mini buffet breakfast was not worth it. Might as well pay $10 downstairs. We tried again on the second night, the food was much better but the lounge is small and crowded, you need to get there at least half an hour early if you want a table. This needs improving. There were people from USA everywhere, am guessing they work for the US Air Force in one form or another judging from conversations, in fact we were the only Aussies there on one of the nights!  All in all, great place to stay, spa/beauty salon worth a visit, close to restaurants along the boardwalk on the riverside, and a couple of minutes walk to the CityCat stop.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_456862299~“Very Unprofessional staff & damaged by clothes and charged by personal card for paid up booking”~I had 2 issues: 1) I was on business travel and my reservation was paid up in advance by the travel agency. I was asked to share a credit card for incidental expenses during check in. On check out I was told that there were no expenses and thus did not receive any invoice. I get back to my home country and get a shock when my credit card statement arrives. I am charged for the entire stay. When I called the Manager I am told that the reservation was not paid in advance and there were double reservations on my name. How unprofessional can they be, why was I not told on check in when I showed the manager on duty the paid up reservation details with the confirmation number. Why was I not asked if I had 2 rooms booked ( if by error) rather than charge !! and why was I not given a copy of invoice on check out if they charged my card. I am now in process of getting this resolved wasting my time. 2) Another incident happened a day prior to my checkout, I had left my clothes in the room to air as they were sweaty and didn't want to pack them as is. When i return in the evening I find that 2 of my trousers and a shirt have stains from oil or some some agent. When I asked the house keeping and Manager on duty they had no explanations on who had entered my room and what caused the stains. It could be some cleaning agent or room freshener some spill caused by a person who would have accessed the room. The Manager after some discussion was kind enough to and tried to get my clothes dry cleaned. But it didn't help and I had to travel with new clothes ruined. Even the morning breakfast service is slow and they keep you waiting for ever for just a coffee pot / milk.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~3~2~nan
