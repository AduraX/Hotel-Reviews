review_479005622~“Good but missed the better views”~The two bedroom apartment had everything you needed but lacked that extra wow. We were in an x07 room which did not have the fantastic up river views. Wifi availability very poor - half an hour per day and then you pay exorbitant fees. Check in procedure for some reason was long and onerous - only one receptionist on duty. The parking is horrendous. We had a large 7 seater rental car which was nigh impossible to get in or out of the thin garage driveways and the few thin parking spots for hotel guests - others left for residents. On the plus side clean, good beds and central to tourist requirements.~3~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_478690610~“Amazing Views”~We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment on the 29th floor. WOW what a stunning view both day and night.  The apartment was very clean and the beds were super comfortable.  The location was fantastic. Convenience store 2 doors down, supermarket was 2 blocks over, an easy walk to the ferry terminal and great selection of restaurants along the river.  Reception staff were very helpful and accommodating.  I would definitely staff here again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477913615~“Great place Good location Great service”~We had a great stay and with the excellent location one could not ask for more. Staff very friendly. Apartment fully equipped and for the tariff charged have never seen better. I doubt you would find much better than here and will return. Oh the beds are great, water pressure the best I've seen and two TVs a god send. One small thing. Change your coffee sachets. Not that good but all other amenities were great.  Keep on keeping on. Well done staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477661361~“great location”~Really greta location but felt a bot like a backpacker set-up when we walked into the small reception area. Staff were either only 1 person at any given time at reception and generally very busy. Great price. If we had paid any more we would have been dissapointed as its an average properpty.The pool area is very 'squeezed-in' and not very inviting. Views from our room was great. Comfort of bedding: very dissapointing...the pillow covers felt harsh on my skin. Spacious though.Shower had black algea.~3~3~4~2~3~2~3~nan

review_475101343~“Good Location”~The Oaks Felix St is very handy to the river ferries and also the city centre so very well located. Some rooms have nice views and there is parking in the building (for an extra charge). Our room had a kitchen, washing machine and dryer and a view over the city. It also had a nice balcony but the city is very noisy so we had to keep the windows closed at night to try to keep the noise down. When we did this, the airconditioner could not cope. Luckily it wasn't during the really hot weather because the air was quite "stuffy". The room would need either a new air con or a supplementary one in the bedroom for next summer. The only other problem was the terrible smell in the hallway that lasted the entire 3 days/nights we were there. Either the carpets need shampooing or there needs to be some ventilation and/or a deodoriser. It was very unpleasant. Check-in and check out were easy and everything else worked well.~4~3~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472775720~“Great location and apartments”~We had an apartment on 25th floor with river view. Very nice, spacious layout with great little balcony with view of river, Story Bridge, and Eagle St Pier, short walk to everything including gardens. Very well-equipped kitchen, we did breakfast only but could have done most anything. One thing needed repair and it was done promptly. Two minor issues: 1. A/C unit in living room only, nice quiet unit but to get the bedroom down the hall cool required making the living room frigid. 2. Wifi is very good except supports max of 3 devices. We travel with a mobile and a tablet apiece, so occasionally had to log something off. We didn't need to use more than one apiece at a time, but it was a minor annoyance to logout/login and seemed a bit silly. Again, great place that I highly recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472492213~“Views of the storey bridge are lovely”~i would rate as good the views are really nice from this hotel and you have some of the best restaurants like pony within 5 minute walk. The room itself was a little tired looking even though we paid extra for a deluxe apartment with view. Beds were nice and the apartment was ok in size just would benefit from some updating. Facilities were ok...we used the spa.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471941126~“Weekend in Brisbane ”~Weekend in Brisbane. Oaks on Felix offers good value rates and location to city attractions, facilities and the river is great. Rooms spacious however at the point of needing some TLC. Signage and street presence both require some work, as entrance easily missed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471810824~“Pleasant suprise”~Arrived not really knowing anything about this accommodation that had been booked for us as part of a wedding party. Surprised with spaciousness and rooms!

review_471271386~“Needs an update.”~Stayed at the Oaks felix for 4 nights and it was an enjoyable stay but the hotel rooms could definetly do with a fresh coat of paint and updating. The hotel parking is definetly not the best, limited spaces and if you need to go down past the first level of parking it is extremely tight, so much you can see all the scratches on the walls and concrete pillars. It is also $25 a night which is overpriced given the layout of the car park. I also feel like there are too many rules in the hotel, report to reception if you're a visitor (how the get up to reception from the car park I don't know as you need a swipe to access the lifts), keep the aircon at 24•, ensuring the garbage is taken out and dishwasher is on so you don't incur additional fees etc. Now to the positives! Great staff at check in, shop downstairs which I believe is 24 hours, close to eagle st pier, coffee within a 1 minute walk, great view from the hotel room of partial bridge and Brisbane river.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471232881~“Watch your bank account”~We were provided vouchers for accommodation in the city and we chose to stay at 'Oaks on Felix' due to its convenient location. We booked and fully paid for our accommodation the week we were due to stay through the Oaks booking site. We then went to the trouble in calling reception and confirming that the room we were booked into was a King sized mattress and not two single beds pushed together. This was confirmed over the phone. When we checked in, we were told that car parking was not included and that it was an additional $25. We were also obliged to provide security of $75 in pre-authorisation on our card. This is standard procedure and we were aware that this would occur. However this amount should NOT be drawn from the account but be held as a pending withdrawal, to be cancelled following our checkout.  This was not the case and it was drawn as a payment from our account. We had to contact 'Oaks on Felix' and request that this money be returned to our account. We were told that it would take 3-5 working days. When we insisted that this was not acceptable, the money was banked back into our account that same day, which it was. When we went to the room, we found that we had been checked into a room with two single beds pushed together and not the King that we had confirmed. After we got home, we checked our account and found that we had been charged twice for our accommodation! We NEVER presented our card for this transaction and this money was taken from our account WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION. This is fraudulent behavour by the this Hotel and on this ground alone, we would not recommend this accommodation to anyone who is looking to stay in the city. When we called 'Oaks on Felix' and advised them of this occurrence, they agreed that this was wrong and agreed to bank the money back into our account and that the staff member would be 'addressed'. My wife and I have worked in hotels in the past and understand how the booking systems work.  This behavour is fraudulent and therefore theft on the basis that the money was drawn from our account without our knowledge or authorisation, If there was doubt of payment, the staff at reception who made the transaction should have checked the record on the booking and at the very least, asked if we had already paid. Finally, 'Oaks on Felix' informed us that the money would be returned to our account in 3-5 working days. The staff member we contacted in relation to this incident informed us that the delay in the money going into our account was due to the actions of the bank. We contacted our bank and they told us that the money would be in our account in 24 hours, once the transaction had been initiated by the hotel. Needless to say, we will not be staying again at 'Oaks on Felix' and we will not be recommending their services.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_470701739~“Disgusted”~We'd been gofted a lunch cruise on kookaburra queen which turned out to be fabulous by the way. Decided to stay the night at closest best accommodation. The position was ideal but the standard of cleanliness disgusting! Will never choose this place again nor recommend it! Couldnt wait to leave in the morning! Our appartment looked like it may have been a crime scene at one stage and the cleaning never done properly! Stains on curtains! Bathroom dirty! Just yuk!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469770856~“Comfort in the city”~I recently visited Brisbane and decided to book a one bedroom apartment for my overnight stay. The Oaks on Felix was situated close to everything that Brisbane has to offer; shops, bars, restaurants, cafes and the ferry to Southbank. The apartment was clean, spacious and very comfortable with a balcony to enjoy the lights of Brisbane. Everything was supplied in the apartment so all I had to bring with me was my clothes and a small amount of food for breakfast in the morning! I would recommend the Oaks on Felix to anyone that wants to stay in the city but within a few minutes walking distance of all the best that Brisbane offers! Great price too!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_468655521~“Great location and vlaue”~Stayed here a few times now for both work and pleasure. The location is perfect, on the river and not far from everything. Coffee shops and convenience store very close. Eagle Street Pier next door has some great restaurants. Parking out the front when you check in can be difficult. There is a loading zone but its often full and you need to park illegally. Easiest if there's two people and one waits in the car (to move it if need be) whilst the other runs in and gets a temporary key to access the hotel car park just around the corner and then check in. The decor and quality are pretty much the same as most of the apartment complexes in the CBD (eg the Mantras or other Oaks). Rooms are well laid out with acceptable furnishings (not top quality but consistent with what you're paying) and both the river view and city view type rooms are good. All have good outlooks. Beds are comfortable but most bathrooms need a major refurb (cracked tiles with mould). Housekeeping can be a bit hit and miss. One time great, the next time average. Prices are competitive and often cheaper then other comparable properties in the CBD. We will stay here again mainly because of the friendly helpful nature of staff, its location and views.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_465958336~“Great Location”~We recently stayed at the Oaks on Felix in Brisbane. We booked a 1 bedroom apartment on the 32nd floor. The view was simply breathtaking. The apartment was nicely furnished and clean. The location undoubtedly terrific and within walking distance to everything. However the staff wasn't very friendly or helpful. There were no hand towels, shower gel or body lotion, no kitchen towels, no cleaning cloth to wipe kitchen bench or table, only one hair shampoo and conditioner for 2 people.  I know, it sounds very much like a 1st world problem but we've stayed at other 4* star hotels and everything was provided and if not it was delivered to the room rather than, come and get it at the reception. Not even bottled water was provided. The pictures of the pool made it look very inviting but it was very small and the area just fitted 5 deck chairs considering the size of the hotel. We didn't end up going there at all. It has been rated 4.2 out of 5 by trip advisor but I personally would down grade it to a 4 out of 5. I don't think we will book there again.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_465477428~“What a good place to stay!”~We thought that we would never ever stay at Oaks apartments again (after afwul experience in Sydney Oaks Goldsbrough), but wanted to give them another chance anyway.. and it was defenitely worth it! This Oaks in Brisbane was totally different and from the different planet! We got a beaufiful room with a balcony facing the riverbanks! The view was amazing from the upper floors where we stayed. The living room and kitchen were huge. The staff (especially the lady, who welcomed us) was friendly. The location was so good - just walking distance to "everywhere" and the ferrystation as well. Only thing that we didn't like was the stuff left in the kitchen cupboard... the adult sfuff, which belonged to the bedroom... Bet those who left the stuff are laughing now, as their prank succeeded and the cleaners didn't find that, but we did... Will stay in this place next time as well!~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464456247~“Disappointed and the place is in desperate need of a refurb. ”~We came here for a weekend away to enjoy a night out at the eagle street pier. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location and view if your lucky enough to get one. Bathrooms old dirty rundown. We upgraded to a room with a view after being disappointed with our first room that looked out at a construction site with a dodgey balcony and half broken chair. The upgraded room was smaller and stingy old and rundown rusty bathroom and kitchen fixtures and fittings. We paid more for a smaller and backpacker type room. Again the location is great the view is great if you ask for it but was a little worried about the hygiene and cleaning standards just by the condition of the room. I noticed the blankets looked used dirty and old. I was too scared to use them in fear of bed bugs or some other cruddy parasite that may have been laying dormant from the last 1000 people who used it. Definitely wouldn't use this chain of hotel again. They may have better rooms but considering we paid for an upgrade I felt Id stayed in better hotels in 3rd world countries Ive visited. We have stayed in so many other hotel in brisbane with views and around the same price with much better and higher standards. So this is on our blacklist for sure.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464419214~“great location”~We stayed at the Oaks on Felix as we were seeing The Pixies at Riverstage and also my husband and I kid free for the night!. Great location just walking distance to botanical gardens and the eagle st peir. Only limited parking in front of hotel to check in but staff helpful (Dawn) to give us a temporary swipe key to get into hotel parking which I recommend at only $25 per day and it is convenient. We have an older style Toyota Prado which is 2 metres tall and the parking was fine. ( we have had issues at other hotels where we haven't fitted our car in and Valet parking parked offsite but still charged full price) We had room 291 which was fine had a view of the city and botanical gardens and river.. One bedroom apartment has great kitchen with full size fridge, microwave, toaster, kettle... Balcony, tv in lounge and bedroom which both had some Foxtel channels but bonus of 3 movie channels which was great. Bed was King size. Bathroom bit small and water had weird smell to begin with but who cares really as your not spending your time in the bathroom! Also had a laundry in the bathroom so that would be helpful if staying a few days. All in all would definitely stay here again. enjoy x~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463905599~“Wish I Could Give 4 Stars but Can't”~We recently stayed 4 nights so we could go to two Bruce Springsteen concerts. The apartment was lovely and large with an amazing view of the river and bridge. The location was great with a short walk to the train station and easy access to a grocery story, restaurants, bars and shopping.  The balcony was large with table and chairs. The beds were comfortable. So with all of these great things going on, why not more stars??? First, the housekeeping was lax. The first day was great but day two was very poor. We thought it was a fluke but day three was worse. When we invited management up to look, they agreed. Secondly, the appliances were so old, the symbols were worn off so we couldn't tell whether we were turning the stove up or down and we never did get the dishwasher out. Thirdly, the lint filter on the dryer kept falling off and lint dust went all over the bathroom. Finally, we tried to order food one night. The menu is a third-party organization that delivers from lots of different restaurants. Sounds great except that the menu was old and a number of restaurants were closed. The organization told us they had delivered new menus to the Oaks but apparently they decided not to put them into the rooms. Made the room service ordering frustrating. Yes, these are not big things in an of themselves but getting higher star comes down to attention to detail. This is where the Oaks Felix needs to improve on and if they do, they can easily be the great place to stay that they should be.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_463325013~“Very very average”~Not sure where other reviewers on here normally stay, but the Oaks Felix is decidedly average.  The good: - Very large apartments.  - Good sized kitchen, small bathrooms (but functional) and living space. - Good air-conditioning (in each room) - Location is good, particularly if you're working around the area.  The bad: - Very tired/dated. - Common areas smell of vomit or garbage. Not just a bit, but seriously overpowering.  - Friendly, but seriously unhelpful front desk staff. No idea where basic things are in the area. Chatting amongst themselves re: other trip advisor reviews. Hint, if your company values the opinions of people on this site, it's a good idea not to talk loudly among yourselves about the views that people give. We were all laughing at the views of one of the staff - pretty unprofessional.  Not a place I'll be sending my team to again.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_462426409~“Breath taking view”~Tis was our first apartment we stayed in before travelling around Australia. The apartments were modern, spacious and the view of the bridge at night from the balcony was stunning. The lady on reception was very welcoming and helpful and other staff we encounted were equally as nice.  The only 2 points that let this place is down is the poor quality of the lifts, too infrequent and had a strange smell for our stay. Also the door lock was broken so couldn't lock from the inside during the night. These were minor issues and I would not hesitate to stay here again!.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_458550995~“Unbeatable Location”~Had a great stay, fantastic location right next to the river. Nice to have a kitchen to cook breakfast.

review_458173844~“Very nice but limited”~The Oaks proved very nice apartment style accommodation and well located with the exception of dining choice (no in house restaurant or bar) which is limited to an eastern selection unless you are prepared to walk a little distance. The home delivery option from the room is by an external provider and our meal took two hours to arrive. Level of cleaning is average with our return one day to discover a dirty cleaning cloth left in our bathroom sink. All in all, a comfortable stay, a little on the expensive side rate wise for what the property offers. Reception staff friendly and helpful. New pillows are definitely required!~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458023334~“Basic”~Cleanly presented but this is as basic as they come and tired around the edges. Shampoo, conditioner and soap bars. No additional amenities. Fan but no air con in the bedroom - only the living area. I was also travelling as a single woman and couldn't be sure that the door was locked so had someone come up and check. There isn't a chain lock on the door either. It may not bother other travellers but women do need to think of these things. Good location near Riverside restaurants and business offices.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457419851~“Comfort with a view”~I booked one night when attending a business event as I wanted to get a good nights sleep and not have to travel that late. It was a good decision as I was totally refreshed the next day. I woke to a wonderful view of the Brisbane river and Kangaroo Point cliffs etc... the KS bed was very comfy (although it was joined in the middle). All other amenities were clean and working well. The only negative thing was that someone had set the alarm clock for midnight and when it started buzzing I was woken and had to get up to turn it off - this is not my idea of humour, but some people must think themselves very funny.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457236693~“Spacious, clean, good for long term stay”~Stayed on 33rd floor. Had a nice view of the river. Checkin was no fuss, efficient and friendly. Paid about $150 for Saturday night. It is 600m walk to central station. There is a convinience store underneath and a Japanese restuatant (which was closed ). There is a 20m? Lap pool and a smallish gym with a concept 2 rowing machine, one treadmill, and one elliptical trainer. The room was cool. It had a kitchenette with a stove and fridge. Within walking distance to the mall.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456531284~“Super view and apartment ”~Spent a very comfortable three nights at the oaks felix st . On arrival we had been given an upgrade apartment with amazing views of Storey bridge and Eagle street. The Oaks is situated in a great position to explore Brisbane and next to the botanical gardens and river .

review_456331203~“Great location but improvement needed.”~Having stayed at several "Oaks" properties, including two other Oaks properties in Brisbane CBD, I was in a position to be able to compare. I have to say some of the other Oaks properties have really nailed it and Felix street could do well with a sleepover at the competitors place. Little things add up. Laundry door didn't shut...clothes horse too big, thick dust on ceiling fan in bedroom and no air-con in there, carpets need serious cleaning or replacement. The view was great, however the balcony was really dirty. The smoke alarm kept going off when we cooked breakfast, even though there was no smoke and we had the balcony door open, rangehood fan on (which made a horrendous sound) and air con to try and stop it. There was a peculiar smell in the corridor from the lift to both our room and the pool area. The fact that the corridors are not air-conditioned may well be the reason. I did wonder about the airflow. On the bright side, the staff are friendly and the car parking quite cheap for the city. $25.00 per night. The kitchen was quite well set up although chopping board would have been handy. Excellent location being so close to Eagle Street Pier. Great restaurants and bars within an easy stroll and the river with ferries to take you both up and downstream. All in all not a bad stay, however with closer attention to maintenance and cleaning this property could improve.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_455759696~“Lovely sunset views and a good night's sleep”~Note to drivers: there is no check-in parking so you may have to park in a loading zone or perform a similar dodgy on-street manouvre in order to get your parking access sorted out. Luckily for me I had someone else travelling with me who could stay in the car and "do the block" if necessary while I checked us both in. This could be a real hassle in peak hours especially as you're in the middle of a busy CBD traffic zone around this hotel.  Having said that we loved it and would happily return; our apartment was huge with a handy kitchen/dining area. Also convenient was our laundry/bathroom (shower only) combo.  We especially loved the balcony (32nd floor), which offered a decent glimpse of the Brisbane River and views over the city to Mt Cootha/West; it was a perfect evening drinks terrace! This also enabled us to have fresh air overnight rather than having to run aircon all night. We both enjoyed a good sleep in the comfortable king bed (with TV in both the bedroom and the loungeroom). Ideal for our few nights stay.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_453204437~“Lovely hotel in Brisbane CBD”~We stayed 5 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment on the 33rd floor. Being mid-January, it was hot and muggy outside, but the rooms were comfortable. We are a family of 4 with 2 young kids. The car park is difficult to manoeuvre in a medium-large car, but never failed to get a car space. The apartment was small but fine. There was a musty / mouldy smell in the hallway of our floor and in the gym / pool area. Our shower had some black mould in it, and the kitchen ware (noticeable on glassware and a few bowls) were dirty upon arrival. Other than that we had a wonderful stay, and are already planning to return again! The view was amazing, the air conditioners in the room were very welcome in the January heat, the in-room washer and dryer were handy with young kids, and the kitchen was big enough to cook for a family of 4 each night. The pool was suitable for people of all ages, and big enough for a few families to enjoy at the same time (although it was smaller than I had expected and could do with more shade over the top). The staff were kind, obliging and so helpful. The location of the hotel is ideal - a short walk to restaurants, entertainment, shopping district, transport, the river and even South Bank! We have already recommended this hotel to family and friends, and are looking forward to our next holiday with them!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_452288757~“Good family appartment but wasnt clean”~Great family apartment as there was plenty of room including three bathrooms and a laundry room in a 2 bedroom apartment. However, on arrival the bin in the kitchen was full and smelt of old rubbish and also the master bath had several pubic hairs in it. Also we paid $89 for parking for one night in an offsite carpark 5 minutes away as the main carpark closest was full. There was no mini bar or restuarant either.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452239256~“Handy to everything and a magnificent view......but....”~Recently had three nights at Oaks on Felix....the apartment was on the 29th floor.....the views were superb especially in the evening.. Althought the apartment was geting a little tired...we were dissappointed in the general cleanliness on a daily basis.. On arrival, the glass topped dining table was smeared and grubby as was the coffee table ...In the bathroom the shower had black mould between the tiles and the soap tray had rings from the previous guests..The bed was comfy and daily fresh towels were lovely..but cleanliness is the first thing one notices on arrival..  Strong cooking odours permeated the hall ways leading to the lifts....and in the heat it was quite noticeable daily.. The staff were friendly..but a stand out member was DAWN who is a real asset to the Oaks Group...~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan

A booking for 4 rooms was made. Two of us were on one level, others were on other levels higher up. Because of the secure nature of this motel, none of us could go up to the other levels as our access passes locked us out of any levels above the ones we were staying on. From my room I had a lovely view of the buildings to the east of my balcony and could only catch a brief glimpse of the river to the north. Family members all arrived at different times and none of us could check in until the holder of the credit card on the booking arrived. I don't think I will be staying here again any time soon.~2~nan~3~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_448732364~“Great views and amenities”~We were looking for a place with 2 bedrooms in Brisbane and among the many, opted for Oaks Felix on the basis of price, location and amenities. We weren't disappointed. Great location near the river with views across to Storey Bridge. Heaps of space. Adequate lap pool. Two separate bathrooms. Half hour free internet could have been more but better than nothing. Lots of restaurants close by too. All in all, well worth the money.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_448668224~“The Oaks Felix”~There are some really good aspects and difficult aspects about The Oaks. The rooms are comfortable and reasonably spacious. The beds are just the best . Firm mattresses for good back support and just no back ache. Soft mattresses are just the worst for backs. Pool and gym are great. The position is truly excellent near the river and countless cafes and restaurants. The worst aspect of the oaks is the parking. Trying to get an average size car into the car park is just insane. The ramps are so narrow that it is almost impossible to turn into and out of the ramps. The walls show the difficulties, scrapes. Whoever designed that car park must have never driven a car. The parking situation is unacceptable.  Besides the parking the accommodation is excellent and we have stayed there a couple of times now.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_448454975~“Perfect location”~Great apartment on 33rd floor with magical views day and night right up the river to the Storey Bridge. We didn't want to leave and will definitely return. Very friendly and helpful reception staff and keen to please. Nothing was a bother. Our apartment was clean and modern with every amenity to make our stay extremely enjoyable. The beds were very comfortable and the linen was clean and fresh. The water pressure in the shower was amazing and very therapeutic, better than a spa. The Oaks Felix location is so close to everything, and shops and restaurants are all within walking distance and a block away are the botanical gardens which provide a very picturesque pathway through the gardens alongside the river to the Goodwill Bridge and an easy amble over the river to Southbank. We never took the car out of the garage for our entire eight night stay. We loved everything about our visit and would recommend it as a great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447918698~“Great Apartment, Great Position”~We had three days in Brisbane to have a look around. We had a one bedroom apartment (actually 2 bedroom - 2nd one locked) with a large living room/kitchen area. A fantastic courtyard. They had their own secure underground parking $25 per day. We were about two metres from the Eagle Street Pier precinct.  First afternoon after a swim, we picked up a ferry at the Riverside pier and went as far as we could up river and return - about 1 hour. The first night there after a swim we wandered 200 metres down to the Eagle Street Pier and had a couple of drinks at the River Bar and then onto Georges Seafood Greek rest for a great meal and service. The apartment had air con in the lounge and the bedroom. It was central to everything. Staff were good. We didn't have a problem Will use this one again for sure~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_447908491~“Walking distance to Riverside eateries and a couple of blocks from the Botanical Gardens”~We 3 spent five lovely days over the holidays in a 2-bedroom unit. Our 24th floor unit had gorgeous river views and the King + Queen bed configuration we had requested on our online booking direct with the hotel. There was an ensuite with shower as well as a bathroom with bathtub (bliss). Kitchen was well equipped - but had to get Maintenance up to show me how to operate the dishwasher - and we never managed to turn the oven on ... but didn't really need to use it as the gas hotplates and microwave did everything necessary. Air conditioning unit in the main area worked efficiently - and ceiling fans in the bedrooms helped circulate the air. There was a washer & dryer, but we didn't use them. Found everything most satisfactory - staff most helpful. Parking beneath the building worked well as we could come and go as it suited us using supplied token (extra cost for daily parking well worth it). Inclusive WiFi ran the whole time :) Oaks on Felix gave us a lovely break away and I truly enjoyed sitting on the balcony on Christmas Day reading a book.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_446823965~“very convenient location”~Location perfect for city shopping, close to restaurants, convenience store, taxi stand. the beds are very comfy, linen very clean, lots of spare blankets, quilts, pillows, all extra linen plastic wrapped sealed for hygiene, allowed 2 visiting friends vehicles to park in hotel parking for free. the only negative was the parking for our hire car in the hotel was $25 per night and the parking area was very tight.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
