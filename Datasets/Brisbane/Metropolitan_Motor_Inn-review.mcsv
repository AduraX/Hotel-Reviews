review_471367694~“Good hotel”~Nice hotel, good value for money - close (walking distance) to metro station (Central - airport line) and the city center. It’s all the way up a hill. My room was nice, with TV and free internet. Front desk is friendly and well organized. There is a small in-house restaurant, which I have not tried.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_471001671~“Just look at all the bad reviews......and they are right!”~Never again. All the comments about rude front counter staff are true. We found the booking in process very uncomfortable. It was more like and inquisition than a welcoming! Not to mention the room check they do before refunding your room bond the next morning. We are middle aged world travelers NOT teenage punks! There was no respect shown by staff who clearly thought they were doing us a favour for letting us stay! Secondly.....we asked for a one hour delay in checkout.....$30 charge for one hour! We asked for a few hours of carparking.....$30 again despite it being a sunday and the carpark was 90% empty. The roof top used to be a lovely place to enjoy a cigarette and an evening drink.....not any more....surveillance cameras and threats of on the spot fines. There is a smoking area to the side but it has hideously uncomfortable furniture and no shade at all during the day. All in all, very unpleasant. I have noted how defensive the manager is in her replies to these reviews. My advice to her is to take the comments on board. Ive never seen a hotel with so many bad reviews! 33! :-(~1~1~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_467430479~“Hidden Gem in Brisbane's CBD”~First of all let's state that if you want to stay in a super flash Hotel with super modern architecture and perfectly manicured rooms..this is NOT the hotel for you. If you are after a comfortable, quiet hotel at a fantastic location close to Brisbane CBD at a fantastic price with amazing "old school" friendly staff, you can NOT to past Metropolitan Motor Inn.  From check in to check out the experience is always friendly and easy. We have stayed there 3 times for a total of 10 nights and have never had a bad night. The beds are comfortable, food in the restaurant is fine and the coffee is great also. A few cosmetic scratch and bruises around the rooms and elevators etc but If you can look past that, you'll have a great stay. We WILL be back!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466636203~“Excellent value, no-frills accommodation”~We normally use a nearby backpackers for a short stay in Brisbane, but for a few bucks more this place wins hands down. Our ample size first floor double room on the Hope Street side was well away from any traffic noise and featured a large comfortable bed, TV, balcony and efficient air con unit. The bathroom had been recently refurbished but some electrical fittings throughout the apartment remain in slightly random positions. The reception staff are lovely (we left out bags in the 'VIP room' after check out while heading out for a stroll around Roma Street Gardens) and you get free wi-fi, although the signal strength was a little poor, plus some fresh milk for the fridge. We tried the in-house restaurant, which is large but a little characterless, as you get a discount for the big breakfast. It was well worth it however, the serve being a big tasty plateful. There is some free on site parking as well if you book it in advance and being situated so close to Central Station, the Metropolitan really is an excellent value, no-frills accommodation option for whatever type of traveler you may be.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464615547~“Adele stay,”~So I stayed here last night for Adele, I paid for a Queen Deluxe the room was alright, but the elevator only fits 5 people at a time, and isn't 24 hours it's closed between 9:30pm-6am & as someone with a disability I wasn't happy when I get back at 11:45 last night. The toilet in my room hardly flushed, the bathroom doesn't have an exhaust fan so it gets quite warm in there, the aircon felt like to me it wasn't really on unless I walked into the room or out from the bathroom. The free wifi is quite crap, it's slow & pointless. Some of the reception are nice but there was one lady that was quite rude especially on the phone when I rang 3 days ago to try & downgrade my room ( didn't end up having to tho ) told me I couldn't downgrade from a Deluxe because that's the lowest they have but they had a Queen basic, but it was booked out. But overall the stay was just average~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463317130~“Dont judge a book by its cover”~Chose this hotel for great location and free parking. My wife and I tend to. stay in 4star hotels so this was a variation induced by weak uk pound.The staff were incredibly friendly. The parking was great. The Breakfast great value at 8 Aus dollar . The room was modern and clean , air conditioned and had a fridge. It was quite noisy from the road outside but many central city hotels are the same. Incredible value for money. Although looks less appealing than plush 4 star hotels this was great for an overnighter in Brisbane. Easy walk to the river. try it~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461577443~“Damn good stay!”~Pretty damn good for only 58-70 dollars a night, room was big and clean, NOTE:shower, no bath tub and only a fridge with our single queen room (didn't bother us none:)) The service was friendly and helpful, and needing to stay extra nights and be available really helped the trip There was also a restaurant inside!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_460133150~“Nice hotel”~Stayed here for 2 nights and it was great.  Staff were really friendly and there's free wifi.  Rooms are spacious and air conditioned and not too far from the city centre.  Stayed here on a budget and would say it was definitely worth the money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459572801~“One night stay”~Booked hotel for 1 night to attend rugby 10's, staff were very helpful and willing to make suggestions and help with our enquiries. The noise from the hallway and other rooms was not very well concealed so if you struggle with this then it may ruin your stay, but for us it wasn't a problem. Free wifi and free parking, and able to extend for a decent price.~3~4~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_459563090~“AMAZING STAY”~Right from the time we got there nothing but amazing service friendly staff great rooms tasty food.

Thank you again x~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_450531563~“Great location, clean and tidy.”~Our first stay at this motor inn and we are very impressed with the location. Only a short walk down the hill to Queen Street Mall and all Brisbane has to offer. The bed was comfortable and the room was appointed with everything you need. The rate was cheap and even included free parking. Would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449953630~“Well priced”~Stayed here for a few nights when we needed a place in Brisbane at short notice. Clean rooms, good for a young family, central location. Car park difficult for 4wds to enter/exit but it is free so another good feature. Overall not bad for what we needed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448655931~“Terrible”~Terrible. Stayed for 2 weeks and the whole time the only cleaning done was making our beds (pulling the sheets up, not actually changing the linen). Not once was the bathroom even wiped down, mopped and the rooms were not once vacuumed.  Also glad I had a small car because the park was horribly small and only around 20 car parks for the entire hotel.  Stayed over the Christmas period and understandably the rooms were not done on Christmas but there were also not done for 3 days after, so there was rubbish everywhere and no fresh towels for all that time.  Not happy and will definitely not recommend~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448653650~“Pleasent”~stayed here for just over a week, as you arrive it is welcoming and the staff are helpful, there is a security bond of 200, no problem, which we received back on departure. we were on the 2nd floor overlooking the street inside our room there were 4 single beds and a queen which were were average on comfort there were 6 of us, as we were there over the xmas new year times lots of things were closed, the restaurant in the hotel was not open during our time there so iwe were always looking for d decent place to eat, (we recommend Fat Boy 5 min away). we only had our beds pulled up when made, no cleaning at all, of the floors or bathroom, the shower was great, I would have thought the bathroom would get a clean only clean towels, but not for the holiday period at that time we had no one came in at all for 4 days no clean at all, had to reuse dirty towels and buy toilet paper. there was parking you need a voucher for this and be quick or you will miss out and need to street park, we were lucky to get a park. the advantage to this hotel is its close to the CBD I may need to move our Christmas holidays to July as most eateries and other amenities are closed.  we were a bit disappointed we couldn't eat at the hotel and the cleaners didn't clean the room , changing towels and pulling up sheets is not cleaning ,~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_443172959~“Always fantastic Value”~Metro is a home away from home for us, the ladies on reception are always friendly, rooms spotlessly clean, great decor and very reasonably priced, the central location very convenient to the Queen st mall for shopping and arterials north and south for the beaches.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_436025487~“Great location and value for money in Spring Hill on the edge of the ,CBD”~Over the last 18 months I have stayed at the Metropolitan Motor Inn 3 times mid-week on visits to Brisbane. It is located on a busy Corner, however my rooms have not been noisy. It is an easy walk to the CBD and the Central Railway Station. It is great value for money and with undercover parking available at $10.00 for the night (out by 1000Hrs). The $8.00 cooked breakfast which is available if staying the night (collect the voucher when checking in) was good and included Bacon ,eggs ,a hash brown, tomato and toast . It doesn't get much better. The rooms have been recently refurbished, including new bathrooms, they were very clean and have comfortable beds . I have always found the staff friendly, helpful and efficient. I would make special mention of the receptionist Maureen who did an excellent job on check-in.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434124849~“A Hidden Gem!”~On first looks you may think this motel is a run down disaster however once you have aired your room you will notice the spotlessly clean room! Our room had a new bathroom- basic shower but great use of space. The other hidden surprise is their restaurant- offering great specials and home style meals!  It's close to specialist doctors. Will definitely recommend this motel to family and friends!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434104436~“Great value”~Don't be put off by the older style architecture, this hotel has everything you need. Its obviously be refurbished recently. The bed was comfortable, air-conditioned, decent shower, & free wifi all for $89. The in-house restaurant was an unexpected bonus. 3 course set menu for $24, coconut prawns, salmon main and bread & butter pudding.  Staff are helpful and polite and the off street parking is free. I'll definitely be back ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433024006~“Enjoyed our stay”~Our room was great! No traffic noise. Comfortable bed. Bathroom was spacious and clean. Close enough to walk to the CBD and check out the city and Southbank.

review_427061620~“Worst hotel ever!”~1. Room smelt really badly.. so badly I was gagging when I first walked in. Also really noisy!! 2. The guest hotel guide that was inside my room said that room service dinner was between 5.30 and 8.30pm. I rung room service at 8.15pm and was informed the chef had gone home because he "needed to be finished BY 8.30pm".... That is not what the hotel guide says. And then, I was forced to order out and travel to collect my dinner elsewhere. Really unimpressed about this. If the guide says 5.30 - 8.30 then that is what it should be - I had planned my evening around these "open hours". After a long day of driving and working, the last thing I want to do is drive to get dinner because the chef couldn't be bothered to finish his shift.  3. Requested a wakeup call due to issues with my alarm on my phone. DID NOT RECEIVE WAKEUP CALL.  If you're in town on business, this is NOT the place to go. The hotel and the staff are unreliable and do not even try to make the experience a positive one. I will not stay here again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424236228~“Unprofessional managers!”~POSITIVES: Motel was old but had recently been refurbished. The bed was comfortable, Wi-fi was good, parking was free and we found the receptionists at the desk pleasant and helpful. NEGATIVES: Unfortunately the room that we had been given had an unpleasant smell so we asked for a change. It should have been easy enough for the receptionist to just allocate another room. However she said that she had to call the manager to deal with it! The manager said she couldn't smell anything unpleasant and that she had a sensitive nose! Rather an unprofessional response I thought as it suggested that I had to have been wrong! We insisted so she gave us another room, but it was very noisy as it was near the street.  There were also a couple of other things that came up during our 2 night stay which were dealt with by her and her husband in a far from professional manner! There are many ways to resolve issues with a CLIENT and being ARGUMENTATIVE with them is surely not the best way to do it?? It seems like they do not have any POSITIVE strategies on how to speak to CLIENTS to RESOLVE and diffuse problems!!  We won't be going back or telling our friends to go there either. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423635044~“The Staff are so friendly.”~Our stay was a rather long one and the Staff are so friendly, I haven't experienced such a welcoming atmosphere at a stay for a long time. They were also very helpful with check in and out times. The location was perfect , The rooms were very comfortable . The top deck was very nice to sit out on .~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_419702414~“Good value ”~I stayed here for one night. It's a short walk from the city and is very affordable. I did read reviews on here about how it's noisy, so I was prepared for that. Even with ear plugs it was still pretty noisy, it's on a busy corner. I had breakfast in the restaurant, good value! The staff were very friendly and let me keep my car in the car park for a few hours after checkout. Be warned, the car park is tricky to manoeuvre, very tight squeeze, even with a small sedan.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415120663~“Great value”~A telephone booking gave us a $10 discount off the already low price of $99. Our room was good, with a 32` TV and a shower with plenty of hot water. The receptionist, Ruth highly recommended their Dining room so we gave it a go and weren't disappointed. My wife had the $24 3 course special and I chose a steak. Both meals were delicious. After a sound sleep we enjoyed the $8.00 breakfast, bacon, eggs, tomato, and toast, and again, a great meal. Parking was a breeze downstairs and the next time we are in Brisbane, it will be the Metropolitan Motor in for us. Oh and free wifi!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_412904715~“Noisy Room”~Although the property has been freshened up recently, it would have been beneficial to have spent some money on sound proofing the rooms that face out to the street. If not for the lack of sleep, our stay would have been very comfortable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412501128~“Lovely Family run place”~Nice friendly staff, very clean and a nice dining room with reasonably priced food and drinks. Very handy to CBD with the free Spring Hill Loop at the front door. Easy down hill walk to city centre and then catch the free bus back up the hill. Nice and quiet room.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_409073197~“Underpromised Overdelivered!”~Being a former inner city Brisbane local and passing through, I assumed being about a 3.5 star motel, the central location would be the only good thing about this establishment.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Not only was the location obviously amazing but the place has had a refurbishment and looks fresh, clean and was very comfortable to stay in. Staff were pleasant, cheerfully friendly and very hospitable and again was shocked to receive free wifi at a good speed and free parking in a large underneath car park, very rare in inner city hotels.  Clean and crisp new bathrooms, modern shower with great water pressure (always a valued bonus to me) A steam iron that actually did a decent job for a hotel iron. Handy having a reverse cycle air con, especially with Brisbane trying its hardest to still be 'warm and sunny' in winter... But another bonus having a semi private balcony off my room with a fresh air option.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to dine in the restaurant underneath, but having that option is a great bonus feature to this place. (Along with the very convenient late houred bottle shop just next door! ;)) I did have a good sticky beak inside and the refit and rename of Restaurant One O Six was also very impressive... defiantly will utilise this next time! They've really done a great job of the place! Look forward to dropping by and staying my next trip to town. :))~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_407643488~“Very Central”~We stayed here as we had an early appointment in Wickam Terrace. As expected, this Motel is an older style but was very clean and tidy. The room was refrubished , bathroom clean and a great hot shower. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable , for this reason I would not choose to stay here again. The room had good wifi and a small bar fridge , it was nice to have a small bottle of fresh milk for tea and coffee. Within walking distance there is a little grocery store, pizza places and restaurants. The Motel also has free carparking which is tight to navigate .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_401919845~“Convenient and Comfortable. ”~Have stayed here many times and love its central position. Recently revamp and looks very smart. They've obviously had some issues as some minor though obvious cosmetic problems not resolved. Exceptional well priced, very friendly helpful staff. Edward st side of the hotel very noisy first thing of a morning. Free wifi that works and doesn't drop out or time out. Room serves available, Alexander's restaurant on the ground floor. Great for large groups and families or singles or couples nil impact visa versa.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400653399~“Well Priced and Quality Room”~I've stayed at the Metropolitan Motor Inn about half a dozen times now, both for work trips and personal trips. Since I was there the last time the hotel has had a renovation - with a new lift *Praise The Lord*, updated rooms and bathrooms. As usual, the service was top notch, breakfast great for the price and room excellent! It's not the Hilton, but for $110 a night (hot tip - call the Hotel for the better price) - it's excellent!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_398201804~“Pleasantly surprised”~As a modestly priced motel we were not expecting too much, but were pleasantly surprised.

review_393706952~“Misleading Pictures”~Although the pictures on the internet made the room look like it was a high quality motel. The overwhelming smell that came out of the room when we opened our room door was awful. Was like the dead were living in it, there was a very bad energy in and around the room made me feel sick and wanting to leave immediately. Due to the fact we had no where else to go and it was late, I stayed. Slept on top of the blankets with my clothes on. Couldn't even open the windows as it opened out onto a shared balcony where other guests were sitting and making a lot of noise. Was also woken by housekeeping hovering around the door at 9:15, and check out is at 10:00am Staff were lovely but the place I would never stay in again.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393325502~“Clean and good location. ”~I found this hotel was clean and in a good location with a short work to Queen St Mall and the CBD. However with a room on the Main Street, at the front of the building there was quite a lot of road noise. Perhaps it was be quieter at the back of the building but the walls are quite thin. If you are a sensitive sleeper this hotel would not be for you. Parts of the hotel are somewhat dated but I would stay again for the location and its cleanliness.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383551170~“Handy to Brisbane CBD”~Within 10 minutes walk to the heart of Brisbane this is a good place to stay for business or pleasure, the rooms are clean and comfortable , and I think all have balconies, the staff were friendly, the building has a elevator so getting bags up to your room is no problem, and they have a restaurant ( it was being renovated on our stay) but it has opened on writing this review, the building also has a underground car park , we flew into Brisbane and got the train to central railway station, witch is a 10 minute walk away, but beware it's mostly a up hill walk! I say that because we had large bags and were puffing by the time we got to the motel, but getting back to the station was no problem !! The motel is on two major roads so it got a bit Noisey peak hours but not so bad other times, being so close to the CBD you would expect a lot of traffic, we had a two day one night stay in Brisbane and the motel securely stored our bags for us till we had to fly out, all in all a good place to stay handy to the river and the sights of the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382414024~“Update On Previous Review After Renovations”~Having stayed here a few times previously I have reviewed the Metropolitan Motor Inn before. But now that the renovations finished, I thought an update would be good. I stayed very recently (June 2016) and the renovations were done all but a couple of 'bits n pieces'.  I do like what has been done with the place – yes it is still “aged”, to me this is part of the charm – but I do miss the ‘old clunk’ from the lift when it stopped, guess this has also been fixed. The foyer has a welcome feel and the restaurant was open and looks great. The room I stayed in has been completely refurbished, was clean and comfortable with everything I needed.  Staff make a stay and I found all the staff I encountered to still be very friendly, helpful and respectful – they just have to remember my name is Emily LOL.  PS There is still free parking under the motel.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_381737808~“Ok for short stay”~Need transport to get to major areas.I was also kept awake by traffic noise and very noisy neighbours who created a very uncomfortable disturbance all night. Thankfully they were evicted the next day but it wasn't a pleasant experience to go through,especially since I was travelling on my own.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_377779911~“Metropolitan Motor Inn”~The foyer had yet to be completed and painted; the restaurant was not open despite a planned May 23 re-opening; a lot of carpentry and painting had to be done on our (3rd) floor. The exterior has yet to be repainted and all the old air-conditioning units are visible from the balconies. In all, we felt the hotel should not have been open. Our room, however, was completely refurbished, although the bathroom is small and the shower cubicle needs a grab rail.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376955440~“two night stay”~we found this motel being renovated at the time we stayed, the room we were in was newly renovated and was very clean and designed well. restaurant was still under construction but if you turn left out of the front door there is a Pizza shop a Burrito licence bar (really good) and a 24hr 7-11. very close to the city a 5 minute walk down the hill and they have free parkin, Nannas Kitchen to the left also was terrific and well priced.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
