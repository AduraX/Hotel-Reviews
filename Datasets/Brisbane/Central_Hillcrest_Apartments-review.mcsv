review_466446728~“A happy traveller”~I quite liked this apartment, there were many positives worth mentioning with only a couple of negatives. Positives: nice pool, spa & Sauna. The room was very clean and modern. Parking was easy and free.  Negatives: the gym was small, restaurant closed on weekends with no buffet breakfast only continental.  Overall I found this apartment good value for money and I would reccomend it to people.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_450863607~“Great location for Southbank, CBD and Gabba”~We booked a 2-bedroom apartment and a King Room for 4 nights after New Year for a short holiday with overseas family. Booking was easy and everything was exactly as listed in the ad. My son upgraded himself and his family to a 1-bedroom apartment quite easily and for not much more. There were definitely plusses and a few minuses with this place, although on the whole the good outweighed the annoying!! In a wonderful location, with a large balcony and a great view up the river to the Storey Bridge (which was beautifully lit up at night), the apartment was plenty large enough for 4 adults, with loads of cupboards for storing stuff. The beds were super comfy and in the main bedroom, there were sliding doors leading to another balcony with the same great view. The bathroom was clean and modern with plenty of hot water and extra towels if you requested them and there was also a laundry in the apartment with a washer and dryer. The kitchen was adequate although there could do with being more crockery to use in the microwave and I would have expected a dishwasher these days. One petty thing that really annoyed me was the issue of 1/4 of a Chux cloth (!!) for cleaning both the kitchen and the bathroom. That's really so ridiculous when a whole pack of 10 only costs $1!!! As mentioned in some of the other comments, the A/C was pretty noisy and set on one constant temperature, which I suppose avoids people messing with the controls and constantly needing attention for it.  The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the housekeeping staff were delightful, even though we did not make use of their services. They were always ready to offer clean linen or towels had we required them. There is good security parking and the location cannot be beaten for access to Southbank Parklands with its lovely gardens, many restaurants and large play and pool areas. It's a pleasant walk across the footbridge to the CBD and the Gabba is just down the road. I cannot comment on the onsite restaurant as it was closed for refurbishment during our stay but that was clearly advertised on the webpage before I booked. It was not a problem as we either self-catered or visited one of the many local restaurants and bars. Finally, there is a smallish onsite pool and a great spa which was wonderful, especially as we had kids with us. Sadly, the steps to the pool were broken during our visit and one of our party could not access the pool without them as she would not have been able to get out of the pool. When she asked about this, the response was less than helpful to say the least; it was more or less, "Well - deal with it - we can't do anything about it right now." This was unfortunate as in the main the staff were great. All in all, this place is great value for money and we enjoyed our stay there.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_446140413~“Cricket”~We stayed for 3 nights in a 1 bedroom apartment for the test match. The hotel had ensured our room was ready early so we could settle in and be at the Gabba for the first ball. Excellent under cover parking included. Very roomy and comfortable 1 bedroom apartment looking back over the Mater Hospital. Very comfortable King sized bed, full kitchen ( but little in the way of dishes for the microwave or oven ) , no dishwasher, bathroom had a large shower , washing machine , clothes dryer and laundry tubs. Clean and functional. No road noise but air conditioning just has an on off switch and was loud. Immediate area is not attractive but short walk to Southbank, Botanical Gardens and the CBD . There is a Coles supermarket close by. We have booked again for a day night match in January but significantly dearer for next year's test match.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437286790~“Comfortable Overnight Stay”~We booked 2 rooms: 1 x One bedroom apartment (room 303) 1 x King Room, which had a king plus a single bed (room 606) The Good: The staff are lovely and the parking is hassle-free :) The location is excellent - especially if you're needing to be accessible to either the Mater or Lady Cilento Hospitals, or the Gabba. Only a 2-3 min walk to the Southbank Parklands - great for walks along the river and an abundance of restaurants and bars to choose from! The beds were super-comfy, and all the bedding was fresh and in great condition. Both rooms were very clean. Room 303 has a nice sized balcony, where smoking is ok and an ashtray is provided. This apartment is also quite big, and easily accommodated four of us sitting around watching tv after dinner! Room 606 has a lovely view over to the city. The Not-So-Good: The rooms are quite dated (especially the bathrooms), though in good condition. The air conditioning in room 303 is set by maintenance staff, though we asked at reception and they had someone adjust it to suit. It is also quite a noisy thing. The shower cubicle in 606 is quite small, being a plus-sized lady I found it to be a bit uncomfortable.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_428387379~“Centrally located, comfortable accomodation in Brisbane”~Partner and I stayed one night. Smallish room, view to a car park, not an issue this time to us as only staying one night. Clean room, fresh bedding and a king size bed joined together by two smaller beds. No safe, have to see receptionist. Car parking is at off street road level or underground. We were given one card for a continental breakfast on arrival. Would assume for both of us, but no, when you go to breakfast the card entitles only one person to a free breakfast. Very disappointing, had to give the waitress $10 for myself before I could have my breakfast (partner had the card).  Ask for two cards. There is free WiFi, but watch out, it does go to charge if you use too much.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_427464986~“Good location”~The location of this hotel is great as it's a nice stroll down to Southbank and close to the city. The rooms are a generous size and the bed was huge which was a plus for us as we are very tall. It's not very sound proof though and we could hear a child crying in the room next door to us during the night. It's not so much of an issue to be situated next to children, however, we didn't expect for the walls to be so thin and the sound to travel. No doubt we would have disturbed the neighboring family in the morning when we arose early. When we arrived, we were given a complimentary voucher for a very average continental breakfast in the morning. We assumed this voucher was for all occupants of the room i.e. the both of us. We were wrong and were forced to pay for another breakfast even though we only had a slice of toast each. It was so much that we had to pay for another breakfast but rather we weren't told the voucher was for one person only when we checked in. I would recommend this is made clear to guests when they check.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_424070021~“Two and a half stars”~For sheer convenience to the Mater Hospital precinct (or the Gabba for that matter), Central Hillcrest Apartments is a pretty good option.  It's also not too far away from Brisbane's Southbank precinct with its myriad cafe and restaurant options.  But its very location - right on busy Vulture Street - meant that I was stuck in traffic for up to 15 minutes during peak times just trying to enter the carpark. This issue was magnified due to the large amount of apartment construction happening in the vicinity, meaning lane closures. Naturally, all this traffic and construction means quite a bit of noise, especially during the day and especially from the giant cranes working overhead. There's a secure undercover carpark accessed via a private five button access code (it's a bit fiddly) and the same for hotel access after hours.  My room rate came with a breakfast voucher (only available to use on one of the days as the restaurant doesn't open weekends) and complimentary wifi is also offered, though it's capped at 200MB per day and you have to go to the front desk each day to pick up a new user name and password. Front desk service was consistently warm, professional and friendly.  The room was a bit of a let down, I must admit.  Though it had a pretty great view of the cityscape (which is under threat from a new apartment complex being built right in the way, pictured) and was clean, it was all pretty basic. More '80s/'90s 'motel' than apartment. Would I stay again? Probably not, but if it's convenience you're after, Central Hillcrest Apartments may be just what you're looking for.~2~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan

review_401896162~“Bit of a mix”~Chose this hotel based on its location to the Gabba (about 500m) and for a riverview. Location is excellent for the hospital, Southbank and one of the terminals for the free cityhopper ferry to the CBD. Our room was spacious and comfortable however the balcony and view was a bit of a disappointment being small and much of the "river view" about to be built out. Nice view of the CBD at night though. The kitchen was well equipped and the bathroom was one of their renovated ones. The bed was a little hard for my liking but acceptable. Parking is secure and free. Wifi is free but limited to 200Mb per day. We were there in winter and at one stage looked for the heating as it was forecasting a minimum of 8C however this apartment at least only had airconditioning and the temp is set by the hotel. A little inconvenient but I guess this is not a big deal for Brisbane most of the year. TV was restricted to free to air channels but they provided a DVD player. They have a restaurant but it is only open weekdays so we didn't get to try it. Overall it was ok.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_388849790~“Busy road and environs”~Tidy, clean rooms, tiny balcony, noise from road and building sites close by. Lovely restaurant with great food and reasonable prices. No breakfast or meals available on weekends. Needs double glazing for noise reduction.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_356189780~“Clean, Cheap, Good location for Gabba and Qpac”~Stayed here for just one night because we were going to a show at Qpac, good location, an easy 10min walk to Qpac but even closer to the Gabba, there was a cricket match on at Gabba when we stayed and the hotel was full of cricket fans. The rooms are basic but have everything you need, they are clean, parking is easy and free, if you just need somewhere to crash for the night its perfect~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_320766268~“Anoyed”~The accommodation was fine but as a business traveler I am annoyed that this place advertises free internet, and yes you get 200 MB...., you remember that from dial up days? well that's the teaser you get, a few emails and half a download from head office server. Then you are transferred to the internet supplier and charged extortionate fees for your remaining download. I just don't like being lied too. That's it for the Central group for me.~2~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_319777494~“Convenient Location ”~This hotel was spacious and conveniently located for Southbank restaurants and attractions. We had a 2 bedroom apartment which was great for our group of 5ppl.  Checkin was quick and efficient, rooms are tidy and comfortable. While this is an older apartment block the rooms are nicely decorated. Beds were comfortable - good pillows.  Ours was a 5th floor room, with lovely views up the river. Parking was great although there's hardly a need to use the car when it's only a short walk to Southbank or across into the city. While they do have a restaurant onsite, we didn't use this - they don't open on weekends (I can understand this as the proximity to the Mater Hospital quite probably means they cater more often for corporate clients). Overall, good value - would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_307718629~“Great Prices Great Location Great Staff!”~My family and I stayed here and were impressed with the location (we were visiting a sick family member at the Mater next door) the lovely lady booking our room was so friendly helpful. The rooms are larger than other City hotel rooms we have stayed in and parking is secure and free (big help in the city!!!) the only downfall would be the restaurant it was terrible overpriced reheated frozen food.... We even thought we'd try breakfast there because you can't ruin a breakfast but the chef managed with overcooked everything but the bacon..... Such a shame about the restaurant but being in Brissy it's easy to leave and find a good meal, but I can't fault the hotel or its friendly staff I would recommend anyone having to go to the mater to stay here~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_304883606~“Hen's Party Accomodation”~Just wanted to say how fantastic Hillcrest Apartments on Vulture Street were with accommodating our needs. They were helpful, super friendly and fantastic about allowing us to use our interconnecting apartment (sleeps 6) for a Hen's Kitchen Tea for 18 ladies in the afternoon before we headed out! A very convenient location to Southbank where we had dinner and the city where we went dancing! The staff couldn't do enough to help, they charged a very reasonable price and went out of their way to make our stay perfect...from early checkin to set up, late checkout after a big night and extra parking passes for guests. Thank you for all your assistance in making my sister's Hen's Party truly memorable!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_273101825~“What a view!”~We really enjoyed out 2 week stay here...ask for a view over the river because it is pretty spectacular. Our 1 bedroom apartment was spacious, clean, and attractive. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking, and the staff were friendly and efficient. You couldn't ask for a better location - 20 minutes by bike from the university and just across the river from the CBD. Our morning walks rotated between the botanic gardens (just across the pedestrian bridge), the Kangaroo Point cliffs and the South bank. I would definitely stay here again. My only complaint (and this seems to be shared with many Australian hotels) was the quality of the free internet (at least they didn't charge for it) - it was intermittent and very frustrating for someone who needs it for research.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_262173074~“Great position - overpriced”~My husband (needing surgery) and I chose to stay in these apartments because of their proximity to the Mater Hospital. We spent 3 nights in a 1 bedroom apartment with an "almost" river view and 1 night in a king hotel room. While the rooms were clean and well appointed we felt that they were overpriced. In particular, the King room at $162 / night (very small & prone to picking up all the noise from the unit next door) was perhaps the worst value we've had in accommodation in a long time. I checked with the Sudima apartments (virtually next door) and they are newer, considerably cheaper and have received better reviews from this site. We ended up staying at the Hillcrest apartments because the whole medical issue was rather rushed and I didn't do my usual rigorous research!  The swimming pool and sauna facilities are good and the restaurant serves up superb meals at a very reasonable price: The chef is brilliant and he understands that people away from home on prolonged medical stays enjoy tasty, wholesome meals with generous lashings of vegetables. So .... on balance, would we stay there again? Maybe ....~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_261840498~“Comfortable, great location, lovely view”~Staying at Central Hillcrest was a very positive experience. The apartments are spacious, clean and comfortable, and the kitchen is well-stocked with tea, coffee and kitchenware. My Mum, my partner and I stayed in a two-bedroom apartment for two nights. Both nights, I slept really well in the double bed. There are large cupboards and mirrors in both bedrooms, and a shower and bath in the bathroom. All rooms are well-maintained by the housekeeping staff, who clean daily.  Central Hillcrest Apartments are only an 8 minute walk from beautiful, tree-lined Southbank, which offers parks for children to play in, the man-made Brisbane beach, a range of eateries and the Southbank markets.  My only criticism is how cold the rooms become when the air-conditioning is on. I don't think the temperature can be adjusted? We tried opening the doors instead, which lead onto little balconies, but the traffic noise was too loud.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_260955308~“Thank goodness for space & a comfy bed!”~We stayed here for 10 days early March. I booked a 1 bedroom apartment & had a rollaway bed. The decor is a little dated, especially the kitchen & bathroom, but it was clean, couch & beds were comfy & it was perfect to spread out in! The kitchen was very well contained with a fully functioning oven, cooktop, microwave & full sized fridge. We were booked as weekly accommodation so our apartment was only serviced weekly. There is a small IGA supermarket within walking distance to restock with. Internet is provided free at 200mb a day. Most of the staff were very friendly & went out of their way to help. There is a complimentary washing machine & dryer on each floor which was a godsend! I didnt use their gym, pool, restaurant or other amenities as I was there to be near Lady Cilento hospital & family. Car Parking is onsite & it is walking distance to Mater & Lady Cilento Hospitals. About 20 minutes from Brisbane airport. Restaurants, cafes & pubs within walking distance.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_249812342~“Impressive”~We stayed here as a family for one night. Spacious, clean, modern apartment with spectacular views of a Brisbane especially at night. Beds were extra comfortable.

review_248385852~“An excellent place to stay in Brisbane...long overdue review”~I have stayed at the Central Hillcrest Apartments three times over the past year, and every time it exceeds expectations. The front desk staff are particularly delightful (especially Nicole!) and the housekeeping staff really go the extra mile.  Location - great location, 30 seconds walk to Mater Private Hospital, 3 minutes walk to the other Mater Hospitals and Lady Cilento, 4 minutes to South Bank. Don't miss the Brisbane Brewhouse across from the Mater hospitals. About a 7 minute walk to the South Bank train station. Rooms - very spacious compared to standard hotel rooms, and quite clean. Tea and instant coffee are provided, as well as an allotment of kitchen dishes and cutlery. Great views of the river and the CBD! Amenities - parking is ample, free, and available under cover or out in the open. The pool is nice, and the workout room is small but in good condition. Each room comes with 200mb of free Wifi internet each day, enough for some basic surfing. To summarize - for a trip to Brisbane with plans to visit South Bank, the new children's hospital, QUT, or the CBD, I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_246899310~“New Year's Eve in Brisbane”~Recently stayed in Hillcrest for the New Year. The apartments aren't new, but they are comfortable and close enough to Southbank to be near everything you need. Good value for money aNd having the option of studio, 1 or 2 bedrooms they are suitable for all types. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there.  The sound proofing is brilliant so you don't hear city or other hotel noise.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_243716021~“Good Location in South Brisbane”~Stayed November, 2014 This hotel is located in South Bank Brisbane. It is an apartment style hotel with one and two bedroom units. We got upgraded to a two bed unit. The apartment was reasonably modern with all the things you would expect in an apartment. Large fridge, dishwasher, microwave, enough pots and pans for cooking and cutlery, glasses for four etc. All equipment was in good working order.  The room had a kitchen, combined lounge and dining room with balcony, master bed with a king bed plus balcony and a second bedroom with two singles. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom with bath and separate shower the toilet was also separated. It also offered a laundry consisting of a washer, tub and drier. We had a river view facing room which was lovely and offered good views of the city, Southbank and the Storey bridge. There is an onsite gym and pool both of which a fine. Parking is free and has both secured and open parking. The motel is located next door to the mater hospital and a ten minute walk from the new children's hospital. Southbank parklands and restaurant area is a 10-15 minutes walk. Just remember the return walk is up hill. We also scored a free breakfast for one morning (continental only) which was average but still enough to get you going for the day. Overall I have no complaints in regards to this property and enjoyed by stay here. I would stay again due to its location. I like Southbank.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_243228938~“Very comfortable accommodation close to hospital”~We recently stayed here while my son was a patient at the nearby Mater Hospital. On arrival we were upgraded to a two bedroom apartment so that set the scene for a pleasant stay. The Hotel is VERY close to the Mater Hospital so is perfect for families where one member is a patient and the rest of the family want to be close by. The apartment was quite large with a modern kitchen, good sized living area, good sized bathroom and laundry. Views over the city were spectacular, particularly at night. The restaurant had a somewhat limited menu, but the selections were very tasty and priced well. The restaurant is only open Mon - Fri for breakfast and dinner. Plenty of undercover secure parking. Very close to Southbank and a short walk to the ferry terminal, Gabba cricket ground.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_241036859~“Good location, good service, lacking restaurant facilities”~I stayed at the Hillcrest recently and was very impressed with the overall facilities. The location is a short 10 minute walk to Southbank where numerous shops and sites are available. The rooms are well appointed, clean and spacious. They also have a restaurant, however, it is almost never open for dinner. Breakfast is ok, standard fare for buffet breakfast with sufficient substance, but not exceptional quality. Essentially this is a well appointed accommodation and you could do worse in the area. I would consider returning.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_234874837~“Home away from home with more”~What a wonderful experience to stay at these well appointed condos. Had an amazing view of the river. Private balcony. Fully equipped condo with our own laundry. This was a bonus. Short walk to Mather medical or Southbank. Free bus trolleys and free boat taxi nearby. Breakfast included, either a buffet or ask to order from the menu. Great coffee, friendly kitchen staff. If staying a week, get a week pass for the internet. They like to give you a daily pass code, but you can get a weekly one. I would go back in a heartbeat. Found the best coffee in the world here in Brisbane.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_230407621~“Good value functional apartments close to Southbank and Mater Private Hospital.”~We stayed with the family at Hillcrest Central Apartments. Found it to be good value for money. Rooms had a tired/aged appearance, yet they were clean and functional. Absolutely perfect location if you had to stay over to visit the Mater Private Hospital. They had plenty of off-street parking. Heaps of space for little kids to run around inside the apartment. Kitchenette has all the features we needed to cater for ourselves. The daily allowance of 300MB free WiFi (which was slow) seemed to disappear unusually fast. The dining area downstairs was very basic. Staff were friendly and courteous. They were happy for families with kids to stay. The kitchen facilities were generous and relatively new-looking. You could easily prepare meals there. A 15 min walk downhill to Southbank. A nice view of the CBD city in the distance. We would definitely stay there again. Overall, the value for money, and generous room space in the main living area made it an attractive stay for our family.~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_228555380~“Get what you pay for”~We stayed here at Christmas with the family. Got a couple of rooms. They were well equipped and centrally located but thats about it. They were quite tired. The pool and games room was good for the kids. Can't say much more really. It was quite clean. Washers/Face cloths werent provided, offered us additional hand towels as an option, but at a cost.  Although the view was quite nice. Love a good view.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~4~nan
review_228315977~“Decent hotel in suburban setting”~I stayed here recently for a conference at the convention center. It's about a 15 minute walk from the convention center area and Grey street restaurants. There is not much in the immediate vicinity, apart from a couple of brew pubs and a few cafes. My hotel room was nothing like the one shown on their website. The carpet and paint were old, and the bathroom had very old, dated fixtures. I don't know if all the rooms are in similar condition, but I was underwhelmed by mine. The staff were always very friendly and professional, especially the breakfast staff. The breakfast buffet was pretty basic: toast, cereals, yogurt and canned fruits, but adequate for what I need. They boast free wi-fi, but keep in mind that this is only limited to 200MB per day. I managed somehow to blow through mine in 10 minutes just looking on Google maps, so I opted to shell out money for more minutes since I needed it for work. It still amazes me that people continue to charge per minute for wi-fi.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_223048271~“Excellent base for Brisbane visitor”~We were given a spacious and well equipped apartment. The positives were: Cleanliness and comfort Closeness to South Bank and to the West side Swimming pool (though not heated) Efficient desk and housekeeping staff Good value Free wifi in our apartment, though we had to change the access code each day The negatives were: Initial difficulty in getting after hours entry (directions to safe needs some signage) Adequate but quite uninspired breakfast with good juices, dull bread, hohum cereal and poor hot drinks. Overall we were very pleased with our choice of this apartment hotel.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_220164076~“Central location, comfortable apartments”~We stayed here recently with a large group-so had 2 apartments--709/710 & 704. Both were very spacious and comfortable and the setup of 709/710-where the 2nd bedroom was a self contained hotel room, meant that we had 2 bathrooms which was great. The views from the large balcony up the river were magnificent. Beds were comfortable, plenty of towels provided and although we didnt cook-plenty of crockery and glasses-as well as the basic cooking utensils. My daughter made use of the gym but we we didnt have time to check out the pool and spa. We didnt walk to the riverfront for dinner as we had 2 members of our group who were unable to walk that distance-so ventured into the city-not a good idea-parking and getting around without ending up on a freeway was a nightmare!! So next time-we will be walking!! We were actually in Qld for racing at Queensland Raceway at Ipswich and the trip to the track was easy and took about 40 mins-so not too bad. I would reccomend Hillcrest for anyone wanting more space than a hotel, it was comfortable and very reasonably priced.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_211040181~“Excellent location”~Very convenient location, very close to South Bank therefore close to restaurants and coffee shops. Stadium at a walking distance. Rooms are modern and clean. Parking is very easy and plentiful. Didn't have the chance to try the pool or sauna.~4~3~5~4~4~4~3~nan
review_208490419~“Well placed accomodation”~We stayed with a large group of people who all booked separately so we were able to check out a couple of the different rooms. I was very happy with our room # 501. Although we didn't get the river view we got to see the hospital helicopter land 3 times! (some may not find that as exciting as we did) Our 1 bedroom apartment was obviously recently renovated compared to the 2 bedroom one across from us in 504. Our bed was comfortable but was a double compared to the king size in 504. We had a dishwasher, they didn't. (tho there was no dishwasher powder!) The staff were all very cheerful and helpful, even the housekeeping staff. The location was a plus being very close to the river and many restaurants. The most frustrating thing about this place is the one way streets that surround it. If you want to get to a place just around the corner by car, it will take you just as long by car as it does to walk as you have to drive in a 8 km square to get there. Our apartment included a big lounge room and dining table. Lovely kitchen with all cooking facilities. Separate bedroom and bathroom that included a washing machine, sink and dryer. Other non renovated rooms were just as functional but with the mustard colours in furnishings and wooden cupboards in the kitchen it just felt old and not as refreshing as our room. Other friends had booked just a room not an apartment and that was very small with a couple of beds and a table all in 1 tiny room and they only paid $60 less than us for the 3 days. I would recommend paying the extra to get the apartment. Overall we were very happy.~4~4~5~3~4~4~5~nan
review_198243415~“Made a visit for surgical procedure stress free”~I was not aware of the great booking I had made until we arrived. I'm not familiar with Brisbane and was so pleased when the hotel was right next to the Mater Hospital. The surgeon made last minute changes and there was no problem for the hotel to accomodate our needs. Nicole was so helpful online booking. When we got to the hotel it was fantastic to be able to park the car and leave it. The desk staff were great, Ian especially helpful. I enjoyed the gym equipment and pool. Such an easy walk to beautiful southbank from the hotel and we were lucky enough to go to the Sunday markets. Free wi fi and parking were a bonus. The beds were really comfortable, sheets great quality. Pillows were a little too big and hard for my liking but I always bring my own. I had heard great things about the hotel from other people who had to stay for distance hospital visits. Our apartment was perfect and the river views were spectacular. Even had fireworks one night. Thank you for making a potentially stressful visit to Brisbane as easy and as comfortable as you did. Incredibly grateful for everything. Thank you~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_197094207~“Great views”~Stayed New Years Eve as l got stuck in Brisbane for work. Best place to be stuck, well fitted large apartment with everything l needed except lack of shops close ,not able to utilise kitchen fully. The sites from the large balcony were great ,especially the fire works display.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_193231688~“Great location amazing views”~Booked the one bedroom apartment with river view. Landed the 8th floor with fab views up the Brisbane River to city. 5 minute walk to restaurants in Southbank, ferry to city, and free ferry to Eagle St Pier. Spacious well appointed lounge, big DTV. Sound system, great bedroom, fully appointed kitchen. Well worth the $$~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_191980328~“Avoid breakfast”~We booked a hotel room here rather than an apartment, which suited us for a one night stay. The room was clean and although the bathroom was dated - it was clean. We had a fairly pleasant swim in the pool. It was a huge surprise when I looked at the dinner menu. The restaurant is very dated & on this particular night - it was empty. I wasn't surprised when I saw the prices & nearly fell over! They charge like a 5 star hotel! In an old dated restaurant? $30 plus for a steak. $10 for a garlic bread. $20 plus for a ceasre salad. Kids meals were $15. Needless to say, we could have gone down and had a lovely meal by the riverside for these prices. Instead we got pizza delivered. Anyway, breakfast was included in our tarrif, & I have to say it was like a joke. It was 8am & the hot food was running very low & cold. I got some poached eggs from the Bain Marie & when I cut them open water just oozed all over my toast & the yolk was hard. The baked beans were so dried out. Really, just don't bother! We got a deal online - perhaps that's why they put us in a room that overlooked the back car park. You'd think, with not too many guests, they would at least try to give you a nice view... No such luck. Wouldn't stay again. If they fixed up the restaurant & the food prices it might have been more enticing. Close to the Mater hospital but a good 20 minutes walk from QPAC~3~2~2~3~2~3~3~nan
review_191003717~“Great view”~Nice hotel room on 8th floor. Has been redecorated tastefully. We took deal with breakfast and was good value. Shower could of been cleaned a bit better, found lots of hairs. Reception staff could of been a bit more talkative and forthcoming with information.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_189111883~“Do Not spend New Years Here”~I'm not sure where to start, we booked a double room which was not what we paid for on the booking site the main light did not wrk was sure had booked room with a kitchen as stated in the ad and 1 bedside table light did not wrk, when told Ian about not happy didn't seem to care. Had a swim used a towel went to reception and asked for a dry towl for a shower was told no we cud use the dryer provided mean time we were cold and wet while waiting for towels to dry. We rang reception at 10 pm and asked for sum ice and was told kitchen was closed and they cud not afford staffto be running around to serve us by a rude lady. COME ON PPL ITS NEW YEARS There was a painter painting in outside our door and the fumes made me sick. I travel overseas a lot this was the worst service and hotel I have ever stayed in and I am not being dramatic either! We stayed in room 309 if management wishes to contact me which I doubt they will my email is trarise4@gmail.com~1~1~3~3~2~3~1~nan
