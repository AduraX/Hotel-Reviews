review_478065921~“Impressed”~Clean with large rooms. Close to freeways but quiet. Reasonably priced with full apartment facilities. Would stay again. Rooftop pool and spas looked great at night however never got the chance to use them~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_472511334~“Spacious, clean, well-appointed apartment”~I and my daughter stayed in a two bedroom apartment for one night. We used the cooking facilities to prepare a meal, but needed to ask the receptionist to show us how to get the stove top to work. Had there been some instructions handy, I am sure that we would have been able to figure it out ourselves. All in all, it was much pleasanter staying at the Oaks Woolloongabba than in a hotel room. If we hadn't had a car, however, we might have chosen to stay somewhere closer to the city. The apartment was spotlessly clean. The front desk staff were helpful. We would be happy to stay here again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_468661329~“Perfect for short or long stay”~Very comfortable, very clean and very conveniently located to Princess Alexandra hospital where I had to go each day. The roof top Pool and spa was amazing especially at night-time, looking out over the city, wonderful for a country bumpkin like me! Lots of nearby places to eat plus a close supermarket if you would prefer to eat in.. I would be very happy to stay there again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_462841550~“great place”~The apartment was beautiful, clean and well equipped for short or long stays. A beautiful roof top pool and bbq area. Staff were so polite and friendly. And apartments handy to the PA hospital . Will definitely be booking accommodation at Oaks Woolloongabba again~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_461866566~“Perfect Accommodation”~The apartment was great for anyone visiting the PA Hospital. Karly does a great job at reception and the apartment was very functional for our requirements. Would recommend Oak Apartments for people visiting hospital~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461594851~“Great place to stay”~Our unit was very clean, modern and practical. We really enjoyed our stay at the Oaks Woolloongabba, The roof top pool with views out over the city was amazing day and night. We found it very central to all the activities we did and will definitely stay here again as we regularly come to Brisbane for swimming competitions. Has a cafe downstairs that was very convenient,~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461343851~“Checked in Friday 17th Feb 2017”~I am a regular Oaks guest now for business. Have to say the staff at reception are what staff should be. Thank you for the fantastic service, it can really make your day when greeted with such enthusiasm and great assistance. I intend to use the Woolloongabba Oaks instead of the Ipswich Oaks. The drive is worth it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461092662~“Highly rated”~I stayed at Oaks for 3 days with my 7 yr old son. The rooms are immaculate, spotless and very modern. The view was amazing and the pools and spa were great. The pool and spa were in roof too which was very appealing to my son.  I would've given a 5 star rating however the only thing that bought my rating down was the unsecure exit to the car park. When you want to exit their underground car park it is almost impossible to see incoming traffic. All that is offerd is a little mirror in the corner which is very hard to see. Overall i very much enjoyed my stay in Brisbane and Oaks is very close to the city centre and motorways~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459663667~“Great for family & near amenities”~We'd a wonderful time staying this new hotel which is a residence concept. Clean, spacious, cosy, equipped with good laundry & kitchen in each units & very near to train & bus station. Indeed "Home away from home". Though not in city center, the closeness of public transportation & only 10 drive to city makes this a great place for family to stay. The front desk lady, Nicole was very good & attentive when we complaint about our 1st room being too noisy as close to the road. She immediately addressed our complaints well by switching to another room.  The only cons is this hotel should provide free wifi 24 hours a day instead of just an hour per day. Hope this can be addressed in future to make this hotel more attractive against the many competitors hotel at surrounding area.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459571990~“Great!”~Two Bed apartment (2 bath), great for two couples or a family. Clean, good layout with full kitchen. Each bedroom had own controlled reverse cycle system and double glazed windows throughout, which blocked all traffic and train noise. Excellent location, less than 5 mins walk to bus, train and supermarket. Reasonable rates and secure undercover parking ($15/night). Only negative (small), no free wifi. Very happy, would definitely stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458812449~“One Nighter”~Clean, quiet, new and well maintained. Good views from rooftop bbq area, pool and spa. Good Air con, friendly cafe below with good coffee too. Only criticism the pool surrounds are very dirty and need a good axrub~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458399017~“Buisness at PAH”~Pros:Great location, very clean, staff very friendly and helpful, would come back again. Cons: Need to pay for wifi. Double glazing in bedroom so quiet in there, but could hear traffic noise from living room.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458195261~“A Great Stay”~Stayed three nights whilst visiting grandchildren. First night used BBQ facilities for wife and I, daughter and husband and three grandchildren. Very suitable facilities and grandchildren enjoyed evening swim. Didn't even have to clean BBQ as cleaner does it next morning. Space in the room was refreshing and accommodated visiting grandchildren easily. Room was clean, well fitted out, comfortable and protected from adjacent rail noise. Bus way and train stations very close for city trips. Very impressed overall and will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Close & central to Public Transport , Dining at Stones corner only 5 min walk away or at Gabba . Its away from the city centre so easy access by Car to Travel in & out of the Area, avoiding the city traffic.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_455729436~“GREAT PLACE TO STAY IN BRISVEGAS”~oaks woolloongabba is a new property with a central location right beside buranda rail and bus stations and a stones throw from the p.a. hospital.it is a very modern fully self contained very large sized 1 bedroom apartment that has every facility you could possibly want for a weekend stay in brisvegas.the 7th floor apartment had great views and a huge balcony dual airconditioned living and sleeping areas and the best pillows in the world.the unit was equipped with the latest front loading washing machine and dryer and a huge shower area with consumables supplied.it ticked all the boxes including very reasonable room rate and $15 per night secure parking for my two night stay and cant wait to return.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455555652~“Clean, tidy and quiet”~Spent six days at the oaks in a one bedroom apartment on the eighth floor and was very impressed at the quiet feel of the hotel. The room was spotless and serviced daily, included all of the necessary amenities and had nice views of the city and Gabba. One downside was only one of the lifts was in operation for the entire week and at times the wait for the lift seemed like forever.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455336771~“Big Comfy Secure Self Contained "Home Away from Home" Apartment”~Oaks Woolloongabba has been my home for 7 weeks and its been truly great. :) i was very politely greeted by the Hotel Manger "Ty" on arrival and check in was quick & easy. First impressions were positive and remained that way for my entire stay. Thanks Ty, greatly appreciated. All the front desk girls also get a pat on the back too, always a smile & hello when walking past. Thumbs up! My apartment, Surprised on how big it was.. (i like space and i got space) The apartment was well fitted out with washing machine & dryer, full size fridge and well equip kitchen with dishwasher. Comfy couch, big size TV with Foxtel, modern decor, dinner table and king size bed. Very nice. I required a few business documents printed out and the hotel manager was more than happy to print these out. The location is very convenient to everything. Getting to the CBD, Southbank, Gabba, and alike was easy with major arterial roads feeding off nearby. A few minutes walk across the road is a small shopping centre with supermarket and other small stores and fast food. Highly recommended for long or short term stays.. Its quiet, its comfortable and secure.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_453893654~“Excellent service”~We loved our 2 night stay here. The staff were really accommodating and pleasant to deal with. They arranged an early check in for us and were always helpful with our queries during our stay. Lovely room, well equipped and has comfy beds, also very handy to public transport. Pool and spa's are great with fantastic view of the city. Would definitely stay there again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_452065732~“Outstanding apartments ”~Couldn't speak more highly of Oaks Wooloongabba. My husband was hospitalised nearby for a month and the team at Oaks were compassionate and understanding of my never ending changes in plans .  The apartment is new and very comfortable. Having a kitchen and laundry made it much easier for a long term stay and there is a shopping centre only a block away.  I liked having underground locked parking too.  The location is very central to a number of hospitals in that area and some can easily be accessed by bus , walking or car.  Fabulous pool area with city views.  Wouldn't hesitate to return when next in Brisbane, so easy to hop on a bus and get to the city or Southbank. Saves hassle of car parking and apartments are better value than staying in the city.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450540946~“Good value”~We were thoroughly pleased with our two night stay here. Initially I was a bit worried when we arrived and saw how close the train track was to the bedrooms but it was quiet!!!!  The apartments were centrally located to the tennis and were clean and modern.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450035654~“Nice Apartment but the rooftop pools and spas were not in use and was the reason we chose the apartment”~After choosing this accommodation over other's, for the Rooftop pool and Spas was very disappointing. The spas were out of order and the pool was not an option either with chlorine/chemicals being added to get it ready for use. This was in December 2016 so you would expect the major draw card to be in use and when booking we asked about the pool and spas and were not told they were out of order. We don't get to travel much so was a let down. Other than that parking was good, apartment was very good.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_448812652~“Overnight stay for BBL game.”~We chose the Oaks primarily due to it being walking distance to the Gabba and the price was reasonable. It was easy to get to and on arrival the reception staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The entire hotel had a high standard of cleanliness. The bed was extremely comfortable, in fact the whole apartment was well appointed. The only negative I can say is that they could give a few more coffee/tea/sugar/milk serves and also a disposable shower cap (you usually find one in hotels). As i said, only a minor issue. All in all i would recommend The Oaks and would definately revisit on another stay in Brissy. Thank you.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448710659~“Excellent Hotel”~I checked in on 31/12/16 and stayed with 3 other guests to celebrate New Years. We chose this hotel because of the location and how close it was to a nearby event and because of how great it looked online. When we checked in the lady was lovely and very helpful when I came down for more information a few hours later (I'm so sorry I forgot her name!!)  The hotel was amazing! We were on the 4th floor. We booked a 2 bedroom room with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and balcony. It was very neat and tidy and our friends staying with us commented on how nice the apartment was especially considering the great price we paid. It was also a plus that there was a washer and dryer so that we could dry our towels and togs after trips to the rooftop pool and spas. We loved the rooftop!! The pool was really nice and it was even warm at 9-10pm! We also enjoyed the view and the spas! It was a great way to spend New Years Day. We also wanted to visit Southbank for dinner that night and Buranda bus station is about a 2-3 minute walk away which gets you straight on the busway so it is in a great location. On our last morning we decided to make breakfast on the BBQ on the roof because of how nice it was up there and had one last swim! We didn't plan on making any food so it was great that the shops were only a short walk away so that when we changed our minds it was easy to get supplies. We also made a mess of the BBQ and were going to clean it up but one of the members of staff offered to clean it for us and was really helpful and we wanted to say thank you to him. It is a busy location with busses, trains, busy roads and planes flying overhead however we never heard the noise in the apartment it was peaceful and quiet! Overall we all had the best time and didn't want to leave. Everything was excellent and we are looking forward to our next stay at this hotel hopefully very soon! Thank you for a great end to 2016 and start to 2017!~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_447696586~“Ok for price”~We got a good deal, paid for one bedroom and got two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Beds comfy, and all facilities good. Every night we got a whistling sound coming from somewhere in the building, was driving us crazy, went out into hall way and was even out there so not just our room. Very high pitched and annoying. Had very few coffees and teas for three nights for three adults, ended up buying own. Not sure what the problem was with spa but didn't work and while there people with wheel chairs couldn't access pool as the wheelchair lift didn't work. I had also requested a city facing room up high which I didn't receive and was disappointed as we rarely visit the city so would have loved city view, only got 4th floor and view of road. Not that the place was full either.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447630154~“Quality apartment hotel near the Gabba”~This is a very good apartment hotel. Rooms are spacious and well appointed with car parking in a secure garage. Pool and BBQ area on the rooftop which gives great vies of Brisbane. Close to bus and train services to the city and to major roads and motorways~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447610038~“Hidden costs...”~While the hotel was clean & modern, our visit was clouded by a few things. The late check in was a bit of a nightmare to arrange and then, when we did finally arrive late at night after flying across the country with 3 small children, the key we were given opened a used room which had not been cleaned since the last visitors left. After some time, the night caretaker arrived and found us a clean room.  The extra trundle bed in the room had not been made & there were no spare pillows, blankets or towels anywhere for the 3rd child. This did not stop the hotel from charging us with an extra $40 a night fee for the trundler bed that we had not been prewarned about at all when we booked and paid in advance on the hotel website.  All costs should be made clear at time of booking as we would have booked a hotel closer to the city for the extra $40 a night & saved that money on public transport in & out of the city each day.  The place is nice but we've been left with a bad taste in our mouths & won't stay here again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447346017~“New and modern apartment with plenty of room and storage.”~Good location but very limited access to free wi-fi. Our room on the second floor overlooked the railway line on one side and a brick wall on the other so we would ask for a room on a higher floor next time. Windows are all fixed so unable to open for fresh air. Even the 'outdoor' room was glassed in with fixed glass.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_447308500~“Lovely new, spacious 2 bed apartment.”~We rented a 2 bedroom apartment for 5 nights for our annual visit to Brisbane for Xmas celebrations with the family. The apartment enabled us to cater for 7 people for Xmas lunch very comfortably. With comfortable King sized beds, the apartment is very new, clean and spacious with all mod cons. The two bathrooms were an added bonus and of course there are the rooftop pools and sauna and Chess Set. Oaks staff were friendly and offered excellent attention. We took advantage of a special holiday deal and hope a similar deal is available for Xmas 2017 as we would have no hesitation in staying here again and will recommend to friends and family.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_446840875~“Great Staff And modern clean rooms”~Nice and clean. Being a new complex you would expect this. Close to all forms of transport and excellent views from the pool area on the roof. Karly and Sam on the front desk were very friendly and answered any question put forward. I would recommend these apts. especially if visiting loved ones at the hospital.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_446829542~“Great value for money”~The Oaks quality really showed through with these apartments. These units must be relatively new as I hadn't seen them before, but booked an overnight stay at short notice.  The cost was very low, the unit we had was big even by Oaks standards, & the location is very handy to the city & the freeway.  Will definitely be booking there in the future.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446355755~“There is a lot good about this place, however...”~So the hotel is new, and to be fair it really is very nice. Immaculately clean, the two bedroomed unit we have is beautiful with pretty much every amenity we could want. So why a 'poor' review? First, the internet. We are paying AU$ 200 per night for this place, and you get thirty minutes complimentary internet PER 24 HOURS. This is obviously a bit of a nightmare with the kids, and for work, and frankly, not what you expect at all from a place like this. I was told by reception, that if you book direct, you get complimentary internet, but if you book through a third party portal (who doesn't ??), you do not. Again, all fine, but this is not made explicit on booking.com. Second, the gym. We've stayed at a few places like this in Australia, there is always - a very well equipped- gym onsite. Here, you are offered the chance to go to a commercial gym, 10 minutes walk away and join at a reduced weekly rate. Might I venture that the management would be better off not mentioning gyms at all?  In many ways, they've spoilt the ship for a ha'porth of tar, which is really bad management.~2~2~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_445165610~“Clean, comfortable, excellent service”~I found my stay at the Oaks Woolloongabba very pleasant. I only stayed the night for business and found the service excellent, the apartment immaculate, spacious and well appointed. Had a perfect night sleep. The roof top pool is really nice and big enough to do laps.~5~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445128433~“Beautifully modern.”~Room 507 was a delight. Immaculately clean and very modern. Airconditioners in lounge and bedroom made for a very comfortable overnight stay. Bed and linens were very nice and we slept well. The check-in staff were very professional and friendly and went out of their way to help me find my destination in Brisbane, even going so far as checking Google maps for me, and then summoning the elevator for me when I arrived back at the Oaks with an armful of parcels.And the check-out young lady (sorry, I meant to remember everyone's names) was a gem. Underground security parking cost $15 per night, but it's worth it for peace of mind. I'll certainly be staying at the Oaks Woolloongabba next time I venture into the "big smoke".~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_440800109~“Nice hotel for price. Expensive internet and parking.”~Really nice good location a bit noisy with the trains running right behind the hotel. think the front might be quieter but is on a road that is not that busy. The rooms are really nice. Most of the foxtel channels don't work don't see point in having it if you can't use it. Internet is a rip off now days it should be free. There internet price is ridiculous.~5~nan~nan~3~nan~5~5~nan
review_437721349~“Wow! Yes, stay here ”~This place is so new it's barely finished but don't let that stop you! The hallways are huge, the rooms are gorgeous, views spectacular and there's a rooftop spa and pool - what's not to love? Get a shuttle bus return from the airport for $46 - its drops you at hotel chino - two minutes from Oaks Woolloongabba (you can see one hotel from the other). The staff at the Oaks are lovely too. There is no onsite food yet - I think there will be in the future though (there's a space just off the lobby that looks like it's going to be a restaurant) - so I used menulog. That didn't work out really but is no reflection on the hotel. The bed was really comfortable, and the place was super clean and well-equipped. It was also really quiet so I got a good night's sleep I will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437654341~“Amazing room”~I had to travel to Brisbane for work and I was very impressed with my unit for the night. It was VERY affordable and probably on of the best places I have stayed. Only downside was there was nothing open on a Monday for dinner where we could charge back to the room.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_436950283~“Girl's Weekend”~The staff here were very friendly. Some of our group had to wait for the person who made the booking (and had collected everyone's money) to show up, so the girls at reception put our food in the fridge and let us up to the pool area while we waited. The rooms themselves were great. We booked two two bedroom rooms, and each bedroom had its own en-suite bathroom (very handy with 9 people getting ready to go out). The pool and barbecue area was perfect, with an AstroTurf chess board, hammocks, lounges, and a 360' view of the surrounding area. I will definitely be coming back!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_435716701~“Home away from home”~I needed accommodation close to the hospital and these apartments surpassed all expectations, everything you could possibly need, friendly and very helpful staff beautiful surroundings and close to shops and transport.

review_435451086~“Great staff, well presented, easy access.”~Everything we asked for was without a problem. They even cleaned our room between the nights we stayed which we didn't expect.  Definitely well contained and tidy in the kitchen. We got a really good deal for 2 nights for a great room which really made the difference for us to stay in Brisbane rather than drive up and down from the Gold Coast each day. Thank you!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434951950~“Brilliant accommodation ”~We've stayed in a number of hotels in Brisbane and this is one of the top places on our list. The 1 bedroom apartment is very spacious, super clean, modern in design, and has all the facilities you need to feel like home. The pool is gorgeous so bring your swimmers. We have a car so it's nice to be able to park securely at night & explore Brissy by car during the day. The cost of parking is $15 a day which is very reasonable compared to other hotels in Brisbane. The reception staff are very professional and friendly, esp. Nikki. We flew in late the first night and the staff were happy to place our room keys etc in the safe for us to pick up when we arrived. Absolutely love this place!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_431058517~“Awesome Staff, excellent place to stay”~I just wanted to say what a wonderful stay I had at Oaks Woollongabba and it was all based on the excellent customer service and professional attitude of Emily. I found Emily to be courteous and friendly and full of very helpful information, she was always ready with a smile and nothing was a bother or too much trouble for her. She is absolutely a brilliant asset to Oaks, and I would highly recommend her brilliant service and attitude and will stay here once again. Thanks Emily for a fantastic stay. The accommodation was clean, modern and sophisticated with every appliance available to use in the self contained apartment. And the view from my apartment of Brisbane City was amazing. On the roof the pool, steam room and spas where a fantastic way at night to relax and take in the night time views of the city.  It is is close to shops and public transport so Oaks Woolloongabba is convenient place to stay.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_429478319~“Great view, very friendly and helpful staff”~Nice getaway to catch up with family. Double glazed Windows so you can't hear the city noise while you sleep.

review_427770039~“Business trip to Brisbane”~Spacious and comfortable, brand-spanking new. In-room facilities were excellent. A short walk (10 mins) to Stone's Corner, but would be nice to have something a little closer for the weary business traveller. Was booked as "with balcony" but as the room was on a north-facing corner, the balcony was completely glassed in, so really just another room.... Overall, would recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_426506898~“Value for money 👌”~The guest service agent Shana delivered customer service and professionalism that was second to none, the building is beautiful and new and clean, the rooftop is great with a pool and two spas, the appliances are high quality and you could easily live here long term, there are plenty of places for dinner and drinks nearby and your ver close to the city so uber was a cheap a good option, give it a try, good work by Oaks.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424859710~“Modern, spacious apartment”~We stayed here in a two bed apartment for Riverfire, what a fantastic hotel! Brand new, so beautiful rooms and stylish decor, very spacious and comfortable with a great kitchen. The roof terrace is gorgeous, two spas, steam room, a beautiful pool, BBQ areas, and many chill out areas! We watched the show from the terrace, what a treat! The pool was all lit up and looked so inviting. Located 2 mins from both bus and train stations, it's a short trip into the city.  Although the hotel is right near the train station the noise level is so minimal due to great double glazed windows.  Not a much located on site as yet, there is a cute cafe downstairs which does a scrumptious bacon & egg toastie! And it's a short 10 min walk to Stones Corner for some funky cafes and good shopping.  The staff were all lovely. We often stay in hotels in Brisbane when we want a night out, as we are about a 40 min drive away, we will definitely be back here again! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423628423~“Loved it!”~I stayed here overnight for work purposes. I was upgraded to a two bedroom apartment which was spacious and stylish. Everything was sparkling clean and the bed was very comfortable. The view from the roof is incredible and the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly. A great experience. They also do an awesome hot chocolate at the cafe next door. I will definitely stay here again. Thankyou!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_420696223~“Took some work but all ended well”~Once we finally worked out the logistics of a second person checking who wasn't the cardholder and that we needed parking for two it was full steam ahead. The room was very neat and tidy and well presented. The kitchen was the perfect size for whipping up a storm and an early breakfast. The roof top pool, spa and steam room were amazing. The city views were 360 degrees and very pretty at night.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_420400963~“It's the little things ...”~We started off well when we arrived early and were able to leave our car in the building whilst we went off and explored. We were told our room would be ready around 2pm. We came back close to 3.30pm to find that our room was not in fact ready. We were not offered an alternative. It seemed acceptable that we just sit in reception and wait. To be honest, the wait was only 10-15 mins long but then the advertised check in time is 2pm so we kind of expected to be able to get in straight away. The room was supposedly checked by housekeeping minutes before we were given it, but I walked in to crumbs on the kitchen benches, there are grease marks on the kitchen splash back tiles (can be seen if you turn the range hood on) and upon opening the mirrored cabinets in the bathroom, there were dusty / mildewy type spots over the rear wall. The accommodation is comfortable and new, so most of it is in good condition. The bed was comfortable and super big! The noise was persistent, but then knowing the area I was going to stay in, I did expect it. We were right above the pedestrian crossing so the noise was probably exacerbated by the fact we had cars. motorbikes and trucks accelerating from a stop right below us. The parking was easy to use and a fair cost. My complaints are only small in the bigger scheme of things, so I would recommend it as somewhere to stay. The location is super convenient for the hospital, trains and buses and you can actually walk to Southbank / City pretty easily.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_420003922~“Average”~For brand new apartments I was disappointed. The disappointment was walking into an upgraded 2bdrm apartment when it was just a couple only to find bench tops not clean & dishes dirty. The apartments themselves were very spacious but the bdrm & ensuite we very badly designed. No power point beside bed to charge the phone, the door in the bdrm and the bed were about 5cm apart so made it difficult to get in & out of the room. The last thing was the noise, not only in the other rooms & hallways but also from the trains going past.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419959459~“Everything we needed for overnight in Brisbane”~We attended a wedding at the nearby Latvian Hall, live at the Gold Coast so decided to stay overnight in Brisbane. I have stayed with Oaks once before with work, so decided to give it another try.  The location was about half a km walk via the path over the highway from our venue, so very close. Having said that, I'm not sure how safe it would be to walk home at midnight, so we were dropped back by friends. Our room was modern, clean and very comfortable. Check in wasa tad complicated as we had a car, so,parked in the visitors carpark underneath, but needed to 'buzz' to come up the lift to get to reception. This then took about 10 minutes to be served as there was only one staff member working. I had booked on-line so had already paid, but a further $150 was 'taken' as a 'deposit' .i do object to this as everywhere in Europe card details are held but credit is never taken- so don't know why this has to be ( then have to wait for the credit card refund minus the parking charge with an interest fee...) Bed was very comfortable, bathroom adequate ( but no hand towels). I would definitely consider Oaks again as a self- catering choice if needed.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_419706959~“Everything I needed & mote”~I was staying 2 nights in Brisbane while my husband was in hospital. It was in a very convenient area for the PA hospital but it was also convenient to food & shops. I found the roof top pool, bbq area and spas a great distraction and a great way to pass the time in between visiting hours. It's setting is very close to main roads & train lines but some very effective double glazing makes the noise fade into nothing.  Very new & very comfortable, I recommend this apartment highly.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417743963~“OK stay”~Nice and new hotel but felt a bit cold/clinical and lacking in atmosophere.  The room was not spotlessly clean either. Attention to detail lacking...Could be because it's so new. The receptionists were very friendly though.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~4~nan
review_415963423~“Would stay there again”~The room itself was good. Nice and spacious and clean. Beds good and plenty of cutlery and crockery etc. My only comment regarding the rooms was there were no hand towels. The location was not great for us. There were no real facilities such as shops, supermarkets and the like. We arrived late at night and the key was where we were told it would be but trying to find shops in the morning before our appointments was a bit hard.~3~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_415920957~“Great location, great price”~Brand new apartments, right next door to train and bus station. Undercover parking. Friendly and helpful reception staff. We will be back again as there is the option of the extra room which we normally need for 3 kids. Should have packed our togs for the rooftop pool and spa.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_415542649~“Lost our business”~We use the Oaks for business purposes and also whilst my wife is in hospital with complications from her cancer. My wife checked out one day early from having her last operation and not only wouldn't they refund the second night (which that is fine we booked for two night so I understand) they then went on to charge her credit card $15.25 for parking, despite not even having any disabled parking bays. Now that in itself is ok but it was the lies that were told when she called. On the morning she checked out Nikki had advised she would waive all car parking fees so there was nothing to pay. So when my wife called to question this she was told she would be put on hold. Unfortunately they didn't press the hold button and my wife heard the conversation she had with the manager basically saying there were no notes on file what should she do. The manager said that maybe the fees had been waived for the second night. The receptionist then went on to tell my wife there were notes on file left by Nikki and she was on the front desk herself yesterday which was a total lie as there was only Nikki on the front desk and two people waiting in reception to view one of the apartments. They have lost around $10,000 a year in business as I booked most of our clients in to the Oaks for the sake of $15.25.~2~nan~nan~4~nan~5~1~nan
review_414120550~“Great accommadation at a great price!!!”~My husband and i stayed in a one bedroom apartment, the room was very spacious, with a good size balcony to enjoy the fresh air and the apartment had everything you needed as it is fully self contained.  The rooftop terrace with a pool, two spas, two barbecue areas a chess set and plenty of seating ranging from lounges, bean bags, sun lounges and a hammock was a beautiful area to enjoy. Just the pool was a little cold(not heated) for the time of year we visited.  There was onsite secure car parking at a cost of $15 a night.  There is a cafe just at the front of the hotel for convenience although there are also shops, supermarkets and the train station that are all in walking distance. It is a quick 10 minute drive into Brisbane City and about an hour drive to the Gold Coast.  Great accommodation at a great price.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_413694960~“"Great holiday,great accommodation."”~Great accommodation,very nice new building,well set out unit with everything needed to enjoy stay.The outdoor area on top with lap pool , barbecue and spa ect. was great. Buses,trains and shopping close by.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_412532957~“⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️5 STAR LUXURY AT A BUDGET PRICE ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️”~I stayed here on Friday 26th Aug for unfortunately only 1 night.  I have previously stayed within the Oaks chain and have absolutely loved it so being a new hotel and apart of the Oaks chain, booking here was definitely a must to check it out. I booked a 1 bedroom apartment for myself and my sister to stay in as we had a business training seminar to attend early the next day.  Upon arrival the two lovely ladies at front office (sorry I don't remember their names) were ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! They were extremely friendly and very helpful. Definitely an asset to the hotel!!  We had room 708 on the 7th floor and it ended up being a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment although we didn't use the 2nd bedroom or bathroom as they're were signed "upgrade your booking to use this room" and we were only there for 1 night so we just shared the most comfortable big king size bed.  The pillows on the bed were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!  Super soft and fluffy.. I really need to know where they are from so I can purchase some for myself haha.  Upon entry into the room.. It was absolutely immaculate, clean and new (although the toilet roll holder in the bathroom was missing)  The style and decoration of the room was beautiful and modern but yet still simplistic.  There was plenty of storage throughout and full wall mirrored medicine cabinets in the bathrooms and mirrored doors on the built-in wardrobes as well.  (We all know how much us women love mirrors ) The apartment is fully self contained and had EVERYTHING you could possibly need. There was air con in each bedroom and lounge room which kept the entire apartment snug and warm when it cooled off.. This will also be a bonus when the weather heats up again too.  Off the lounge room through the floor to ceiling, wall to wall double glazed sliding doors was a large balcony with beautiful views at night overlooking O'Keefe St.  I unfortunately didn't get to go to the roof top but will next time.  Next time I am in Brisbane wether it be with my family or for business, I will definitely not hesitate in  re-booking here again.  Thank you Oaks for another amazing stay, I look forward to staying with you again in the near future. Kellie  P.S - If you have not stayed with the Oaks, you are seriously missing out!! It really is pure 5 Star Luxury at a 3 star budget price!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412440003~“enjoyed”~had a great time really nice place to stay the pool and spa on the roof really done it for me up there at night looking out over the city. being able to sit out on the deck to suck back a few cold one was a highlight.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_412047685~“Oaks Woolloongabba”~The Oaks Woolloongabba is a very nice new hotel. The rooms were immaculate and very modern and the bed was very comfortable. It has a great rooftop pool area and it is very handy to The Gabba and Brisbane~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_409159861~“Modern and clean”~Happy to have found this accommodation! The apartments are serviced daily (we were surprised to find a lot of holiday apartments aren't) and are modern and clean. Staff are excellent. Price wasn't too bad - we stayed 5 nights and I think it worked out to be about $175 a night. Major draw back is paying $15aud per night for a carpark - this adds up after a few nights. It wasn't really made clear on arrival that we would be charged for it, we read it later on in the paperwork. Free unlimited wireless was great too. There is a lap pool and 2 spa pools on the roof which have amazing views~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408558126~“great stay”~Got this in a deal as it has just opened so very nice rooms ,lovely reception staff.bit if a draw back having to pay for parking, and check WiFi as there can be some charges attached . We found it in a great location for us.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_406421678~“Fantastic Unit”~Unit was beautiful and new, pool and spa area is stunning, will go back. View was amazing from the roof top pool and spa. Booking was a little tricky make sure you check your confirmation when it is emailed.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_406389074~“Will be back”~Upon arrival the staff were very welcoming, we were able to check in early.  The rooms are very new, clean and spacious. Being a new hotel there isn't any restaurants within the building at this stage, but the reception staff were very knowledgeable of the area and were able to point us in the direction of where to go.  the only issue which was a small issue as the ability to hear the traffic, but some of that is due to my husband and I being from the country. It didn't keep us awake which is the main thing.  This hotel is great value for money and I will be staying here again~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_405937219~“Wow Wow Wow”~That is all I could say when I arrived to my room. This place is 5 star luxury at a bargain price. The apartment as everything you could want. Full size fridge, oven, microwave, toaster, kettle, washer/dryer a huge walk in robe: not forgetting the balcony and the roof top pool. The only negatives I can think of and I had to think hard is 1) It is an apartment block that is shared with owner/buyers 2) If you are heading the wrong way down OKeefe street it can be hard to reach.  I will most certainly be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405931352~“Clean, Spacious & New ”~The staff are great, and eager to help without being overbearing. We walked in and felt relaxed.  The car park entrance can only be approached from Ipswich Road unfortunately. You can however turn right at Carl St & go round the block if you do miss it. Otherwise access is pretty good.  Chinos across the road is fairly good for breakfast. Alternatively a short walk over the railway lines along the bike path,there is a lovely cafe called Stellarossa.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405867442~“Excellent accommodation.Wonderful room with great city views and spa and pool on rooftop.”~We booked for two nights then did some traveling and returned for six more nights.  We more than enjoyed our stay. We had a great room which was fully self contained.Excellent value.The staff were very professional,friendly and helpful.The location is excellent and handy to public transport if required. We would definitely stay here again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_405546267~“Very Clean and Confortable”~I booked this hotel because it was near where I was going the next day not expecting very much for a low price. However I found it to be a very large suite with two bedrooms and two dining areas. Each room have its own ensuite and all the mod cons one could desire in a kitchen. The suite was immaculate. The staff were very helpful telling me where I could find a nice resaurant.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_404696588~“Awesome”~We booked a one bedroom apartment using the 'opening special'. The apartment was a great size, clean and fresh as you would expect of a new facility. Good sized TV, good lounge, great open awning. The bathroom was a touch small and lacking storage space, but it was sufficient. Great location for access to the hospital, the city, or the airport.  When you open the doors you do get some noise, but close them and the double glazing takes care of all the noise.  No I house dining yet - still being finished off.  Overall, well above average and as long as the normal price is not outlandish we will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403126407~“New, convenient to public transport and hospitals.”~We stayed in a two bedroom apartment on the 6th floor that overlooks the city. The apartment is a good size, brand new, nicely decorated, has a well-equipped kitchen, good WiFi and aircon in each bedroom as well as in the living space (I think that this will be a necessity in summer). The hotel is surrounded by major roads, however, for the most part, the noise heard from the road/trains is minimal. The public transport options are excellent with both a train station and major bus station nearby. The rooftop (9th floor) has two spas, pool and BBQ area. This area can be used up to 10pm. Friendly and polite people on reception.~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_402742869~“New Oaks!”~This is a brand new property about 15 min from the airport. i am a regular OAKS patron, who likes the cookie cutter version. This one has great beds, great pillows, lovely kitchen. The balcony is enclosed with small windows you can open, and no TV in the bed rooms. The bathroom is on the smaller side with no storage and has a shelve in the shower which is great, but the actual shower head is right up against it. The sign in the hallway which tells you which way your room is is actually on the Lift side (not the opposite wall like usually) and the car park is super confusing and also costs you $15.00 Per night. The staff where great - nothing is a hassle, but please note that on one side the rooms are over the train tracks as well as the freeway. (windows are double glazed, but the trains love their horns and they seemed to go all night)~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_402340805~“Everything was perfect”~I almost don't want to post this review incase more people find out about this amazing place.Service was amazing. room was everything we wanted. I can't wait for an excuse to come back and stay here another night~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402228093~“clean brand new apartment”~Stayed the weekend after visiting Brsibane for work. Apartments are brand new. So everything is clean and new. Everything you need in a self contained aparment is there including nice big TV with all foxtel channels. I satayed in a single room apartment in the 4th floor. Very spacious apartment with large walk in robe area with plenty of room for your baggage etc. Good size kitchen with good equipment (if youbare into cooking!) Good basement car park with enough room to get in and out (I hate car parks you can hardly get in and out in a decent size car!). Nice friendly receptionist too. I was very happy and hard to find a fault. Only thing missing is an inhouse gym. But there is 24hr gym very close by which has discounted casual rates for the hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_400591591~“What a wonderful place to stay”~Great location for anyone needing to visit the RPA hospital. There is also small shopping centre nearby with Wooloworths and Target. The 1 bedroom apartment that we stayed in had everything we would ever need to cater for our stay. Everything was in excellent condition as it's only been open for 3 weeks. My husband and I loved the extra high, but soft, pillows supplied.The Rooftop area was amazing, just wished that it was warmer weather for us to enjoy it, (next visit hopefully). The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We thought that road noise may be an issue as you room was on the end close to the motorway. The double glazing in the bedroom stopped most of the noise and it was just a light hum that I am sure helped me sleep. Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_397825045~“Comfortable Stay”~Rooms brand new with everything you could need for a short stay, traffic noise louder than expected, and if you want to park underneath the building they charge you an extra $15 on top of your already paid room price, which always leaves a sour taste when you shop around for a good deal and find its not all-inclusive! We would stay here again though, as facilities were good.~4~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_396425503~“All Brand New - Room 609”~Lovely hotel, unit was well appointed. Full kitchen, oven, stove, dishwasher, laundry cupboard with a washing machine and dryer, vacuum cleaner, broom, mop & bucket and a clothes airer. Everything brand new.  On first glance everything looked amazing, although there was evidence that the apartment had not been fully cleaned following opening (ie: a large but thin smear of silicone on the island bench, grout and plaster dust in the bathroom, builders finger prints on the kitchen draws). On a close inspection there were a few little rough points such as the top two draws in the walk through robe were ill fitted, and the paint job around some of the power points was a little rough, but nothing that affected the quality of my stay. There was a lovely balcony that covered the entire frontage of the apartment, however the traffic noise was so loud it wouldn't have been pleasant to sit out there as a group, on your own you could deal with it. The helecoptors for the hospital on Sunday morning at 4am were a little loud too, double glazing would have been a big benefit for those apartments facing the road. The pillows were all VERY high too. So, if you like a thinner pillow, perhaps BYO. The roof top area is amazing. Stunning views of the city, a lap pool, two spa baths, a sauna, chess area and two BBQ areas with electric bbq's, sinks, lots of seating, tables and chairs, couches and, did I mention the view! All in all I would stay again. The road noise is really the only thing that stopped the review being a 5 out of 5, although that's not totally the hotel's fault!~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_396010178~“Convenience with luxury”~The unit was perfect for our needs - fully appointed and self contained with all you could need for a long stay - laundry, cooking, and cleaning facilities Wonderful rooftop BBQ with lap pool and two large hot tubs and two steam rooms with spectacular views in all directions. For those who like walking and running and cycling there are dedicated paths totally protected from motorised traffic into the city and Southbank that don't cross any roads which can be accessed about 100m from the front door. Public transport is also available at the same location. Stones Corner with alfresco dining and coffee is also just a short walk.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
