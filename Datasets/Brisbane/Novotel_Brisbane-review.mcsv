review_478383074~“Welcoming and Warm”~After the previous weeks stay at another Novotel in Brisbane, I was worried that the chain had lost is sparkle. I need not have worried as the welcome and amenities at Novotel Creek Street were fantastic. On arrival, i was welcomed, thanked for my loyalty, upgraded to a premier floor and offered a free drink, and also vouchers for a coffee to start my day, each and every morning of my stay. I had a great, clean room, with a fantastic balcony and my favourite item, a Nespresso machine. Complimentary water added each day. I love it when a hotel gets it right, and really makes me feel valued for staying loyal. Completely the opposite experience from my previous week at the Airport. I also love the respect for the hanging towels and that whilst I am travelling I can minimise my impact on the environment.  Thanks Novotel Team Creek Street Brisbane. See you soon.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan

review_477634041~“Comfortable and central”~An easy walk from the river in a good location. Rooms are comfortable, especially on premium floor. Gym is tiny. Don't use all the milk on the first day.

review_477581723~“Great Easter Break”~Paid $250 for 2 nights including parking but no breakfast. 11th floor, good sized room with comfy bedding. If you ask to join their loyalty programme (no charge), you can have free wifi for up to 3 devices. Our TV stopped working although the remote etc was fine so rang reception who promptly sent up a young maintenance guy. He arrived with a mallet and proceeded to knock the cupboard piece open next to the TV - lo and behold, all the switches. So he simply turned the power on and off to reboot the system, which got the TV going, then he replaced the bit of wood and all was good. Lol, highlight of the stay. Also rang for soft pillows and also bathrobes and they were delivered promptly. Love the top knotch service and friendly staff. A special shout-out to Jess and Michel. Thanks guys, we had a great stay.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477461225~“Average At Best”~Checked into the hotel on Wednesday for a 2 night stay. Was informed that the restaurant was closed for dinners through the whole of April which I thought was a bit strange. Not sure why this was but was happy to have dinner in the bar. Arrived in the bar about 6.30 and it was in full swing. Couldn't find any where to sit because every table and couch was occupied but that did not stop the staff from trying to satisfy our needs. Kyle who was working in the bar both nights we came to visit was extremely helpful and was one of the fastest staff members we have ever seen. Watching Kyle and the other girl (with blonde hair) whos name I didn't catch run around like crazy was a site to behold. Surely more staff could have helped as they both seemed quite stressed. Didn't receive the great service like we usually do when we visit the Novotel and left just feeling like any old customer. A bit of a let down but will still stay again.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~2~nan

review_477249506~“Reasonable city hotel”~Clean room & reasonable facilities. Pool is typical of a city hotel, lack of sunshine on the terraces. Breakfast was adequate but the quality could be improved & finding a clean table was a challenge.  Staff were courteous. Seems well soundproofed which is important after a long flight when you want to rest!

review_475473686~“not a bad for the money but nothing special”~An old place that has been freshened up, you can tell they are cutting costs with room cleaning as there was old food and rubbish under the furniture, shower over bath, really narrow and hard to enjoy a shower without breaking your toe on the plug~3~3~2~3~3~2~4~nan
review_475443115~“First and last stay”~I stayed for 2 nights. Arrived late, around 11pm, no one at reception and took more than 5 minutes to get someone's attention. I asked if my room was quiet, which I was told it was... only to realize that the room was facing the rail tracks and a main road... my bathroom had hair from previous guests and on the 2nd evening I was visited by a cockroach when attending an audio conference... gross... also mattress super soft... overall, poor value for money~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473707031~“Great Hotel to stay in Brisbane”~Stayed overnight in Novotel Brisbane (Creek St).  Great rooms; very roomy; great service and welcoming staff. Came in by train.

review_473597256~“The staff at this Novotel made our visit memorable. ”~As Accor Club members, we always stay at the hotels in this group when we visit a major city. I had trawled through all the ones in Brisbane and read quite a few reviews. I booked this Novotel based on the generally positive reviews I had read and its central location in Brisbane. It was easy to drive to from the airport and when we drove up , we were immediately met by a member of staff- Jordan. He is such a credit to your hotel with his cheerfulness, enthusiasm and professional attitude. Not only did he give us a warm welcome, give my husband directions to the car park and take our bags inside but he also checked us in, acknowledged our upgrade, booked us in to the restaurant, gave us a map, offering advice on places we could visit, took us to our room, delivered our luggage and finally brought us a luggage rack and two bottles of water. All these little touches made such a good first impression of the Novotel Brisbane and the standards of service that are aspired to. Our room on the 14th floor was modern, clean and the bed was soooo comfortable. We were also impressed with the restaurant menu and our food was amazing. My husband had to ask for his steak to be served plain but second time around, it was cooked to perfection. Hayden, we think he was the restaurant manager, was very attentive and had an excellent knowledge of the wines, something which is not very common in hotel restaurants in my experience. As I work in the wine industry, I was impressed that he took time out to chat to me about how the wines in the restaurant were chosen. My only suggestion would be to add a dessert wine to accompany the superb desserts on the menu. Breakfast was also excellent, again our only suggestion is that the baked beans are served with no onion as people with onion allergies cannot eat them! Again, the staff on duty were helpful and friendly. As we were leaving, one of the cleaning staff on our floor acknowledged us and wished us a lovely day- again something which we rarely come across in Accor Club Hotels. We were able to store the luggage behind the desk until we returned to drive to the airport. We hope that all the staff will be congratulated for their friendly and helpful attitude as well as their professionalism. We would definitely return to the Novotel on our next visit to Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472921902~“great stay in Brisbane”~Had a lovely 3 day visit to Brisbane and stayed at the Novotel in Creek st. Room was quiet and well furnished and in great order. Hotel staff couldn't be more helpful, giving us info on how to get the buses nearby and info on the attractions around. Breakfasts were lovely. Eggs could be cooked to order and great varieties of fruits cereals and breads apart from assorted fried options. Lovely terrace was a haven away from families.

review_472070846~“One night stay”~My Fiancé & I stayed one night at the Novotel and loved it! Our room wasn't ready when we checked in so we got put up to the next floor, same room type but balcony! Love the rooms with decorations and art works. We stayed on the premier floor, worth the extra money if you can afford it. Nespresso pod machine in your room for a lovely coffee. I really love how all the information you need to do with the hotel and surrounds is on the TV and the room service menu as well.No flicking through books for a few minutes trying to find what your chasing. Excellent spot in Brisbane just near Central station.Steep hill but if you cant walk it definitely catch a Taxi. Short stroll in the Queen Street Mall. Theres water in the reception which is a nice touch if you've gone out walking and need a quick drink to cool down. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely and arrived fast. Breakfast was also fantastic plenty to choose from and always refilled. Barista coffee was included you just had to go and get it yourself. Love everything about this Novotel! Good undercover parking at a reasonable price considering your location.Big thanks to Jake for helping me order a Taxi & for looking after us so well! :)~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472042571~“Tired and in need of refurbishment”~I have stayed in some very nice Novotel properties all over the world... I am afraid this is not one of them. The rooms are looking very tired... it looks like they have had new furniture and bedsteads added but the bathrooms are dated. Some issues with my room: - the bathroom smelt stale.. some of the tiles were dirty and the grouting wasn't great. - the safe didn't work at all - the door card reader was temperamental and frequently required many swipes to work On the upside, the breakfast was pretty good and the staff were nice! Was this awful? Of course not! Was this great? No. Would I stay here again? No.  And seriously, paid wifi?~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_471983002~“Comfiest bed!”~Just had a lovely night's stay at Novotel Brisbane. Very well located a short walk to public transport and shopping. Friendly staff and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Nice bar downstairs.

Great service, staff excellent, always smiling, upgraded to Premier Room which was much appreciated, have stayed here about six times and it just gets better, a walk up the hill from Central Train station, I find this hotel central for adventures into Fortitude Valley and also the city, no problems finding my way back late at night, hot days by the pool, evenings out in Brisbane, just a great stay. Exceptionally clean and well serviced. Thank you Novotel.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470728053~“TERRIBLE!”~1. Called in arvo on hold for 10mins no answer. Had received a weird confirmed email that only said for 1 adult not 2 and didnt confirm anytning like parking or the latest check in time. 2. Got there car didnt fit in park 3. Called spoke to reception then put us on hold for over 5mins just to pass us to someone else and not even brief her on why we called. 4. Free valet driver to park car in loading zone (car isnt even that big, 2.1m and fit in novotel airport hotel parking) but they adjusted everything in the car and left the aircon on, did they drive it more than just to park? 5. Staff rude 6. Must have been upgraded to a more expensive room as we booked room with 2 double beds and got a room with a king bed in the second highest floor. Was expecting it to be the best in the hotel. Room was small, old, hallways smelt weird and unclean, bathroom wasnt clean so dusty, brown stain on the wall next to bed carelessly not cleaned, sheets creased and no doona cover just sheets wtf? Whole room styled outdated dirty and smelt weird, bathroom needing renovation. 7. Noone explained the card needed for power in the room. Took ages to figure out then also leaving aircon on to sleep but no lights took ages to figure out. Bad experience should be explained by reception! 8. Roomservice lady at door pushed past me and just entered, extremely rude! 9. Not buying the whole 'save the planet' use of services, more like just to save you guys money and power bills. 10. Dinner meats were tough and bad cuts of meat not worth the price at all! 11. Restaurant has lights turned off at 8:30??? Who does that, so we can book at 8:15pm but be in darkness by 8:30pm and obviously the food would not be out by then. 12. Staff took so long to do anything, slow and inefficient 13. Whole hotel was a dissappointment, not worth the 4-4.7 stars advertised. Novotel airport awarded less stars and it was great so we only bookws novotel brisbane as we were expecting amazing. 14. Only went to you guys since we had the best experience at novotel airport it was amazing there spacious new super clean luxury room, food was AMAZING meat so tender staff polite (besides a small asian lady serving at dinner who was extremely rude and grumpy). Overall an amazing stay room decorated modernly and felt luxurious. Extremely dissappointed should of gone to novotel airport wish we could redo it. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469956088~“Mini Bar list price”~Every thing it's alright, but I suggest that they have to put the price list for all snack and drink at mini bar. The view not to bad. The location is a bit far from city attraction. The customer service is good.~4~3~3~5~4~4~4~nan
review_469756347~“Winner for Brisbane CBD stay”~Have been staying in a few hotels in a few cities for business lately, and this one has been by far the nicest, and best price as well. Nice, vibrant hotel just a comfortable walk from the centre. Spacious, sparkling room with an outlook over streetscape, and still quiet. The whole place is humming with industrious meeting attendees and business types. Breakfast included in rate (a special, I believe) and a great choice of hot buffet and also lovely fruit. All in all, enjoyed my stay and would definitely come again for my next business trip to Brisbane.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469730190~“Dated and difficult location”~The room on the 11th floor was dated and obviously needs renovation. To shower you stand in a high bath with a hand rail on one side and a folding glass screen on the other. Very narrow and difficult to manoeuvre especially with protruding metal plug that you kick every two seconds. Dangerous and amazing no one falls. Beds are old and pillows ordinary. The service and food in the cafe at the reception area is outstanding. The young English server this morning was extremely professional and courteous. Check in and out was very slow and took forever. Gym is better than most and pool looks nice. Taxis and Uber have difficulty finding it. Overall though very disappointing and needs updating.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~4~4~nan
review_469486408~“Brisbane Novotel inner city stay”~Reception staff very welcoming. Room upgrade was an excellent bonus. Dinner - service excellent by Taylor. Food fresh and tasty with generous servings. Great choices for buffet breakfast. Only negative TV is no longer in the newly renovated bar area. Bar area a great place to sit and have a drink but we had to retire to our rooms for the men to watch football. The costs of drinks is a little expensive. One beer and a glass of red wine cost a member of our group $17.~5~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan

Rooms are clean, comfortable and have all that you need. I liked the fair trade shampoo/ conditioners/soap etc..! Menu is a little over-priced at the bar and restaurant, but atmosphere is good.

review_467209656~“Disappointed on this occasion :(”~Novotel Brisbane has always been our No.1 choice for city accommodation in Brisbane, and prior to this I would have said it was always a 10/10 stay. However, I felt like the hotel is starting to slip a little. Pillows need replacing, they are old and lumpy (I didn't dare look inside the cover to see what the pillow actually looked like - I might have ended up sleeping without one). Duvet is also starting to feel lumpy inside, like the wadding is coming apart inside. The beds are still the most heavenly soft beds I've EVER slept on which is a positive ;) Where the reception staff are usually neat, tidy and very professional looking (even down to their polished fingernails) the young woman at reception was quite blunt, her hair was a mess and she honestly looked like she had just crawled out of bed with a hangover. Breakfast restaurant staff were hopeless (maybe they were new?), it took the chef two attempts to make an omelette (the first time it was served raw in the middle) then it took forever for a new one to appear. Continental breakfast was terrible - croissants, pastry items, muffins and donuts were STALE. And what happened to real coffee? Yes there is an instant coffee machine, but when we asked about a proper coffee we were told they are not available anymore. WTF?? This is the second time breakfast has been a let down, and it's not cheap either, so I would recommend making the five minute stroll into the mall to find something better (and cheaper). Thumbs up, however, for the guy working in the bar on Saturday night! The most AMAZING espresso martini and mojito cocktails, plus a complimentary REAL coffee and muesli bar at 11pm was greatly appreciated! It would be disappointing to think that this fall from perfection is a permanent thing... Maybe it was just a one-off weekend where the receptionist and chef had a late night together out on the booze and neither of them wanted to be there on a Saturday morning?? Some fresh new pillows and duvets would be in order. Nothing was serious enough to put us off from staying at the Novotel Brisbane again, we've had more great experiences there than bad! But we won't be eating breakfast there anymore, and if the bedding hasn't had a refresh next time we stay we'll probably start looking for alternative accommodation in future.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_467092201~“Impressive 3 night stay”~Clean, tidy with a comfortable bar area which extended outside which was even accessible for breakfast...

review_467091453~“Poached eggs were excellent this time”~Second visit to this hotel, I ordered the chicken satay skewers as a late lunch whilst doing some work in the room, and they were very good, shower, bed, all good. I thought I would order the poached eggs again for breakfast. I was asked how I wanted them and they were cooked to perfection. Only criticism is as an Accorrplus silver member that I have paid for, there is no real priority check-in or out when everybody is the same line. But on the whole a good stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465143911~“Nigh Away.”~We stayed at the Novotel overnight as my younger sister was attending Good Life. We booked a room with a good rate that included breakfast - wow. As the kids were under 16 they stayed and ate for free. The hotel was in a great location. Staff were wonderful on checkin - even checked in early and room was ready. When we arrived we just wanted to relax so we got our vehicle valet parked for an extra $10 - was worth it. My partner and i dined in the restaurant for dinner and using our accor membership we got 50% off - our meal was 10/10. We had breakfast included and used it the day of departure. Service was great at breakfast and food was lovely. We will definitely be back and visit again soon.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_464967698~“Great hotel location but a little hard to find”~Sometimes its great to find a great stay away from main city throng. Novotel, Brisbane is one of these but it can be hard to find, due to Brisbane's road infrastructure.. The hotel is nicely located in the Spring Hill district, easy access from Brisbane's Central train station and within walking distance to the Valley &Wickham Tec. Difficulty seems to be with taxi drivers not knowing the how to access to Novotel entrance, may drop you at end of the arcade.-30m away  Better signage would help visitors and transport companies ~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

When served no recognition of gold le club status by staff member however pleasantly upgraded to a premium room. Apart from being on a higher floor the rooms are very basic and remind you of a 60,s motel room with an ikea upgrade.

In the 4 years since we have started staying the service and friendliness of the staff has continued to improve but sadly the building and public areas are looking a bit tired. I would also like to see a bigger change in the breakfast buffet - there are a few organic offerings tucked away in the corner but I think it's time to move away from the generic breakfast cereals and offer something a bit different. Having said all this the Novotel Brisbane is probably the best value for families wanting to stay close to the CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan

review_457315900~“Hasn't got the basics down”~The most annoying problem is that WiFi is not complimentary. The front desk staff asked us to sign up and become members for instant free WiFi--which our party did, but we were unable to access it. There is, however, free WiFi in the lobby and restaurant area. Also note that there is no signal (no WiFi or data) in some areas of the carpark. Additionally, charging via the USB ports is very slow and sometimes does not work. If that happens, simply charge using the ports on the side of the TV.  The TV is a problem on its own. Signal was very bad and we could not manage to watch anything at all--refer to photos. Staying in Novotel Brisbane also gave me some security concerns. Firstly, the room doors are pretty flimsy, and the toilet doors have a big gap underneath (some do not lock well) which could potentially be a problem if you are sharing a room with someone.  Secondly, a staff member tried to use a keycard to gain access to my friend's room well after midnight--imagine the fright when she asked her young daughter to call down to the front desk, and the staff there replied that they hadn't sent anyone up. It was apparently a noise complaint. I completely understand that the hotel has to take action if some guests feel disturbed, but this was not the way to go about it. There were no calls to their room or knocks, just a person trying to get into a room with a showering mother and young daughter after midnight. Communication between staff was poor, as shown by the fact that the front desk said they hadn't sent a staff member up to their room. It was extremely frightening and inappropriate. The hotel seems to have been refurbished recently, but is still in dire need for maintenance--refer to the photos. For example, the sink tap creaks loudly when turned on. You do have to bring your own dental kit, but other toiletries such as shampoo and shower cap are provided. The toiletries were of a good standard, and are basically the same as in every other Novotel in the world. Personally, I find Novotel not offering complimentary water quite strange--not a negative, just unusual. Our stay wasn't completely bad--the breakfast was good. The food options remained the same every day but you pretty much have everything a continental breakfast has, such as eggs, bacon, sausages, bread and juice. Most of the staff, such as the cleaning staff and restaurant staff were polite and accommodating.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan

Chinatown for variety of restaurants; river side for more expensive restaurants, pay for view; Southbank for a stroll and maybe a leisurely lunch. Brisbane Central Railway station a short 5 minute stroll away, when you find the shortest route from the maze of streets.  Hotel comfortable and, at cost, has a good breakfast. Great stay.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

review_455795015~“A great base in Brisbane CBD”~This is a good value for money hotel on the very edge of the CBD. It has comfortable spacious rooms with a good breakfast area, friendly and convenient bar and breakfast areas. The swimming pool is great and the gym is pretty good too. I have been to meetings in the meeting rooms and I liked them as well. The one down side is that the curtains in the bed rooms could be props for the chain saw massacre.. Have a look at my picture and you'll see what I mean.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_455563323~“The best value for money ever”~I could not believe how good this hotel is for the price It is well situated close to the Central Railway station And walking distance to the Queen Street Mall The staff were all helpful and friendly especially the house maid that greeted us as we departed the lift and directed us to our room What a lovely introduction to the hotel The facility are great, the pool area is large and the pool clean The gym is well equipped The rooms are clean and furnished nicly The only thing that let it down was the food in the Pantry Restaurant which unfortunately I can't recommend The bar tender in the lobby bar makes a mean margarita - that I can recommend This is a great hotel for business or pleasure ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455104909~“Everything was excellent not until”~We stayed here for 5 days 4 nights, we are Accor members so, we get to stay in the 14th floor where premium rooms are located. The room was nice and very comfortable. There is also cot for our baby as requested. They also have a bath. In short, we loved our stay in their room. At the cafe,  food is also as tasty as the Pantry (their fine dining restaurant at the hotel), maybe because I order the same food all the time which is the Spice market fish for lunch. It's the most substantial food on their menu so I order it all the time hahahahaha. Regarding the Pantry, Their food was also awesome and tasty, we had their chicken wings and lamb with couscous the night before Australia day, it was very good. Both, of their customer service is okay, just lack of smile for the waitress at the Cafe during lunch time.  Gym & Pool Their gym is OK, it was good actually. Everytime we go there, it is not busy so it was relaxing and easy for me to do some work out even simple exercise. Close to their gym, is their pool area, it was simple but clean maybe not as fancy as Sofitel has, but it was good. We had a family swim on Australia day.  Customer Service Room to Room service was excellent! The cleaners and the waiters or waitresses that served us for room service. They are all very helpful. The concierge and the bell boy when we arrived, I am with my 7 month old baby and the concierge and the bell boy who are on duty at that time noticed me upon arrival and the bell boy quickly helped me with my 2 big luggages, the concierge at that time was professional and very direct, I did not have any issues at all. We had complimentary drinks and lamington.  However, Today, when we had our late check our, I called the concierge her name is Jess and she was actually nice over the phone. I asked her to bring help to our room for I have 2 big luggages and one pram with baby to carry. So, she did. When we went downstairs and I was actually in front of the queue waiting for someone to attend me, She, came and she started asking "other" people who are foreigners and I was the only Asian there "I am already in front of her" because I waited for someone to attend me and yet she didn't even bother looking at me not until I called her attention and said "excuse me, Jess?" And I immediately reminded her that am the one who she is speaking with over the phone regarding the late check out and that is the only time she really faced me and pay attention to what I sat, but prior to that she was looking at the others who are not even on the queue and I was already in front of her with a baby pram. She really acted oppositely this time I don't know?! Maybe because she realised that am not a bystander or a typical Filo that can be ignored? We stayed at different Accor hotels worldwide and non of their staff treated me this way. But, anyway, regardless of who ever your customers maybe you should not make them feel like you try to deprioritise by race? No one deserves that! Just do your job, smile and be professional. If there's a CCTV camera you'd confirm that this happened. I was shaking my head in front of Jess to let her know that I know what she did to me. Anyway, in the end she helped me with keeping my 2 big luggages temporarily at the concierge.  Overall, we liked our stay, but maybe next time will stay again with Sofitel. We love all the Accor member hotels but this is the first time I was a bit dismay by an act of one of their staff. We hope that this won't happen anymore in the future. We liked the hotel itself but customer service can affect overall rating :-) Maybe the Concierge Manager can debrief their staff how to treat their customers equally. We are your customers not a bystanders. We pay so please just give us a good smile, equal treatment and professionalism.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455101350~“Great Relocation Hotel”~We used the Novotel as a base as we had moved up from Sydney. Being central and close to everything, it was the perfect hotel for us. The hotel is very close to Central station which made it easy to get around. Breakfast was excellent and would recommend getting a breakfast rate or pre pay the special that is always on offer when you book. The hotel has a nice relaxed feel about it and the staff were very friendly. I managed to book a day too early, so I emailed the hotel and Andrew kindly changed my dates and held the amount paid for the room as a hotel spend credit, which was beyond what I expected. Special mention to the front desk staff. When we arrived, we came off a flight that was diverted from Abu Dhabi to Perth. The Crew from the flight were also staying and when I mentioned about the medical issues on the flight, the front desk staff made sure they got looked after. Overall, a nice hotel that is centrally located with super friendly staff!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_455088886~“Needs to improve customer service & communication to staff”~Overall a comfortable hotel in a good location though there are a few things that overshadowed our experience.  We were not happy with how hotel management responded to the situation in which our housekeepers left our door wedged open with a towel for the whole day. The manager did not seem to care much and didn't even apologise or call us with an explanation later. When I enquired as to what happened later on (expecting there to have been some sort of investigation into the matter) the hotel manager said he had forgot and would call Housekeeping "soon". Needless to say, I never heard back from him, even though I asked again that night and the following day. Appalling.  When we returned from a full day out exploring, we noticed our breakfast dishes were still outside our room and were beginning to smell. I called reception and asked kindly if someone could take them away. An hour later we were ready to go out for dinner, and noticed the breakfast dishes were still there. I notified reception about it on the way out and they assured me they would take care of it. When we returned from our dinner at 11.30pm, the stinky dishes were still there!!! *facepalm* As Accor Plus members, we felt ignored and under-valued during our stay.  ~2~3~4~4~3~4~2~nan
review_454713761~“Service was excellent!”~We were brought here after missing our connecting flight by the airline. After a long flight check-in was so easy & friendly. We then had dinner in the hotl restaurant The Pantry. It stayed open later so we could eat a nice dinner, the food was great and the service from our French maitre d' was excellent. Very friendly & understanding of our situation.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_454163936~“Amazing from start to finish ”~From the friendly check in to the amazing comfort of our room even though it was just a standard room we were so impressed, to the quality of our food (room service, breakfast and dinner saturday night) to a wonderful dip in the pool, if your looking for a family hotel look no further we will be telling everyone we know about this hotel and recommending it. I was blown away and we will return!!!! Thank you for an amazing weekend. (Small thing i would suggest and it didn't impact my weekend in any way but i would suggest a clock in pool area so people can keep an eye on time, and foxtel kids channel was very jumpy)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453936631~“Luxury Escape”~Checkin was easy , parking available (at a charge) rooms clean & Tidy but bathrooms need a refurbish. Arrived around 7.30 so decided to have dinner in the hotel at The Pantry, service was very slow and then the steak which was $42.00 was overcooked but had waited so long we where starving, did advise the waiter of this though. Saturday Night our family joined us for dinner and we booked for The Reef & Beef once again in The Pantry for 7.30, we ordered around 7.40 only to be told about 10 minutes later they had sold out of The Reef & Beef very disappointing , so we found other dishes to order then to be told they had no Sweet Potato Fries as a side order, we then proceeded to wait over 50 minutes for our Dinner and we only had Main Meals as we had drinks & nibbles in the Bar earlier. There was no apology for the delay and we where not even asked if we enjoyed our dinner , I think the wait staff where aware that the delay was unacceptable.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_453729963~“Pleasant but not perfect”~My partner & I stayed here with another couple as we celebrated the festivities over the Xmas period. I must say the hotel lobby was nice, smelt wonderful, looked great and bright. Unfortunately this was not complimented by the lady on reception who enjoyed a conversation with her colleague while we stood there (no one else in line) she had no decency to greet us let alone even look at me while completing the check in process.  Overall the hotel was pleasant, the rooms were spacious but slightly tired. A missing bulb and hole in the ceiling to the entrance of our room greeted us - making the entrance quite dark. A big brown stain in the middle of the carpet did not give the cleanest feeling to the room. Overall the stay was alright; but small details such as missing light bulbs & stains should be taken care of immediately. The pool area is a bit sad and doesn't feel exciting or refreshing. It felt like a public swimming pool on a not so busy day.   I do commend the hotel restaraunt on their buffet breakfast & table service. Perhaps the ladies on the front desk could learn a few pointers from the restaurant staff. Sadly the same attitude was displayed by the front desk staff when checking out. This wasn't a terrible stay however I wouldn't rush into booking again or recommending this to others based on the behaviour and level of care shown by the first point of contact - the front desk staff. There are a tonne of competitors out there and people expect a certain level of customer service & treatment, especially from such a big hotel chain.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453675017~“Review”~All was good. WE enjoyed the stay. the restaurant was very good except we found it hard to eat the whole meal. Breakfast was good. Though this time having stayed there previously, we encountered tables that were reserved which made it tricky to find a table. Also one of our last visits, we asked for waffles which weren't on the buffet and they were done. This time the we were told that it wasn't possible. A more consistent approach would be good.~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan

review_451773745~“Comfortable & Clean”~The hotel is confortable and clean, we had a twin room, which had 2 spacious beds, enough room for 4 of us to enjoy the room - 2 adults and 2 children. The bathroom is nice and spacious as well. The staff are helpfull. I like the pool being on the ground floor here, plenty of room for guests to spread out and enoy, the pool is average sized - but clean. The hotel can get a little noisy - I guess it's big, and busy - so you are always going to get general noise, esp. if near the lifts. We had a view looking out of the park, whch was nice. All in all I think this is a great mid ranged place to stay, clean tidy and helpfull.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_451573732~“New Year”~We stayed in a king room with balcony which we thought would offer us a view of the fireworks. Unfortunately it was spoiled by kids throwing bottles from about 10th floor of next building while I was sat outside the bar having lunch. I did report it but doubt that anything would be done. Also our room's balcony overlooked the pool in the Kids building and it was very noisy and comments being made about us when we came out on to the balcony making me not want to use it. I doubt we will stay here again.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_451133126~“Overnight stay”~Stayed a few days ago at this hotel. Well situated for the city, park and Fortitude Valley. Michel on the concierge desk was an absolute asset to the hotel and couldn't do enough to help us particularly when there was no-one on reception in the morning. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, not a lot of choice and needed topping up more often. Would we stay there again, yes if the price was right~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

review_448168114~“Very misleading advertising. Not a 4.5 Star.”~Found that the rooms were pretty average, carpet very stained and the bathroom which is dated had dirty marks all over the floor, the coffee table was standing on its end and the fridge was mouldy inside and leaking very stinky. There was absolutely no information inside the room or in the reception area about where to eat or transport or sites to visit. the TV had an interactive guide with not a lot of information. If you were watching a movie and felt like ordering in you had to switch to the intereactive info to find what you could order and prices, very frustrating. The reception advised that there were venues to eat only 7 mins walking which was really 15mins and all uphill on the way back. Found the restaurant to pricey and breakfast was $30.00 each. Also the air-con did not seem to be very efficient. TV guide on tv not working.  very average pool and NO SPA. This accommodation is not very centrally located and no views except for buildings would not stay there again. Be prepared for a lot of walking or expensive taxi fares.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~2~3~nan

review_447411276~“Just OK”~This hotel is OK. I wouldn't say it's the best and I wouldn't say it's the worst. Got into room and a few things were broken or just old. Beds comfy though. Breakfast wasn't organised well at all. Ran out of eggs at 9.30 and told to order with Barista. I did that and it got to 10.15 and hadn't receieved anything. Asked staff and was told "breakfast is finished now". If you're visiting the city just be aware it's at the top of a hill. It's only a 10 min walk to Centre of town but can be hard going uphill in the humidity!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447364710~“Good from far, but far from good”~Great room (clean and decent size) on level seven though the view was of offices nearby. Novotel stuck to the 14:00 check in which is fair enough and not an issue. Decent internet with good speed, though far too many dropouts, which required a simple re-login, just annoying really.  Nice pool on level 2 and gym (and usable Sauna, ie didn't stink). Breakfast was described as "the best" by family members, but I felt it was a full buffet breakfast to be expected, with plenty to chose from. Including good selection of fresh fruit.  But here comes the main gripe, which was the guests! Though the Hotel can't stop bogans booking the hotel, there was far too many upper middle-class bogans who feel since they have paid a little more than the average B&B they can demand everything from everything on the buffet to be recooked, from the eggs to the bacon, to warming the milk, to cooling the milk, to 4 coffees they have no intention of drinking to cutting in front of you at every opportunity, to taking your toast and it seemed like every morning they were attracted to me!! I could see the staff doing it tough, especially on Christmas Day, so I don't blame them. It was as if one customer saw staff do one nice thing, then they would demand it as well, otherwise they aren't getting their monies worth from the Novotel. Honestly if they kicked one customer out of the restaurant or hotel, it would send such a clear message to the rest of the bogans, who probably would normally never act like that, I hope. This behavior continued at the pool and the gym, as well as the rooms which had people running and down the hallways well past midnight and banging on the walls. But again, this actually isn't the Hotels fault, just worth considering and mentioning, as it wasn't a one off, but indicative of our 5 day stay.  Yes I mentioned this to the staff, who were polite but simply suggested they will look into it, or perhaps as frustrated as I was. Some other, minor issues was that one day house keeping neglected our bathroom. Whilst the following day they neglected our room all together.  The bar closed early most nights, including 9pm when last drinks were called on a Wednesday night.  There is a kids area in the lobby which is usable for 3-5 year olds at best. But a nice touch (when the bogan children aren't screaming and throwing blocks at other kids, whilst their parents are drinking at the bar or on their mobiles in 'we are on holidays' mode. Overall staff were very nice and did their best to meet everyone's needs, even if this meant an endless barrage of requests. Lastly, access to the Hotel is rather difficult for those with a wheelchair or in our case with a pram. When walking to the nearest station (Central Station) or just to Queens Street Mall nearby you have to walk down (and then up when returning) a very steep driveway shared with cars. And then a negotiate and extremely narrow footpath, which could only just fit our pram, when people walked in the opposite direction, they were forced to walk on the busy road.So if you use a wheelchair or pram, sadly I would NOT book this place, unless you want to pay for a taxi to go anywhere. As I suggested, staff and facilities are Good. But too many issues (especially other guests) to make me recommend the Novotel Brisbane.~3~2~nan~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_446691275~“new and clean”~We stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel is new and clean. We DID have some problem with the access card though. It also took some time for them to fix it.

review_446629437~“A good rest in the city (of Brisbane)”~Stayed one night, to attend a conference and the room was excellent - spacious, very good lighting and great views of Brisbane's CBD. The hotel is a short walk from Central station and is signposted all the way but the walk is a bit uphill. Very quiet in the room, breakfast in the restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and you choose between a continental breakfast or a cooked breakfast, Food was very good. Check in and check out were easy with very efficient staff who were very helpful. The only niggle was with the card access to the elevators and the room - the card did not work sometimes.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan

Our room has two comfortable double beds and a large sofa near the windows. Hotel pool is small but adequate for a quick swim on a hot day or after walking around the city.

review_445412723~“Excellent location, and overall a good experience!”~Great location with easy access to all road systems, as well as the city for shopping. We booked two rooms and stayed three nights on a Luxury Escape package. We weren't really satisfied with the initial allocation of rooms (on 7th floor and a bit tired and no view) but after discussions with reception we were happy to pay an additional amount to move to the 14th floor which was much better. Staff overall were very good, and breakfast was excellent (availability of barista coffee is a great touch and this should set the standard for more hotels!). My overall impressions was that the ground floor looked really good (after a refurbishment), but the rooms are starting to date, and are some reinvestment is needed and would pay dividends. Parking was easy straight under the hotel.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
