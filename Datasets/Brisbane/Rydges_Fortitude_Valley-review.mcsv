review_478415502~“Brand new modern hotel”~I had an excellent stay at the year old Rydges Fortitude Valley. A very comfortable bed & pillows and blackout curtains made for a very comfortable nights sleep. Not a lot very close by, but plenty of bars, public transport etc just a 10 min walk away. Thanks to Baden at reception for the tip on how to fix the TV (Foxtel was stuck & I couldn't change the channel - a simple switch the device off then back on again after a few minutes wait). If you are going to a concert at the Tivoli this hotel is practically a 2 minute walk from there. I will return~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478345956~“Better reception staff but parking problem is ongoing”~The receptionist told me that the ticketless parking system does not like the personalised plate [personalised registration number] and thus acts erratically causing a lot of inconvenience.  All charges must be carefully checked when you check out there as overcharges may occur.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_478108970~“Excellent!”~We travelled to Brisbane for a wedding in the Valley and booked 2 rooms - a standard room for my husband and I, and a wheelchair accessible room for our adult daughter and disabled son. The rooms are very modern, stylish and comfortable. The accessible room was HUGE! We were very impressed by the size and configuration of this room and all the amenities provided. A lot of thought and consideration about the needs of people with disibilities has gone into the creation of this room. Also, the beds in this hotel are unbelievably comfortable! I did not want to leave - and the later checkout time of 11am meant we could linger a bit longer! Will definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone visiting Brisbane.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476334417~“Great Find”~Looked for a hotel close to The Tivoli in Brisbane and came across Rydges in Gregory Terrace. Turns out it's about 100m from the venue! Check-in was seamless and we were given a room upgrade to an easily accessible room because my partner was on crutches at the time. Room was clean, modern and very nicely laid out. Large screen mounted in a frame on the wall opposite the bed. The bed itself was just a little soft for my liking, but others might find it just right. There was a desk to work at and a fridge full of alcohol! Fast free wifi. Bathroom was very nice with ceiling to floor tiles and 2 shower heads - a large overhead rainfall and a hand-held adjustable head. There's a full bar and separate restaurant on the reception level (we didn't use either but both look great) and meeting rooms on the mezzanine level. Ordered some ice from room service and it was there within 3 minutes! Parking is available for $27 per night right next door, but seeing as it was a public holiday the parking metres on the street weren't operating so we just parked across the road. Our room looked straight into the main ring at the RNA Showgrounds. Excellent during the Ekka in August but we guess the tariff would be substantially higher than what we paid. If you need any supplies there's an IGA Supermarket about in Wickham Street across the road from the police station - about a 6 minute walk. Great find - we'll be there again.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475548978~“Walking distance to RBWH”~Beautiful hotel, great food and drink menu in the bar, loved browsing the books in the library whilst sipping cocktails. Easy walk to RBWH. The beds were very comfortable, amenities 5 star and the staff were very courteous and helpful. Highly recommended.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474852691~“Will be our favourite place to stay on trips to Brisbane”~We had a room on the top floor - not much to see out the window due to a lot of construction going on, but this will no doubt improve. The room was large and had all the conveniences needed, incl free Wi-Fi. Very comfortable - maybe a choice of pillow softness would have been an improvement. Easy to get to and good parking at a reasonable rate. Reception and restaurant staff were great. Our buffet breakfast was good value, and the evening meal was exceptional.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474787124~“Relaxing relief after a very long trip.”~Very friendly staff. The bed was awesome. Missed my wake up call because I was in the shower. They came to my room personally to make sure I was awake. Unfortunately I only stayed one night. I have an apartment for the next 90 dys. First time to Australia, so far it is great.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472870022~“Nice but isolated”~Perfect location for a conference across the road. New, clean, good sized room, nice lap pool, captive for food. Breakfast expensive. Asked for discount as staying four nights. No response. Disappointing. Otherwise neutral opinion. Nothing exceptional, nothing terrible.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_472582586~“Perfect location for Showgrounds ”~Great, clean, new and well located hotel. 2nd time I've stayed here while working at the Showgrounds, location is perfect. Rooms are big and comfortable, and bathrooms are nice. Pool was ok (water was a bit cloudy though) and gym is adequate. Only issue is the bar menu is poor, but plenty of other meal choices within walking distance!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472531970~“Very Convent for All Things Fortitude Valley”~If you're looking for the same experience you would receive at Rydges South Brisbane then this hotel is not for you. However, the accommodation price points are substantially lower and the quality you would expect from the Rydges chain is also a feature of this lovely hotel. We had one of their suites which had perfect views over the EKKA Showgrounds (even the main oval). It's a smallish suite with a beautiful bathroom, though with no kitchen area. It does have a fold out couch. The hotel is situated in the newly developed King St area of The Valley, and as such is quite close to newly opened restaurants and cafes. Additionally, the hotel features a fine dining restaurant and a cafe on site. Some important points to note: There is no 'pay per view' or Foxtel available. However, is you take along a USB (with your own programs) or a HTMI cable you can stream from your own device. There is no valet parking, though the parking station is right outside the reception area and is easy to access.  The staff are exceptional and we very much appreciated their efforts on our behalf - they really went the extra mile. This includes the lovely Zoe on reception. the Reservation's Manager and the Duty Manager. Simply brilliant service.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_472486749~“Awesome stopover.”~Nice newly renovated hotel, the new beds are amazing we all had the best sleep. Cheap in comparison to city hotels.  Parking right next door is easy and the kids love the quiet lap pool. It's now our go to city stopover hotel.  We walk down to the Valley for breakfast and a shop.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471797218~“Blown Away by the Service”~A recent business trip to Brisbane was unexpectedly extended due to the inclement weather, however I could not have been at a better hotel to spend the extra day. The rooms are stylish with modern comfortable furniture and all the touches that make a stay pleasant, like the lovely toiletries and the very comfortable bed. The bathroom is spacious and clean, with good lighting. Best of all, the service is consistently good, with efficient staff like Zoe from the front desk making sure at each visit it is a pleasure to return.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_471486947~“Very nice hotel”~The Rydges is a nice hotel with very friendly staff. The food in the bar is quite good and reasonably priced. Highly recommended. Rooms have a good size and the coffee is excellent. Will definitely stay there again if I'm in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470400457~“Stylish relaxed vibe”~This hotel is good. It is in a nice spot. We visited during EKKA (without even realising or knowing what it was) so access at that point was limited but the hotel was nice and quiet, and the rooms are very spacious and with a nice style about them. This hotel is a keeper, it would be good for business and family and just getaway trips alike. I highly recommend.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_470194423~“Great hotel”~I stayed for 6 nights on a business trip. Lovely rooms, very clean, the best beds and pillows! There were only 4 hangers in the wardrobe, but housekeeping were very quick to deliver when I asked for more. No drawer space, which was a pain when I wanted to unpack. Like the fact you can say when you want your room cleaned or if you have any preferences re housekeeping. Staff all very friendly, breakfast great, and had lunch here a few times. Did a wonderful surprise cake too....most delicious! Got our free drink for being a member, so that was nice. All in all a lovely hotel..up to the usual Rydges high standard.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_469229579~“Great place to stay, would come again ”~Stayed here overnight because I was in hospital and it was a great choice. Earlier in the day we went into reception to ask about the parking and they let us have a early check in as the room was ready. Staff were very lovely and friendly. My dad ordered room service for dinner and he said it was very tasty and it got to the room fairly quickly. The only down side is the parking as it parks belong to the show grounds which is understandable. The beds were so comfy with heaps of pillows and I had a great sleep. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Brisbane and would even like to try their other hotels around the country.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468979541~“Great stay”~Lovely place, the beds are so comfortable. It has the whole urban industrial styling going on, Would definitely stay again.

review_468717356~“Great Hotel and the best staff.”~I stayed here for 6 weeks while on a course. Great location, close enough to the CBD and only a short stroll to the Valley but without being too busy, convenient access close by to the Airport tunnel. Very friendly staff, great menu in the restaurant, bar and room service. The rooms are fantastic, clean, well decorated, modern bathrooms and very quiet. Will be here for any other stays in the future.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_468392091~“Work stay”~Really nice hotel. Comfortable clean room. I went for a swim in the pool and it was lovely in the evening. The buffet breakfast had a good range of choices, which were fresh and really nice. The staff were friendly and helpful.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_468152372~“Great hotel”~Stayed for work. After a long day the bed was so comfortable. Hotel is quite new and well appointed. Breakfast is good but a bit expensive . Good bar.

review_467974873~“Very good hotel with outstanding service”~This is a good clean, comfortable, modern, bright welcoming hotel in an unexciting area of Brisbane.

review_467692879~“Excellent hotel”~I had occasion to stay at Rydges to take part in a nearby conference and found the staff extremely friendly and helpful, in fact the whole experience was very good. The food in the dining room was very well presented and of a high standard.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_466462494~“Best hotel I've stayed in”~This was one of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. The rooms were new, kept spotlessly clean and appeared to be soundproof as I was unable to hear noise from anywhere or anyone else in the hotel during my four night stay even though, for a few of the nights, the hotel was booked out. The staff were extremely helpful, friendly and professional. The complimentary shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body moisturiser were all certified organic and free of synthetic chemicals. The shower heads were huge and luxurious.The beds were unbelievably comfortable with thick pillow top mattress toppers. The beds even had two different types of pillows on them - a high pillow and low pillow (filled with pure down) to cater for all body shapes. The airconditioning unit was very efficient and quiet, which made it easy to sleep. The gym provided complimentary towels and filtered water for guests using the gym and/or the pool. All the equipment in the gym was new too. I ate dinner at the bar downstairs; it served delicious, well-priced meals and was staffed by the friendliest bar staff. This hotel was amazing value; seven times cheaper than the last hotel I stayed in and one hundred times better. If I ever need to stay in a hotel in Brisbane again, I will definitely go back to Rydges Fortitude Valley.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_465178315~“Great breakfast buffet”~Pros: - Great breakfast buffet (I really mean it!) Cons: - Bed was far too soft. Ended up with back pain in the mornings - There are small water bottles in the room. Beware! They count as minibar and the hotel charges $3 for each - Car park is $24 per day. Luckily I figured out that there are loads of free overnight carparks close to the hotel - The water in the outdoor pool was so yucky that I refrained from taking a swim - Overall, I felt a bit ripped off~3~2~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_464872207~“Best accommodation I have ever had”~The beds are to die for. So soft and so many pillows. Definitely the best I have experienced in a hotel.  Room service was great value for money and delicious too.  Staff are very friendly and very accommodating and they have delicious coffee in the lobby.  I will definitely be back and this will be my go to hotel when staying in Brisbane.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464616721~“Family room ! ”~Stayed just one night - had to wait just a few minutes past official check in time - but was given free drinks while we waited. Excellent friendly reception staff. Room had 4 king single beds - plenty of room. The bathroom - amazing ! Best shower I have had in years - 2 shower rain heads. Had a quick swim in their lap pool. Not massive - but fine for a quick dip to cool off. Would definitely recommend this hotel for visitors to Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_461026465~“Holiday stop over”~We stayed for 2 nights, during 2 stop periods on a recent holiday. Check in was easy, room was great value for money, nice and clean and the shower was great after a long flight.

review_460795310~“Exceptional value for money”~As someone who travels often this hotel is definitely one of the best value for money that I've stayed at.  Close to the CBD and airport with easy parking, the only criticism I have is that the pool area is fairly basic without any chairs - but that really is a first world problem! ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460571285~“Luxuriously comfortable room”~Great pool. Good internet. Nice gym.Luxuriously comfortable bed and room. King St is an up-and-coming area, though Fortitude Valley itself is a little seedy. We really enjoyed our stay and couldn't have been happier!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_460562517~“Ticked all the boxes!”~This is an excellent Excellent Hotel.  Great food and drinks, we ate at both restaurants and had room service. It was all excellent! Location was also great. Close enough to the airport and only one train stop from the CBD. Only downsides were the daily issues with the magnetic strip keycards. We did not store them with anything magnetic and they failed on us at least once a day leaving us locked out of our room on the top floor at the end of the hall. Also the pool was cloudy.  Overall, with these items remedied...This hotel is exceptional value. Don't forget to become a Rydges member and enjoy 20% off AND a comp beverage. We will stay here again!~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_460556916~“Business trip in the big smoke”~This was the first time I had stayed at Rydges Fortitude Valley after my company changed accommodation providers and it was a lovely stay, from the friendly and helpful welcome on the front desk, to the immaculate large rooms, reasonable gym and pool. Access was easy off the highway and is in a great location. Only slight negative comments were that the bed was a little soft for my liking and there was no padding on the ironing board, only a cover, which meant when I was ironing my shirt for the morning I was effectively ironing on the metal. Small gripes in an otherwise perfect stay and can't wait for the next visit!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460513717~“Most comfortable bed i'd slept on in years!”~Staff were helpful & friendly. Rooms & bathrooms were clean & modern. Stayed with a friend in a family room that had 2 King size beds. Those beds were amazing! I want one! Felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.....~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_458859794~“Returned for an enjoyable stay”~A comfortable hotel which we recently returned to for a further 2 nights stay. Reception staff are excellent and assisted with all our inquiries. Our room was clean, comfortable with excellent wifi. Whilst we know where the hotel is located, our GPS (TomTom) refuses to accept the location as a valid address, so some visitors may have issues locating the address. Carparking alongside in the showground (Ekka) carpark with the automatic number plate recognition remains an annoyance, but its not part of the Rydges Hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_458416246~“Perfect choice”~I stayed a week while doing some work at the QIMR labs on Herston Road. Very close (900 metre walk according to Google Maps) and also walking distance to Fortitude Valley restaurants. In fact, it was walking distance to all of the CBD, at least for me. Having not visited Brisbane before, I came a day early and walked from the hotel across the Story Bridge, along the base of the Kangaroo Point cliffs, to Southbank and onto the museums and galleries, before heading back through the Queen St Mall and back up Wickham St. A long walk but a good one :) The hotel itself was perfect for me. Very nice King Size room with amazing, comfortable bed. Room had a desk and a small sofa as well. Great view across the showgrounds, dark curtains, good air-con, rain head shower, excellent appointments. Can choose to have the room serviced as often as you like. Staff were all super friendly and helpful. Restaurant was delicious (not open Sun or Mon) and wait staff friendly and attentive.Bar also has great food and atmosphere and cheap nights (e.g.Monday is a gourmet pizza and beer for $15). Had the buffet breakfast one day, which was also excellent but at $29 was a bit much to have again. Pool was big enough to do laps. Also has a gym but I didn't get around to trying that. All in all, highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_458374462~“Nice Stay”~Overall it was nice.  Location is nice, staff was really helpful and they have 24 hour room service.  But if you don't have car access then take something more near to city.  Restaurant was good and food was good too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_457804883~“Comfy Beds”~We stayed here for the second time last year just a couple of nights before Christmas and once again we had the most enjoyable sleep ever! I really would love one of there beds they are so comfy you never want to get up and luckily enough if you are a Priority Guest Rewards Member you get late checkout till 1pm. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the Gorgeous Natalie who remembered us from our previous stay and made sure everything was perfect with our room. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the Hotel is immaculate for me there is no where I'd rather stay in Brisbane. I love the location it's so peaceful and quiet away from all the hustle and bustle of the city yet only a 10min drive and you are smack bang right in the middle of it all. I definitely plan on coming back again very soon.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

It has an beautiful restaurant with an amazing menu that uses a lot of regional local qld produce. The Bar upstairs has an unique atmosphere where you can request the exclusive lounge or be out in the general bar with a great selection of wines, spirits and other cocktails!  If you want to be in the city but not be bothered by the hustle and bustle of city life this is the location to go too...  The room is off the chart and I would personally like to own the fabulous bed that is provided to you!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445450409~“Excellent Value for Money, Service and Facilities”~My husband and I booked a room at this perfectly situated hotel. We had my work function at the RNA showgrounds and this hotel is located only a 5 minute walk away. Upon check in we were served by Zoe, very helpful and professional young women. Our check in experience was quick, efficient and easy. Zoe upsold their rewards program to us which offered a complimentary drink.  We parked our car next door and went to our room. We weren't expecting anything too flash as really the room was only a place for us to sleep due to the event we were attending. We were very pleasantly surprised by the decor, ensuite, the minibar, facilities and the amazing king size bed and quality linens. Our event commenced at 6pm and we had an hour to spare so we enjoyed ourselves at the Paddock Bar located at street level for pre-dinner drinks, the wait staff were very friendly and professional. We had a very comfortable night sleep, so quiet and peaceful, the bed was amazingly comfortable. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast $24 per head excellent value for money, considering my husband grazed over the space of an hour so he could try everything. Eggs cooked to order was a plus and most of the guests took advantage of that. All staff were very helpful and smiling. Check-out was effortless we were very sad to go however, will definitely stay again when next we have an event or function. Due to the close proximity of Brisbane City and Fortitude Valley highly recommend for a weekend breakaway.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_445141218~“Terrific newly built hotel, ideally located if you seek a Fortitude Valley location for your stay”~This newly built hotel is a superb choice if staying in the trendy and rapidly developing Fortitude Valley area. The feeling is smart, spacious, stylish (but not in a forced way, or stylish for the sake of being stylish), with all the room features you need for a business trip. The room is absolutely excellent - very well sized, cooly presented, tea/coffee, big safe, mini-bar, good lighting, desk with sockets for all international appliances, great bathroom with “wet room” style shower complete with large rose head. The door to the room must be the "heaviest" I have come across in a hotel and needs a major push to open. There was a bit of noise during both the day and night from all the surrounding construction projects. A reasonable gym and small lap pool on the third floor; there is no business centre but there are other communal places to sit, with a lively bar area at the rear (although would benefit from more charging sockets for the many members of the “gig” economy who were working on their computers there). To walk to downtown Brisbane is around 30 to 40 minutes (along a very busy road ie Ann or Talbot Street), there is no bus (I asked about a hotel shuttle bus, which is advertised by the hotel, but was told this wasn't available), or even convenient public bus. If you want the downtown area, I would probably recommend staying there rather than in the Valley. The nearest supermarket is about a 10 minute walk, within Fortitude Value train station. Brunswick and James Streets also both around 10 minutes away. Fortitude Valley train station (eg for the train to the airport) is about 10 minutes walk. There are plenty of nearby restaurants/cafes/bars nearby, as you would expect in this part of town. The adjoining streets are very smart indeed courtesy of the property developments which are underway there. On street parking is available if you want to avoid the $24 parking charge in the adjoining show grounds car park: $1.60 per hour; 7 am to 7 pm are the hours covered; you can stay for up to the full 12 hours - but if leaving the car there overnight, will need to get to the meter/parking bay by 7 am the next morning. I would very much like to stay at this hotel again.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan

The hotel is still fairly new, and is very well maintained. From the friendly and efficient check-in onwards, this hotel ticked all the boxes. The room was well maintained, clean and the bed very comfortable. The conference facilities were great and the staff, in all departments were efficient and eager to please. The food was very good, my only criticism being that I would have liked a bigger spread and options for breakfast. The gym and pool were fantastic and perfectly adequate. All other aspects of this hotel were really good. I will definitely be back and do recommend this hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

The interior is amzing and the room was so lovely, with everything you could think of. The buffet restaurant had an amazing selection. And as a fussy coffee drinker, I was amazed that the coffee I had, albeit out of a machine was just as good as one you would expect in a specialised coffee cafe. I would absolutely return and would highly recommend.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437960538~“Mixed feelings”~We stayed here for 5 nights recently. The accommodation itself is really nice, well lit rooms and nicely decorated. The beds are very very soft, not to my liking though,it was like trying to sleep on a marshmallow. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom which is a bit inconvenient with fogging the room and also bathroom odours. There is no on-site guest laundry, there is an expensive laundry service though. Our room was serviced daily but there was usually something missed like no garbage bag, or bin not emptied, no tea bags or sugar left, the fridge was left open on several occasions therefore the contents were warm, i had to replace the milk 3 times! We had room service one night which was a nightmare! they delivered our meal to the incorrect room, then after a phone call delivered the meal to our room an hour and a half later - but it was the SAME meal - it was cold and inedible. After phoning again they did rectify this by bringing us a replacement meal, but it was so late to eat by this stage - 2 hours after we originally ordered. The bar downstairs was very expensive... Our complimentary drink didn't cover the drinks we usually have so was a worthless giveaway to us. Meh, very mixed feelings about staying here.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~4~3~nan
review_437273694~“Pleasant stay with great service”~I found the accomodation great, clean rooms and a great restaurant. Looks like recently renovated. Service was good and parking was an ease. Undercover parking next door  which made it easy. As far as the resturant is concerned the food and servive was  excellent. And if you wanted a relaxed atmosphere after a hard day their bar was also excellent.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436037062~“Comfortable stay with great service”~Great room sizes, loved the bathroom with rain head shower and very comfortable beds and ambience in the rooms. Great options to socialise at lounge bar or commercial bar on George Terrace size. Easy to get around from fairly central location. Cooked breakfast in the restaurant was pretty good with lots of options including fresh cooked eggs to order. Very friendly service that delivered everything you would expect. Would definitely return!~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_432259449~“Great hotel”~The hotel was new so it was very nice. The pool looked very inviting, however the gym was quite tiny. Even thought it was a business trip I still use these facilities. The food was excellent, though quite expensive.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432068210~“Great accomodation”~I recently stayed at Rydges, Fortitude Valley on Business. Great central location, great staff and wonderful service. The restaurants downstairs were divine. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a lovely place to stay in the heart of Brisbane City.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432026781~“Excellent Service and attention to detal”~The Rydges at Fortitude Valley is truly an impressive hotel with excellent attention to detail and helpful, friendly staff. Our team stayed there for two nights and everyone was impressed with the attention to detail in the rooms and the very comfortable beds. The food and service at Six Acres Restaurant was great. The buffet breakfast was delicious and the chef was very friendly - we definitely over ate ;) Would highly recommend to anyone staying in Brisbane, as the location is very easy to find and easy to get anywhere. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_431954727~“Outstanding ”~Great new hotel in the CBD, large clean well equipped rooms, very quiet for a good nights sleep in a central location closecto thecrail network. Huge television in the room. Paddocks restaurant on the ground floor has a great range of food and beers.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431632671~“Rydges Fortitude Valley: Excellent Experience”~We have stayed twice now at Rydges. Living West of Brisbane we are frequently looking for accomodation in Brisbane on weekends. Rydges fits that Bill 100%. Rooms have a contemporary design: Stylish without being pretentious of fussy. Public spaces: Dining Rooms, Foyer and Bars all nice places to be in. Staff have always been friendly and attentive without any pretention: Just helpful and efficient. The location suits us. Out of the the dirty busy City, close to the Valley, but in easy access to all the inner City offers. We park up and use Cabs, close enough not to be overly expensive way of getting around. Have only eaten breakfast and that was always of a good standard and range to suit all tastes and diets. Excellent value for money. I have spent the same money staying in the run of the mill Motels for the same money: Which would eran none of the above praise. The Brisbane Exhibition grounds are directly across the road. And if there is nothing on, well it looks like a great quiet place to run off that big smorgasboard breakie! We wouldnt really look at any other options!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_431630320~“Great stay!! Beautiful Hotel”~I must say the Rydges Fortitude Valley is a great hotel, such a nice place to stay. Interior design is amazing. If you love a comfortable bed then stay here! Could not fault or pick on anything. Food is great in the six acres restaurant or if you want something a little more low key then the paddock bar is the place to go. Loved the different range of craft beers they had to offer- and such a nice place to relax at the end of the day out on the deck under the trees. Not far walk into the valley and some other great places along the way!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431417582~“Nice, well located and excellent service ”~From when we checked in to now it has been impressive. Modern and cool style!  We have three rooms for the next two days for a conference her in Brisbane and I'm so pleased we chose to stay here. The rooms are super modern, the lighting and mirrors are great to get ready in the morning. The bed, pillows and linen are to die for, so comfortable and fluffy bed! You have USB entries everywhere to charge your phone. The gym and pool area is compact and very nice for a quick workout. The breakfast was really nice, a great variety and great service.  Just great! Definitely will stay here next trip to Brisbane!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431039491~“Heavenly Beds”~Check in was fast and friendly, Just stayed here overnight last week, The complimentary drink was a nice touch to becoming a Rydges member, I've stayed in some nice hotels the world over, but this hotel would have the most comfortable beds in the world.. like sleeping on a cloud~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_431011673~“Perfect”~Very professional, upmarket hotel with excellent service. Stayed for a night out in Brisbane as it is the perfect location and spacious room with the best beds you will ever sleep in! The service was warm and friendly, Ebony went out of her way after her shift to walk us into the main of the Valley and find us an Italian restaurant - amazing guest service! Overall not a thing to fault and after two perfect stays I highly recommend.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_430803633~“Great place to stay”~Stayed here for one night. Very clean, new hotel. Price was ok for a Saturday night. Parking which isn't run by the hotel costs $24 per day. Rydges beds are awesome ! Special thanks to Mel who went above and beyond, we had a good laugh ! Would stay again for sure~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_429866700~“Getaway”~Room was great, location is excellent and the staff and accommodation great. With the city location access to the main areas of the valley and the city are accessible. This is a great location for the Eka and surrounds.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_427161207~“Great venue with good options”~Attended a conference at the Rydges. They have a number of function room sizes with options to scale up or down. Good media. Rooms are modern and well set out. Breakfast was on par with other venues. I would recommend this venue.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426510982~“Amazing stay! ”~Stayed for one night for Oktoberfest. Perfect location-just across the road from the Showgrounds. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Room had nice decor, comfy bed and a rainfall shower. Would certainly stay here again. Thanks!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426253859~“Beautiful hotel in the right location”~Just a short walk out of the Valley and you will find yourself at a trendy new street being developed right opposite the showgrounds. The bar was well equipped and the staff were willing to give it a go (cocktail enthusiast I am, lol). Food was also great at the paddock bar. My daughter also enjoyed her time within the hotel. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in central Brisbane. Not far from the train station too which was quite convenient to getting around Brisbane without a car~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_424800474~“Great hotel!”~Love this hotel! We stayed three nights in a Arena View Suite and it was lovely. Could do with a microwave at least though as there was no way to even heat food let alone cook food. I have to say, the service was amazing!!! Call room service for a bucket of ice and they're literally knocking at your door two minutes later. So good!!! And I love how this hotel have towels at the gym for the pool so you can just help yourself to towels and we had children so we never ran out with all the swims they were having and times they'll shower during the day. The staff were superb and helped us find door stops as we had joining rooms and the doors couldn't stay open and my kids kept nearly jamming their fingers, so I phones reception and after being told they don't have them she went on to say she'll go look for some and be up to the room with them. Which she was, only five minutes later. So grateful for their help. Great location if you're wanting a night out in the valley! Uber will cost you next to nothing. Parking however is $24 per night and we had two cars so that all added up by the end of the three night stay. The pool says heated but I wouldn't go swimming if it's not realllly hot. Where the pool is located is quite windy as its on a deck and the water isn't even warm so you get cold almost straight away.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424352142~“"Great sized rooms,great view."”~You are welcomed by a big airy foyer with sunlight steaming in and cheery staff at the counter. It feels modern and up to date and has the air of a new hotel. Check in done in 2 minutes and into the swift, shiny lift to the 4th floor. The room was a treat. A small sofa at the end of the bed with a mountain of cushions on it. A desk and hanging space all done in rich dark wood. open the curtain to an uninterrupted view of the Brisbane Showgrounds and surrounding period buildings and the city sitting further away in the background. The firm bed was great with a good combination of pillows and cushions to choose from. The bathroom is exquisite, but simple a good sink and a level floor all the way into the shower, no steps. 2 shower head options,rain and high pressure. The fabulous TV has a usb and HDMI input and the WIFI is free, unlimited and fast. The area is quite and the sleeping is easy. Breakfast has many,many options and great coffee (extra for Espresso) overall an excellent hotel that is a short cab ride to Grey Street and Southbank eating and entertainment quarters.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_424248542~“Review ”~Great location The staff are well presented well versed know the role and everything they need to do Highly recommend the 6 acres restaurant the food was excellent and the staff are very professional  Rooms are very clean the room staff are professional and clean the rooms to a high standard~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424033862~“Fantastic Breakfast! ”~Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and loved the breakfast in the restaurant! Fresh, wholesome, good variety, healthy, gluten free and tasty! The coffee was lovely too! I sat near the window and enjoyed the atmosphere. I wasn't rushed by staff who were helpful. I would have stayed in the restaurant longer, but I had a plane to catch. I'll definitely stay there again and will definitely go back to the restaurant for breakfast! Well done you mob!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424006420~“Looked after extremely well :)”~My daughter and I had a two night stay here whilst awaiting furniture for our apartment move. The room was very clean, large and modern with a lovely ensuite. The bed was very comfortable. My only negative comment would be the absence of a guest laundry in the facility which would be very useful for light travelers. The hotel does offer offsite dry cleaning service. As for the service and staff... I give them 20 out of 10! They were extremely helpful, kind and understanding. My daughter (19) was sick and I felt reassured that she was comfortable resting in the room whilst I visited our new home.  The restaurant and bar has a lovely ambiance and the foyer is a great place to sit to have a freshly made coffee! There are also some lovely new eateries popping up down the street. I will be recommending this hotel to many people. Again, a big thank you to the staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_423672602~“Overnight stay”~Can't fault this place, our new regular. Quiet, dark rooms with soft comfy beds. Easy Walk to the valley. Great rate too, friendly helpful staff. A few minutes drive from the city. Oh and on our last visit fireworks from our bedroom window. Luv it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423375926~“Wish we had stayed there the whole time we were in Brisbane ”~I so wish we stayed longer. I accidentally booked for the wrong month but the lady at the front desk promptly sorted a room for me and my little family. The rooms are amazing. I can not wait to come back. Breakfast was amazing too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421624048~“The Valley ”~Had two nights with my wife and three kids in a family room. Generously sized, with a king, queen and roll away bed. Very modern and happy with everything. Only issue was the fridge didn't work but they soon replaced that. Also location wise a bit of a hike to the fortitude Valley train station but across the road from the showgrounds.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421348790~“What a 4-star hotel should be”~I booked it last minute for a business trip, and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel looks brand new, it is very clean and modern. I also received a room upgrade which was great, and the hotel reception called me a few days before to confirm my arrival which I thought was a very nice touch. Having stayed in many hotels that like to call themselves 4-star, I can say that this one definitely is and is a good value for money. I haven't tried food in the restaurant, but I had a drink in the bar downstairs. The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is because of it's location. It is a little bit out of the main dining areas and a bit of a track into the CBD. But I'd rather spend a bit more time travelling and stay in a nice well looked after property then stay in a dated one which is central.~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_419717852~“Nice accommodation ”~The accomodation was really nice. Bed was comfortable and room was well furnished. I left one star off for the ridiculous names given to simple meals and the exorbitant prices in the restaurant. Definitely stay here, but eat somewhere else.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419702034~“Exceptional bedding, A+ room, Parking expensive”~The room was lovely. King pillow top bed with exceptional quality linen. A good night sleep is super important when traveling! The room wasn't enormous but adequate and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Bathroom was great. All modern. Staff were lovely, even got a free welcome drink :)  Luckily we were there on a weekend so had free parking on the street but otherwise the parking next door (run by the showgrounds) is expensive. I think it was $24 the first night then $11 each night after.  If you needed transport to get into the city I think you'd have to walk a while to the train station?  I was very impressed with the price which was on special for I think $213 for a Fri/Sat night. Exceptional for the quality. Definitely a 4 star.  Lovely bar downstairs. A restaurant too but I didn't try that. And the best bit, join Rydges for free and you get 1pm checkout!!! Plus all sorts of discounts with Rydges.  I would happily stay here again. Photos show view out window and across the road (on TV screen)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419646455~“Nice hotel ”~Popped in for a night away from the Gc and were very happy.  Check in staff member was exceptional!  Room was modern, clean and nicely presented. Though do suggest getting a room away from the elevator.  Buffett breki was delicious and very nicely presented would love to see what dinner is like.  Would be happy to return to this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419377492~“A lovely hotel”~Location wise, if you need to be in the heart of the city, this hotel is not ideal, but if you are wanting to eat and drink in the Valley or New Farm, it's an easy walk to everywhere you need to visit. Being a new hotel, it's still fresh and contemporary, but the quality of the decor and room facilities is a notch above many hotels - the beds are fantastic, the bathrooms spacious and well equipped. Zoe who checked me in was fantastic, as were any other staff I came into contact.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_418949993~“Great new hotel”~We struggled to find the reception, given the direction we'd arrived in. I notice there's a sign if you're driving by the show grounds in one direction, but not the other. Still, it's lovely when you get there! Very well decorated, great theming for the area. Well appointed clean rooms with high ceilings to make it feel more spacious. The usual great pillows and squishy beds. What a great shower design, very well thought out. A brief walk to the Tivoli or showgrounds, a 15 minute walk to the Valley or James St precinct. Although there's building work at present it's not disturbing. Looks like it will be a great location when the rest of the local restaurants are finished and filled, just hope the price doesn't go up too far!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
