review_479273905~“Pleasant, not fancy”~We only stayed one night, but it all was seamless. Reception was prepared for us, the parking safe (but tight if you have a larger vehicle), and the room was clean. Price fairly reasonable, but perhaps a little high for what was received.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471043396~“Quiet and Comfortable ”~Had a great stay, only 2 nights but could have stayed longer. The staff are helpful and most importantly the bed was great and the room was quiet. Will definitely make this my new regular home away from home. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470732769~“Upgrade didnt make the stay any better.”~Myself my husband and our 2 teenage daughters stayed here for a week. I booked 5 months in advance to get a good room. My daughters had to share a bed, which they didnt like. The pools were filthy , the gym was out of order the sauna was out of order and the restauant was closed. They upgraded us to an appartment at no cost, but it was so cramped for the four of us and our girls had to share a fold out sofa bed, this was a pain when it came to watching tv as well as the girls going to bed. There was no tv in the main bedroom. We payed over a $1000 to be cramped , and nowhere to cool off with a swim or to eat in. Room service kept putting our toiletries back on our luggage, and moving stuff around. They even trough out my daughters collector cups from dreamworld.~2~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467069416~“Travellers delight”~This room was spacious, and the pillow top mattress was exactly what my tired body needed. The shower was spacious and water pressure was great. The undercover security carpark with internal access to the motel was great as well..~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460786304~“Our new "go to" motel”~We had a single night stay at the beginning and end of an overseas trip. This was our second time at Pegasus. There were two things that impressed us once again.  Firstly, the ease of making a reservation and checking in and out. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful at all times. Secondly, the cleanliness of rooms is most impressive. This hotel is certainly one of the most consistently clean places we have ever stayed. It is very refreshing to take a shower and not find even one spot of soap scum on the glass shower screen. The motel cleaners deserve a big pat on the back. We are looking forward to our next stay.~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452571739~“Won't Let You Down”~Stay here all the time for work when I'm in Brisbane and it's always been a great place to wind down after a busy day. Conveniently close to the airport and not too far from the city either if you get a cab. Rooms are comfy enough to unwind in and there's a space to get a bit more work done if need be. Restaurant serves great food if open otherwise staff will give a good recommendation nearby if you ask.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441612192~“Under New Management - Disappointed ”~Pegasus has been my motel of choice every time I visit Brisbane for a number of years now more than I care to remember. Whilst the restaurant was never open on weekend's, being told the restaurant is now permanently closed does leave you wondering where to for meals. Luckily the Bowls Club is well within walking distance and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and affordability on offer.  Disappointingly, was the attitude of the new owner right from arrival. No eye contact, no smile not even a greeting. I always enjoyed Pegasus not only for the quality of my stay and property location but importantly for the great friendly service and that welcoming feeling you got every time you booked and stayed. All gone. I and my travelling work colleague were both left with the impression they were doing us a favour and then to be told the restaurant was closed almost as it was our problem for not knowing was very disappointing. When I enquired if the site was under new management my work colleague and I both got some serious "attitude" from the new owner and then the reply, "well if you could call 8 months new management" as we both looked at eaxh other. When i pointed out that i stayed here with my family only in July I never got a reply.  There are some noticeable changes also in the quality of housekeeping services that are provided and the carpets in my room clearly needed cleaning as I discovered after walking around in bare feet. It is doubtful I will be back which saddens me greatly however, to the unitiated, I'm sure you will find the motel adequate  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441054059~“Clean roomy albeit a tad noisy but conveniently located near airport”~Close to the airport, reasonably priced motel. It's a tad old but very clean. Fair bit of traffic noise but if you ask for a room at the back its not too bad. Good shopping and. eating about 10 mins walk away but no onsite restaurant. Breakfast is unremarkable neither good nor bad. Rooms are a good size and the suits are well laid out. Free under cover parking. All in all a reasonably priced, clean motel that is conveniently located close to the airport and Eagle Farm.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_420989602~“Great accomadation near the Brisbane airport”~This hotel was extemely spacious, clean, quiet and well appointed. Will stay here any time I need overnight accomadation near the airport. Short 10 min $30 trip by taxi to domestic airport. Management were very helpful and friendly and there is nothing but good to say about my overnight stay here.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_409053741~“Good quality motel”~By motel standards the Pegasus Motor Inn is definitely up there with the better ones. Smooth process for check in/out. Clean and well presented. Plenty of parking undercover. Rooms a decent size. Despite being on a main road it was very quiet and I had no trouble sleeping in after a big night. if you need low cost accommodation near the airport, cruise ship terminal or the race track then this is up there with the best options.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_405967506~“Very Happy with our stay/s”~We spent two nights at this hotel, at the beginning and end of an overseas trip. Our initial enquiry and subsequent booking was speedily and very pleasantly handled by staff member Nicole. Check in for our initial stay was handled speedily and we were allocated the ground floor room we had requested, due to some mobility issues with my husband. The room was more than adequate, with a small table and chairs, and a long bench/dressing table. The bed was good, and the overall cleanliness was outstanding. We were near to the stairs leading to the upstairs rooms, and could hear guests moving up and down, but this ceased by early evening and the room was otherwise very quiet with no traffic noise. In room wifi was excellent. The walk in shower was excellent as were the towels and bathroom lighting (a bonus for us contact lens wearers!). The only small negatives were that the wifi router had a blue flashing light that did wake me a couple of times during the night and the bathroom could have done with a bit larger shelf to put out toiletries. The room was also a little dark, but perfectly fine for an overnight stay. We would happily stay in this room again and do intend to request it next time we stay. On our return, we were allocated an apartment, even though our booking (made nearly 2 months previously) was for a motel room. On check in, we were asked to pay a higher room charge than quoted on our reservation. When I pointed this out, we were told the hotel was full that night, and we were given the apartment at the lower charge without issue. The apartment was quite a distance from reception which made transferring our mountain of luggage very difficult. The apartment, however, was very nice, with a lounge room, kitchen, dining area as well as the bedroom and bathroom. Once again, we were very impressed with the cleanliness of the apartment. We did get a small amount of traffic noise during the night but it was quite muted and not overly bothersome. The only real downside to the apartment was the shower over bath - I was unable to climb out of the very high sided bath without a great deal of help from my husband.  Overall, our two nights at Pegasus Motor Inn were very good and it is our intention to stay again. I would recommend this very nice motel to travellers who appreciate staying in friendly and exceptionally clean accommodation.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_404444252~“Great motel not too far from the airport”~Our company puts us up at this motel when we are staying in Brisbane. It's not too far from Brisbane Airport and costs about $30 in the taxi to get there. The rooms have all been clean and comfortable and have everything you need. The one bedroom apartments are spacious and have a kitchen and lounge area. I have not had any housekeeping issues during the times I have stayed there. The staff are always friendly. The motel is within walking distance to shops and food on Racecourse Road. On some nights they have the bar open near the pool which has some food and drinks available. I am not too sure about value as our company pays for the rooms. Overall, a great place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_403531891~“Ideally located for airport. Lovely staff. Good rooms”~We stayed here for 2 nights recently and were really impressed. Rooms were clean and practical.

Taxi cost about 25 dollars and the staff ordered all taxis we needed.~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_348953011~“Excellent motel”~The Pegasus Motor Inn is an excellent motel to stay at, it has great facilities, the rooms are very clean and nicely laid out.

review_340594355~“Very comfortable. Great location to Security Car Park.”~We have stayed at the Pegasus Motel on a number of occasions now. It is nicely located to a security car park, where we leave our car when we travel. We have found the rooms very comfortable and clean. The In House restaurant is certainly worth a try. Great food and service  It has underground car parking facilities ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_337047644~“New Years eve stay”~Great pricing for the location of being close to town, nicely presented and modern. I was surprised w could find anything at such short notice on New Years Eve, the car park was a bit tight. Staff were friendly enough.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336814303~“Good for overnight stay between flights”~I was simply overnighting with an early international flight next morning. It worked fine. The location and ambience would not prompt me to take a holiday there, though. Taxi from the airport was around $25, shuttle next morning 15. Room was comfortable and clean and quiet. Restaurant was not open; just as well I had had food on plane. Helpful Office reception man.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335479445~“Handy”~Clean, comfortable and close to the airport. Only issue: secure car park in basement with no lift access. Steep stairs to rooms. Took out what I needed for overnight rather than lugging suitcase up 2 flights of stairs. There were signs saying to not leave valuables in cars but I couldn't face those stairs!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_334106967~“Great location and clean, comfortable rooms.”~Pegasus Motel is close to the Brisbane Cruise Terminal and airports. It has easy transport links into the city. Racecourse Rd is close with cafes and restaurants. There is also a restaurant on site. The rooms are quite spacious and clean and comfortable. The motel is very well maintained. Bonuses are secure, under cover parking and double glazing so rooms are quiet. Have stayed here numerous times over several years and have always enjoyed our stay due to the high, consistent standards that are maintained. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_332035586~“Good clean rooms close to airport and pubs”~Good clean standard motor inn rooms..nothing way modern but perfectly clean and a good rate. Close to the airport and acoupla good pubs.

review_329224744~“Clean and comfortable”~I have stayed at Pegasus several times before mainly so I can catch an early flight the next day. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the motel is quite and has easy access to public transport, the airport and major roads. Meals are lovely and there is a small restaurant on site. You can walk to Race course road which has a myriad of restaurants, coffee shops and clothes shops or if you prefer something quiter than a walk of 10 mins takes you to the river and the cruise ship precinct. No views, in the suburbs on a busy road but still worth the stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_328956160~“Does what you expect it to”~As an airport motel this place delivers all it needs. Car park, clean and tidy rooms, and there is even a little pool as well. There is complimentary washing facilities thrown in as well. Only a couple of minutes from the airport!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_327899737~“Excellent value”~We stayed in a one bedroom which was spacious with sliding glass doors opening front and back with 2 balconies! The dinner in their outdoor small restaurant was outstanding. I felt our twin beds could have been firmer and the noise from the street was pretty noticeable but I would stay here again jn a heart beat. We loved the feel of being in a spacious piece of property with walks and balconies yet we were only 15 minute taxi drive to the airport. Walk two blocks in the morning to a great coffee stand.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_319903966~“Plenty of choice, made the right one!”~Chose the Pegasus because I was looking for somewhere cheap due to late arrival and early departure from Brisbane airport. But wow, what a great experience. One of the largest and certainly cleanest rooms we have stayed in. It seemed a shame to only be their to sleep. Great value and a really nicely appointed room for a motel. Looks like I might have found a regular stop~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_319734142~“Clean and comfy.”~Spent a week in an upstairs suite. Kitchen was fully equiped including a dishwasher and microwave. No oven. Fresh sunny bathroom with shower over bath. Bed was a bit on the soft side. Washing machine and dryer included. Location is great for easy walk to the Port for cruise ships and Brett's Wharf to catch the City Cat ferry to the city. Also walk to Racecourse Rd for supermarket, banks, bottle store and other shops, library. Excellent cafes and restaurants. Great if you are going to the races or need to be near the airport. Two swimming pools and spa, sauna but they were not warm so no one swimming in October when I was there. Overall a very clean motel. I would have liked to have had an outside deck to sit on as the seating by the pool and small restaurant did not look that inviting.~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_318865021~“Good place to stay”~Close to the airport , and Brisbane CBD easy to get to by car, or not too expensive in a taxi. Stayed for four nights for a work trip and was given a large twin room which was very comfortable . I Recommend trying the Nasi Goreng from the restaurant it was Delicious. Room had two queen beds and a small table and three chairs. Free parking was also available. The pool was small but just right for a quick dip after a hard days work.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

The place is meticulously maintained. Good size rooms, good quality linen, very clean, convenient facilities & delicious breakfasts. There are laundry facilities available, secure parking, cable tv, free wifi, magazines,the swimming pool....  Thank you Nicole & Marni. Close to the airport, DFOs, racecourse & Fortitude Valley too.

review_314232987~“I always stay here while in Brisbane...”~I normally try new hotels as I travel around, and there are few I just go straight back to and this is one of them. If you read my reviews you will know I really don't like two things about big cities.... the price of taxis and the price of parking - especially airport parking. This place is only a short taxi ride from the Brisbane airport. Also because I can walk to the rental car companies, walk to the restaurants at Portside Wharf, walk to the bottle shop, great fish and chip shop across the road etc etc. The poolside restaurant seems very expensive at first, but when your meal comes ...OMG Chef quality dishes... absolutely delicious every time. Definitely worth every cent every time. I choose the suites, they are are spacious and homely feeling. Complete with snacks and wine... range of beer in the refrigerator, you beauty! They even have a washing machine and dryer.... so good after a few days travel to be able to throw on your own laundry. Friendly reception, efficient booking... why stay around, I just go back there!~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_314199791~“Great place to stay”~This was an excellent place to stay. The room was modern, clean and roomy. Although just a studio unit it had a table and chairs, and a sofa as well. Close to a busy road but nice and quiet. Plenty of parking under the building.  We were in a very handy position close to Racecourse road with it's mix of restaurants and a Sunday market. However you would need a car for these, just out of walking range.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
