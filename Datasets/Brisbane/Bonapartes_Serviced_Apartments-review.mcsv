review_328553184~“Wont be staying again ”~Book a 2 bedroom apartment,rang up a day before arriving to confirm everything. On arrival and going into our apartment and only having 1 bed and 6 people staying! Finding out that they had double booked us. Got offered 3 single bedroom apartments instead so ended up having to split the group up. The rooms smelt, fridge took a day to get cold, shower was dirty and broken, hardley any cooking utensils, got given things to wash the dishes up with but no plug for the sink, no bbq so we had to cook everything on a tiny stove, there was cockroaches in our apartment, cigarette butts out the front door. Definitely will not be staying again especially with not being offered any compensation for their stuff up of double booking after i rang up to confirm.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_290227997~“Overnighter”~We stayed to watch the Liverpool vs Brisbane Roar Football match as it was the closest to the stadium we could get for under $150 for a double o/night. I will be honest, the place does need a little TLC, but for the price it covers a comfortable room, with toilet and shower, cooking facilities, washing facilities in your room and great working aircon. Short walk to Chinatown and fortitude valley train station.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_281710282~“Great place to stay”~We travelled from New Zealand to visit friends. We stayed at Bonapartes Serviced Apartments for a week.

We would like to stay there for our next trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_268945287~“Not Worth The Money”~We stayed here for a week and for the money, didn't feel it was worth it. We arrived with 9 cases (5 weighing 30kg), and there are steps EVERYWHERE. We was placed in a top floor apartment, and it was a nightmare with all the cases. First we had to wheel them down a very steep hill to the main door. Then up some stairs to reception. Then down some stairs, across the yard, up some stairs, then up 2 flights of stairs to our apartment. And in the dark, because the light is on a timer and goes off before you can get to the top with a 30kg case. I think this place is run/owned by Chinese and its hard to understand them, and them you. There are fines for everything. If you are too noisy, they fine you. You drop litter, they fine you. You don't empty your bin, they fine you. You don't wash up, they fine you. Yet the residence there are noisy as any thing and nothing is said. Lots of bogan residence too. Not a nice place, or nice feel/atmosphere when the bogans are out of their Apartments. It don't feel safe. The rooms are ok. Cleanish, tidyish, practical. They do the job. The location is the only good thing about this place. At night, its hard to sleep. Police sirens, harley's whizzing by constantly, building works and drilling OVER NIGHT and noisy bogans makes it hard to sleep.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_262758906~“Cheap for a reason”~This complex is very dated and in major need of a renovation. There is obviously a mixture of permanent tenants as well as holiday makers. The permanent tenants must be said have little respect for the traveller who is staying there. In my case the people who were in the apartment above me were loud noisy and constantly banging on the floor and then the people that were on the top floor were extremely loud. Lets just say that their recreational activity was very obvious and very continuous~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_261996433~“Convient and Comfortable Stay”~Having to travel and stay in Brisbane for 2 weeks for medical appointments, we selected Bonapartes Services Apartments primary on location as was conveniently located to the various areas we needed to go. Price wise the unit we were in was very reasonable and the unit was quite comfortable. The unit had everything we needed to self cater. If you stay ensure that you clean up after yourself as there are warnings in the unit for extra cleaning fees. This we found not to be onerous and successfully concluded our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful though not having the registration desk open all the time was a minor irritation. One issue we did have was mobility as there are plenty of steps in the facility and if you have limited mobility this does cause some difficulties in getting about. The unit felt and was safe for our stay and the under cover parking was very good. We did have some minor issues with the washing machine and air conditioning during our stay. All in all good value for the price and would happily stay there again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_229352574~“I will not be staying here again. Cheap for a reason.”~Stayed for a week.  Bad points - Greeted by topless bogan resident upon entry which was a bad start. Have to empty my rubbish bins or expect a fine yet they do not empty theirs. Also more fines if you don't do your dishes. Grubby shower with time limit on showering before the water goes cold.  Noisy tradey work such as concrete drilling and banging throughout the duration of my stay. Cost's extra to have your unit serviced. Only has a washing machine, NO dryer. However I managed to use the pieces of a clothes rack provided and once strategically positioned I could hang my clothes on this to dry. Air conditioning difficult to use, old and crusty. Many lights not working as bulbs needed replacing. Good points -  Bed was good and seemed new, along with bed linen. The apartment block seems secure and safe. My recommendation would be to stay at the Brunswick Street Central apartments for the same cost, better location, a dryer!! rooms serviced everyday for no extra charge but the bed wasn't as good.~2~nan~2~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_210493397~“Good location and value for money”~I booked Bonapartes for myself and four other colleagues. The apartments are a short 10 minute walk from the RNA Showgrounds and within 2-3 minutes, you're at Fortitude Valley train station. Chinatown is just down the road and the Brisbane CBD is roughly 20 minutes walk. Hamish and his the rest of his team have done an amazing job since taking over management in January 2014. The apartment was very clean when I arrived and the beds were very comfortable. There is enough cookware to make your own dinner. I will definitely be booking our stay here again next year. Thank you so much Hamish.~4~5~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_209070978~“Great location, amazing staff and even better value”~I stayed at these serviced apartments for 3 nights and it was a very enjoyable stay. The rooms are clean, its close to main transport, close to most of brisbanes attractions and the staff will go above and beyond there duties to help, we had broken glass in our room which they came and vacumed for me at 10pm, I left my passport after my check out and they met me at the train station as my train was going to the airport 3 days after I had left and any help I needed in my stay the staff were there to help. I recommend the apartments for all ages and abilities as the stay you will have will be an enjoyable experience.~5~5~5~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_208414269~“Good Spot”~We have stayed here twice & going for a 3rd time in December..It is extremely close to the nightlife and RNA Showgrounds for nights out and festivals. The rooms are all quite spacious and good for the pricing as well. The staff have always been really friendly as well. We would recommend staying here if you want to save money on cabs for nights out to the clubs.~3~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_205285628~“Renovations & New Excellent Management Equals Very Good Result”~My wife and I stayed for four nights for our four day visit to Brisbane in May 2014 due to the proximity to the Fortitude Valley Public Council Pool about one kilometre away as we were attending the Water Polo Australia 2014 National League Water Polo Championships to support our Daughter. Our apartment was spacious, clean and private and our bed was excellent. Being in Fortitude Valley Bonapartes is also very convenient to the City and has local restaurants, China Town and various nightclubs and entertainment venues with train and bus services also conveniently nearby and taxis services minutes away. Bonapartes Serviced Apartments are also reasonably priced and affordable. We enjoyed our stay which was enhanced by the friendly and helpful management of Stacy and Hamish a couple of young guys making Hotel Management their careers.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_205003522~“4 Stars”~Stayed at Bonapartes during May. I found the rooms to be clean and the location very central to the valley and city which contains most of Brisbane best night spots.

review_202664127~“Ongoing renos made huge improvements”~We booked at Bonapartes almost solely based on price, with location being second. We are a family of 4 with two smaller kids (age 5), and we wanted a budget accommodation with space for just a few nights (3). We read the reviews and were prepared for the worst. We booked a mezzanine room, and we were happily surprised with the space and condition of the room. The entire room had just undergone a complete renovation. New kitchen, cupboards, counters, sinks, etc. It was very clean. We stayed in unit 16, and were told it was one of the last of the mezzanine units to be redone. There was still some work outstanding like a second coat of paint, and other finishing tasks, but we were happy. The pool was cold, but like many outdoor pools here, it's not heated, so given we stayed in the fall, that wasn't a surprise. The parking was great ($10/day fee) and secure, and the staff were great help for us with all of our map, transport, etc. questions. As for location; it was a quick 3 minute walk to train-station, and 20 minute walk to the Queen Street Mall. We would recommend this place for anyone looking for a budget stay in Brisbane.~4~4~3~4~4~4~4~nan

review_174416660~“Don't stay here”~I chose to stay at these apartments because I believed the info online about Bonapartes Service Apartments. My advice is don't believe any of it. “.. Premium accommodation, in beautiful surroundings with an onsite restaurant and cafe, and hotel”. This is the most disgusting place I have ever stayed in my life. It started at check in when I was confronted with no facade for the reception area other than a buzzer code system in the dark underground car park area. When I got inside the complex, the check in process was like a scene from Fawlty Towers, followed by a walk in the dark up flights of stairs to my room (no lifts). As a female travelling on my own, for safety reasons, I welcomed the thought of an onsite café and hotel. The onsite restaurant and cafe, and hotel have all been permanently closed and placed into receivership. The outdoor furniture is old and broken. There was filth from one end of the apartment to the other consisting of stained bedding, nail clippings, stained furniture, broken lighting, filth in the shower area, broken doors etc...~1~1~4~1~1~1~1~nan
review_173462652~“Had a wonderful night here, you deserve to stay!”~My friends and I stayed in this apartment a couple of days ago for a birthday party, I have to say the service there was really nice, the boss was so kind for everything. We stayed in a mezzanine room and it was fairly beautiful and delicate. I like the lay out of it, especially the view from the balcony was great. The cleaning was nice as well as the price, cuz three people can share this room which makes the price is okay for each member.  Next time when I visit Brisbane again, I'll definitely choose this apartment, hope it can be even better!~4~3~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_169550922~“This property should be avoided!”~I booked this property in good faith that for the money I was paying, it should be of a reasonable standard. I was proven very wrong and now after reading the many negative reviews, I can only totally agree with most of them. I wish I had read the reviews before choosing to stay here! As well as being very, very tired, the rooms were dirty. The check-in was nothing short of bizarre, with a padlocked gate to get through. There was no soap and stern notes about washing up and putting your rubbish out to avoid a $50 cleaning fee. There is no excuse for the complete lack of care in cleaning and presentation and I like most of the reviewers feel completely ripped off. I don't think I have ever stayed anywhere as awful and would recommend avoiding this property until a major refurbishment is undertaken.~1~1~2~nan~1~1~2~nan
review_168346774~“Run down and in need of refurbishment”~We shouldn't have expected too much for the price of the room but had stayed in some very nice places on our trip in the same price range but Bonapartes is very run down and in need of some updating.  The new owners advertise that fact but have made no changes to their units as I stayed there 6?years ago and nothing has changed. The bed was uncomfortable, the doors were off the wardrobe, bathroom not clean, when asked for an ironing board it took an hour to get it. We were very unhappy with our accomodation and would not recommend this to any one other than maybe backpackers~1~2~3~2~1~1~2~nan
review_167979785~“Average stay, for the price”~We stayed here overnight for my sister's hen's night, and it was ok considering we only needed beds to crash in and a kitchen for drinks and snacks briefly . Everything seemed clean enough, although the single bed in the mezzanine room was the single most uncomfortable bed in the universe. Beware the "free" parking - parking across the road in a complex is included, but parking at the actual hotel will cost you ($15 from memory) - although there was a lower carpark too that I have no idea how you'd get in there, and the staff were not very forthcoming with information. I had trouble finding the hotel the first place, and I'm a nervous driver at the best of times, so I chose to pay, but its not even secure or anything, it was more out of convenience. Also, I had to wait for another guest to let me in from the carpark, because the way to reception wasn't clearly signed. The actual hotel is well situated and you can't hear road noise or people in other rooms. It was fine for our needs but I wouldn't stay again.~3~2~4~2~2~2~2~nan
review_166005751~“AWFUL! Don't stay here!”~DON’T STAY HERE!! We were looking for a place to stay that was fully self-contained and had the facilities to cook as we were travelling with our 2 young children. Their website stated that their “premium accommodation” apartments are fully equipped. The website photos made the apartments look modern, clean and tastefully decorated. Upon arrival however, it became apparent that we had been conned. The 2 bedroom apartment we had been given was nothing short of disgusting! We had booked for 3 nights but we couldn’t get out of there fast enough and left after 1 night. Our apartment was filthy! The walls were caked in dirt, grime and unidentified splatters of I don’t even want to know what. Old, stained, torn and fraying carpet everywhere. Damaged and dirty furniture. The bathroom, omg the bathroom – the door handle was falling off, the floor and edges of the shower were thickly layered in yellow-brown grime, large expanses of paint had peeled off the painted shower tiles and the showerhead was black and grimy. Old beds with cheap old mattresses. The carpet underneath the master bed has obviously not been vacuumed for years. The bedroom door was so filthy I refused to touch it! The “fully equipped” kitchen in an apartment for 4 people had only 1 bowl, 3 forks, 3 cups and 1 wine glass. There was inadequate utensils to cook a meal and the oven was old and dodgy. The curtains across the main living areas only covered half of the glass so there was absolutely no privacy. The “private balcony” was only 2 tiles wide. There was only 1 towel per guest per week but not enough rails to hang them up to dry after use and our apartment was missing the bath it was advertised as having. The washer/dryer took 3 hours to dry a damp towel. "Quiet central courtyard" - absolutely not! This complex is so noisy, even inside the units as the windows seem to offer nil protection from the street noise - don't stay here if you want a good night's sleep! The whole complex feels quiet seedy and dirty.  Honestly, words can’t do justice to how awful this place was. I didn’t want to touch or sit on anything! This place is old, run down, shabby and absolutely filthy. Their self-rated 4 stars is a joke!- I’d give it MINUS stars if I could! I’ve attached photos – check them out for yourself.~1~1~4~2~1~1~1~nan
review_148397525~“Hit and Miss”~Bonapartes apartments are an amateur operation, with the occasional win if you're not fussy. I was unfortunate enough to be staying here during schoolies. So noisy, and management didn't care that they were disrespectful to other guests. Management: Reception is manned from 10am to 5pm. And not a second longer. Ridiculous for a business that claims to rent out "executive suites" to business travelers. I asked to be moved to a room on the Agnes St side, and they told me one would be opening up the next day. I came in at lunch to confirm, however they had already given it away after offering it to me. Don't expect much from the management family. Room: Stayed in a one bedroom apartment - number 9. Galley kitchen was ok, decent sized fridge, well supplied with utensils and pans, but only a small hotplate and microwave to cook with. Furniture is all IKEA, perfectly serviceable. Air con had a terrible smell, and kept having to close the balcony doors (there are two - one off the living, one off the bedroom) with cigarette smoke drifting in. Disgusting. The en-suite bedroom is of good size, but has a weird bathroom setup. Basin over the combined washer dryer, galley style against the wall. Then a sliding door on the ensuite proper with the shower and toilet.  Maintenance: The cistern in my room kept flushing every 1.5minutes and was not seen to even when i brought it to managements attention. The washer/dryer put mould and stain marks on my clothing, and the dryer function didn't work at all. Cleanliness: One dead cockroach and a few ants with whom to share the appartment. Apartments are serviced once a week. Make sure your towels last. There is a $50 cleaning fee if you leave any rubbish or dishes out.  Clientele: Business travelers please avoid if you value a good night's rest. Party-goers, this place is for you. Families, the pool is nice but often filled with revelers working off a hangover. Location: Excellent convenience to Fortitude Valley with its restaurants, bars and nightlife. Not too long a walk to the river and the city. Noise: Terrible road noise. The apartments occupy the end of a block bordered by Agnes st (the quietest side), St Paul's Terrace (the noisy side) and Gipps St (the appallingly noisy side). I was in a Gipps St apartment. There is no insulation and the doors and windows aren't well sealed so road noise is just as noisy with the doors open as closed.  Over the weekend this is a party hotel so be prepared for noisy balcony parties and the stamping of feet on the floor above. Value: Excellent value for money if the above does not bother you.~2~4~4~1~2~3~1~nan

review_126021723~“DO NOT STAY HERE”~We had a really bad experience here - we asked booked a SPACIOUS one bedroomed apartment and got given a studio apartment. The room stank of sewerage when we complained about the stench and the room we were given a can of air freshner and was told that the room is bigger than most in the city (utter rubbish) our bedroom was bigger than the whole apartment! We had ant issues and when we checked in there was used condoms in a box under the table in the living room! very poor servce the manager would not move us or cancel our booking!!~1~1~5~1~1~1~1~nan
review_118543181~“Ask for room 19 when you book. It's really nice.”~Considering the price and location, this place is pretty good. Some rooms have been renovated. So ask for apartment 19 which is nice and has a big courtyard plus a balcony. The lady referred to in other reviews apparently no longer works there. I found everyone very nice and accommodating. It's not 5 star but it was so great to find something so spacious and self contained close to cbd and valley. I'll go back.~4~5~5~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_105376512~“Very Poor Service”~If I could give Minus 1 I would! One small roll of toilet paper - already largely used up.Asked for another - told"Try Coles it's not far from here, just walk up the hill and you'll see it." The water in the shower - so weak - my urine is stronger.No light in the bathroom, no light in the bedroom. When arrive the single blanket smells, but never changed.No housecleaning for 5 days. No soap - have to ask especially. Only one given - per request. One towel per week. Have to clean room yourself and put out rubbish.If not pay $50 extra! Sign at reception says "Will Be Back in 5-10 minutes". Should be the message on the receptionist's headstone - you could die waiting.~1~1~3~2~2~1~1~nan
review_101172561~“what a rude person”~In September we rang for a quote for 2 bedroom apartment for 3 nights over new year for myself, my best friend & her partner. What we were quoted seemed reasonable so we booked & were sent an email confirming a 2 b/r apartment & paid a deposit. My friends partner arrived 1st & rang us at the airport to advise us that we had been given a 1 b/r mezzanine. So we rang from the airport & the woman that answered told us we had only paid for the mezzanine. When we told her that we had a confirmation for 2 b/r she told us that if you don't like it she would give a refund & we could find somewhere else...like that was going to happened at 5pm on NYE. I could not believe how rude she was. The gentleman that worked there come to our room later & tried to make amendes with a bottle of wine & the offer of a bottle of scotch, which we declined, then he told us he would something out like a free weekend or something, we never saw him again. The next morning we went to speak to the owner & show her our confirmation & the only argument that she had was that we didn't pay for a 2 b/r. Our argument being we would have no idea what the tariffs are except what we were quoted over the phone & we had requested a 2b/r & had that confirmed & it was their error if we had been undercharged. She then advised us we could leave if we weren't happy but we would not get a refund .So I was stuck sleeping on a fold out sofa bed that had the most digusting stains & the biggest dip in the mattress. To top it off when we went to check out the reception was closed so a day or 2 after our return home they had actually over charged my credit card by $250 & it took a few days to get it refunded. When speaking to Bill about this he promised to refund an addition $150 for the stuff up with up with our room, 3 months & numerous phone calls & emails & threats to take action with the ACCC we still haven't seen our $150. I have never ever come a cross such a rude person running a business in all my life. After reading some of the above reviews I have no idea how they are still in business~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_90838111~“sub standard and overpriced”~This hotel was the only one left available for a one night stay that was necessary for my partner her parents and myself. A very substandard hotel with the downstairs shower not working and very unclean. Should have taken notice of other reviews.  The fold out bed was broken which we didnt discover until bedtime which was too late to do anything about.  Location is ok being more in the valley than it is in Spring Hill.

review_70433088~“TOTAL DISASTER ZONE”~Asked for a quiet room in my online booking. Had all and sundry walking past window early hours of every morning and the rubbish truck make two early morning visits right outside. Upstairs guest partied all night even though notice says to be quiet after 8.30pm. I think she is a prostitute because she kept having visitors that only stayed for about 15 minutes. A group came back one night and one screamed like a banshee for no reason, then laughed her head off. Went and saw management tell them what was going on and cut my 7 night stay.

review_54466533~“Good value for money paid. Not as bad as previous reviews indicate”~we booked a 2 bedroom apartment for a weekend stay with my in-laws, partner and 9 year old daughter. After reading some of the reviews (after the booking; not smart......), we thought we'd made a BIG mistake booking this place. We nearly re-booked, but decided to take a punt anyway. The building is relatively easy to find, the entrance to reception a bit harder, but there are signs pointing you in the right way. There is ample undercover, secured parking. THe building and grounds are not new anymore, that's for sure. A good lick of paint and some reno's wouldn't go wasted, but all in all the place looked okay. There's a pool that looks fine. The official website talks about "boutique" apartments, and has lovely photos on it...... don't you believe it....... Piccies probably taken on day 1 of its existence...... the place looks like it's been used, and has been exposed to the Queensland weather. The trim and furnishings in the room have been through tough times as well. Not the newest materials anymore. We got room 40, a 2 level apartment with plenty of bedding (6-8 people easy), a -too small for the job- aircon, and all the mod cons one needs (tv, washing machine, stove, fridge, etc.). The 2 people at reception were both very friendly and helpful. No probs there. the only funny thing was the bond: they block $400 on your credit card for a number of days (dependent on your length of stay); in our case: 2 days stay was 4 days block. All the stuff in the cupboards was clean, and so were all our bedding and towel materials. The beds were great; must have been fairly new. The apartment was in OK condition; not flash, but good enough for $140 per night (MASSIVE rooms, 2 bedroom unit, 2 levels; I think $140 is pretty good). There is a fair bit of road noise if you sleep on the street side, but hey, you're in China town, Spring Hill. Things happen in places like that. We slept on the courtyard end of the apartmentl; no worries there; also because of the gentle hum of the aircon unit. We struck it unlucky the 2nd night with party-goers talking and shouting loudly in the unit below us until about 4.30am, but that can happen anywhere....... aircon on full blast made the racket less bad...... Sunday reception was closed, so we dropped our keys in the drop-box. Our kettle packed up on us; it was quite an old one I must say, but that's the only thing that went "wrong". All in all: not the flashest place on the planet (I'd give it 2.5 stars), but very centrally located, and really good value for the amount of space we got. Staff were friendly, and room was clean. For that amount of money you cannot go wrong. Definitely not a backpackers only venue.~3~5~4~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_51378401~“Worst service ever!!! Stay away!!!”~Do not stay here!!!! Any notion of hospitality and organisation does not exist at this place!!! I booked and paid up-front several weeks in advance for a couple of apartments for myself and some friends for a weekend in Brisbane. Upon arrival all doors into the facility were locked (one with chain and padlock) so we couldn't even access the lobby/reception!! There were no contact numbers anywhere on the front or back doors but luckilly I had my iphone so I got the number off their website and it rang out every time!! We had to sit outside the door until a hotel guest happened to exit (40min later!). THIS WAS AT 4PM ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON!!! Not exactly quiet check-in time for a hotel. The reception was UNATTENDED, no staff ANYWHERE! I called the in-case-of-emergency mobile number discretely placed on a noticeboard and the staff member on the other end of the line made a fuss because he was at home and had to come and help us(WTF??!!). 30min later he arrives, he cant find our bookings, and after another hour of fussing around we get access to rooms that haven't been cleaned yet!!! Broken bathroom doors, back-breaking sofa beds, blackouts and heavilly chlorinated pools aside(!!), we then come to the checkout... The female manager walked into our apartments unannounced (privacy anyone??!), treats us like a bunch of school children (we are all professionals in our mid-30s) and spoke to us in a completely condescending tone telling us that everything needs to be clean or they will charge us $400 for cleaning, and that 'she wants it done amicably' (is there any other way?!). We go to the reception to check-out and IT TOOK US 3 HOURS TO CHECK OUT because they had processed our billing incorrectly and wanted to make sure we had paid the right amount (it turned out they had overcharged US!!). Through all this the manager was making accusations, and even threatened to call the police on us??!! We all stood there in complete disbelief. It was the most surreal/stupid/ridiculous situation I have experienced in a long time and it wasted half a day of my holiday that I would rather be spending doing something productive. In summary... AVOID THIS PLACE!!!~1~2~2~nan~1~2~1~nan
review_40176501~“How does this dump rate so high?”~I can't believe there are 21 hotels in Brisbane that are worse than this dump. When reception is closed and you call the hotel (to let them know that you'll be arriving at 10pm), the phone gets diverted to a non-existent number - helpful! When you do eventually get through, they'll give you the code to the front door and tell you that your apartment will be left unlocked and the key will be left on the kitchen table. To get into the 'complex' you either have to ascend a very steep set of stairs or go down into car park (both poorly lit). Either way, you're greeted with a door that could've been used to protect a local crack den - how welcoming... To get to any of the rooms that aren't on the ground floor, you'll need mountain climbing equipment as the stairs are that steep. Once in the rooms themselves, you'll notice that one of the first things stated in the information pack is that no refunds are given for early departures. You'll also realise that the windows are no use for anything other than keeping the rain out and if you're hoping to get any sleep after 0530 in the morning when the sun's streaming through the sheer curtains and the traffic noise is deafening, good luck! Tripadvisor needs a "Would you recommend this hotel to your worst enemy" option. I'd tick no.~1~1~3~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_35624056~“Clothing bin is more appealing”~Hello, Just wanted to warn all future guests not to bother with this place. We were moving interstate and were looking for temporary accomadation until we could find a house and within minutes of arriving we were back at reception. We found this place on the net and rang and booked for a week on arrival of the premises it was a dump noisy and rundown with cling wrap around the smoke alarm!!! we told the blond we were cancelling she asked why? Not to our standards we booked from out of town looking to start work the following monday there was no way in the world we would have slept. This place is only good for backpackers ... Anyway we left and when my partner checked her visa the blond charged the entire weeks rent when we were not even in the room 5 minutes I know most people would understand a last minute cancellation and perhaps a single nights fee but a week what a joke all I can say is watch your back you ex call girl...~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_35113251~“don't stay there!”~booked this place for 4 nights. the pictures online were deceiving. the actual apartment is old and run down. all fixtures are old even though furniture is not too bad. bathroom is terrible. small and old. apartment only has sheer curtain to the entrance. doesn't offer much for privacy. very very noisy! reception is meant to open 9-6. came back every night by 5.30pm and it's always shut except 1 night. stove not working and of course i couldn't tell anyone as the reception wasn't open for most of the time. really below motel standard rather than their self rated 4 star.~1~1~4~nan~2~2~1~nan
review_33842216~“Dont stay here!”~My partner and I were moving back to brisbane and were looking for accommodation between finding a flat. We booked 7 nights here through WOTIF, which was a pretty good deal, we only stayed here one night and thank god it was only one night. The front office staff didnt seem to know what was going on, check in was quite disorganised. These apartments are like glorified backpackers, the rooms are old, tired, everything has a hole in it or is well past its sell by date! The room was clean, but the crockery, cutlery etc were not!! Definately not boutique and dont be fooled by the pictures on their website! They are nothing like that!! It is located on one of the busiest roads in Brisbane, noise doesnt stop! Even ear plugs didnt help!! Also if you leave any rubbish in the apartment they will charge you $400 for the removal fee!! Dont stay here, pay a bit more for somewhere quieter and more up to date.~1~1~2~nan~1~3~1~nan
review_30618448~“Old and tired”~I stayed here for a work trip, and while the location is good, the apartments are very run down. It looks like the whole place is in need of a re-fit. Chipped & worn paint, broken tiles, snapped soap holders was my experience. The room I stayed in was quite dirty - the mugs had been used for coffee & put away unwashed plus the cupboard was full of crumbs from the toaster. I must admit that the room I had was quite spacious, but my colleague had a room that was half the size - so you can't be sure what you will get. The bed was terrible - the mattress sagged in the middle, which would have been awful if there were two traveling. The complex has a nice pool but I think there are better places to stay. I won't be returning.~2~2~4~nan~2~1~2~nan
review_29208075~“Ripped Off”~I booked on line as I was from out of state,I paid for all expenses up frount as well the hotel demanding $300 holding deposit before I arrived. On arrived at appartments I told one partner that we were intending to go shopping on the last morning before we leave and that we would need our bags to be here before departing that afternoon. he was happy to accomidate us and said it wad no problem, as long and the cleaners could access the room we could take our time basically. . I booked for 3 nights and the second day the fire alams where sounding more than 3 times and the lady owner was screaming at everone as she thinks we all were using hair straignters or somthing , so the thrid night we diceded to stay elsewhere to get a better nights sleeps as we had a late night planned and didnt have to fly out until the next afternoon. I stayed at friends and returned to the complex at 915am I cleaned and packed all my bags and waited for my other flat mate. I was completly ready to go at 940am and I sat outside on the step in the sun. approx 1040 the cleaners arrived and i let them in they advised it was fine to leave the keys on the table as I have prepaid etc and reception door was closed anyway. My flat returned at 11.10 and we packed the car and as i was leaving i notice the reception door was open. Out of curtisy I dropped into say thanks. the owner said who are you?? I said I was a guessed and i have just returned to pick up my bags? she said i cant rent that room out now??? i said what are you talking about I let the cleaners in ages agoand I wasnt even in the room.. she muttered dont worry about it and I left without no thanks for staying Nothing. Two days latter i was checking on my visa card on line and she had charged me a wooping $200.00 without telling me nor my approval. I called and she was rude and hung up the phone on me... DO NOT trust this Lady. the worst experience ever.~1~1~3~nan~1~2~1~nan
review_20946002~“New management - Going backwards”~I have stayed hwere a couple of times. Previously the management were very obliging and organised. This time it was very disorganised. They seemed to blaming everyone else but themselves. Don't bother with this one.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_15772688~“Terrible. Very noisy. Don't bother with this one.”~I stayed here one night. It was so noisy that I didn't get any sleep and I checked out the next day. The customer service is very poor. Terrible.~1~1~3~nan~3~3~1~2
review_7617943~“Good location but the apartment needs some basic improvements.”~We (2 adults and 2 children, aged 9 and 5) stayed at this apartment for 4 days in May 2007. Although i am very happy with the organisation of the booking (very prompt replies) and the late check-in that was organised for us, there are many minor things that detracted from the stay. I would like to highlight the positives however, which was the space (plenty of it), comfortable beds and ample storage space and a nice outdoor area around the pool. It is a 5 minute walk to the wonderful china-town area and public transport options are plentiful. Now for the bad, after selecting the apartment, based on its amenities, i was rather dissapointed that the washing machine was not working. I would have considered asking to be moved to another apartment, however the office was not open, nor was it open for the remaining 3 days. And then, the plethora of broken/unavailable items just kept popping up.....broken door handle on the balcony, broken close horse, dirty glasses, light not working in the outside stairwell (rather dangerous as stairs as steep), the tv was not tuned in (we had to do this ourselves), no corkscrew/bottle opener. I would have liked to of notified management, however there was no review form or indeed, any check-out information provided. The apartment could easily be improved with attention to these (and other) minor issues. ~3~3~5~nan~2~2~nan~4
