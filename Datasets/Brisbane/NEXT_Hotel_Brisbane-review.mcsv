review_478689025~“Nice facilities, poor cleaning”~It's a new hotel, nicely decorated. Smells perfume everywhere and I found that irritant. Even at the gym, teh air smells. Also, the cleaning of the room was very superficial. It looked like they just remade the bed but .~4~3~5~4~3~2~3~nan
review_478389561~“Great location”~Great location, very handy to everything . The staff were excellent and very friendly. We enjoyed a lovely dinner in the restaurant.The only trouble we had was it was a little difficult to find re parking.~5~5~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_478380453~“FUN BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AT NEXT”~Had a great time was on 26th floor-room was great -service great-pool bar area at night awesome ,met up with friends and had a few drinks there. The technology at next was also fun to use-Only thing I would change is have a buffet breakfast~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_478374482~“Enjoyable Visit”~Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel. Great facilities and very well positioned in the City. The pool and other facilities are great. Minor complains would be the pillows being too hard and breakfast could have offered some cereals as part of the buffet. Other than that I would definitely recommend this Hotel.~4~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_478366617~“Minespec Parts”~Perfection every time and I choose to stay at NEXT due to now established relationships, convenience, your staff in all areas and location. I love level 4, the food, the hip hotel amenities and the gym.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_478356514~“Good hotel in CBD”~Good, clean hotel well located ion CBD. Reliance on tech in guest rooms is a bit contrived. Swimming pool is more for show than function (who wants to swim with a audience in the pool bar?). Good Wi-Fi. Mini-bar perks are a welcome change!~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_478356197~“Perfect in Brisbane”~Simply an outstanding location comfortable room and great service! The lounges both by the pool and in reception area were fantastic, just book this hotel, you won't be disappointed. We didn't have a car, and didn't need one!~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_478245634~“Great location, very comfortable hotel with great facilites : )”~Perfectly located right on Queen St pedestrian mall in the centre of town. Modern comfortable rooms (except the remote control lights are impossible to get right!). 4 free minibar items each day is a nice bonus. In-room coffee machine. Free Wi-Fi worked very well. Nice gym and pool. Terrace bar and lounge is nice but the music was not to my taste and was somewhat overbearing. Helpful staff. They also have 3 'sleep pods' near the lounge, but it's a busy area so it's not ideal for "sleeping" - altho it's still a good for trying to get some short rest, and better to have these than not at all. Note the rooms xx04 and xx11 seem slightly smaller, and the toilet door is a very large sliding door to whole bathroom -- it's inconvenient if you're sharing the room with someone else. I would be happy to stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_478119009~“Great location in Brisbane CBD”~Great place to stay. Easy and so convenient. An equipped gym and great lounge area near the pool. Can arrive early or late - no problem.

review_477935387~“Fabulous NEXT to nothing ”~This is the second time I am staying here what can I say but I love this place. Valet parking needs to be attended to more though. Food and bar by the pool fantastic. 4 items from the minibar per night also great perk. Swimming pool is glorious. Love the sleep pods in the lounge great idea. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477870389~“Great overnight stay”~We stayed for one night on our way to the airport after being on the gold coast for a week. It was a really great hotel, top notch service, and quality of room. We loved the free mini bar items and the complimentary shampoos etc were really nice quality. The lights were a bit fiddly using the digital tool, but not a deal breaker. We were very impressed with the hotel and will definitely return if we need to spend a night in Brisbane. Very central to shops and restaurants etc too.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_477644887~“Good for business trip”~A really handy location with very friendly and efficient staff. There's a good gym. I like this hotel lots. The only downside is they have stopped in-room breakfast since my last visit. Otherwise I highly recommend it.~4~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan

review_477620297~“Love it .love it ,superb hotel.”~My wife and I spent two nights in Brisbane around Christmas time as she wanted to do some shopping on Boxing Day .we managed to get a reservation at the Next hotel for two nights .We chose this hotel because according to the map it is situated on Queens street mall so we didn't have to drive to the shops .We checked the reviews on Trip advisor and ticked all the boxes for us. we were so impressed that we promised that we will be back again soon and we did,this time not for the shopping but to see the play My fair lady.We travel a lot and this hotel to me is as good as the Hilton or the Hyatt hotels if not better.The location ,the rooms,the facilities within the hotel are first class but most of all the staff are most obliging and so friendly .We thank you .The valet parking attendant was very helpful and polite.We thank you for your curtesy.We had breakfast and diner at Lenons in house restaurant and it was excellent .We had not enough time for a dip in the so inviting swimming pool on the fourth or the well equiped gym but we had lunch at the tables around the pool and it was delicious.Thank you very much Next hotel .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477583306~“Succeeding at being different”~The perfect inner city retreat. Fantastic staff (there must be a good manager driving this!) who can't do enough to assist the guests. The location is perfect overlooking Queen Street Mall from a a fabulous deck with pool. The free guest lounge is enormous, fresh and a fabulous idea. Modern, innovative and deserves to do really well! We'll definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477330338~“Noisy Neighbours”~During our stay we had very noisy neighbours which lead us to move rooms twice. No apology from neighbours or accomodation provider for the lack of sleep for a night. This was a quick relaxing getaway and relaxing it was not :(~3~5~5~1~2~5~3~nan
review_477291638~“Would Come Again”~Reception service by Charlene was excellent. Loved the room (clean and light) and great location. All staff were friendly and polite.

review_477271144~“Business trip from China”~Great hotel. Good location and very friendly staff. The Lounge on level 4 is very good for doing business or relaxing.Food in the dining room was really good. Also loved the brand of tea you have. Check in is always easy and the hotel is has meetings rooms available for business meetings which is great asset.~5~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_476945805~“Excellent stay”~I found everything wonderful - no complaints. The only issue was that there were some dark hairs in the sheets but that may have been accidental from the cleaner. This was the best hotel I stayed at during my business trip~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_476935543~“Great hotel”~Love this hotel, my go to in Brisbane. The 4 free mini bar items and free wifi are great. I like how they use the Next app to run everything (air con, lightnin, room service, etc) in the room is a fantastic idea.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan

review_476644793~“Short visit”~Stayed at this hotel before and the location is very good. Lovely hotel inside and very helpful at the checking in desk.

review_476632633~“Sublime”~Our 2nd stay here was just as perfect as the 1st time. Fantastic location right in heart of CBD. Was great sitting on pool terrace watching the hub of the city below. Staff went above and beyond, they were so friendly.  Rooms were clean, fresh and I love the funky minimal design.  Loved every bit. Will be back again (but will wait till the pool is warmer )~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476593627~“Very Good Hotel In the centre of Brisbane”~Stayed again in this hotel Always very good Only issue was in the restaurant I was the only one in the restaurant and they forgot part of my order and I still had to ask for drinks But otherwise very good~5~5~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_476592932~“Descriptions and hype better than the reality”~Bed was poorly made with the sheet not reaching the bottom creating enough of a change in textures that I slept poorly as I kept rubbing my feet around the change trying to work out what was going on. Also, the free mini bar is a gimmick more than anything else, one beer, one cider and no wine unlik any other mini bar at any other hotel. Great to get one beer but sometimes after a day of work you want a couple. I wouldn't come back unless it was my only option.~3~3~2~1~3~4~4~nan
review_476432448~“Always awesome”~For a great downtown central to the action place to stay, this is it. Easy access to the mall for shopping, train for trips, 2 mins to the casino and 10 mins to walk to Southbank. Cabs available and easy to get to the airport using the tunnels.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_476356226~“A pleasant surprise in Brisbane”~I really liked this hotel. It is in a good location in the Queen St Mall. The staff are so friendly and having stayed in many hotels in Australia, the staff employed at the Next are amongst the best I have encountered as service in Australia is not always so good.  I liked the modern room with the free movies and mini bar items. I will definitely stay here on my next Brisbane trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476332876~“Pricey for the room size”~Overall not bad. Very good location for walking distance to local attractions. The staff were nice and friendly. The hotel had a good range of amenities, the problem for me was the room size i was given was small for the price and the in room controls although a nice gimmick to the room didn't always work and slow to respond sometimes.~3~3~5~5~2~4~4~nan
review_476322089~“Great Brisbane CBD hotel”~We stayed for a Rugby match at Suncorp Stadium followed by a show at the Performing Arts Centre. The NEXT Hotel is situated right on the Queen Street mall. Its a 7 minute walk across the bridge to the Performing Arts complex and a 15 minute walk to Suncorp Stadium which was perfect for us. Great, hi-tech rooms, with Free movies and some free mini-bar goodies. Friendly staff. Valet parking available, but much cheaper to park in the Myer Centre Car park and get your ticket validated at reception when you check out. We love this hotel and will stay again next time in Brisbane!~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_476282722~“Pleasant stay!!”~We stayed here as it was in the city & we wanted to be close to riverside. Check in was simple & lee who checked us in made us feel so very welcomed.

review_476282625~“Effortless”~Good hotel within striking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, mall and pub. Excellent customer service from staff and the rooms are clean and new. There is free wifi however the connection is speratic. The hotel has a good bar, pool and gym. In room controls are via sumsung mobile hub that you can take with you while waking around and serves both as a phone and a wifi hotspot. I thought that was cool.~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan

review_476259761~“Excellent hotel!”~Excellent experience! In the absolute centre of town, great room, 4 x free mini bar items, you can control everything in your room from a mobile app, mobile hot spot supplied by the hotel, fast free internet, great dinner at the resturant, nice pool & drinks by the pool, don't miss the sleep pods!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475996404~“Friendly hotel in Central Brisbane”~This hotel is in the best location. Right in the Queen St Mall. Close to shops and the Casino you can't really ask for anything more.  The staff are very friendly and are probably the nicest staff we have encountered on our trips to Brisbane.  The hotel is modern and we liked the Samsung phone idea to operate everything in your room.  There is really nothing to fault and the four free mini bar items per night is a great idea. Great concept that sets Next apart from the other hotels in Brisbane. Would definitely stay at the Next again. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475983105~“Such a great stay”~The facilities were modern, the rooms were spacious and clean and the location was terrific. The hotel is right in the middle of Queen Street, so close to pubs, bars, clubs and nice restaurants. We loved the quaint-boutique-style receptions and downstairs cafe which do a lovely breakfast. We stayed for 2 night, 3 days and will definitely be back. The best this about this hotel was the rooftop bar and pool , which had tasty food and great drinks. A little expensive, but very typical for Brisbane~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_475981165~“NEXT HOTEL PERFECT”~This location perfectly suited us. We love the electronics. The bed was comfy. A good snoooooooozzzzzzeeeeee. The waiter was helpful with selections for dinner.

review_475949177~“What a great find”~Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from the concierge service to the room. State of the art amenities with all rooms set up for smart technology. The main restaurant is plush with a great little bar and tasteful self serve/takeway section. The biggest surprise and delight factor was the inhouse guests lounge which opened out to the funky rooftop pool bar which was reminiscent of a Bali upmarket hotel. The guests louunge (which you could access both before and after checkin) was large and plush and perfect for meetings or work. There is a library, a bar, self-serve food, lots of tvs, lounge chairs, lounges and tables, a great gym and the best of the bunch...massaging, relaxation pods. In the centre of the Queen St. Mall it is a perfect location for all CBD attractions and restaurants.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_475941771~“Birthday Fun”~Great spot to organise a large overnight catch up with friends to celebrate an important event- lots of fun! The pool bar was an ideal location to kick the night off with amazing cocktails and DJ to get us all in a festive mood~4~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_475932224~“Room for improvement”~The hotel was terrific but I did not like the room service menu at all - not much too choose from that I liked and when I ordered a nachos it was cold and had no cheese on it (I think that is the way they make them but it is not what most people would expect). The bar fridge was not much better - too many soft drinks and no wine.~2~2~5~5~4~2~3~nan
review_475667650~“Nice hotel in the heart of Brisbane ”~The best thing about this hotel is the phone with hotspot wifi so u can walk in the city using the wifi outside. I don't like the room service, looks like u made an order from mcdc or bgking last time the food I ordered was cold and didn't satisfy my expectations:( but generally the hotel is good enough for 4 star hotel~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475664397~“Lots of creature comforts at this place😎”~I only had trouble trying to get to the parking at this place but reckon that could have been easier if I had seen their online video first. A very brief stay but it was a very welcome and comfortable one. My room was right next to the lift and i was concerned of noise from the lifts operating. The sound proofing must have been good coz i didnt here any! All the room controls on one little mobile phone from tv, to lights etc. Being an android fan myself, found it very convenient. Could also charge my mobile phone directly on the same Qi pad. How brilliant that this hotel allows you 4 complimentary items off the mini bar... anything of your choice!! A very clever use of the space in the room. Excellent location if you want to be at the heart of the city affordably. Will I stay here again.... DEFINITELY!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475524694~“Loved this place!”~Fantastic hotel, very modern and contemporary. Superb location right in the heart of town. Controls for lighting, TV …etc in the room can be done the traditional way, or with the smart phone they provide. Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is no on-site parking, but you can park in the Meyer Centre and the reception staff will validate your ticket with a preferential rate. They do have a drop off area, but would recommend that you watch the helpful You Tube video on the hotel’s website to find it, as its very tricky. Easy walking distance to the Victoria Bridge which will take you over the other side of the river to theatres and museums, plus the Brisbane letters. Also within walking distance are the Botanical Gardens. We also had free wifi in our room.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_475520102~“Cool & modern”~I booked this hotel based on reviews and pics on the booking.com website and overall was pleased with my choice. The only unexpected feature was the size of the room- tiny! At 5.5 x 3.5m in total (including hall and bathroom) it reminded me of hotel rooms in Hong Kong and London. Fortunately I was on my own but it would have been unacceptably squeezy for two. I'm not sure about the other rooms but I got the impression my room- on the top level and in a corner next to the lift shaft- was not the standard layout. This was confirmed when I had to call reception for help finding the unusual, hidden cupboards where the iron and ironing board were secreted. No complaints about the bed which was only a double but was firm and comfortable, the bathroom was also restaurant served a good breakfast and the staff were also helpful and friendly.~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_475379926~“Great location”~Great location and gym was the best I have seen. Comfortable beds and free movies and the 4 items for free from the mini bar was a real treat. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable.~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan

review_475175647~“Always a good experience”~The staff at NEXT are very attentive and friendly. Lennons is a great restaurant and the facilities in the room are fantastic. Always guaranteed a clean room however during my recent trip noticed they were missing towels and a few toiletries. Staff were quick to rectify this and given it was the only time this has happened out of the many times I've stayed here, not bad odds!~5~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_475153487~“Fantastic hotel”~Quirky and modern. Friendly and fun. The Next hotel is a breath of fresh air from the often stagnant hotels available these days. The courteous staff are very helpful and couldn't do more to ensure the stay was enjoyable. The beds are the comfiest I've experienced in any hotel. My only slight reservation - please pop the full breakfast back on the menu; so it's not only available with the continental.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474931451~“Review”~Good Room with everything i needed nice Drink Selection close to all the Shops Nice Employees Easy walking distance to anything nice view of the pool the phone they provided was awesome could sit in bed and turn off and on the lights.

review_474913752~“Be prepared for noise”~Don't expect an early night. Regular events involving amplified music in the Queen Street Mall will interfere with your sleep. Don't plan a day time nap. The city clock peals every 15 mins and the noise insulation is inadequate.~3~3~4~1~4~5~4~nan
review_474901986~“Overnight Stay”~The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Brisbane. The check in/check out method is ver efficient and convenient. The room facilities were great with an extremely comfortable bed and pillows - I didn't have to take my own on this trip. The food was delicious.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_474836345~“A Great Stay!”~Great hotel to stay at. Right in the heart of Brisbane. Wonderful bar and pool to relax by, drink a beer and watch the world go by, esp if you're up for business and on your own. You can come and go with your own vehicle for a one-off daily cost. But remember, even though the sign says "No Entry - Service Vehicles Only" (or something like that) you can enter Queen St Mall, ignore this and follow what the GPS says!~4~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_474801739~“Great weekend at NEXT”~This hotel is the epitome of luxury accomodation. A few friends and I stayed here for my friend's Hen's weekend and it did not disappoint.  The location is actually amazing; everything is literally right at your doorstep. Rooms were beautiful and modern, beds and pillows comfy (always gets a big tick in my book) etc. The ONLY criticism I would have of the rooms, is the lack of privacy when using the bathroom - there are large sliding doors but they aren't that effective in making it a private space when needed.  Staff and facilities were all excellent - the pool bar is a sensational spot, a must when spending time at NEXT. Will most definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474342917~“Best Location for Shopaholics!”~Lovely classy hotel directly opposite the Myer Centre. Great bars and room was lovely! The 4 free minibar items were very welcome although a wine in there would have made it better! The only complaint I have was that my carton of milk and toiletries weren't replaced for my second nights stay.  I would definitely stay again!~5~4~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_474011158~“Very nice”~Everything was top class, except for the in house Samsung remote. It tried to be cutting edge but overall it was annoying. Fox didn't work while I was there. A small bottle of wine would have been nice from the mini bar. I'd really like a balcony to watch everyone go by. Would I stay again? Absolutely. Looking forward to it.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

The only thing that I find lacking is we always have to request a showercap because they are never in the room, but in the complete picture this is a very small negative in a place full of positives.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473969907~“Great hotel, Great location”~NEXT is conveniently located within Queen Street Mall. Despite proximity to the bustle of city life, inside the hotel is quiet and perfectly suited to a peaceful night's sleep. The beds and pillows are so comfortable! Free movies and mini bar treats are stand out luxuries not often found in hotel accommodation. Our dining experience was also very good at the Pool Lounge and Lennon's Restaurant (although I'd recommend adding feta cheese to the continental breakfast selection for the bruschetta). One thing particularly noticeable about NEXT is the use of modern technology which makes me think they're a forward thinking company.~5~4~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_473963784~“Great location”~Excellent location and some great perks like free mini bar items and movies. The technological aspect was irritating at best. Using the app to turn on the lights was more time consuming than actually flicking a switch. There's no benefit to having this on the smart phone. The smartphone room service ordering was useful though. No dessert options on room service was disappointing. Some staff need more training on customer service.~4~4~5~4~4~5~2~nan
review_473962865~“City Stay”~Stayed here for a girls weekend away. Loved the free in room movies! Would of liked to see more options on the room service menu. Pool area was nice and relaxing! Was nice to get four free items from the mini bar.~4~4~4~3~4~4~5~nan
review_473962384~“Very good stay”~Checked-in to this hotel only for one night stay on my business trip. The location is good. However, I couldn't get into queens Street from Elizabeth because of a maintanence truck. I covered the rest on foot. Later found that there's an another Street called Burnett which is behind the hotel and can also be used. The hotel has focused on harnessing technology as much as possible. There's an in-room hotels mobile equipped with an app. It's designed to enable guests to order many things including food, service etc. However, the user interface wouldn't be easy for a non tech savvy. It can be improved. The restaurant downstairs serves continental food and is worth trying.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473957520~“Great”~Excelletn place to stay. One step to Queen Plaza and few minutes walk to the Reviser side. NEXT Apps shows how the mobile phone technology can be used. If you want to see how to maximize a small place and get incredible comfort, the rooms of NEXT hotel are the best example.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_473957169~“Awesome”~Highly recommend NEXT hotel, second time back and once again loved everything about the hotel, an amazing experience. Very friendly staff, very clean room, perfect location, can't fault it. We will be back again. Thankyou~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473955632~“Musty damp room”~We arranged a twin share room through Agoda, specifically requesting in additional notes. When arriving to the room and calling guest services, we were advised we could either pay for the upgraded room or pay for a roller bed - each option being $60 extra. We got the upgrade and room 2608 has a damp musty smell that permeated the room and our clothing, which was really quite disgusting.~3~3~5~4~4~4~3~nan
review_473921430~“So much more than I thought”~Beautiful view, great location. The room was so much better than I ever thought and the staff were fantastic. The food was delicious and service was impeccable. I will stay again for my next business and personal trips.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473908989~“Professional and friendly excellence”~We held a training program at Next....staff and facilities were superb. Program ran smoothly and support was exceptional. Accommodation was of the highest standard with a good range of in-house dining options. Highly recommended on all accounts!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473717432~“A series of unfortunate events”~Having stayed at the Next a year ago and with the amazing experience had, we were sure that this would be a perfect spot for my overseas Fathers 70th birthday weekend in Brisbane, however, upon arrival, we found the toilet leaking in my parents room. Upon changing rooms they discovered red wine stains all over carpet and pillows and also greasy hand prints on furniture, marks on the walls everywhere along with filthy wall tiles in the bathroom. Meanwhile myself and my partner discovered our booked extra large bed (being used to a king size at home) was a double bed in a shoe boxed size room so we had to change and were arguing with the reception about our booking. After some unpleasant feelings were expressed we were given a room with an extra large bed and also we insisted that my parents had the same. Even then, my parents room had again red wine stains on the carpet and also cracked/crumbling grout in the bathroom. Then there was the problem of the handset smart phone controller not being programmed properly and needing attention along with paid movies cutting off halfway through yet being charged for 2 movies upon check out after getting back into the movie library and selecting the same film to watch the last half. The reception/concierge kept apologising with a very weak unfelt apology which became mildy annoying. Our dining experience in Lennons began wonderfully with the manager greeting us and shoeing us to our table but then the starter of mussels were served to us cold and the medium rare steaks were left under a heat lamp for 15 mins and eventually arrived like well done steaks fit for a dog. We had to wait over 20 mins for 2 beers which were forgotten and we watched the girls eating their meals until the steaks arrived again and were very salty and this time medium -not medium rare. A truly awful un attentive dining experience in which we paid $80 per person for starters and drinks. We found the hotel to be tired and in great need of attention to walls being marked, loose taps in the guest toilets, catpet stains, bed cushions in poor condition, towels smelling like food, split silicone sealant in the shower & lift floor stone being cracked/crumbling. Upon checking out we were not asked if we enjoyed our stay and were charged for parking, breakfasts etc without a tax invoice being given which is illegal and also being told that they would email the account, of which we still have not received. Overall, we would never stay here EVER again~1~1~5~1~3~1~2~nan
review_473713986~“Awesome”~If you're looking for an excellent place to stay - please consider this unique boutique hotel. It's just fabulous and the staff are awesome! Also - you can have 4 items from the minibar free... (water is a must...)~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473687929~“Great location”~The hotel is in a great location. Lovely clean rooms beds very comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful .I would make sure no parties were book on weekend as unable to be accessed certain areas bar and not a very quit getaway where you can sit and chat without large numbers of people. The pool couldn't swim as to small and people sitting around drinking so not very private for the people that don't want to look like a fish in a bowl swimming around . That's the only faults i would most definitely say I again.~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_473559384~“Noise ”~I had stayed in the Next Hotel before and was impressed by the quality of the accommodation, food etc. I've stayed the last 2 nights in the hotel for business and the constant loud music from the pool bar the last 2 nights has been a nightmare. Unfortunately I won't stay here again. It's OK to be hip and have a cool rooftop pool bar but if this makes the stay a nightmare for guests please rethink it.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473310401~“Very handy excellent hotel with option for cheap parking”~My husband and I (middle aged) have stayed at Next Hotel twice recently and both times the hotel and staff met all our needs. With quick and easy drop off of luggage in Burnett Lane and parking at The Myer Centre being validated, it makes The Next Hotel the ideal place to stay when attending concerts at Sirromet as we did both times. The coach transport for Sirromet picks up and drops off at King George Square which is a short stroll from Burnett Lane entrance. The pool was only used on our first visit as it was a bit cool on the most recent stay. Room was very clean both times with everything working. The four free items from the minibar is a nice touch. Staff have all been very friendly and professional. Definitely recommend the Next Hotel for couples.~5~4~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_473292009~“NEXT Experience”~1. Room clean, neat and tidy. (Room 505, 05 Apr 17) 2. Towels, some appeared to have pulled threads, well used and thread bare. 3. Difficult to navigate to front door with car. 4. Valet service excellent. I'm from the Baby Boomer generation and found the Samsung room controller/phone a challenge to operate. A hard copy guide next to the device would have helped immensely.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473290919~“Brilliant location”~Excellent service fantastic location. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to stay in central Brisbane close to many attractions including botanical gardens, theatres transport and river cruises~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473289814~“Excellent stay”~Room was delightful, loved the décor and facilities. The style of the airport was very modern and in line with other world locations. The hotel is well situated as you step out onto the mall with shops. Restaurants are close by.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473280714~“Bris vegas”~By Peter April 2017  The hotel was centrally located, my room was excellent, was upgraded on check in and all staff were pleasant and courteous. Breakfast was delivered very quickly, nil hassles. Would definitely recommended the hotel to others and will stay here again.~5~5~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_473255762~“Great location Comfortable Room”~Enjoyed my stay, room was clean and well maintained. Four free mini bar items were a nice touch. The hotel was centrally located right on queen st mall. Would definitely stay again when in Brisbane. Check-in and check-out processes were very efficient.~5~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_473238711~“Enjoyed the stay @ Next”~Enjoyed my stay. Loved getting 4 free mini bar items. Clean and tidy rooms. The staff were friendly. Centrally located. Would be good to have few more free on-demand movies. I will definitely stay at Next when I visit Brisbane again.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473058825~“Brisbane”~I loved my stay at Next. The hotel was centrally located, the rooms were excellent and staff were pleasant. I will definitely stay at Next when I am in Brisbane again. I couldn't fault it and can't wait to return.~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_473047794~“Breakfast”~The breakfast menu and breakfast was disappointing.The hot breakfast menu was very limited and did not include any sides; mushrooms, baked beans, avocado, etc.  The portion size was also very small and it was expensive give the portion size.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473041941~“Top notch comfort; fantastic location. ”~What an absolute delight of a hotel, I don't know where to begin on which aspect delighted me more!  The hotels location was fantastic. Nestled in the middle of the main shopping street and a mere walk from the harbour front. (Good running trail).  The shopping street was very calm yet had all the main chains; Zara, H&M, Cotton On, LUSH including Myer Mall too.  Great to be so accessible to other breakfast spots and dinner places should you wish to venture out of the hotel.  An underground train station is essentially adjacent the hotel- you wouldn't know it was there as you can't hear a thing.  Naturally you will need to leave the hotel but you won't want to!  The hotel is a perfect fusion of functionality and practically with a modern touch. The human element behind the hotels design is evident as the details in the services they offer is second to none.  In the bedroom you shall find a Samsung mobile phone that you can use outside of the hotel to make local calls and link to your phone as a mobile hotspot!  You can browse the room service menu, control your lights and television and even text an on demand concierge who will reply to you in moments to answer any questions, concerns or attend to your technophobe troubles.  The bedrooms are spacious yet cosy. A good sized bed, comfortable with big fluffy pillows to sink into.  There is even a pillow menu on your handheld so you can have one ordered to your room! This made me very excited. You can also select a time to get it delivered too!! The television is as big as my headboard and has lots of fantastic free movies, (recent ones too!), along with standard television channels and movie packages you may purchase, should you wish to do so.  The bathroom is brand new; a walk in power shower with glass front. It is a well thought out layout with plenty of light, mirrors and space to hang your clothes.  The amenities were lovely too.  Breakfast was fantastic. It is lovely to see a very healthy start to the day encouraged. You can either select a continental plan or a hot breakfast menu from the menu. Should you select the latter you get a choice of one dish from the kitchen. For example, eggs benedict, smashed avocado on garlic focaccia etc.  I had the smashed avocado and my colleague had the eggs benedict.  They were impeccably delivered to us and tasted absolutely delicious. Yum!  Service was great even at busy times (we grazed breakfast for almost 3 hours from 6.45-9.30)! And we weren't bothered to move on at all. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive, happy, friendly and engaging. Faultless.  The fruit was very fresh and they had a yummy selection of yoghurt including coconut yoghurt for any nondairy tummies!  A pleasure to see a selection of chia seeds, dried apricots, cranberries, pumpkin seeds, nuts and shredded coconut to add to your cereals or yoghurt bowls too.  Orange, Apple and pineapple juice available along with unlimited coffee from the machine were available.  A small selection of breakfast deserts on offer too. I sampled the carrot cake. Yum.  The breads were all fresh and included a sourdough loaf which made me very happy!  Everything proactively replenished. The human touch is seen throughout the staffs personable approach and through the amenities offered.  Sleep pods and shower pods for anyone when their check in and out times don't match their itinerary.  In room exercise is pretty cool. Send a text on the phone and they'll send you a Swiss ball, yoga mat , Pilates rings and therapy bands to your room!!!! There is a gym 24 hours a day and a beautiful outdoor pool too!  You honestly won't regret staying here. It's truly a cool and fabulous hotel! Already can't wait to come back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473024565~“Restaurant”~Restaurant food was terrible. I waisted $19 as there was nothing at all I would eat for Breakfast. Some basic cereal (cornflakes, weetbix etc) would have been good and normal uts of bread. Not everyone is a health fanatic. This was the only setback everything else is great.~5~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_473006384~“Another great Next stay”~I love the Next hotel. This time I also had a great dinner at the restaurant. Friendly service, great food, good value. I always appreciate the free 4 items - just had one chocolate bar this time. Great location, too.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
