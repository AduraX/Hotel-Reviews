review_473342775~“Hits the mark. ”~I stayed at the hotel for a week. Nice, clean, tidy, well located hotel.  Room was very clean, air conditioning worked well which is always a plus for me.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Lots of local restaurants which is great for choice beyond the hotel restaurant and Coles is close by at Toowong Village.  Parking was great and easily accessible.  Wi-Fi was free and speedy :-)  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470211894~“Powdered spread”~Let me begin with this: do not miss the restaurant. I'll get back to this. I had the opportunity to stay at the Jephson Hotel on my first business trip to Australia. The hotel appears clean and the staff, even the room maid, was very friendly. I had a room on the 4th floor with a balcony towards an intersection with, at times, quite dense traffic, but even though, the sliding door was closing out the noise so well that even jet lag would not keep me awake.  Unfortunately I only spend one evening, the last, in the restaurant. And I pity that. The dish I had by far exceeded the cuisines I had the earlier days on Queen Street (the business quarter). What I mostly enjoyed was the desert made out of powdered Nutella. Don't miss that!~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468974569~“Rude Reception ”~Stayed at the Jephson Hotel for a few days this past month. Rooms were tidy. Location good. However, reception was terribly rude.  The female receptionist in all of our contact with her was condescending, passive aggressive. In every interaction my husband and I felt belittled by her. In our opinion she has either been in the hospitality industry TOO long or not long enough.  Other receptionist was OK. However, we witnessed him walking through around the hotel in pajamas several times. He Walked through restaurant like he owned the place. He walked in front of my husband and I at breakfast, walked behind the bar and made himself coffee! In pajamas! Felt sorry for the staff in the restaurant who were clearly busy, and had to tell him to come back. Such a display.  All in all, would come back again. However would wait to be checked in by someone competent. Staff training would not go astray.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466640883~“Pleasant hotel”~Pros - Room was spacious and clean. Modern TV. Bathroom clean. Toiletries provided. Tea and coffee making facilities provided. Wardrobe and fridge in-room. Balcony with table and two chairs. Free parking under hotel. Check-in checkout easy and quick. Staff polite. Internet in-room but can’t comment as I didn’t use it. Cons – when guests in other rooms flushed the toilet or took a shower it was very noisey. Restaurant closed on a Saturday night ?! No bath~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_462629129~“Clean and conveniently located”~The rooms are basic but clean and spacious. The reception is locked up at 8:30pm, which makes late check-in a bit difficult, and the WiFi system needs an upgrade. There are shops and restaurants within walking distance and a train station close by so getting to the city centre is easy. My stay there was comfortable and I would recommend the place if you are looking for a decent hotel in Toowong.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~3~nan
review_460321786~“Clean, quiet, one of the better choices in the area”~This hotel is pretty basic, but the rooms are clean, decently sized and quiet. On the 4th floor there is a conference room and if there is a conference and they leave the door open you will find it extremely noisy, so I'd advise asking for a room on the other floors due to this. There are washing machines available for 4 dollars (two 2 dollar coins) and a dryer for another 4 dollars. There is a restaurant and bar downstairs. The staff leave reception around 8:30pm and the reception is then looked up. The wifi system is silly as you have to find the individual modem number then enter the modem number as the first password then use passwords the receptionist will give you on slips of paper every 24 hours to continue to be online, so I hope at some point they will upgrade this way of doing things as it's a hassle. Overall a decent choice if in this area.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459356661~“Clean and comfortable with friendly staff”~I have stayed here several times before on business and find the rooms well presented and more importantly, quiet. There are laundry facilities on each room and the Covet restaurant downstairs provides great meals and a competitive price. The A/C is okay but it is probably time for this hotel to spend some of their profits on upgrading it since it only just meets an acceptable standard. Good location for local shops and restaurants and not too far out of the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455690027~“Great Value for Money”~We spent a couple of days including Australia Day in this hotel> The price was very affordable for a family room, and when you combine this with great location, easy walk to both trains and buses, it made this the perfect spot for us.  The street was not to busy as to make the room too noisy, and the room had a great view from the balcony. The hotel had its own restuarant, but there was plenty of other restuarants all within one block of the hotel offering a large selection of meal choices. I would definitely use this hotel again, and recommend it to anyone that wants a great value hotel close to the centre of Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_455105175~“Great location and lovely rooms”~Seriously great location for visits to southeast Queensland. While not in the heart of Brisbane CBD, the Jephson is conveniently located to the railway station direct to the centre of Brisbane and beyond. Around the hotel are a range of cafes, pubs (Regatta and Royal Exchange) and the Toowong Shopping centre is within minutes walking. The parking is free - and easy. While the reception is not open 24 hours they phoned us to say the rooms where ready early and we could check in anytime was a pleasant surprise. The rooms are neat, clean and modern.  I found the bed just fine after a big reunion at the Regatta :). None of our party of 9 had complaints about the bed. There is a restaurant on site.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_449754848~“Great location & rooms of high standard.”~The hotel is in a great location close to the city, public transport & restaurants. The rooms are spacious , very clean quiet & well equiped. However reception is very much part time & was closed at 7.00pm when we arrived (despite advertising that they close at 8.00pm. ) Checking in consisted of ringing a number( which resulted in a 5 minute wait ) & then you are given a code to an outside safe which contained our check in package & key. The restaurant & bar were also closed. The hotel is small & very much a boutique hotel & would result in a very pleasant stay if you arrived during reception open hours.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_446493311~“Very Pleasant”~We had a studio room which was well equipped, except we had to ask for a toaster, not included because of safety regulations. The bed was very comfortable. The staff were most helpful. We cancelled our last night's stay with 24 hours notice and were given a full refund. It is close to shops.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_444956081~“Ok”~We booked 2 rooms, and i guess the hotel is in a great spot, but both rooms the beds are terrible, in both rooms they where just unacceptable, the rooms are not cheap, but the furniture used is basic, would i stay again only if i had to, staff were very friendly and helpful, but the let down is the fur NJ iture and cheap beds.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_444362898~“Great Location”~This hotel is in a great location with shopping mall and restaurants near by, had lovely staff and the room was large, modern and clean and at a great price. If I am ever back in Brisbane I would defiantly book here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443205547~“Try's hard ”~I have eaten there a few times and have never been impressed, the offer is basic no real flair , been for breakfast and drinks .The hotel itself Is good if you want to be in Toowong which is five km out of town~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442476517~“My 'go-to' for short business stay”~Short walk to Toowong Shopping Centre, cafe's and the river for a pretty early morning jog. Easy check-in and parking. Staff friendly and helpful. Beds and pillows are comfortable. Rooms clean with adequate facilities.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_440406698~“Unremarkable ”~Two nights for business. Good sized room, balcony, ok bed. Good bathroom amenities but low grade toilet paper and rubbish bin needed replacing. Few features - no free onsite gym or pool. Reception almost never manned - had to do express check out and still nothing emailed to me? Good location and plenty of cafes close by. Cab rank outside and nice walks around area. Stay again? Yes but I would prefer a better featured hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_438892729~“Second time around just as good...”~The location of the Jephson is conveniently near shops. Parking is available in the basement carpark. Check-in/check-out was no hassle. This time around we were in a two bedroom apartment - very spacious with two bathrooms, large living area, roomy balcony and generous kitchenette. A minor hiccup with power supply was fixed very quickly with no fuss by the Reception crew. The restaurant - Covet - is the main reason I went back. Great food, great staff - just a pleasant all round experience! Well done once again.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_436495350~“Great place to stay”~I wanted a small but friendly hotel within walking distance of the Toowong Village shopping area and a friend's home just up the road. I was very impressed with the layout of the rooms and the overall standard. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone wanting a small and friendly hotel within walking distance of anything you need. It is also close to other large shopping malls. I particularly commend Beck and Hugo, staff members there who went out of their way to provide assistance to me. Thank you!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_432835034~“No reception staff”~This is not a full service hotel-I didn't see any staff at all during my stay. Reception was unattended when I arrived at 9 pm and when I left at 7:30 am the next day. I had not been advised of check in arrangements and had to be shown where to find my room key by the cook from the adjacent restaurant.  The room is ok, clean at least, but with uncomfortable pillows and a clunky wifi system that didn't work. The location is good- close to shopping centre and transport.  Ok for a no frills stay- communication with guests about check in procedure would have helped though.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429055909~“Fantastic!”~I stayed at the Jephson for two nights for business. I'd only booked one night and needed to stay again and staff couldn't have been more helpful. Rooms are modern and clean and have all facilities. Despite being on a major intersection I didn't experience any noise issues and I was in a room facing the street. I travel a lot for business so I need a home away from home and that's what I got. I have to return to Toowong a lot for business and will be prioritising the Jephson for booking. And, as a side note, thank to the Jephson for using Peter Morrisey products. I love them and they're rare to find!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429006747~“Handy and comfortable”~Clean and comfortable rooms with a selection of pillows available in the cupboard. Handy to UQ with large shopping centre within a short walking distance. Pub, restaurants and cafes all close by. Staff were friendly. Free parking.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_427163184~“Don't Bother ”~Have stayed here before. It's ok but just that ! Try and attend reception they are rude and not accomodating at all. And that's when it's attended. Otherwise just wait until they are ready to help you.  Never again!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404676145~“Sour from the start...”~The location, as you could walk to some great cafes and eateries and a massive shopping mall. Nice and clean and quite modern. The receptionist. We booked on Booking.com and on arrival the lady said that the booking cost had been attempted to be deducted off my card and due to funds being unavailable, they canceled my booking. She said is was a special rate and she couldn't honour that rate (tried to charge over $100 more). I told her, I hadn't received any correspendence in regards to funds being unavailable and she said "this is all in the terms and conditions" which I've read. And told me it's between myself and booking.com, I then asked her, do you want me to contact me?.. in which she said no. My booking was still active and secure on my booking.com app and as I said, no calls or emails from either booking.com or the motel were received in regard to this matter. Unfortunately she couldn't offer me the rate, as per my booking. Funnily she tried to call me approx 2 mins prior to our arrival, so my details were clearly available if any issues were to arise. I then told her I need a moment (either I was going to get too upset or I was going to figure this whole thing out)... What do you know! Jumped on booking.com and same rates I had, were available to book for the same 2 nights. I then approached her and said the same.. She then did a 360 and told me that should could "re activate" my booking as long as I supply the same card credit used for booking and that, this was the only issue all along. Again, I told her the credit card was valid, was available and had funds from the start of the conversation. Let's just say, I didn't bare give her another glance. I'm not sure what game she was playing at! Maybe my age and gender gives off the idea that i'd be glad to play and pay for such nonsense. I have booked multiple times with Booking.com and will continue to do so, as it's not a fault of theirs. Adding further, I am a real estate agent and have been for many years.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404222580~“Great venue for 5 day conference and accomodation for delegates.”~Use of upstairs meeting room was an excellent choice for 5 day conference. The venue was prepared and staff were so accomodating. Nothing was too much trouble. A dedicated staff member to support the event was there from morning to night. Catering was excellent and well timed. Food was always of high quality. Accomodation for delegates was comfortable and well supported. Very high attention to detail. Amenities always clean.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_401118242~“Noisy and over-priced”~I have stayed here on business for 4 nights. The room was small with no microwave but the worst thing was the extremely noisy location on the intersection of two of the busiest streets in Toowong. The hotel does no have any double glazing so the traffic noise is really loud and disturbing all night. The second night they moved me to the rear of the hotel which backs onto units. That night there was shouting and screaming from the units at 1:30am and still no relief from the traffic noise. The hotel is expensive by any standards and I was fortunate to find fully self-contained apartments close by for my next trip, which was cheaper than the hotel and quiet as it is a high rise that overlooks a park. The location is very convenient and the staff very pleasant, but not the place to stay if you need a good nights sleep!~3~nan~nan~1~3~nan~4~nan
review_400726951~“Great rooms and even better service”~I stayed in the top floor 3 bedroom suite for 4 nights for a conference together with a colleague. The three balconies had great views and they had three clean bedrooms and three clean toilets/showers. The WiFi was a a bit complicated to start with but once we were connected it was more than suffcient. The best thing is the service. I would like to especially thank Prue for all her help from the point of booking till after I departed. I left behind a coffee plunger upon departure and since it was a wedding present, it had special significance for me. Prue and her team arranged to get my coffee plunger sent by post all the way back to Singapore. I will definitely stay here again if I come back to Brisbane. The people at this place know what great service is all about.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399882575~“'Good but needs refinement'”~Great comfortable bed and nice bathroom, but needs a few things changed. I wanted to order room service after a day at work. You have to spend $30 to have room service and then they charge you $5 for a delivery fee. $35 for dinner without beverages. There is a lot of noise before 7am in the morning. Breakfast was ok, I ordered the omelette which arrived on toast and covered in balsamic dressing which was too strong for the omelette. The coffee was the best part of breakfast.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_399776396~“Excellent unit in inner surburbia”~Stayed overnight in 2 bedroom unit with adult daughters. Away from the usual CBD haunts but close enough to the action - large shopping centre close by with plenty of restaurants of varying style & price. 2 bathrooms so no fighting over time in the shower. Unit was spacious, modern and very clean and tidy. Good cooking facilities if you want to stay longer. Largest TV we have ever come across in a hotel. Comfortable bed & a good night's sleep. The only issue (seen in other comments) is that the hotel restaurant doesn't open on weekends. No big thing, as there are plenty of options around.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_398043501~“Excellent personalised service & Special thanks to the Chef!”~Stayed in the top floor suite for a week. It boasts a 180 degree view of city from the various balconies. The staff were extremely helpful for finding places in the city & directions. And were very accommodating to the other people in our party. A BIG thankyou to the Chef for creating a new special for me. The assorted ice cream, especially the fennel flavour was to die for and its creation was completely unexpected - Thankyou for going out of your way to surprise myself, and our entire group on our final night and for continually striving to ensure the food was allergen free. His food was delightful to sample & it was refreshing to eat something where the chef thought about the texture of every component, and or the experience of the meal & its 'show'. The Nutella Powder, Caramelised Banana & toasted coconut ice cream was my favourite as it was textually intriguing but tasted delicious. Rooms were kept clean & tidy and were quiet. Night staff were extremely helpful & were always more than willing to assist. The conference room & balcony was functional and well maintained. A contractor cleaned the car park while we were staying there & when i informed the hotel staff that the cleaning had caused back spray & dirtying of my car they organised for it to be cleaned free of charge prior to my departure. Would be more than willing to stay there again anytime in the future as all the staff went above & beyond!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_396489841~“Definitely a business hotel”~My brother booked a room for us, due to the proximity to his place. My father, his wife and I were all being joined for dinner in the city. The room accommodated 4 adults, with 2 singles and 1 double. There was probably no more space to allow 4 adults, than 2 adults. The bathroom was quite spare and basic, no bathtub. The shower was ok, towels were small. Morrissey toiletries. Rooms aren't particularly soundproof either, as evidenced by a ?bucks party staying up the hall. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on that. The price we paid was a special price on Booking.com and it was probably fair, I'd suggest the full rack rate would not prove to be value for money.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~nan~nan

review_352740089~“Better than average”~Good location for meeting around Toowong Village. Rooms were OK but the pillows need refreshing. Didn't go to the bar downstairs and didn't eat there. Went to Coffee Club right across the road. Asked advice at reception and then spent 15 minutes walking around trying to find what was not there. Asked again and said she wasn't from the area. Good one. Car parking underneath was OK. Overall above average but nothing to rave about.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~4~nan
review_339755953~“Very Happy.”~We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff, the building seems quite new so first impression was it was fresh, clean and modern. Our room was modern and clean with expected amenity of a hotel style room, small fridge, kettle and glasses and cups, coffee, tea, milk and mini bar, iron and ironing board. Generous wardrobe, pleasant bathroom with good shower. The rooms have balconies although no views to speak off. Our bed could have been more comfortable, we seemed to be rolling onto the middle. The location is great, very close to the railway station which connects to the airport train. The train station is part of the shopping complex which is also one minute walk away, There are lots of eateries, restaurants and bars to walk to. We had a decent breakfast in the hotel but did not try it for other meals. Car parking is easy and free. Service was good, our companion in another room managed to get the plug stuck in the sink and someone came promptly to fix it and she was also offered another room. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone looking for accommodation in the area.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
