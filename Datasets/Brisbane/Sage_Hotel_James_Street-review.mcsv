review_478087227~“Great Location. ”~We stayed here on a Saturday night, looking to spend the night in the city and valley. When we arrived we walked into the lobby. It was very clean, new and the staff were great. Parking is no hassle, we have a 4x4 and it was easy to park.  Our room was nice and fresh. The bed and pillows are awesome.  I would seriously recommend this place to anyone, especially if you have work or play at this end of town. We will be coming back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475451604~“Nice small hotel”~This hotel is in a great location. Close to the cinema, restaurants & bars. 10 min walk to the city or quicker by bus. I stayed in a standard queen room with city views at the front of the hotel. Traffic noise could be a problem for some but there are rooms away from the road. Check in was very easy. Pleasant staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_474386247~“Fresh and neat”~Stayed here on a cancelled flight booking - really really nice rooms and in a classy part of BrisVegas. Worth staying here again. Close to city and approx 20 minutes to airport, with nice bars and pretentious coffee shops nearby.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
