review_467178374~“Mould, dirty, noisy, lack of care, avoid!!”~As a frequent traveller to Brisbane (sydney based) I don't usually have the time to write reviews, when I do, I always review through booking.com - and they are always incredibly positive, so this is the first one I am writing with trip advisor as I was so appalled I needed to voice my opinion.  I was so uncomfortable in the unit that I had to check out and move into other apartments that are in the building but managed under a different management. I have been staying with the other building management company when I visit Brisbane and being in the same building I expected the same high quality of unit from Tribecca. The furnishings were old, marked, scratched, ripped and outdated, they were dirty and felt dirty. There was mould on the ceilings of the bathroom, I had constant hayfever and could not sleep at all. Dust and marks all over the walls. Dirty architraves, food and oil splatters all through the kitchen, dishwasher that doesn't work. Kettle is filled with mildew so I had to boil my water. Air conditioner doesn't work correctly, it blows warmish air on the lowest temperature setting. Toilet is all cracked all over, mould all through the bathroom and on the ensuite ceilings. It had an overall dirty and uncomfortable feeling - we barely slept, I just felt so uncomfortable. I found the staff at reception bossy and uncaring, the room felt similar to what I would expect a prison cell to feel like.  For a two bedroom apartment there was only one pillow in the spare room on one of the beds (two singles), no face washers, one shampoo in one bathroom then the other bathroom had a conditioner? exhaust fans didn't work, lamps were not plugged in or situated near a powerpoint. pillows were thin, old and crappy.  To add insult to injury they were attempting to unknowingly charge me for a baby cot and parking (I stay in hotels 2-3 weeks out of a month, I would have known if I had booked either of these extras) especially considering I cannot physically have children.  Please save yourself the disappointment and book with the other management onsite.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436017151~“Simple and bright”~Great location, close to shops and supermarkets. Even with the intercom, you will still have to go down, pick your guests up from the lift lobby. Just don't expect to get good night sleeps, the bed is of poor quality, so were the pillows. The blinds don't shut well, so be prepared for an early 4:30 am sunlight on your face. You can also hear traffic noise while staying on level 5 at all times. The bathroom was clean. They had strict no-party policies. They also had, "wash your dishes before you go" policy. I stacked the dishwasher on the last day and realised it was unplugged and the power point is not accessible. When I rang the reception, they just said to leave the dishes as it is, and they'll take care of it.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_422649601~“Comfortable inner city stay”~We had a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with plenty of space in the living room for the extra bed (5th person). Apartment was clean. Kitchen facilities were great - sufficient for any type of meal preparation. There were less than 5 chairs and fewer than 5 table settings in the crockery but we were able to improvise. I'm sure if we'd reported it to management they would have provided the extra but we managed without it. Car parking was relatively cheap and easy to organise.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_409040917~“Great location, clean and wonderful view”~I've seen mixed reviews for these apartments because they are all independently owned, so it depends on which unit you get. We stayed in 804. BRILLIANT PANORAMA views over Brisbane, including story bridge, gateway bridge, churches, etc. Spacious and modern with everything one needs for a self catering stay. The air con was a little dodgy and noisy and the tapware was very silly as it was hard to turn off correctly, but otherwise these are great value.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_399813599~“Spacious, On a Steep Hill, Comfortable Bed”~We spent a week in a 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment here. It was very convenient for three people--full kitchen, large dining area, balcony with table/chairs. However, these are mostly unserviced apartments (no daily maid service) and they charge extra for add'l towels, supplies. There is a 7-11 across the street if you want to get some breakfast items or sodas (or paper towels...can be used as placemats, napkins, tea towel, etc.). There is a washer and dryer in the 2 bedroom apartments and this was handy, though it takes a long time to dry clothes in the small dryer (there is a clothes drying rack on the balcony if the weather is nice and the birds aren't around). The condition of the apartment was acceptable--carpet stained and not entirely very clean. Basic eating and cook ware is provided as is toaster, microwave, 4 burner stove, full sized refrigerator, dishwasher disposal.  The location is nice BUT it is a steep walk down to the city (in any direction) and coming back up is taxing. Take it slow and it's not too bad (plus good exercise, of course!). It was very handy to be able to walk to Roma St. Station, Eagle St. Pier, Chinatown, Queen St. Mall, City Botanic Garden etc. Tons of restaurants in the downtown area. Nearby, the Mexican restaurant is just OK (wings, nachos; skip the margaritas and stick to beer). The Capers Pizza is OK and reasonably priced. There is a hotel with a fine dining restaurant right across the street--didn't try it, the menu was intriguing but pricy. There is an indoor pool, sauna, spa and small exercise room (treadmill, bicycle, rowing machine and one other something or other). Didn't try the pool out. The area is seeing lots of high rise construction which means the sound of cranes and construction elevators during the day (but fascinating to watch). In the morning, there are many pop up coffee places in the area. There is a Woolworth's grocery just down (steeply down) Boundary Rd...keep in mind you have to carry it all back up. Wifi is free but quite slow (best reception was in the laundry area).~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_385063410~“Well located but.......”~We booked a 1 night stay at the TriBeCa Apartments on a quick trip to Brisbane to go to the State of Origin. The apartments are very well located as mentioned by other reviewers and they are very spacious. We did have a couple of major concerns. Firstly the bed is rock hard, so much so that I ended up taking the cushions off the couch and sleeping on the floor. The second issue is that they are sparsely appointed. One of the reasons we choose a serviced and self contained apartment is that we like to cook our own meals when we are away. The lack of cooking utensils in this apartment made that difficult. Even though the apartments are so well located we will not be staying here again~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_375281243~“Woeful. Never again”~I stayed here for two nights. Check in was OK but the wifi did not work. Check in staff could not help and their external provider did not care, so no wifi. At 2:30am on the second night the manager came into my room and turned the lights on! Informing me that there was a leak that was coming from my room/ Turned out it was the room next door and the carpet was starting to soak. She threw towels down around the walls and left. She returned at 4:00am with a carpet cleaner guy and I was asked to vacate the room, which was now awash with water so he could suck up the water with a large machine. Everything was piled up on the couch and I waited outside on the balcony while this took place. Back to bed at 5:15. No mention of a refund or anything like that at all. Had to ask the question in the morning and received a $60 credit fir the inconvenience. Avoid at all costs~2~nan~nan~nan~2~3~1~nan
review_365864393~“reasonable”~i have only stayed at tribeca a few times and is ok . they are ok there but the place has no vibe. i will only stay there if i have to and would prefer to stay somewhere else in my price range. It is pretty handy to most things in the city overall it is reasonable~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_357981818~“Terrible”~Very disappointed. Looking at the photos of the place online it looked great. However what we got was not the same. We booked a 2 bedroom apartment. Apartment was extremely tired. Carpet needs replacing was very old and dirty and so was the furniture. The foyer to our room absolutely stunk like dogs. Will never stay here again!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356703722~“Fantastic! ”~We arrived in Brisbane after an 11 hour bus journey from Rockhampton so we were exhausted. Made our way to Tribeca Apartments and were too early for check in however, the lady at reception couldn't have been more accommodating. Our room wasn't available but she took our luggage, allowed us to have a shower and rang us when the room became available while we got some breakfast. She even took our luggage up to our room on the 6th floor until we got back! I would definitely recommend staying here. Very clean, great facilities (washing machine/dryer/dish washer) great location/foxtel!!! They also have a gym with pool/jacuzzi/sauna! Also very affordable. Would stay here again for sure!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_340124246~“Festive season stay”~Our room had a great view over the city. The pillows were terrible. You only get two towels for the entire week which includes the pool so the washing machine got a work out...probably more economical if they supplied an extra towel. The kettle was very dodgy. Very smelly vestibule on our floor. Pool was lovely but spa broke :-( and wasn't fixed. Great shower. Overall ok but not luxury... Furniture all a bit tired. Having to pay extra for parking was a bit disappointing too. Wifi was an extra charge too.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~3~nan
review_335360157~“Relax in comfort”~Beautiful two bedroom apartment with all the luxuries of home. Extremely quiet yet only minutes from the city. Spring Hill is a lovely area and has all the conveniences of shops and restaurants at your finger tips. Staff are very helpful, undercover security car parking takes the worry out of parking in a safe place. Cost of apartment was very reasonable and I would not hesitate in recommending Tribeca apartments to anyone. I will most definitely be staying there again. Thanks Tribeca staff for a wonderful stay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_332535132~“Good location, spacious rooms”~Stayed here for couple of days over the weekend. Checked in after office hours and the instructions were clear. No trouble getting into the room and not much wait. We stayed in a single bedroom apartment, had a decent kitchen with all basic amenities. A good balcony, comfortable couch , TV. The bedroom was good as well. Overall a very decent and clean place to stay. The hallway in the first floor smelled a lot. Probably the carpet was not cleaned for a long time. Apart from this there is nothing much to complain.  Will definitely recommend compared to other hotels in this price range, the rooms here are more spacious.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_323497612~“Alright for a quick stop”~I stayed twice at the apartments in a two week period in a 2 bedroom apartment. The first room I had was a large one looking towards the city and was quiet. There was a good sized kitchen and bedrooms. The second looked out to the road and was small and had damaged furniture and small bedrooms. At the same price it was disappointing. Staff were alright and tried to respond but lots of work is needed to get rooms up to standard. The postion of the hotel is fine with a short walk to shops and nearby food places.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_319935939~“Not to delight nor to disappoint”~Near the corner of Leichhardt St and Upper Edward St, these serviced apartments are centrally located within easy walking distance of the CBD and the Queen St mall. The office opening hours are within the usual business hours so it is best to check in within those times. There are two swipes to negotiate to gain access to firstly the car park and secondly to the rooms.  The accommodation is dated but clean, some rooms having views toward the city and others such as mine looking over the Upper Edward St intersection. Although I was there on a Friday night, traffic and general revelry noise from the pub opposite was minimal. There is a kitchenette, complete with microwave and an adequate but minimal supply of crockery, cutlery and cooking utensils. It is ok for a couple to self-sustain for a few days. I spoke with a man from the country who has been choosing the Tribeca for years for his annual Brisbane experience and who was full of praise for the apartments. I was there on business and found it convenient for the purpose but would not choose the Tribeca for a holiday or for a romantic assignation. In summary, a functional and utilitarian apartment for a purpose.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~3~nan
review_313257940~“Fantastic ”~We are planning to stay here again! We checked in late and all the information was there for us to collect. We stayed in room 403. The apartment was very bright, clean and spacious. The kitchen was great as it had all the utensils that we needed and more. The apartment looked more like a home than a stop in. The bathroom was good and had a hairdryer.  The best part about this accommodation is the spa and sauna. Me and my partner found it very relaxing and throughly enjoyed our time staying here. The staff are also very friendly.  The only things I would change are a) a reduction in the cost of onsite parking and b) free wifi  Other than that, it was fantastic!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_311846137~“Best apartment-hotel experience in our travels in Australia and Europe.”~Tribeca is an apartment-hotel so we were left mostly to ourselves after check in but accommodations were like a 4-star hotel. We had a spacious 2-bedroom suite on the 4th floor, with kitchen and a living room that open to a balcony overlooking the city. The building is on high ground north side of the city in a CBD (City Business District if I remember right).. Kitchen was well furnished except for the lack of garbage disposer. Washing machine and dryer also available. Several levels of underground parking with controlled access made parking convenient and secure. Wifi available at extra cost. For charging electronic devices, bring along adapters for the Australian electrical outlets with slanted slots. No food service in building but a small but highly rated restaurant across the street. Their food, featuring Australian produce, was great. Convenience and grocery stores were also close by. For us, it was an ideally quiet and convenient accommodation for a week of prowling around the city and surrounding areas visiting a daughter at UQ and relatives in the surrounding towns. It was the best apartment-hotel experience in our travels in Australia and Europe.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_310962302~“Some issues but overall very good”~A mixture of views but overall, pretty good. Firstly, if you use Trivago, beware that their map view is incorrect although Expedia and other companies have it's location correctly marked. Apartment is based at a junction on top of a fairly steep hill although it is only 10 - 15 mins from CBD. I worked out it was probably the height of a 9 storey building. If you are fit, there is no issue but if you struggle a bit, you will probably need taxis or local transport. Had some issue checking in as apartments only seem to have a manned desk between 9 and 4.30. Outside these hours, make sure you have a mobile phone to get check- in instructions. A few officious notices warning of fines e.g. Must fill dishwasher with all dishes and start cycle before check out. Another wee grumble was that pillows were far too soft and had to revert to cushions to get a good sleep. There are many positives. Apartment has full facilities for a long or short stay. it was very comfortable and my room had an excellent balcony and view over the city skyline. It has a gym and an outside pool which seemed decent. I was happy with my stay and would recommend this to travelers although I believe the apartments are more commonly used by locals and those who are working in Brisbane for short periods. Was possibly mis-led by Travel companies write-ups as I believed the immediate surrounding area was a 'hot spot' but it was a more residential area with a 7/11, a bottle shop, a pizza carry out , a small Mexican eaterie and a bar on the corner. A couple of other businesses had been there but have been closed for a while. Get yourself a skate board though and you could propel yourself to the CBD down the hill in just a few minutes.~4~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_305393860~“Not too bad”~Good sized apartment and reasonably well equipped. Clean, but would benefit from an update. Within(a reasonable) walking distance of some local attractions and shops. Not a bad location for a visit to Brisbane. Car parking available at extra cost.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_304556728~“Great location and friendly on the budget ”~We recently stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. Room was basic and reflected the price. Kitchen had most things needed to cook in the apartment. It was mostly clean, but could do with a thorough spring clean of the carpets and bathrooms. The pool and gym were fantastic and staff friendly and no fuss. I'd stay again, was worth the cheap price. If you're looking for a 4 star, plush experience I'd suggest staying elsewhere and paying more!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_300965243~“4 star's? Rubbish”~How can anyone trust the star rating system? Or should one ask how they arrive at the number of stars? I chose to stay based on the website presentation and the number of stars. Stepping out of the lift I was greeted with a stench only to find it was all through the apartment. Looking around the unit was filthy and the furniture appeared second hand. After complaining I was told the cleaners would service the unit again. The result is the place is still dirty, I'm glad I'm not paying the cleaners.  The only good thing that I can say is that the building is convenient to hospitals, supermarkets and the city. Definitely would not recommend it and suggest traveler's ignore the star rating guide.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_299358663~“One night stay before flying”~Arrived after reception hours, but found the after hours service good. The room we had was in a good location, very clean, spacious, handy to food outlets. The only thing we had difficulty with was finding out how to access the guest parking but we used the visitor parking - no problem with a one night stay.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_297111830~“Tribeca apartments ”~Very disappointed in the cleanliness of these apartments. We had to go and buy cleaning products. The bathrooms and toilets had not been cleaned. The pillows on the beds had old stained yellow protectors on them. The cutlery was dirty. We had to buy coffee cups as the ones in the apartment were stained and dirty. We wouldn't stay here again and are sorry we have booked for two nights.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_296862365~“Very powerful spa”~The rooms were pretty average as far as rental appartments go. On the first night I was woken at 4 am be somebody on the street using there horn in ther car then again at 5 by the trash compactor truck reversing.  We had to pay extra to put the car in the garage  The spa,sauna and pool were good especially the spa~3~4~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_292821401~“Good value 2 bedroom appartment”~Stayed four nights in a two bedroom apartment on the fifth floor. Staff were very helpful, allowing me to leave a suitcase in the office during the day before a late flight out. The location is good - pub, a mexican burrito, pizza shop and nice coffee place opposite; supermarket just down the hill a little way, and the Brisbane CBD not too long a walk (15-20 minutes probably). Apartment itself was clean, neat and tidy, and a good size. Kitchen was well equipped, nice views from windows and balcony. Only complaint really is the lack of free wifi in this day and age. The addition of this would be ideal. Nevertheless, good value for money all around.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_272610848~“Great location, average rooms”~Good: Location up in Spring hill was handy Security system for entry and exit seemed quite secure Good view of the city Nice to actually have a bed that was one piece as many hotels have 2beds joined together (where you often fall down into the gap) Bad: No aircon - were not able to get this to work the whole time we were there, the missing remote didnt help the cause Shower/Bath - water pressure was a little inconsistent and water would also come out of the tap on the bath at the same time. bit of maintenance needed No FREE Wifi To Improve: Bit of a clean up as its looking a little dated~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan~3~nan
review_272257496~“Why would you have vermiculite ceilings in this day & age?”~Check-in started with someone who had had a personality bypass. Received 2 keys and arrived at 502 and opened the door to a very minimalist apartment. Towels & floormat only (no hand towel or face washer). No soap provided. I realise this is an apartment, not a hotel but there is a minimum level of expectation. Lights in the apartment were clearly a builder's lot and did not suit the vermiculite ceilings which I have not seen since the 1970's apartments. TV was a minimum 32". Given the falling price of TV's I think they could have managed a 32". Lounge was a 2 seater. If it had been a 3-seater it could have provided the second bed which would have been greatly appreciated. 2 bulbs had blown in loungeroom lights. Bathroom was basic with shower over the bath. Do people use a bath these days? I certainly don't. A 2-person shower would be much more welcoming. Exhaust fan in the bathroom did not appear to be working. No ceiling fan in the bedroom so it was unbearably hot. The airconditioning could have been a split system, or relocated closer to the bedroom door to ensure cool air went in there instead of chilling the lounge occupants. All in all it just made the grade for the money which was paid. Location was good with an easy walk into the city.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_265575767~“Great balcony views”~Apartment itself was lovely, pretty modern and very well equipped. Was great having all the foxtel channels, had a great view of the city from the balcony. Good location supermarket close by (2 minute walk), my only issue was that we stayed bank holiday weekend so there was no staff on reception the whole time we were there and had a few problems with parking as we couldn't park in our apartment bay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_265352590~“Good Value Accommodation near CBD”~When you need a place to give you a functional home for a few days this has what is needed. Not flash plenty of space, self contained, clean, functional - good value! If you arrive outside the reception hours you will need to go through some simple hoops to get in - don't be put off by that. If a good place to sleep while your purpose is to be out and about, this certainly provides that.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_261809184~“CBD in my Neighbourhood”~Good: Very easy to reach CBD, closer to Central Station, 10 mins walk to Queen Street mall & St' Stefan Church, 3 mins walk to Woolworth shopping center, Budget Car rental, medical center. China town, history bridge is 10 mins walk. 7/11 store is at the door step. Bad: No free wifi and car parking~4~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_259510088~“Nice play to stay but no air-conditioning in the bedrooms”~Nice units but there was no air conditioning in the 2 bedrooms. It was so hot we ended up having to drag the mattresses into the lounge room as that is where the only conditioner in the unit is. The road noise was really bad so it would be my advice to get a unit higher up and try and get a room away from the main road. The units were very roomy although the ensuite bathroom is very pokey. The kitchen is well supplied with every utensil you could think you would need. It was very clean and well presented. The units were within walking distance to the city so it was very convenient. They do have some parking available if you have a car but expect to pay $30 pn for the privilege~3~nan~nan~2~4~nan~3~nan
review_257508949~“Good location.”~Location wise it's very close to the train station and walkable distances to the city centre, botanic gardens and local supermarkets. The apartment was nice with good facilites however there was no free wifi in the room but you can walk down to King George Square and get free wifi. The only bad thing about our room was the noise level from the police building located opposite our room due to heir metal carpark gate opening and closing throughout the night.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_239563640~“Beautiful views”~We stayed here in October in a 2 bedroom apartment on the top floor for 4 days. The views are amazing especially at night and the floor to ceiling windows in the lounge room with the decent sized balcony just add to these apartments. Fully self catered, they're clean, spacious and have everything you need. The staff are very friendly and the pool is good too, especially if you have younger ones. It is on the top of a hill so great for a little exercise on your holiday and if you dont mind that, then everything is very central. Supermarket 5 minutes away and about 5-10 minutes into the heart of Brisbane...the main shopping strip or even down to the River. I never knew Brisbane was so hilly. Foxtel was an added bonus. Great place to stay!!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_237907670~“Our Stay In Brisbane CBD”~The apartment was very good, clean and well appointed inclusions, large fridge, dishwasher, Television and Air Con.The bed was not very comfortable, very firm, causing back ache, I think that this mattress was very old. There was plenty of car parking and it was free, which is rare in Brisbane. I didn't realise that it was a distance from the main shopping of Brisbane and as I have a problem with one of my legs it made it more difficult getting around, but overall the apartment was very good.~4~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
