review_475947323~“Miserly”~I get that this is budget accommodation, and we needed somewhere close to the airport for obvious reasons. But we booked and payed extra for four of us in the room and a tiny box of 200 mls of milk supplied. My husband politely asked for one more milk, so we could just have a coffee each, but the reply was no, only one milk per room allowed. In response I wanted to use all of the tissues, all the toilet paper as well as the spare roll, all the soaps and shampoos, the sanitary bag, all of the sachets of coffee tea and sugar. We didn't do so, but should have as it would have been worth more than your silly little box of milk you can't spare for four people. . Seriously, is there really the need to be so pathetically tight? I won't stay there again. I have stayed in 5 star AND budget.. Im no snob... its little acts of kindness that can make all the difference.. and the meanness that just leaves a bad taste in ones mouth.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473264515~“BadLuck Bad Timing”~Stayed for 1 night before flying out to NZ. Reception lady was absolutley wonderful, caring and very helpful. As i had booked this night already i needed to book another night for when we were returning to Australia. After my week away, the morning of the night that we were needing to stay at the Airport Motel i had to cancel ( there is a 24hour cancellation period), cancelled becasue we were stranded in NZ due to Severe weather- Flooding and Landslides making out journey to the International Airport unable. I explained my situation and the helpful lady understood and noted the troubles, she did mention that i reimbursment would be 'on the cards' as unfortunate weather was out of our control. Have today Phoned the Motel and the lady on the phone - was rude and after me trying to explain myself over and over and aksed if there was a chance of reimbursment or part off, she was just adamant to this rule, i did mention that if i had predicted the future i would have cancelled within 24hrs beforehand but she didnt want to understand that. If she was the Manager- i only wished the lady that i meet in person was.~2~1~nan~nan~1~nan~4~nan
review_471747246~“Overnight stay”~We did stay in a spa room with an overnight stay to catch an early flight out of Wellington airport. For the price we paid it was a exceptional small room and to be honest it felt like we were staying in a wardrobe and in parts of the room we couldn't walk past each other without having to give way like a single lane street. There seemed to be more room in the spa and bathroom area. This is why I will rate as poor, the only reason I do not rate as terrible is due to the great service given by the young lady at reception who obviously takes pride in her employment.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468261863~“Good motel bad location”~I stayed here just before flying out to Singapore the next morning on a early morning. the motel was comfortable and clean and a great host who had a intermediate knowledge of the area. their were a few disappointing factors one was the fact the motel was close to a railway crossing and it was very hard to park a car in this motel and there wasn't much sound proofing for the room. the close access to Brisbane airport and also the closeness to the main shopping prenict makes it a great motel to stay in.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_465448703~“Good location & Affordable”~We stayed here briefly overnight before travelling to the airport. Friendly check-in, comfortable room and good amenities including free Wi-Fi and Foxtel. We were on the second floor and considering it's location on a main road, was quiet. The only downside is on-site parking. We had a 4wd and found it difficult.  Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_464265261~“A GOOD FIND CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT”~Being the last night of my Brisbane family visit, I wanted a budget hotel close to the airport. Scrolled through quite a few, and the response from this motel was excellent for questions regarding availability and type of rooms. I appreciated that. Everything was exactly as described. The room was spacious, clean, quiet and had two very comfortable beds for my daughter and me. The bathroom was wel equiped and nicely presented. They willingly helped getting the bags up the stairs, which is the only disadvantage if you prefer to carry your own. All in all a lovely overnight stay with a reasonable shuttle to the airport if required. Thank you to the very friendly and helpful desk staff.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_454621307~“Overpriced for what you get”~First of all, the reception ladies are lovely! very, very helpful :)  The room we had really needed an airing out, very musty and dank. the tiny bathroom had no ventilation and mould on the ceiling. They do offer washing and drying for reasonable pricing. Elevator for ease and short walk to dining options.  We probably wouldn't stay again though as the price was over the top for the quality.~3~2~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan

review_448187049~“Don't do it”~We booked online. When we got there we had to pay extra for a microwave. The air conditioner didn't work and it took 1.5 hours of negotiating with the owners to get a new room. They expected us to pay more for a room with a working air con.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443615890~“Alright for a one night but aircon might need a clean”~The reception staff was quick and service minded and made sure that our motor home had parking spot outside the undercover parking. The room itself was clean and spotless however there was no air ventilation in the bathroom which might be the reason that the bathroom had a bit of a weird smell. When we turned on the aircondition it started smelling badly like a sewer in the room. Instead we had to sleep with the window open and got the road noise. A bit overpriced for what you get, but my guess is that any motel close to airports will be...~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441660654~“Good at what it is”~The reality is that this is a cost effective option close to the airport. The place is old with basic fittings but does it well. Good TV options and air conditioning. Excellent shower with good pressure~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441461708~“Comfort and Convenient”~A great sleep over before catching your flight. The Motel is clean and the staff and lovely. There is a pool and it is a short walk to Hamilton for a selection of eateries and a stroll along the Brisbane River.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_437311432~“Close to Airpot”~Stayed for one night waiting for flight next day. A shuttle service is offered to both domestic and international airports. A small clean motel room, comfy beds and I was surprised how quiet it was considering the busy road it is on.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_436501962~“Great location for early morning flight ”~Stayed here for 1 night prior to early flight. Had dropped rental car off so we were restricted to heading out on foot for dinner. Just a few mins walk from ear street markets and restaurants.  Room very basic and small however Fine for 1 night. Beds were very comfy. Despite being right on a major road the room was pretty quiet. The cleaning in bathroom was a bit rough, with mould on ceiling.  There is a lift, however it's so slow we actually got bags up the stairs, walked back down before it arrived.  Paid for the hotel provided airport shuttle - driver not very friendly or helpful. Handy location, and one of cheaper motels close to airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434056691~“A great overnighter”~An evening air arrival to pick up Juicy camper just a walk down the road first thing in am worked out great. Perfect location to walk to river cafes in evening and a great sleep on a soft bed. Clean. TV. Shower and coffees with a small milk provided. A nice stay. As noted, no lift but no prob to us up one level. Nice people.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429044039~“Very welcoming”~We just recently stayed for one night before our Red Eye flight to Bali. Could not fault them in their customer service. Both ladies at reception were extremely lovely and helpful. They booked our taxi for 3:30am pickup. Told us to pop around to Eat Street Markets for tea. We left our car there for 6 days which cost us a small price of $49. The rooms were comfortable and well priced.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426842058~“Extremely helpful staff”~I was super impressed with the staff as before I came I had lots of issues and questions and they were great at getting back to me. When I arrived every electronic communication I ever had with them was stapled to the back of the reservation with a note on top to remind them to remind me that I needed to book return transportation. The bed was clean and comfortable. Everything was relatively clean, but not spic and span either. However the important things like the bed and shower were impeccable. Staff extremely helpful.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_412400137~“Very comfortable”~If you're looking for somewhere to spend a night before or after a flight, you will be satisfied with your stay here. The staff were very helpful, and the room was clean and well appointed. A short walk took us to Portside where we had our choice of a variety of cafes and restaurants for dinner. We took the 'early light breakfast' option which was delivered to our room the evening before we flew out. A very relaxed and pleasant experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_411640451~“Great Motel 9 minutes from airport”~I was very impressed by the quick responses to all of my inquiries (and there were a lot). I landed at the international terminal after hours and they were great with explaining to me how to get into my room. They also arranged pick up and drop off services which made everything that much easier - $15 each way. And because they knew I was travelling internationally and I'd have heavy luggage with me, they moved me to a room on the ground floor (there are no elevators). This motel was perfect for my brief stay and the owners were wonderful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_411264955~“Not great, not terrible.”~I stayed here for two nights in a twin room earlier in the month prior to a cruise. Staff were informative and helpful when it came to directions. Easy walking distance to food/shopping/groceries at Portside Wharf, Eat Street Markets and City Cat ferry from Bretts Wharf to the CBD. Rooms are dated but functional, could do with a deep clean in the bathroom. Free shuttle to cruise terminal available around 9am. TV turned on at 3.30am both nights we stayed? We didn’t realize it must be set up like this until it happened the second time on our last night. Alarm clock screen broken, no point in having it in there. Beware of the sharp metal edge on the ridge up to the bathroom as it cut my companions toe quite severely to the point of limiting mobility, it put a bit a damper on the next week worth of holiday. Bring your own hairdryer if your hair is long/thick, the one supplied is not fantastic.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_410885096~“Great Motel-Close to Airport”~This is the third time we have stayed here and the motel in always clean and staff welcoming.

review_400602538~“I love this family business motel!　I will definitely come back again!”~I was here for an unforgettable and enjoyable family holiday stay! The host and hostess are impressively hospitable and professional. The motel is beautifully and conveniently located near airport, which is also minutes drive from shopping and restaurants, more attractively it's very close to a world-class luxurious cruiser wharf.  We had a very pleasant experience with all in the motel, clean and spacious settings, helpful and well-maintained facilities, friendly and warm-hearted staff. All is excellent! Thank you! We will be back!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_395856842~“Budget motel good for the price we paid”~We tried to get their shuttle to pick us up, we were told by the reception thawed should take a taxi because that was the same price as the shuttle. Not true, taxi was more. Our room was on the third floor. Ok here I am walking with a cane both my wife and I are over sixty five and they made us walk up the stairs. The next morning we noticed a lift to other rooms. We asked about it and were told we should have requested the rooms with the lift. There is nothing in the lobby nor in their advertising about a lift. You would think the receptionist would have noticed our age and the cane. The room we had was clean and quiet. The motel does not have a restaurant so we ate next door at a different hotel.~3~4~3~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_395308838~“Reasonably priced Motel close to Port Side.”~The service was great,and we were able to leave our car under cover for the7 nights of our cruise for a nominal change. We would definately stay stay again.The room that we were in was on the first floor and no elevator. So this could pose a problem for some.There was a free shuttle for us and our luggage to Portside,saved us a lot of hassles. A big thank you to Trevor and his family .~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_388587861~“Smell was unbearable!”~The man checking our group in was very rude and ubrupt. A lady came in saying her toilet wont stop running and he shooed her away with his arms as he was busy with us.....As soon as u opened the door to the room it smelt disgusting! The bathroom had other guests hair on the vanity.... the shower had mould in it and the tap fittings were coming loose. The towels had stains and were worn on the edges.... The heater was broken and we froze as had to leave window open to air the room out! Very very disappointed. Basic is fine but to have to stay in a room that stunk was just unbearable....~1~nan~3~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_383283361~“Sure there is better”~The room was very dated and small for a family room, and for the price we paid I actually expected better. Thankfully we weren't there for long, we hardly slept. The room was freezing. Seemed clean enough, but didn't really want to look either. Not a great first impression. Free internet but was only willing to give us two passwords for four people. I'm sure there is better for the same price.~2~2~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_379681761~“Convenient location”~Handy for airport parking, clean comfortable room. A little bit on the small side, but adequate for the purpose. Toaster, fridge and kettle provided, reception friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_378112160~“Just passable ”~Stayed overnight before onward travel  Friendly helpful receptionist was a great positive but not much going beyond that  The room is really dated but clean enough The location is good but on a road full of accommodation you could do better  The main negative was the noise and the managements response  I noted early in the afternoon that the noise was picking up to unbearable levels but was informed by the female manager that I could not change rooms but NEXT time I stayed I could ask for a room at the back  The motel was not full so no reason not to be able to be accommodated away from the road  Definitely won't be a next time as there are better options~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_374413362~“Average accommodation”~I have stayed here twice, 1st time 2014, room was clean. Second stay not so good, black mould in bathroom on bath tub and around taps. Tiles were dirty as was the glass shower door. Just needed Exit mould to get rid of the mould. Apart from that was ok but going to try a another motel next time hopefully with no mould.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_359657756~“Worst Hotel I have Ever Stayed In”~What can I say, the hotel literally stinks, our stay has been worst experience ever.  Our room had one towel for four people, they wouldn't believe this (trust me it's true, I would never steal one of the cardboard-like towels) and accused us of stealing the towels. The manager was a bully and came into our room to search for the towels (we were all in our pjs - it was 9pm). It was very strange. We have previously stayed around the corner at another cheap motel (we often need to overnight near the airport) and room may have been similar, but they are always clean and the manager there is fantastic. This has been a totally different experience. I also cut my foot on the sharp edge of bathroom tile and the manager went psycho at me (when he came in uninvited) as i'd put a blanket there to stop my kids from cutting their foot. We will never be back. I would give this hotel less than zero.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358326270~“Last stay for me here, expect more for the price”~Postives- good location walking distance to portside wharf and $12uber from airport.  It's a crash pad for the night before a flight or a cruise, not high expectations. They also have a shuttle and free metered wifi. Negatives-The rooms are dated and worn, and for $130 seems like a lot for this dive. This time though there were about 8 mosquitos in the room. Killed them all. But they keep showing up flying up the drain in the bathroom who knows. We slept door shut but 5am there are another 8 mosquitos in the room buzzing your head. Also a massive hornets nest outside the window. Our friends next door didn't have a mosquito issue but they expected a bit more for the price too. Next time I'm staying down the street next door for few extra dollars.~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_353041410~“A motel close to the airport where you can leave your vehicle”~The Airport Motel is very close to the International Airport and so convenient to be able to leave your vehicle while you are overseas. With a very rainy night on one of the nights we stayed it was very helpful to be able to order room service including alcohol. It is a bonus that the staff are very helpful. We had access to the internet on one of the two nights.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_351517016~“Clean and tidy”~Stayed in a family room for one night. Check in was quick and easy and we stayed in room 1 at front of motel. Road noise wasn't an issue for us at all. Beds were comfy and shower was good. Easy 5 minute walk to Eat St and Portside if your going on a cruise and they do have a onsite shuttle bus Would stay again~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_344645528~“Great airport stopover”~We stayed here overnight before and after international flights. This place is just a good basic motel. All you need as a stopover motel. Checkin was quick. The family room was great with a queen and two singles. They provide a cot for $10 if needed. Only a 5 minute walk to Portside or Eat Street where there is lots of eating options. Overall a great place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339775171~“good overnight stay”~The Airport Motel is perfect when needing somewhere close to the airport for an early/late arrival/departure. It is basic but clean and comfortable. Not far from places to eat or our car hire company. If you are looking for 5 star then go elsewhere and pay for it.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_339518624~“Very good!”~Stayed here over night recently, we were due to go on a cruise the following day. They have a free Shuttle bus at 9:00 or 9:30am that takes you down to the port but we opted to walk as not only a 10mins walk, because it was so close to Portside we checked out a little later due to flying in late the previous night. The room was clean & tidy, beds comfortable, free Wi-Fi which was a bonus as I needed to check e-Mails etc. Our room was on the second level, everything worked fine, bathroom clean & the staff were friendly, easy check-in check-out process, no hassles. Very close to the Airport but the Taxi was $28.00, if they provide a low-cost Shuttle service to the Airport, that would get more people in I think...~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_335352024~“There are better places......”~Negatives: Old motel, small rooms, don't do wake up calls, welcome folder in the room was sticky, stained pages stuck together. We thought that for the money we paid ($135) it should be a better quality.  Positives: A few restaurants within a 600 meter walk. Cheap shuttle for 2 ($15) to the airport~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_330870446~“Excellent location”~Clean but very dated. Hairdryer sparked and vanity was cracked. Walking distance to Eat Street and port made dinner very easy. It's also right around the corner from Brisbane Airport Parking which was great. Friendly counter staff and easy check in..~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_326825555~“Helpful staff and good location”~It is located close to the airport but the taxi was still $30. Not sure if this is because taxis are really expensive in Brisbane. The best thing about it was that we could leave our car there at very low cost while we were away for the week.  It is a older style building and quite dated but the room was very clean and had everything that we needed. The staff were very helpful when we required information. Overall it was quite a good stay.~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_325553858~“rip off”~I didn’t actually stay there. Why? I made a booking but did not receive confirmation. I rang to ask for it but still didn’t get it. I rang again the following day and was told that there was no reservation for me. I booked elsewhere. The next day (it was a last minute booking) I received notice that my Credit Card had been charged for the full amount. I contacted them yet again (their website didn’t work either) and got a reasonably nice reply by the receptionist, but refusing to refund me. I asked for confirmation of this by the manager – who could not be bothered to contact me direct, but all but referred to me as a liar to her receptionist. Don’t stay there if you can help it.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_315711650~“Functional and close to the airport for stopover. Shuttle service available”~Recently had an overnight stay at the airport motel. The place has some good strengths and does have some improvements. We had asked for a family room away from the street which we got. It was great - no noise evident from the busy Kingsford-smith drive.  Room had Mosquitos....and a tin of spray. We dealt with them pretty quick. Proximity to airport was great and the shuttle service (extra charge) was far cheaper and reliable than waiting for a taxi. We didn't try the room service instead taking the short walk to Portside and the eat street markets there which was great. Portside have lots of food options and at such a short walk it is a good option. There is a cinema there also if you are looking to kill some time. Pay TV available in the room to keep kids entertained and the room itself was functional for the needs we had. May have been high on price for basic facilities, but location saves a lot on taxi cost and time travelled if you have an overnight airport stopover. Would consider staying again.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_313435467~“clean room, food and airport shuttle”~nice clean convenient motel close to the airport. Nice staff, helpful, which is good as they dont have a lift and you have to haul your bags up one or two flights of stairs if nobody is on hand to help. Reasonably priced and comfy bed, good shower. They have room service but I would advise you to avoid the pasta. Better off ordering a take away pizza. Loved their airport shuttle service, you pay the same as the commercial shuttle bus services but they have their own bus and driver to take you to the airport, no standing on windy street corners waiting for the bus!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_312534467~“Good for airport only”~Its proximity to the airport is the only reason we went here. We left early preferring to hang out at the airport rather then stay.

review_311455924~“Basic Accommodation”~Very basic accommodation, overpriced for what is on offer. We had a "family room", being the only one available. Very small room, double bed snd one single bed, one plastic stool, one drinking glass. At a cost of $139 for the night I would not recommend. The only strength of thishotel is the proximity to the airport which was our reason for stzying as we hadan early morning flight.~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan~3~nan
review_306150126~“Nice and Clean”~The hotel is clean and comfortable ideal for an overnight stay. If you struggle with stairs ask for one of the limited rooms serviced by a lift.
