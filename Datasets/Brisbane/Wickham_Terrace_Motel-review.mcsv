review_456283740~“Brisbane's best kept secret”~Ignore the only other review. This hotel has been completely refurbished and is now an iconic boutique hotel, like no other in Brisbane. The rooms are very tastefully decorated, as are the public rooms. There is a superb restaurant where we had dinner on the two nights we stayed, including a superb tasting menu.  First class. I would stay here next time in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_149928613~“GOOD LOCATION”~Fab location if your going for a night out in the valley , rooms are out dated ! But for 99 $ what do you expect its budget acc in a great position , if its a quick trip and your out and about then this place is a great place to crash .~3~3~5~nan~3~3~3~nan
