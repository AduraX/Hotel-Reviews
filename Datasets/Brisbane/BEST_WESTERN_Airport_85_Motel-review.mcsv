review_477810998~“Excellent motel near Brisbane airport ”~What a find. Clean, quiet, easy to find & continental breakfast included. You won't go hungry. Beds are very comfortable, we had a king in a ground floor room. The managers are very accommodating & will assist in any way. Taxis are easy to book & about a 15 min journey to the airport or take the shuttle bus. If you want to go to the city you catch a train from nearby.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473724651~“Good Location close to Trains and Portside Cruise Terminal”~We were joining a cruise from Portside and selected this motel as it was well rated and close to the Cruise Terminal. We were allocated a upstairs room which required carrying out luggage up the stairs. Lucky for me a staff member came to my assistance.  Parking for cars is not allocated and is on a first come first served basis. The room was very quite, spacious and had a king size bed. All this made for a great nights sleep. Breakfast is included and consists the normal Continental style breakfast selections. Just right to send us on our way for the day. I would definitely stay here again.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467999870~“2 Night stay with friends”~Located about 10 minutes from the airport, and in a quite side road. Rooms were clean with modern furniture. Breakfast available, but no evening meal. Railway station oppersite, and good restaurant 5 minutes away. Harbour/shope etc 15 minutes walk away.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467094207~“A quiet clean place close to the airport”~I booked a room for 3 adults to stay for a night to catch a connecting international flight. I was impressed by the room's cleanliness and found the bed cormfortable. The location was very quiet and Doomben railway station across the road. Restuarants weren't too far away but required a decent walk of 20 minutes plus. There were no beers in the mini fridge which would have been nice. Bathroom was clean and modern enough. Missed out on the breakfast because it only opened 7 a.m. on a Saturday which wasn't relayed to me so that was a shame. In all a happy customer for the price.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_466445218~“Exceptional Service”~Well where do u start I travel often,   From the booking to the arrival at the motel . The greeting by the owners was very welcoming. So friendly genuine service treated like a real person instead of a number.  Room was very clean and very quiet . So close to the airport and the area is very close to many restaurants and bars shopping etc Well maintained property will be back again  Thank our  David you were very kind to us~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464612191~“Very Disappointed”~If you arrive at this place after 8:00 in the evening the reception is closed. You have to pick up a phone and talk with someone who wants your credit card first to secure the room which is a little uncomfortable not knowing who you are talking with! The room had a very strong cleaner smell that gave me a headache. The air-conditioner also had a smell so we had to turn it off even though it was hot outside. The room was very dated but one thing in its favor is the sheets were nice and clean. The next morning the receptionist was friendly but we left early and didn't even stay for breakfast. We paid way more than we should have for the quality of the room~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~2~nan
review_461890950~“Nice affordable place to stay”~Easy to get to with very friendly management. Clean room and facilities, and breakfast is provided which is also convenient . Close to the airport and a quiet location i found it to be. well worth staying at for an affordable price.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461373003~“Okay turns into dissapointed”~Week 1 ok, Week 2 OMG Air-conditioners rather old and not very good. Owner was great but his male staffer berated the customer publicly for asking the previous week to get batteries for TV & aircon and called the customer a winger. Staff probably need customer training.~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_459528875~“Ok but not great..”~We recently had an overnight stay at Best Western 85 to be able to get to the airport for an early flight, when arriving at the accommodation receptionist was helpful & pleasant but once we got to the room that's where it started to go downhill. Once we opened the door we were greated with an extremely strong cleaner smell, it was so bad that both myself and family had severely irritated sinuses for the remainder of the stay, I did also read this in someone else's review of one of the rooms and in the response from the hotel they said it was a ladies fragrance from the car park that had entered the room, in our case this would be impossible as the room was located at the back of the building with no one around for the scent to enter the room. One of the beds had a piece of hair in it which didn't belong to us. Other than that the room was sufficient for a one night stay.  The parking is free and is also a good location for the airport. I just feel that for the price paid it didn't really meet expectation.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458380028~“Quick stay”~We just stayed overnight after a flight from Perth. Rooms small but adequate,bed comfortable,linen spotless,as was the bathroom. Good for what we wanted,as it's close to the airport, and lots of choice of eateries within close driving distance.~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~3~nan
review_458257700~“Very nice and friendly staff ”~Large and comfortable rooms with a small kitchenette! Train station right outside the front! You did have to change trains to get to the airport but I think you'd get straight down town without changing! Not the healthiest breakfast selection maybe, but still! I'd rather get something than nothing. Highly recommended anyway!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455344318~“Good value, Great customer service”~We had an overnight in Brisbane on our way to New Zealand for vacation. We got out of the BNE airport after 10 pm and 36 hours of flying. We were exhausted and Brisbane was warm and humid even at that time of night. We knew that Uber operated in Brisbane so we took one to the hotel which we had booked through Agoda. The motel was closed when we arrived and the entrance area was dimly lit. The Uber driver was very nice and waited for us to sort out what we were doing. My wife walked around the entrance and found an after-hours box, instructions and a call-box to contact the after-hours service. I finally reached an attendant who took my credit card number and walked us through retrieving the key from the box. I thanked the Uber driver and he departed. We got to our ground floor room, cranked on the AC and immediately started feeling better. The room was good sized, clean. It took a little while to figure out how to control the instant hot water supply for the shower but it worked well. After a decent night's sleep, we went to the motel's "breakfast" room for our complimentary breakfast. The breakfast bar staffer turned out to be the hotel manager. He was very gregarious and gave us a lot of good information. His wife ran the reception desk and was equally nice, friendly and informative.  Our plane didn't leave until 5 pm so we had time to see the city and eat lunch. Another passenger on our flight to Brisbane had suggested that we use the City Cat boats on the river to see Brisbane. The motel was only a kilometer from the river where we could pick up the Cat. We left our bags at the motel and took an Uber to the dock to avoid walking in the heat. We got to the Cat (which did not take charge cards), had our river ride, grabbed lunch and went back to the hotel to pick up our bags. We had another friendly exchange with the manager's wife and left for the airport.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_455141945~“Great value for money”~Location was excellent and within walking distance to Portside wharf where there are a number of fantastic eateries. Also a great location if you're heading to Moreton Island, 10 minute drive to the ferry wharf. The hosts were friendly and the room was clean. Continental breakfast, free parking and free wifi were included which was an added bonus.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454529896~“Great customer service”~We stayed over night. The room was clean and modern and the beds were really comfy. It was great being able to park right outside our room before an early flight. Management were great and excellent at returning emails, answering questions. Didn't get to try the breakfast (left too early) but dining area looked great.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451962447~“Very comfortable motel close to airport”~My daughter and I stayed overnight at this motel on our way home from Brisbane to Melbourne. We arrived around 8.30pm and while reception was closed we were given clear instructions on how to access our room. The motel is an older style and our room had been nicely modernised with fresh clean sheets, tea and coffee facilities and a small offering of food such as noodles and a very nice continental breakfast included in cost. The only negative if this property was that there was nowhere within close walking distance for dinner when arriving late in the evening. We resorted to delivered pizza.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_449444710~“Convenient, calm, practical, a Thrifty next door”~Very typical Aussie motel. Suited all our needs for one night before driving to Noosa. Not that far from the airport, cab fee about 25aussie dollar?(IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY). Clean, comfy, late semi-auto check-in a breeze. There is a Thrifty next door! So don't pre-rent a car online from the airport Thrifty and have to take a cab back there to pick up the car in the morning!~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_448664658~“Convenient and affordable”~The motel was for my parents to stay in after they arrived home on a long flight late at night. Given the hour of arrival the management were very helpful and i was told the bed was comfortable and the breakfast simple but delicious.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444737615~“Friendly people!”~We stayed just one night in transition. Booked Shuttle company "Conxion" online for round trip from airport because it is door to door service and cheaper. The train station Boomben st. is very near but it seems to be not really frequent service. We stayed "Economy Room" that was little over $100, small but enough for just over night stay. It was clean and bed was comfortable. There is a horse race facility across the street with restaurant. We were early so walk to Hamilton Wharf, about 15 min. to have dinner.  Breakfast was basic but good enough for us. Nice friendly staff to help you anyway they can!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_442282838~“Overnight stopover”~Stopped overnight before travelling on next day. Arrived late but access had been taken care of when the manager kindly left keys in safe along with room details. The room was spacious enough for what was required although the bathroom was small and the shower cubicle narrow with very slippery tiled floors. The room was quiet with a quiet AC. Microwave and toaster as well as 3 sets of plates and cutlery. There was a mini-bar but no alcohol. Room was well lit and had a good size/height work desk with light and chair. Free Wi-Fi was supposedly on offer, but try as I may, could not connect to the given address, King size bed was very comfortable and room included FTA TV and cable and a safe for valuables. A continental breakfast was included in the room price. Restaurants close by, a credit card surcharge is payable and no pets are allowed.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_439610850~“Sympathetic and helpful - oasis after the cruise!”~We arrived way too early after embarking a cruise, and were met by sympathetic Dave and Denise. We were given a cup of tea and a seat outside in the shade, while our room was made available! We were lucky to get the triple bedded room, but felt that perhaps two beds would have been more comfortable within the space. The room itself as very clean and tidy, and the beds comfy! The breakfast that was included for the first 2 people per booking was adequate with fruit, yoghurt, cereal, juice, toast and tea and coffee.  We made full use of the lovely pool as well, and have to say that all staff we met were wonderful, cheerful and helpful. Would stay here again - so handy for cruise ships arriving/departing Brisbane!  We paid $15 for a 10 min. taxi from the wharf and pre-booked a 15min. shuttle to the airport the next morning. All went smoothly..~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_438568973~“Great Pace to Stay”~Really enjoyed our stay. The room was comfortable, and obviously recently remodeled.

Also available are grocery store, pharmacy/drug store and other services. The breakfast was adequate. The grounds are well appointed and maintained.

review_431142965~“Quiet retreat only minutes from the Brisbane Airport”~We stayed here prior to meeting family flying in from overseas. The location was perfect for this purpose and was extremely well fitted out for a short stay and the room was spotless & extremely comfortable. The location was quiet & peaceful despite being only 2 blocks from Nudgee Rd. Its location is within easy walking distance to both Eagle Farm & Doomben racecourses as well as the Racecourse Rd café precinct. There was the added benefit of being directly opposite the Doomben railway station which gave us ready access to the city. The included continental breakfast was well provided and available in the garden setting at the front.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_429348317~“Tricked by the name....”~This is a very small drive in motel. Certainly tricked by the Best Western sign. However small and basic, the staff were wonderful and made up for the let down. The rooms are sparse but clean. Location is close to airport but too far from city center. Overnighting for an early morning flight is the only reason to stay here.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_426871878~“Very nice motel”~We stayed at this motel due to its location near the airport for 2 one night stays. Its location was great with lots of amenities and shops close at hand. One huge bonus for the motel is the railway station across the road. Travel into central Brisbane would have been so easy if we were staying longer.  The managers of this motel are totally lovely and extremely helpful. The included breakfast was basic but extremely nice and well presented. The room was perfect in every way. Clean, comfortable and well appointed. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_424274162~“Typical Best Western ”~Stayed here due to proximity to the airport before an early flight. The facility is somewhat dated but the rooms are adequate for a one night stay. It was about $ 23 to cab to the airport in the morning. Getting to the hotel from the airport via trains took about an hour due to having to change lines at eagle station and it would have been Cheeper to cab than for 2 of us to train. (Wish we had known).  Not a lot around the hotel for meals and activities unless your into horse racing.  Prices downtown are less without the ne d tochange limes on the train n if taking transit.  So if staying for a night and need an adequate spot a short cab rid away this would work well. If staying longer would recommend the Meriton Herschel street 2 blocks from Roma station with all the amenities and sometimes a lower price.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423751909~“Convenient, friendly, clean”~We wanted a nights rest after arriving at Brisbane airport at 10.30pm and found Airport 85 was perfect for our needs. It was almost midnight when we arrived, and it was easy to check in: there was a room key in a safety deposit box for us. Our room was clean and quiet (no traffic or airport noise). Breakfast was served from 7am and the staff were really helpful in giving us tips on tourist attractions, advice and maps for driving around, and even where to get cheap parking in Brisbane CBD.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_421344410~“Basic but perfect for a stop over.”~Stayed for two nights white in transit to Roma from the UK. Arrived late at night and reception was closed but there is a phone on the wall. Just press the button and your put through to someone who will give you the safe code to retrieve your key. Safe is to the right hand side of reception door. Although there are signs up saying please be quite as other guests are sleeping some do still drag the bags across the rough floor with the cases with wheels. It does tend to echo in the little court yard. Room was basic but pleasant. Did smell a little like dirty old clothes but not too bad. Bathroom a good size but the best thing is the bed was really comfortable. Along with the key, you get a free breakfast voucher for two people. It's a continental style with tea, coffee, a choice of juices, yogurt, fruit, cereal and toast. Just help yourself. Quite tasty and plenty of it. The lady in reception was very nice and helpful. She advised me where to eat in the evening and having no car, I was relying on things nearby. They have a new map which is vey helpful. This shows all the restaurants in the Ascot area. I settled on a the bowling club a very short walk to the end of the street and turn left. Good food quick service and very friendly. On the Sunday again the lady was very helpful when checking out and showed me that on the phone there are two Taxis you can call. By the phone is a reference number for each company to get to a better rate to the airport. All in I would stay again for a night or two perfect location for airport if it's a quick stop over.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
