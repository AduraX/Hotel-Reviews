review_478358579~“Event with Hilton”~We had a family celebration at the Brisbane Hilton, and all of the staff we encountered were very professional and helpful. Ours was a small celebration which was handled with expertise. I would recommend this Hotel and staff for future events. Accommodation was excellent, so the stay and event was a smooth process~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467074668~“The best Hotel events team”~I happily and excitedly book the Hilton Brisbane for all our business events. The Events team is sharp. fast, effective, they have common sense and are very helpful and extra mile effort people!! I also choose to stay at this beautiful hotel every month because of its top location, modern and Sooooper clean rooms, THE BEST beds and the awesome, big, modern showers- (I am not a fan of the shower over the bath) The gym is GREAT and the pool area is like a mini tropical holiday in the city! AND All the team from concierge to front desk, houskeeping and the folks on the phone are top STAR!!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_478132516~“Nice hotel close to CBD”~Had a great stay, from the start of the stay to the very end I had an enjoyable experience. Staff members that I came in contact with were alsways happy, friendly and helpful. Room was big, clean and comfortable.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477987505~“Great stay”~We spent 3 nights here and found the hotel to be comfortable. The hotel concierge team was great especially Adrian. They were really helpful with directions and recommendations. The lobby is very large and spacious with a bar and restaurant (we never ate there so can't speak to the food). The room was fairly large sized however the bathroom and the shower were small and felt cramped. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The room had a fridge but no microwave (strange). The gym was great. The have an pool that offers great city views the view at night is really nice. The hotel backs to the main pedestrian mall which is very convenient for shopping, grabbing a bite, going for a stroll or just sitting and people watching. We walked over to the Brisbane river (just a few minutes away) from which you can take tours of the city by boat. Also a short walk away is another mall area that is full of restaurants, bars and clubs. Overall a great place to stay that puts you in the middle of everything.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_477826857~“Pleasant experience”~Hotel is well located, clean and a pleasure to stay. Parking like many city hotels is excessive. Rooms are clean, tidy and comfortable. Food again is expensive but good. Hotel staff are very helpful. Overall, would come back again~4~4~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_477805531~“Overnight ”~Quick one night stop over to attend a meeting the following day  Nice enough place. Restaurant was good but service a bIt on the slow side.

review_477272511~“Great hotel”~Stayed 2 nights. Great room.  Used the pool and it was nice.  Location is great but found it hard to find good restaurants in the area during public holidays.  Used the bar and bartender was great also.  Continental breakfast as I am a gold member was free. It was very nice.  Would come back.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476459617~“Feedback”~Excellent stay and superb location is added advantage . I was very happy with the internet services. The speed of the net enabled me to work seamlessly from my hotel room. The inroom dining services are good and have good options for business travelers like me who find it easy and best to eat dinner in the room.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_476316606~“Great value , great location”~Such and a lovely place to stay. Rooms are modest size , but perfectly fine. The location is second to none. But what sets this hotel apart is the silence. When you close the door, you can hear nothing, and the curtains are well designed so they block almost all of the light. If you're in need of a beautiful sleep, check in here.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476115344~“It's the Hilton - nuff said”~We stay here when we are in Brisbane for work. I've stayed on various floors, mostly 18 and above. Hilton's location in town is the best, right out back to the Queen Street Mall and all it has to offer. We always have a rental car when we are in town and parking is sketchy sometimes, especially if you valet. The reception area for cars is quite small and there is always a backup. Valets are highly efficient however and will come and get you and just leave the car where it is until they can get to it. Restaurant is good, I've only been for breakfast however. Exec lounge is perfect place and Mark always seems to remember who I am even if I've not been in town for a year. The pool area is now completed and it looks great. Hilton has come to be my go to hotel for business travel and this one never seems to disappoint.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476001482~“Great service and location”~Stayed here for 3 nights. Right from the our initial welcome by Concierge, then Reception the quality service was first class for our entire stay.

See my seller ate review for the Atrium Restaurant ( also excellent service and fab food).~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_475984482~“Awesome staff and location”~This was my fourth stay here and, as a frequent Hilton member, I am always impressed.

review_475939053~“Exceptional Service”~The Hilton in Brisbane is our hotel of choice when visiting the city and mirrors the excellent service we receive in Hilton's worldwide. Each and every member of staff we came in contact with was an ambassador for the brand - nothing was too much trouble, courteous and customer focussed.  Our King room was spotlessly clean and well appointed, we appreciated the large mini fridge and the bed was super comfortable.  Great location to everything the CBD has to offer, plus a short walk across the river to the theatre.  Our one disappointment was the lack of acknowledgement as both Hilton members and repeat guests.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475717683~“Great stay!”~Overall an outstanding hotel stay. Getting past the initial lack of acknowledgment of my status the staff completely made up for it. Guest relations manager was on point and made the stay. He granted me access to the executive lounge and sent a bottle of wine to my room for the inconvenience. Thank you!~4~4~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_475488743~“Great location”~We spent the last couple of days at the Hilton before we returned to the UK. Our stay was very enjoyable just the bit of luxury we wanted. The hotel is in a great location just 5 mins from the train station with easy access to the airport. We enjoyed the pool catching a bit of sun after the recent poor weather.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475391964~“Overnight child free stay in the city”~Service from the concierge staff upon our arrival was excellent, valet parking ($58 per night) was very efficient and the small touches (concierge opening doors/calling lifts) for us was much appreciated. King size room with a lovely big window with city views was very enjoyable. No DVD player which was a little disappointing. Staff were fantastic, very efficient and courteous and location was excellent, just a short stroll to the Botanical Gardens or Queen St Mall~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_473888573~“Excellent Queen Street Mall Location”~Beautiful property with iconic atrium. Early check-in was allowed at noon. Celebrating our wedding anniversary and a birthday, the staff made us feel very special excellent quality hotel, with turn down service, excellent wi-fi, friendly staff, a nice pool and well equipped and modern gymnasium. I would expect nothing less from a downtown Hilton and was very pleased with the stay~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473888013~“Excellent modern city hotel ”~Very impressive hotel. After a very long international flight, was checked in early to a great view room on the top floor. The hotel is comfortable, modern, has a great lobby restaurant, very nice pool and renovated gym. What I liked the best though was the staff. They could not have been more accommodating. I will definitely be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473828892~“Look After with Great Service”~Arrived to a great greeting at the door and even warmer greeting by the reception staff. Was shown to the room promptly and after arriving in the room and was more then we expected. Plenty of room and a comfy lounge to sit instead a small plastic chair or the bed. 10 minuted after arriving we received text from reception asking if everything in the room was OK and if we needed anything. We went down stairs to the bar and the staff where warm and friendly. Breakfast was good, the only thing everyone was lined up to get omelets cooked and it stopped every one else getting to the hot food as they all lined up in front of one person cooking the omelets. YES I WOULD RECOMMEND STAYING HERE~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_473989534~“Excellent City Hotel”~Great hotel in centre of the city. Large quite rooms with comfortable beds. Excellent professional friendly staff especially in the Executive Lounge.

review_473725174~“It's where to stay when in Brisbane CBD”~Close to everything, but quite and private. Right onto the mall from the lifts for shopping and dining. The fitness facility along with the pool are top rate and I'll most certainly stay here the next time I find myself in Brisbane.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_473678382~“A place to stay once but not again”~The room was ok, nothing special and definitely not what I was expecting from 5 star accomodation. There was mouldnin the bathroom and the bathroom was very small and the shower was over a bathtub. The breakfast was cold (it appears the warmers weren't working) or they just don't get enough guests to turn over the food quick enough. The staff couldn't be bothered in the breakfast area and I had to go to them for a coffee (even though I was told someone would be around) and no one came by again to see if we wanted a refill. Out of this place and the Marriott I will take the Marriott any day! Nicer atmosphere and attentive staff at the Marriott. The Hilton doesn't live up to the hype!!~3~2~3~4~3~3~2~nan
review_473527374~“Perfect location in the heart of Brisbane”~Nice clean hotel. The hotel location is in the heart of Brisbane, the hotel has access to both Elizabeth street and queen street. All the shops are within walking distance. We the Hhoner so the gave us internet access for free, and it was high speed.  We did the check in online which went smooth and essay and we got to choose our rooms, but unfortunately i choose a room for special need so, i had to change the room later. I paid for late checkout and before the time the hotel disconnect my interenet and room phone, i had to go down to the reception so that they can send someone to carry my luggage, since i had lots of bags, then go back to my room ( not functional at all and time counsuming). When i asked the person in reception they acted as the dont know why.  The stuff at the restaurant were disappearing we someone times have to wait for someone to appear to be seated. The food is average no mush verities.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473280403~“service was amazing!”~Came here with my boyfriend for a romantic night out on the town. Our waitress Jill was such a delight to be around. For such a young girl she blew our minds with her attention to fine dining and knowledge about food options. We are foodies and loved everything she recommended. We could tell that the restaurant was busy so there was a little wait on food but Jill made sure our cocktail glasses were never empty! We will come back and we hope to have her as our waitress again! Fantastic work to the kitchen and to Jill! Keep it up hilton brisbane!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_472658890~“Excellent service in Executive lounge”~I am a diamond member of Hilton Honor. That mean I had stayed at many different Hilton property and realize their service standard.  However this hotel executive lounge provided excellent service for the guests. Most of the executive lounges had self service only but this one the staffs were more than happy to take your order and brought your wine to your table. At the mean time I had a late night flight but I was allowed to use the lounge after I checked out.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_471585119~“Fantastic Hotel”~I was thoroughly impressed with the service and facilities at Hilton Brisbane. My room was uber comfortable and had a nice view of the city. The minibar had some wonderful options in it. Staff were courteous and professional in the restaurant, concierge and front desk. I liked the layout of the hotel too. 2 entrances (the back one being very discreet) and the keys to the lifts for extra security. The glass elevators provide a great view of the hotel. It was like being on a dreamworld ride. I ate the restaurant for breakfast and dinner too, which was marvelous. The cocktail menu is also sublime. I cannot fault my stay at Hilton Brisbane. It was fantastic.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_471514368~“Clean and Comfortable in a Great Location”~This hotel was one of two we stayed in Brisbane on or recent trip. The location was perfect. Brisbane is a very walkable city and this hotel was very central and a great starting point for anywhere you wanted to go. It also had easy driving access but beware if you are driving - valet costs are approx $58 per day. This is par for the city in a secure lot. We did research and also checked with Aussie friends who highly recommended it (not spendthrifts - I should tell you). They were very nervous about self parking and leaving the car anywhere else. The room was comfortable and scrupulously clean despite being rather small for the cost. I didn't love the decor. Orange curtains, orange carpet and a yellow arm chair - and none of these colours were flattering versions. I must mention that I thought the bed was very comfy - always a good thing. The facility was easily accessed from the mall and from a couple of other convenient street locations. It also had lots of great restaurants in the immediate vicinity so we didn't choose the pricey 'breakfast included' option which was around $35 per person per day. The hotel has an atrium right in its centre which created a very barn like atmosphere for the public areas. This made the bar and restaurant less alluring. Not good for a cosy, intimate dinner or drinks. Family feedback was that they felt the hotel was more for business and therefore less enjoyable. I personally felt it had a lot of positives and liked it very much, particularly the cleanliness.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471308812~“Top Location and Luxurious Hotel”~We returned once more. We love the location, and the hotel is so luxurious and comfortable. The only thing we didn't like was the change in opening hours for the lounge on Saturday and again on Sunday - very confusing, and frustrating when you find it closed. However, once open the food and drinks and service were great. The rooms and beds are very comfortable, but we have never had a view - not sure if there is one?~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_471283400~“Nice hotel, but extra charges”~I have stayed at the Hilton a number of times. It is very conveniently located & comfortable with reasonable service. However, on the last two occasions I stayed there, when we arrived earlier than check in time, we were told that we could have early check in for an extra $40 - no thanks!  I have stayed in many hotels in many countries & they are all only to happy to let you go into a room before check in without additional cost if it is ready -that is just good customer service! Not good enough Hilton! Also the breakfast cost is $37 - very overpriced. This time we were kffered a 'special deal' for breakfast of $25 - that js all that it is worth - an OK variety, but the pancakes were terrible & the service not good.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_471227595~“Reliable Hotel”~I have stayed here a few times for work. Rooms are functional and clean and spacious enough with a comfortable bed and plenty of light. Location is convenient and staff were both efficient and friendly. From a work perspective it is a good place to stay and typical of a Hilton. Slightly unusual entrance v reception ( need to take lift to 6Floor ) and I have not eaten here as tended to have dinners out for work and my usual preference for breakfast is to find a good local café for coffee and light food rather than an expensive buffet offering.  Overall a very reliable hotel in Brisbane~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471013585~“Hilton Brisbane”~A great stay at the Hilton last week while attending a conference. The hotel is very well run, lovely atmosphere and surrounding. The bar is great for a relaxing drink and the restaurant provided great food for breakfast and dinner. Overall a great experience and I will be back.

review_470165838~“Met Expectations and 5 Star Rating”~Put simply the Hotel performed well. Check in was a breeze with their pre arrival service. Just breezed through and picked up the keys - quick and easy. Ability to select your room online was also great - good availability and we got what we wanted. Breakfast was good - not exceptional, but as you expect. Check out was easy, happy for us to leave our bags and on collecting them early afternoon offered us cold water bottles of water as we left. Couldn't fault it.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_469526490~“Chef - please go back to basics - Hilton Ballroom "breakfast"”~We went to the Hilton for a work breakfast this morning in the ballroom. Presentation was excellent, space is good, but the hot food was dreadful. I've never had powered eggs, but I imagine the taste would be like the scrambled eggs served this morning. I think it was bacon on the plate - it might have been steamed to cook? - I don't know, it was certainly watery. The sausages (you wouldn't call them chipolatas) tasted of nothing. I have never had a really good breakfast at the Hilton, but this was the pits. If I put out that meal I'd be embarrassed - go back to basics chef.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_469540339~“Very Good Hotel, Very Good Location”~The Hilton Brisbane is a very good hotel located right next to the Queen Street Mall which is a great place to shop, eat and people watch. It is also pretty close to the Botanical Gardens and the river.~4~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469305486~“An excellent choice”~I've stayed in half a dozen Brisbane hotels, and this is my joint favourite (but budget wise the better option!), because of the warm, efficient and friendly service, a good location, wonderfully comfortable beds and really good standard rooms, public spaces and bathrooms. I arrived late at night, and checked in very quickly, went straight to bed and fell asleep instantly - not normally the case. In the morning, I found the breakfast in the Executive Lounge was perfect, with a good selection for a continental buffet. The checkout, within the lounge, took seconds, and so they'd effectively removed many of the niggles I find with other hotels (poor checkin\checkout and poor breakfast). If I could change one small, annoying thing...it would be the TV settings. I really don't want "Hotel TV" to be on when I switch on the telly, and so I tried to change from it with Channel Up\Down. But the too-smart-for-its-own-good TV is programmed to ignore all of that, and continue to broadcast the pointless Hotel TV advert at you until you find the red button with the small letters "TV" underneath it. I know many hotels do this today, but in the Hilton, they've made the TV button so small and innocuous, it took real concentration to find it and discover real TV. Not going to stop me giving this hotel 5 stars though~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_469139719~“Great City Centre Hotel”~Spacious, clean, great staff, breakfast buffet good. If you want something with some luxury look no further. Bar is a bit expensive and check-in is on the sixth floor, otherwise it would have been 5 stars~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_468431220~“Comfy and quiet”~We stayed 1 night in a basic room. It had everything we needed, a comfy bed and was lovely and quiet despite being locate in the middle of the city. Good location for travellers. No parking but you can get a deal through secure parking online for $15 per night. We ordered room service breakfast which was very disappointing - the poached eggs were cooked hard and had egg shell in them, the bacon was so over cooked it was like leather, the toast wasn't sourdough as stated on the menu and was more like bread than toast and we were told it would be delivered within 40 mins and it took at least an hour. We mentioned the poor breakfast upon check out and staff were very apologetic and sorted the situation to our satisfaction. Apart from that I would recommend a stay here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_468228871~“Great location, staff and overall experience”~Only stayed for the one night at the Hilton Brisbane however an impressive night it was. Very welcoming staff - helpful and engaging. The room was spotlessly clean and well appointed with one small annoyance- no USB outlets - something I would really expect in this day & age. I could get my phone charged if I was willing to leave it at the desk - not something I was willing to do. Despite this - a very good stay and would definitely stay again and recommend~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_467901637~“Amazing location! ”~This is pretty standard for a nice downtown big-name hotel, but what really sets the swim part is the amazing location right next to Queen Street shopping. It was just a stones throw away from all the major places.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467754825~“The Best!”~I cannot praise this hotel enough! From check in at home to the wonderful macaroons left in the room several times during our stay, everything was done for our comfort. A large room with a good bathroom and walk-in shower. The staff were all great, remembering what we liked to drink etc and the breakfast buffet had everything anyone could wish for. There is a lift from the lobby to the Queen street mall below, also to the Irish pub next door if needed. The hotel is ideally situated for all local amenities.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_467378592~“Excellent location for an overnight visit”~We had one night in the Hilton Brisbane, but feel we made the most of it in our short visit. Had a chance to visit the rooftop spa which could have been about four degrees F warmer during the rain, but was otherwise very comfortable (and empty). Our room was very comfortable, very clean and up to the usual Hilton standards. Since we were pretty tired from the long flight, we made it up to the HHonors executive lounge for happy hour, which was the perfect amount of food and wine for our dinner. The restaurant downstairs looked really nice, but alas, no time to see what they had to offer.  What's great about the location is the proximity to almost anything a traveler would need, including a small shopping center with a pharmacy and cafes for coffee. I wish we had time to do more exploring in Brisbane--if we come back, we would certainly stay at the Hilton Brisbane again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_467195068~“Great short break.”~From check in to check out the Brisbane Hilton was fantastic. Staff were helpful and nothing was too much trouble.

review_467137447~“Nice location, service lacking”~Enjoyed a weekend stay here and rooms decent, location good. Wasn't a great start when on arrival at 1pm (check in is from 3pm) I was told that the room I had been allocated had been vacated, but wasn't ready, but helpfully housekeeping would be notified of my arrival and should be ready within the hour. My mobile number was verified and they said they'd give me a call when it's ready. Didn't hear back, so at 230pm enquired at the desk only to be told room hadn't started to be cleaned yet. Still didn't receive a call, so waited in line from 3pm (by this time, there was a long line as it was regular check in time and just 3 staff on check in), so eventually got into room at 3.30pm. Whilst early arrival isn't guaranteed, I don't appreciate being messed around and prefer just being told it won't be ready til 3pm. Still waiting for the call!  As a Hilton Gold card holder, I didn't receive lounge access or a room upgrade. I didn't ask specifically about this, nor was I told at check in.  Service at breakfast on the Saturday was chaotic to say the least. Most tables dirty. There were no pears, peaches, iced water, not even any butter for toast, just one cracker and just one piece of cheese big enough to feed a mouse!! Asked for some fruit and after a while it was replenished. There was still no water or cheese and crackers when we left half an hour later. Overall the hotel just seemed under staffed in all areas - check in, housekeeping and the restaurant. Clearly not geared up to maintain standards when the hotel is busy. Sundays breakfast was fine. We left our room at 8.30am for a booked tour and returned at 3.30pm to find it still hadn't been serviced. Eventually a friendly housekeeper came after 4. Maybe it was just a bad weekend to stay at the hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_466648129~“Excellent Location”~Excellent Location, lifts take you right into Queen Street Mall. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Dont think that i would consider staying anywhere else in Brisbane. Only downfall is having to catch 2 lifts to your room.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_464936770~“Luxury in the Heart of the City”~The Hilton is situated in the heart of the city on the back of the Queen street Mall. This offers plenty of shopping and restaurants, with only a short walk to the Botanical Gardens, Eagle Street Pier and other places like the South Bank~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464936564~“Great Stay at Hilton”~Brisbane Hilton in the heart of the city and a lot of staff have big hearts when looking after you, and no request is not seen too hard for them to achieve. Front desk greets you with a smile when arriving and when leaving and use your name where appropriate. Rooms are nice / modern and clean. Breakfast is welcoming..~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464619360~“Good to be home agai”~It's quite sometime since I stayed. Excellent service, ultra clean room, comfy bed, nice amenities, great location to shops, gardens, river remained the same. I wondered why it had been so long. I always do feel I'm coming home when I stay. Thank you Hilton Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_464667479~“Amazing Hotel”~The best and my favorite Hotel to stay at. Staff are so polite, professional and respectful. Facilities are clean and amazing and have everything that you would want to have. Centrally located in Brisbane makes it perfect for business, pleasure or for a holiday. The rooms are spacious and the large beds are so comfortable. A great pool to relax around and get some sunshine. The gym is comprehensive for all types of workouts~5~5~nan~5~5~5~5~nan
review_464202073~“Understated Excellence”~An all around excellent experience with Hilton Brisbane, Great room and workable desk, great bed, lovely facilities, plenty of strong hot water, quiet and hassle free. Great staff follow up. Located right by the mall it has everything at you finger tips. 10 mins clam walk to QPAC Arts Centre and Southbank dining.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463807789~“It's Ok”~Exceptionally difficult place to get to if you are driving and don't know the city because all the streets are 1 way and it's exceptionally confusing. Took an hour to get there from the airport and the majority of that was waiting for pedestrians and trying to navigate the streets which are not well sign posted. Awful turning circle/parking at the hotel with required valet parking which is very expensive. Typical Hilton and the staff were the usual crowd between helpful and "I'm here to do my job". Rooms was pretty spacious, well equipped and clean. Cheapest mini-bar I found in all 3 Australian cities I stayed in and the room rate was very good and cheaper than what I expected 9for the standard of hotel and Australia). Very well placed for access down to the river front and the nice restaurants/bars there. Taxi back to the airport was one of their own cars and was pricey (they told me 50 AUS but charged me 65AUS for the 25 minute drive).~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_463072886~“Fantastic Service and a great night's sleep”~I arrived at the Hotel some 3 hours before checking (which is at 3pm). Reception is located on the 6th floor. Reception informed me that a room was available but it was on a low floor - I was offered a choice to take the room, alternatively wait. I chose to take the room at that time. Room, as anticipated, was clean, tidy. Bar fridge stocked well with many snacks. Usual 5 star hotel facilities available, including pool, gym, concierge, bar, restaurant and function rooms. You can access the Hotel via lifts in Queen Street Mall. The Hotel is located only a short walk to the River.  Checkout was a breeze. Regret - I should have taken a note of the pillow I slept on! (which I later discovered can be purchased via Hilton to Home website).~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_463109162~“Great short stay”~Felt valued and welcomed by the whole Hilton team. What a lovely place to spend a couple of days. We arrived early from an overnight flight and were made welcome by the hotel who worked to get us quickly into a room.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_462829286~“Excellent Location”~Stayed on 4 different occasions last December. Service was consistent, housekeeping turndown service was well appreciated due to my work schedule. Breakfast at the restaurant was enjoyable with good service and plenty of options. Breakfast at the executive lounge was good too. Well set and professionally attended. Room are spacious and views are great regardless of the side of the building your room is located. Rooms on higher floors ensure you an unobstructed view. Location is great, just in the middle of the city. Train station 3 blocks away, bus central station 1 block away, shopping center downstairs, restaurants between walking distance.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_462321429~“Solid and reliable business hotel”~This is your typical high quality Hilton style hotel. The rooms are modern with excellent views of the city. The executive lounge breakfast service is well organised and the service staff is a true professional.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_462308735~“Very modern”~Luckily for me my company was one of the feature businesses for the month so I got upgraded and executive lounge access. Exec lounge was great, nice nibbles and drinks as well as your standard breakfast. Rooms were open and light filled. Couldn't fault much with it at all and easily the best of the larger chain brand hotels I've stayed at in brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462075431~“We booked an executive room.....”~Which gives you access to the Club Lounge. The Club Room in the evening was standing room only and chaotic. So, I probably wouldn't do this again vs the extra $'s for the room upgrade.  The room itself is a good size and the views were nice (Room 2206). Very basic TBH not really a 5 star but the location is FANTASTIC. Honestly you cannot beat it.  We didn't haven't any room service so cannot comment on this.  The staff were lovely and welcoming.  NOTE Parking is Valet only, $58 per night!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461989220~“Bed Haven”~The bed in Hilton Brisbane was so amazingly comfortable. Room ambience was great, love the bright bathroom. Location is fantastic, easily accessible to popular areas, good food all around. Breakfast spread was good. Concierge service was wonderful.~4~4~5~5~5~4~4~nan
review_461745799~“Great stay and location”~After Princess cruise ended in Brisbane, we stayed 2 nights. Took taxi from cruise terminal to hotel. Hotel is located right in heart of downtown. We were warmly greeted by doormen who helped with our luggage. They directed us to elevator for check-in on 6th floor. We arrived an hour before our requested early check-in. Front desk agent greeted us warmly. Said our room was being cleaned and should be available shortly. As a Diamond member, they gave us an access key for the executive Lounge on the 25th floor. We went there and had some food. Lounge staff took good care of us. Gave us room key shortly after arrival in lounge. Had our bags delivered to our room on the 19th floor. Had a great view of the city. AC system worked well. Very comfortable bed. Room was excellent. Got breakfast in the buffet both mornings as a Diamond member. Check-out was swift and doormen helped with bags and getting taxi to airport.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_461627828~“Would stay again and again”~The bed was divine if you like big, soft and comfy; the room was spacious, the window was big and clean and the staff are super attentive. Room service meal was hot and delicious and great value for money.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461627715~“Certainly Good Enough”~As a venue to explore Brisbane, or as a location if on Business, this is a better option than most, and the staff are very friendly & helpful. The arrival can be a bit disappointing as you arrive at ground level but need to travel to 6 to check in.~4~3~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_461627611~“Relaxing, quality and Service”~A stay over at the Brisbane Hilton, great room, beautiful lobby bar and restaurant and so convenient to all that Brisbane CBD has to offer. We were very impressed the Executive Lounge team sent us down to the lobby bar (as Lounge full at 6pm on a Saturday night) with drink vouchers and a free food platter. We enjoyed it more than the Lounge anyway!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_461627519~“Quality Establishment”~The hotel was in a great location close to shopping, restaurants and entertainment venues. The rooms were clean and the staff were friendly.

review_461068412~“Fabulous Customer Service”~I recently stayed at here for business. The staff went over and above to make me feel welcome including a text after check in to make sure everything was ok. The staff had left the curtains wide open and I had a beautiful view of the city and its lights. The room was lovely and quiet and the bed was perfect. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_460577408~“I love this place”~Wonderful experience. Best service, attentive respectful staff, right in the centre of town. Great for shopping, food and drink spot on. Its my home away from home. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who asks. Having been coming to this hotel since 1986. We have had family weddings, graduations, celebrations dinners, and now that I live rurally, wonderful mini holidays. You just cant beat it.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460282706~“Superb Customer Service ”~Can't rate the customer service here at Hilton Brisbane highly enough- absolutely superb! Furthermore the location is excellent as you are no more than 10 minutes walk to anywhere in the CBD! Highly recommended!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459746873~“Warm and friendly staff”~Had a great weekend away staying here. A great location in the mall we were able to enjoy a day of shopping before heading back to the hotel for cocktails. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the restaurant and couldn't fault the food or dining staff. The rooms are looking a little dated but the bed was amazing and room service delicious. The food and staff really make this place~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459496134~“Excellent Location”~My 6th Year staying at the Hilton. Located on the queen street mall where you can find great shopping and many restaurants. 5 minute walk to the casino and 10 minutes to central station. The river bank is also just a 15 minute walk. I have stayed at other properties in the CBD however, I would rate this location as the best choice. Excellent breakfast buffet that is free for Hilton Honor elites. If you are choosing between Marriott and Hilton and location is important, I would suggest Hilton.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459490130~“Great old fashioned service!”~Location is terrific. Close proximity to shops and Treasury Casino. Beds were very comfortable, slept really well, unusual for me. Loved the service. The kind that you used to get, making you feel special. We stayed Sunday night and the grill wasn't open, not sure if that's normal. Swam In the beautiful and very clean pool on a hot hot night. Lovely. Had a scrummy breakfast with a huge variety and quality. Would definitely recommend for a getaway or business stay.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_458829372~“Fabulous location with super friendly and efficient staff”~Stayed there on my own for a night as I was visiting Brisbane for a friend's birthday party. From the minute I arrived nothing was too much trouble and the staff were super friendly. Had lunch and breakfast there...both meals good. The room was comfortable, clean and quiet. The hotel is super central and you walk out the door onto the main shopping precinct.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_458615941~“Nice hotel good location ”~I stayed here for 2 nights recently. The exec club room on the 25th floor was lovely, bright and clean. All the staff that i came into contact with were really helpful and charming. We had a lunch in the restaurant on the 6th floor which was delicious, but the service was slow. We had breakfast in the executive lounge which was plentiful and pleasant.  We had a drink in the lounge on the first night and had meetings in the lounge the next afternoon. The staff were great. I used the laundry service which was good. The location is great as i was able to easily run down to the Southbank each morning, and walk to Eagle Street pier for dinner. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458450737~“Comfy overnight stay”~Had a good visit last night.  Eat at the Vantage downstairs - very nice meal Breakfast was good, but quite predictable for a A Hilton. Bit annoying to be charged for a non standard coffee (but still, typical).  Room was comfy - great bed - good close access into the middle of Brisbane.  Interesting hotel - the massive central atrium is a bit of a head spin - probably the most notable feature of the building.  Thanks for the late check out - made my day a lot easier to manage.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457779937~“Perfect location ”~Friendly courteous and helpful staff . Reasonable rates . Double room was comfortable as was bedding . Perfectly located , walk straight out of hotel into queen street mall . Easy walking distance to central station .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457769855~“Lovely City Hotel”~The staff was very accommodating to my son and I. I really enjoyed being greeted in the car park and then directed very well to the reception. Reception had us in our room in record time. We had forgotten our converters and they promptly supplied us with a loaner for our electronics.  I wish would could stay longer, it was only an overnight stop, but was a fresh and promising experience. The one draw back is the VERY expensive overnight parking. I suspect this is to discourage overnighters, but we didn't have a choice. The valet was very upfront right away about the expense, which I had already seen, so it wasn't a surprise, but beware if you need to bring a car.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_457718223~“Very nice hotel”~I stayed at the Hilton for 5 days. The room was very comfortable. I really liked the fay bed and the ottoman for the desk chair. The room was clean and well maintained. Room service was very good and the selection of meals was quite good. The outdoor rooftop pool was great after a long day of meetings.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457687329~“Perfectly located for a family trip to Brisbane.”~I took my 6-year-old to Brisbane for 4 nights to see Australian animals. We did day trips to Australia Zoo and Lone Pine, and the Hilton was well-located for walking to the river (the boat to Lone Pine) and to the train station for the zoo. Overall the hotel was excellent. We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning, and although it's annoying that they have a surcharge for hot items, the service was uniformly outstanding. It was fun interacting with Jillian, the hostess, every morning.  My main complaint is that the room sink is tiny. We had a large number of sauce spills and, consequently, needed to wash things in the room every night. We could fit one thing, maybe two in the sink, and even then water would spill out. Definitely a case of form over function, and not family-friendly. Otherwise the room was great. We slept well, and housekeeping was great. I'd stay at the Hilton again.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
