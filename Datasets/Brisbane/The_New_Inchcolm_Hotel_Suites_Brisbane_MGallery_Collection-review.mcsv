review_478403004~“Superb boutique hotel”~We booked one night at Inchcolm Hotel for 1st April for a 50th birthday present/getaway. On 31st March we postponed a week, due to devastating floods preventing us getting to Brisbane. The hotel and restaurant bookings were moved with no fuss. A week later our car had broken down and we couldn't hire a car, due to the local car hire company losing 30 cars from their fleet in the floods the week before! Again the booking was moved, 2 weeks this time, no trouble at all. We rang whilst driving in to clarify directions to park our car and were given the information promptly. We were delighted to find on check-in we had been upgraded to a suite! In the room we found a bottle of champagne, some chocolates and a birthday card... The suite we had was enormous, had beautiful décor, and was well appointed. The hotel is a lovely blend of old architecture with modern finishes/conveniences. We dined at Thomson's Reserve and the food was divine, the wine selection ample and service impeccable. The continental breakfast included was ample, varied and fresh. The hotel is a 10-15 minute walk through Central Station to the Queen St Mall etc. shopping precinct. We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this hotel, will stay there again and recommend it to others.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_477234703~“Luxury at Inchcolm Hotel”~As someone who has stayed at a lot of hotels in Australia and internationally I would give this hotel the highest rating possible.  Check in was fantastic, room is luxurious and I love the decor. Had a room on the second floor with a great view. Room service was quick and efficient and food delicious. Nespresso machine in the room topped it all off! Fantastic hotel that I would highly recommend to anyone for business or leisure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476977043~“Amazing boutique hotel - highly recommend!”~We were only in Brisbane one night and I did look at a few options but so glad that I picked this hotel! We arrived at 10am and our room was ready so we were able to check in. We booked the Inchloft one bed apartment which was amazing! set over two floors it was a really light room, plenty of home comforts and great bathroom. The room was finished to a great standard and I would highly recommend to anyone staying in Brisbane. it was a short walk in to the centre and the staff were really great. We didn't eat in the hotel or use the bar but they looked really nice.  This is our second stay in an MGallery hotel and we would highly recommend them!!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_475929013~“Inchcolm reborn”~We knew the Inchcolm when it was doctors' chambers and love the sensitive renovation of the lift and the way the lift grills etc are reflected in the carpets and other decor.

review_475379704~“Boutique Retro”~Wonderful luxurious boutique style hotel located conveniently north side of Central Station. Part of larger Sofitel hotel group but intimate and personal. Very friendly and helpful at reception! 1 bedroom Queen suite was a tad too cosy (not spacious) but loved the 1920s decor and ambience. Bed mattress was on the soft side but appreciated the pillow menu to suit personal preferences. Double glazing windows provided quiet respite from city traffic noise. The highlight was the restored old lift, a treat to use. Highly recommended, esp. if you can get a deal.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474510988~“this is the best place to stay in Brisbane”~this place has everything you want in a getaway, luxury,charm,character,tranquility,service & peace & quite - something hard to find in a city. we visit Brisbane several times a year & when we found this place we knew we didn't need to find anywhere else to stay. this is place is awesome & handy to everything, the city, the valley,china town,the river..... we love it, it's very special xMichele~5~3~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473934918~“Romantic rendezvous”~A boutique hotel with wonderful staff who make you feel very special, thanks to Shu on reception and Justina in the restaurant. It is also the perfect location to enjoy Brisbane and all it has to offer.

review_472559296~“Good quality small hotel ”~Our agent booked us in here for one evening before flying back to the UK the next day . Check in was friendly and we received an upgrade to a beautifully furnished modern room on the 3rd floor .  It's well positioned between the main shopping area of George and and Albert streets and China town . Only draw back was parking to drop off our luggage was a bit of a nightmare and had to make a couple of laps before finding a space . Nice hotel though and would certainly recommend . ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471815406~“Wonderful Hotel and amazing food”~Beautifully appointed large rooms - mix of old world charm and modern fixtures.

I am certainly going to return.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470734817~“Beautiful Hotel in a great location”~We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. It was convenient to everything we wanted to do and see. The room was clean and bright. The bathroom modern and clean. The room didn't feel too cramped or cluttered, even with our luggage. The service was excellent. The staff friendly and helpful.  BUT best of all, and what matters to me most at any hotel, is the bed. This bed was one of the best I had ever slept in anywhere. I would come back for the bed alone. I highly recommend this hotel for the bed alone, because at the end of the day, I want a great bed to sleep in at the end of the day, and this one was sublime!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469933930~“Below average”~Did not meet expectations. Nice hotel in good location but the service failed. They just didn't have it. Shame as the place looks good and the food was good. Service is number one and that was't there. Won't be back.~2~nan~4~nan~4~nan~1~nan
review_469899375~“Great little hotel”~Another one of the Accor M Gallery and it lives up to the idea of memorable. Far enough from the city to not be noisy or rushed but close enough to be convenient. This was a business trip for me and it allowed a bit of an escape while still in the heart of Brisbane. It has just been refurbished and the rooms are trendy, clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Is sort of quirky but that is part of its charm.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469257493~“Great service and Food”~The hotel is located on a noisy street in a business district. You are awaken in the night by the noises of the vehicles. Because it is an old hotel you can hear all the creeks from the floor and through the paper thin walls.  It is about 35 minutes from the Brisbane international Airport. No valet or conceige to help out with the luggage. Not a very good family hotel. It is better for the business travelers who is in and out. There is no gym at the location but allows access to a gym couple of blocks away. The staff is very friendly. Although the food has a heavy price tag, it was absolutely delicious! I gave three stars because of that.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469225526~“Very Comfortable Once Again”~Another stay at the Inchholm and another very comfortable stay. Bed and bedding excellent, bathroom well appointed and service excellent. Unlike a previous stay in a suite, the dimensions of the room and bathroom are fine and I didn't feel crammed when using the bathroom while a huge bedroom and sitting room were just on other side of wall. Rm 212 at back of building was very quiet during night although building work behind hotel in Spring Hill was heard before 7am.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469057159~“Great stay”~We've found our home from home in the city!! From the start the service was awesome, the staff were friendly and attentive. This combined with the awesome building, great rooms and incredible food made our stay memorable to say the least. This hotel has nailed everything that is important in a service industry and deserves all the accolades it receives!!! We will be back!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468441308~“Old World Gem”~Housed in a 19th century, heritage listed former doctor's surgery and residence, this place has plenty of old world charm. Check in and check out were quick, friendly and efficient. My room was spacious, interesting, and luxurious. The room amenities were well thought out and offers a larger range of teas, coffees than most other 5 star hotels. The bed was comfortable and everything worked a treat. My one complaint is house keeping's lack of attention to detail. If the guest had used up the lemongrass and ginger tea, it stands to reason you replace the lemongrass and ginger tea, not replace it with earl grey where the existing packets had not been touched. If the guests had used up the coffee pod of a particular strength, you replace that coffee pod, not put in more of the ones that the guests had not used. If a guest had used up the body lotion, it makes no sense to replace it with hair conditioner where the existing hair conditioner had not been touched. Not rocket science. It would have saved me the trouble of having to call housekeeping to get what I had used replaced properly. More attention to detail by housekeeping would have made my experience at the Inchcolm flawless. Despite lacking attention to detail, when they did bring up the items I had requested, members of housekeeping were friendly and obliging. This is a cosy, luxury, boutique hotel. It does not have a pool. It does not have a gym. However, guests can use a nearby gym. It has a smallish dining room serving up a fine dining experience comprising great food with a nice wine list. Across the passageway is a smallish but stylish bar. Wickham Terrace is a small reasonably quiet street filled with doctor's rooms on the northern end of Brisbane's CBD. It is linked by walkways to the Central Station, located one street from the hotel. If you take the Airtrain from either the domestic or international airports, you will alight at Central Station, turn left as you exit the turnstiles and follow the signs towards Wickham Terrace (veering left). It is approximately 5 to 10 minutes stroll downhill to Eagle Pier and its upmarket restaurants and ferry station. It is also approximately 5 to 10 minutes troll to the Queen Street Mall shopping precinct. So, while you're not in the thick of the action, you are near enough to most places of interest.~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_466968021~“Photogenic hotel with good service”~A beautifully restored hotel. The front desk provide great service. The food is truly a work of art - the lamb dish is the highlight. The steak, whilst stunning, is very overpriced. The rooms are very comfortable, the shower and bathtub are great. Housekeeping have poor attention to detail. The bar and room service are both excellent and I really appreciated the fact dessert could be brought up 15 minutes after the main. A nice touch. The iPad is a nice idea, but the apps crashed incessantly which was frustrating. Valet parking is handy, but parking along Wickham Terrace is difficult, to drop off your vehicle, unfortunately nothing can be done about that.~4~3~3~4~4~2~4~nan
review_466369118~“Spectacular boutique hotel”~This will be my new getaway in Brisbane for short trips where I want to relax in the room and experience luxury. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of a large international five star hotel such as it's cousin the Sofitel nearby, but I never use these services anyway. The room, however, is so much more comfortable and unique.  The bed is super comfortable, the furnishings are elegant and interesting, the room is well laid out and spacious. The bathroom is classy and open plan, with Appelles products.  The service throughout the hotel is better than average and felt very personal, although the small size of the hotel will mean that in peak times you may wait a bit to be served---on checkout, the only staff member at the desk was retrieving someone's valet parked car, and was absent for more than five minutes. Not a major drama though, as we weren't in a rush.  I do agree that breakfast was unexpected...we did pay for a breakfast included package, and was surprised that this didn't include the usual fare found at a hotel buffet, but rather is a simple continental breakfast. An a la carte menu was available as well, but very expensive (eg $22 for eggs benedict), and to pay this price on top of the already fairly expensive buffet would have made for nearly $50 per head for breakfast, which is clearly outrageous. On the plus side, the food that was on the buffet was top notch, with enough variety to satisfy most.  My tripadvisor name is alittleharsh, and I tend to give out 5-stars very sparingly. It has been 9 months since I last gave five stars (Sweden), and exactly two years since my last 5-star award in Queensland (Spicers Clovelly Estate). There have been a lot of hotels between now and then, and none of them have met the mark, but I'm pleased that I've found another one!~5~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466154661~“What breakfast?”~I was all set to give this hotel every bit of 5 stars until I went to check out in the morning. So annoyed, but will keep this balanced. My package deal included "breakfast". I get down there expecting what most other hotels deliver (Bacon, eggs, cereal, juice and toast at the very least). What I got was cereal, some cold meats, no white toast even, no bacon and a pod coffee. Then at check out, the guy tried to charge me for my breakfast that was included in my deal. Oh there is more to the horrid checkout experience, but I'll leave it there. I left feeling like I had a dollar sign tattoo'd to my head. All they cared about was how much money they could get out of me. Never, in all my hotel stays have I ever left a hotel feeling like this.  The room is almost faultless. The bed is amazingly supportive and soft. The toiletries are great, but the location isn't ideal. It's a solid 8-10 minute walk to the mall. Also awesome to have charging points for your phone and computer and many towels. My pillows were huge and bulky. I probably will stay here again, but sorry, the two men who checked me out need training in customer service. Was a horrid way to leave the front doors after such a great stay.~4~nan~3~nan~nan~5~1~nan
review_465928062~“Amazing place to stay!”~How lucky is Brisbane to have such a fabulous boutique hotel? Right from the beginning, the staff at check in were friendly and obviously enjoy working there. The room was amazing, these are not your boring old hotel furnishings. We had a drink at the cosy bar before dinner and then ate a fabulous dinner from the restaurant, Thomson's Reserve Restaurant. A small and intimate restaurant and once again the staff here were very good at their jobs. Everything was 100% about the Inchcolm!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_465487726~“A little gem in Brisvegas”~Stumbled across this new hotel and it was well worth the stay. Beautifully appointed rooms, classy bar and restaurant and wonderfully helpful staff.

review_464900259~“I really wanted this to be a 5 star review ....”~I really wanted this to be a 5 star review, I did. The property is gorgeous - quaint and cute, great location and amazing retention of the old worlde features. Room decor just divine and amazingly comfortable bed. Checkin was quick and friendly. Few small things that really affected my opinion - - my husband and I in the room but only one bottle of water - the noise from the cars driving up the ramp at the neighbouring Novotel was crazy (Room 109) - the 'turndown service' included closing the blind and folding down one corner on one side of the bed but did not extend to anything further (ie bed was crumpled and pillows messy) so just don't bother - bar was very hot - no air con? - both before the event we attended and after we had to approach staff for service and yet it wasn't even busy - the one tapas plate we ordered (lamb ribs) goes down as one of the worst dishes I have ever had - fatty greasy and $20 - we waited for a staff member to approach us to order another plate and/or drink but left without doing so (bar staff were too busy noisily counting coins at 9pm) - inconsistent Accor Plus discount again!  - finally we had to pay $40 for valet parking as it a 'safety' policy that prevented us from parking our own car! Overall just very sad that this beautiful hotel just didn't cut it for me :-(~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_464894138~“Good - with a few niggles”~The New Inchcolm is definitely a boutique experience with stunning furnishings and an ample sized room that was high on comfort however, there were a few niggles during our stay that made this less than the 5 star stay we expected. First off, despite phoning in advance and cancelling the valet parking that had been automatically added to our booking.com reservation it was still included on the bill which I luckily spotted before keying in my PIN. Then we were informed that the lift was out of order, which wasn't a problem for us as we had a first floor room but it doesn't create a great first impression.  And it wasn't the only thing that didn't work properly - the in room ipad was so glitchy it was virtually impossible to use, crashing every few minutes. When I called to order room service I was asked to put the request through on the ipad - 10 frustrating minutes later we called again and ordered by phone! Similar story at breakfast when I had to resort to ordering from my iphone app. Whilst the breakfast was truly great the fries ordered were luke warm and the aioli had been spilled all over the napkin. Picky yes, but this is a 5 star rated hotel.  Other things: the bed and pillows were awesome so I was expecting a good night's sleep but the light in our maxibar didn't switch off when we closed the doors as it was supposed creating light pollution in the room and the fridge was so noisy I had to wear earplugs - not a 5 star sleeping experience. I mentioned this at check out and the fries were taken off the bill which was a nice gesture but not overwhelming! I would definitely recommend the New Inchcolm for those wanting a boutique stay in Brisbane but guys, you need to up your game a little bit to deserve those 5 stars!  TIP: Save yourself the $40 valet parking and park at the Wickham Terrace car park (2 min walk away) for $5 a day on the weekend.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~4~nan

review_462133542~“Outstanding boutique hotel with exceptional services”~There is nothing small about this boutique hotel. The management and staff were outstanding!!!! Our flight landed at 6 am and instead of imposing the 2pm check-in, our room was ready when we arrived.  The 2 bedroom suite was just perfect. The beds were extremely comfortable. It was exactly what we needed after flying for almost a day. All the staff were quite professional, friendly, and very accommodating. There were many instances where these qualities were apparent such as; - The lady that ran the breakfast was extremely delightful. The jet lag just melted away with her beaming smile and friendly services - The front desk was quite helpful with sight seeing and restaurant recommendations. In fact, one staff member went the "extra mile" to assist us in researching a code-sharing domestic flight between Brisbane and Melbourne.  We did not have the chance to enjoy the restaurant, but enjoyed the bar / lounge. We had many great conversations with the bar tenders about the history of the property; and Brisbane in general.  Given the exceptional team and services, we are using this hotel as our Brisbane hub for the next three stays.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_460960159~“Boutique hotel at its best ! ”~My husband and I stayed here for 1 night while I was getting a procedure done at the hospital. It was important that we were able to obtain an early check in, as I was on bed rest from early on, the morning of check in. After emailing 5 other hotels (all of them at the top of the trip advisor list) none of them were Interested in helping us for an early check in, except the Incholm. Super helpful, no request was too much to ask. Beautiful elegant hotel, centrally located. Comfy bed, nice linen, Nespresso machine in the room and lovely amenities. No tissues though which was odd. While we didn't go to the restaurant it looked divine. Would definitely return!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460808188~“Old World Charm at New Inchcolm, Brisbane”~If you want old world charm with stylish décor and attentive service, stay at the New Inchcolm, Brisbane. Valet parking from right outside the front door (fee involved) Checking in and out was a very pleasant experience. Used our free drink vouchers in the bar and had excellent service. We were given a room upgrade and late checkout .Very handy location near Sofitel, Novotel and Central rail station. Would highly recommend this hotel.~5~4~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460659501~“Fancy beautiful boutique hotel with outstanding staff”~Mgallery by Sofitel, before staying here we were staying at Sofitel across the road for two weeks and prior to that we were staying at Novotel for a week. Yes! We are an accor members and we get all the upgrades. You'll be able to compare the level of each hotel. The Mgallery and the Sofitel are equally excellent with all things except they are completely different hotels which we loved so much but anyway.  The New Inchcolm Hotel & Suites, we stayed here for almost a week and it was excellent! Honestly, it's like Sofitel wherein the hotel is as excellent as its staff especially the customer service. I am not comparing the two hey I am just saying that they are both beautiful but completely different in everything but we loved it. It's very homely and cozy. They are pretty small, beautiful and unique hotel (fancy one). And since they are small they all help together. The staff were all helpful, from the bar, Thomson's reserve, housekeeping and concierge. I really forgot the name of this nice lady from the housekeeping she is very nice and sees to it we got all what we need plus Ronell who's very friendly and accommodating.  Kingsley, Jeremy and another guy (I forgot his name) from the bar and reception were all friendly and keen to help out. Tiffany from the bar also helped me to carry down the pram (with the steps in front of the hotel).  At Thomson's Reserve Restaurant I took my hubby out on a date-a valentines date wherein 149 pp food only and everything was just perfect and good! All food was yum! Kudos to the chef!!!  This arvo - we had a late check out because we are accor members and Caitlyn from the concierge was very helpful- I called concierge and asked her to send some help to carry out the baggage from our room she came up and I was trying to reject her to help me -asked for the big blokes and she insisted I know she's a trainee but I'd say she really did a good job in dealing with me (don't worry am friendly to her -we're not difficult guests at all) and my baby. She didn't act like a trainee, she acted very professional and genuinely helpful to us.  I wonder where Sofitel & MGallery recruit their people who are all very professional and accommodating. They also treat their guests equally. Please be consistent and keep up the good work people. Overall, we loved our stay and the hotel was too homely and cozy. 5 star hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460305560~“Brisbane weekend”~What a wonderful hotel. From the moment you walk in the front door you are made very welcome. Service is friendly but professional.

review_460224631~“Disappointing”~I had organized this stay to celebrate a friends birthday, it was a surprise and much planning had gone into organizing the weekend. I had upgraded to the Loft Suite and we were very pleasantly surprised at the size, the views and the thoughtful gift from the hotel (birthday balloon & sparkling wine). However, on one of Brisbane's hottest weekend, in a 5 star hotel and paying over $600pn we walked into the bedroom and found that the air-conditioning was not working.It was a sweatbox. It took 3 people and over 2 hours before it was confirmed that there was in fact a problem with the air-conditioning and apparently on the entire 4th floor!! It was again ,surprising to me, that there were still people occupying rooms on this floor, if that was the case. The hotel manager on shift was accommodating in offering another room and providing 3 choices but when your expectations and your plans for a night entailed the loft room and you were then sleeping in a one-bedroom suite that was probably a third smaller, had a small ‘queen’ bed instead of a king, a view of an air-conditioning unit and the back of a building, the lounge in the ‘lounge-room’ faced the door, the TV was in the corner without the ability to move it and this space was not at all conducive to ‘entertain or be entertained’ as advertised. The experience was utterly disappointing. To top this off when writing an email directly to the hotel about our experience , I had no response at all. No acknowledgment. Hence this post on Trip Advisor. Very unprofessional and poor customer service.~1~2~nan~2~nan~nan~2~nan

review_457746179~“BOUTIQUE LUXURY AT IT'S BEST”~We spent two nights here before Christmas on a last minute trip to Brisbane. As we hired a car from the airport we chose to use valet parking at the hotel which was always very efficient. What a grand old building. Quite unassuming from the outside but truly beautiful on the inside. We had a standard room which had been decorated luxuriously. Inside one wardrobe was a fabulous mini-bar. The bathroom was almost as large as the room and definitely had wow factor especially with the mirror. Breakfast was included on our package and although only continental, it was more than adequate with quite a few options available. This hotel oozes charm and luxury with great staff being an absolute bonus.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455160703~“Love something unique?”~In the midst of the ordinary, it's wonderful to discover the extraordinary. The New Inchcolm & Suites in Brisbane delights from the moment you step through its historic wooden doors. Renovated around two years ago, whoever the design team was, they did an excellent job. Colours, textures and exquisite finishes all ooze charm. And that's just the aesthetics! We were delightfully surprised with a room upgrade upon arrival as well as a complimentary bottle of sparkling attached to a helium "Happy Birthday" balloon as we happened to mention we were celebrating a special birthday.  We dined in the inhouse restaurant called Thomsons Reserve and I've just unearthed a new Brisbane favourite. The food was exceptional in flavor and presentation, service was impeccable and the value for money, an added bonus. Visiting Brisbane? This is a must. I'll be going back for sure!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454398826~“Small piece of luxury at the New Incholm hotel”~Our favorite place to stay in Brisbane. It's contained in an historic building that has such character. Each room is unique and interesting decorated in a combination of art deco and 1920's architecture. Most rooms have a beautiful soaking tub and shower. Beds are amazingly soft and the ultimate in comfort. Each room has a beautiful cabinet holding all the beverages they offer - a Nespresso maker, water, wine, drinks of all sorts. Nice wine glasses, coffee cups, a sink and fridge in there too! It's very unique and custom. The restaurant and room service is wonderful. Service provided throughout is attentive and exceptional.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_453423182~“Simply Divine”~From the moment you set eyes on the actual building you are impressed! The interiors are wonderful, everywhere you look the detail is just fantastic. The staff the night we visited were first class. Often staff can ruin a great place but not here. They really knew every element of the dishes, they didn't just drop food and wine off. We decided to do the tasting with matching wine. Simply divine as the title suggests. I cannot describe it, other than to say it takes a while and worth it for sure. We have not had such a polished experience in years. Makes me want to stay at the hotel, even though I live 10 up the road! First class.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452480989~“New Inchcolm, a new standard in hotels.”~Having stayed at the New Inchcolm we will find it very difficult to go back the normal corporate chain hotels. From the minute we walked in the door, were at home (or more precisely the home we would like to have). The decor is entrancing, the small attention to detail is everywhere. The room, the staff, the food, the bed and the bathroom were all excellent.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452300257~“I'm in love! ”~Work travel and I end up with an absolutely stunning, gorgeous room! And boutique accommodation with an intimate bar that is nice for an evening wine, friendly and relaxing. The building is just amazing, the staff have all been attentive, professional & so very pleasant! I can't wait to come again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452234020~“Enjoy!”~A lovely, boutique style hotel for those seeking something a little quieter and more intimate than larger city hotels. Friendly, approachable staff add a nice flavor. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast bar is a little disappointing in terms of choice.if you would like something additional such as poached eggs etc, this is additional.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452179474~“The New Inchcolm Hotel - Great Hotel”~The New Inchcolm Hotel is located close to the railway station and also close the Brisbane Queen Street shopping mall. It is a relatively small Boutique Hotel that is very well presented with top fittings and furniture. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The Hotel is extremely clean and very comfortable.  It was a pleasure to stay at the New Inchcolm and I would recommend to all if visiting Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451574466~“Barman is outstanding”~We booked a superior room but as we are Accor members we got an upgrade and late check out, the room was amazing and we didn't want to leave. The barman, Kingsley was outstanding, made the end of a good Saturday night a memory not to be forgotten (and who doesn't love Disney tunes)~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_451348260~“Outstanding accommodation in excellent location ”~Our travel agent did us proud with this one. An absolutely beautiful room, kindly upgraded for our honeymoon proved to be an excellent spot to explore Brisbane and beyond.  The bed was extremely comfortable,fantastic in room toiletries and just a real feel of class to the place.  We only ate breakfast ( a la carte a great menu, buffet looked lack lustre and average), but was nice. Very good coffee.  Shame any time we returned to hotel post 10pm bar shut so could not even wind down but we realised that most places shut early in Brisbane (we are from London so used to stuff being open all the time).  Front desk and valet service excellent. Could not fault it and really the place made our stay in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451329812~“Absolute pleasure”~The Inchcolm Hotel , what a pleasure,so many memories. Each room is beautifully detailed in Art Deco,and the staff is something from another era.We were made to feel we were valued ,and nothing was too much trouble .This is a very special place .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450015311~“Spectacular”~I and my partner felt like we had been transported back to a golden age, the art deco design was awesome right down to the lift. Was a nice way to start the year, staff friendly and professional. Room left us speechless it was so good, if I had to nic pick it was the remote for tv but minor concern. Do yourself a flavor and stay.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_449835929~“Overall good but improvements needed”~Such a beautiful boutique hotel. Loved the room - stunning. And split level living and bedroom was amazing. Reception staff were amazing and a pleasure to deal with. Really happy and really proud of their hotel. Improvements: 1) breakfast. Terrible. You should just stop doing it instead of the present offer. Buffet is so tiny, and for a continental breakfast not to even have croissants - something is seriously wrong! Charging for a À la carte menu on top of breakfast is misleading. The menu was also so un-inspiring. You have an opportunity to do something great here. Real cafe style. Breakfast staff were also quite uninterested - took over 15min to acknowledge and that was only upon me asking. 2) cleaning - bathroom/shower is starting to build mould on the stone tiles. Might want to review cleaning procedures I probably wouldn't return until the breakfast offer was revised.~4~4~3~5~5~3~5~nan
review_449457974~“wonderful”~Loved the idea of stopping in the city for the night after a long flight and it was a wonderful stay, longer would have been better. A very elegant stylish hotel to spend the night, the staff were very good and the whole set up was great and had a certain vibe about it.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_449441314~“Best hotel in Brisbane.”~Stayed here overnight for a mini-babymoon - by far the best hotel in Brisbane. Immaculate one bedroom suite, amazing decor (and a full tub), extra touches (congratulations balloon, luxe toiletries etc.), and professional staff who put you at ease and are happy to go out of their way to make your stay memorable. Parking was easy (valet at the door), and dinner was spectacular at the in-house Thompson's Reserve. 5 stars. We'll be back (when we can convince the grandparents to babysit...).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449032041~“Great experience”~We had stayed in this building as a hotel before McGallery took over and did their thing - what an amazing transformation. It is a stunning property, very quirky, elegant and really reminiscent of New York Art Deco styling. I can't fault the rooms and the food was delicious.  The only comment I have is that the service, whilst not bad, wasn't really at the standard of the property. We had to carry our own luggage (not a big thing) but the porter was there with the luggage trolley and didn't just take it for us. The breakfast staff were average. It was actually Christmas morning and there was no Christmas cheer - if in fact a little curt and then we were very surprised when they started noisily moving and rearranging furniture around us whilst we were still eating. The bar staff at night however were great and we really enjoyed our discussion and sharing whiskey knowledge. If Accor are setting McGallery as a boutique offering apart from their main brands they could do with a focus on their service to match the unique properties.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~3~nan
review_448173310~“Standard Setting ”~One of the most unique and incredible hotels I have ever stayed in. A boutique hotel vibe, intimate, private and indulgent experience executed by a fantastic / high-quality team of workers. A divine menu (indulge in the aged wagyu). Stay here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446637562~“Do yourself a classy favour!”~A delightful experience from the moment I checked in for 3 nights last week. It combines style, tradition, elegance to deliver a classy experience.  Genuine friendly professional staff always gave me a warm welcome and quality service. The location on Wickham Terrace overlooking the CBD is so convenient.  Great beds, quiet air-con, quality toiletries, immaculately clean. In-room Ipad and docking station was an added touch. I did not try the restaurant but it seemed very popular so I'm saving that experience for my next visit in 2 days time. And it is amazing who you bump into in the shower - enjoy a narcissistic moment !~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_444942040~“Boutique hotel close to the city”~I was going to give this hotel 5 stars, but as we've just returned from the USA and experienced very warm, friendly service, we felt the Incholm was lacking that attentiveness. However, if you are looking for a quiet, classy, small hotel, with an up market B&B feel, this hotel is brilliant. We loved our Queen bed suite, and we're very impressed with the coffee/tea making facilities.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444750544~“Rapidly Becoming my Favourite ”~This gem of a boutique hotel on the northern edge of Brisbane's CBD has rapidly become my favourite hotel of 2016 and the only place I stay in Brisbane. I love everything about this place. The welcome is always warm, the rooms beautifully furnished and appointed and the bar a welcome respite from the stress of your day. I've been lucky enough to try all the different types of rooms and have never been disappointed. Great food and room service too. There is no gym but you can grab a free pass and walk to the super gym down the road. I can't wait for my next stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443920209~“Stunning Suite & A Fantastic Stay”~I was able to check in early, thank you very much to the receptionist who checked me in, was offered assistance throughout my stay as I had dislocated my shoulder, had lunch at the restaurant and was seen to by a lovely gentleman attendant who also offered the chef to cut up my meals for me as well, the meals were absolutely delicious, the suite I booked online is stunning, spacious, walk in shower + bath tub, desk, a lot of light in the room, iPad - tech savvy hotel (love it), old school feel of the hotel but very modern decor, all interaction with staff was genuine, professional and very helpful. Free wifi, easy walking distance to Central Station, pharmacy, Woolworths supermarket and restaurants at Eagle Street Pier. Thank you all for a lovely stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441994150~“Brisbane sleeper”~What a hotel I certainly didn't expect a hotel like this in the heart of Brisbane's CBD. We arrived early and rooms were shuffled to fit us in. Staff on check in were young and sharp. Clean , edgey, innovative.... this place is a sensation. The architecture reflects Old Brisbane and renovations are beautiful . The elevator is a throwback to the turn of the century with modern safety combined. The rooms are large,beds massive and well appointed. Nice touches like a mini i Pad,expresso machine and the tastiest mini bar local snacks. The redzed chocolate covered peanut cookie is an outrage and should be banned it's that good. Any negatives....I did smack my head on the floating shower screen in the sensually lit bathroom during the night,but on regaining consciousness I put a small travel torch in the shower and survived until dawn. I would travel to Brisbane purely to stay at this hotel. Well played to all staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440562814~“5 Star Allrounder ”~We've had a very high success rate with M Gallery properties in Australia and New Zealand the The New Inchcolm was no exception. Nicely located on the fringe of the CBD, it's easy walking to Eagle Street Pier and Spring Hill (can highly recommend the Alliance Hotel) as well as the CBD itself. Service was great, very well designed and executed. Love the preservation of the historic hotel and the way they have seamlessly blended the new accommodation wing. The lift is ye olde worlde but a real highlight. The bed was on the softer side of firm but very comfortable and the bathroom was a fab design, modern, minimalist. Very tasteful decor throughout. The bar is small but equally well designed and a great place to enjoy a drink (and a cocktail). Excellent job all round and from memory good value. No hesitation in coming back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439995191~“Perfect!!! ”~Enjoyed our stay at Inchcolm! People at reception ( didn't get their names) were super friendly and smooth. Room was luxurious! Very spacious with impressive features! Bed was super comfortable and was super hard to get out of ;)!!! Bartender downstairs was super nice and looked like he truly enjoyed his job!!! 5 stars Plussss~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438996663~“Excellent hotel”~We stayed for one night here in October at the start of our holiday and were so impressed that we booked again for our last night in November. On both occasions all the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. They went out of their way to accommodate all our requests which was very much appreciated, particularly on our last day. For the 2nd stay we were upgraded to a suite which was very nice, however all the rooms appear to be beautifully and tastefully furnished with great attention to detail. We had breakfast on both occasions and enjoyed it each time. The hotel is quite well located for downtown and for Chinatown and Fortitude Valley. If you are looking for a stylish hotel with great staff we would definitely recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438693394~“Elegant luxury ”~My husband and I stayed here while visiting Brisbane for a night. We had previously stayed on our wedding night 9 1/2 years ago and we loved it then. Since then a lot of renovations have taken place but the elegance and luxury of the Inchcolm has definitely remained. The suite we stayed in was absolutely perfect! There was nothing to fault it and the coffee machine was a great touch. Perfect coffee! The staff were so professional, friendly and polite. We went out for tea but had breakfast at the hotel which was delicious. There was a huge selection of items to choose from with everything being fresh & beautifully displayed.  We can't wait to stay at the Inchcolm again, hopefully before another 9 1/2 years have passed.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438385038~“Nice experience”~The Hotel is just lovely, Restaurant degustation menu was very enjoyable and our waitress on the night was very good.

review_437649785~“Great Hotel and Great Location ”~Very comfortable room and hotel. Room is wonderfully appointed however bathroom in 402 is a little small - could have reduced the more than ample sized room with sitting area by a couple of metres and added that to the bathroom. Loys of old charm has been retained.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436958792~“Charming and Delightful”~Beautifully appointed room, plush bedding with a clean modern bathroom make this a delightful place to stay if you prefer something a little different.

review_436501730~“Style over substance!”~Spent three nights here and have to say the staff were fabulous ( which is why I've given it a VG rating. The hotel suffers from too much 'hi tech' equipment . Eg an IPad in the rooms which tells you 'what's what ' but ours didn't function so we had no idea about facilities etc. After travelling for 30 hours one doesn't want the hassle of things that don't function so we tried to ring the front desk only to find the phone was dead. The room temperature was too cold but the A C control wouldn't allow us to raise it from 19 degrees.We were on the 4 th floor and too tired to go down to reception. All in all a very frustrating arrival. Anyone staying are advised to take eyeshades if they are sensitive to overly light rooms at 4.30 a m. That said the breakfasts were terrific and although we didn't dine there the chef clearly was very good. All in all a disappointment which was saved a lower rating due to the quality of the staff.~4~2~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_436248631~“Classy and Comfortable”~The position of this hotel is excellent if you want to be right in the city. Our suite was quirky and comfortable, well equipped and very quiet, especially considering where we were.. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The mattress was so soft it almost wrapped itself around you. The staff were so attentive, friendly and helpful and the room service dinner and the breakfasts were lovely. Being an Accor plus member, we enjoyed the benefits that comes with this association including discount, half price meals, welcome drink and upgrade to a suite. We would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_435968045~“Most enjoyed hotel so far”~We had a date night at the Inchcolm and could not rate it highly enough. Our room was room 211 which is incredibly and tastefully decorated with some superb quirky pieces such as the cup and saucer lamp stand. The bathrobes were the biggest I have ever seen. The shower area was funky with a huge mirror IN the shower. The highlight had to have been the huge breakfast in bed. The chef in the restaurant has a great sense of taste and size portioning. The front staff of Lauren and Jeremy were very through and professional. The waiters were very attentive and quick with service and suggestions. The management must have a real skill in selecting staff as they all work with a cohesion not often seen in a 5 star hotel.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_434951559~“Wonderful romantic getaway”~Room was beautiful. The design and heritage room was like nothing I've ever seen or stayed in. Would recommend this hotel. Staff wonderful & helpful  Restaurant was very expensive  Parking was $40 per day Stay just amazing:)~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_434694920~“Elegant & classy boutique hotel”~This gorgeous boutique hotel is superb value for money. From the outside there is a Parisian feel and as soon as you walk in the door the elegance hits you. The location is perfect and the bar, staff and classy rooms are second to none. You will not be disappointed here. I will definitely be back.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434665575~“Fabulous boutique hotel in central Brisbane”~This hotel is really classy with tons of character. The service levels were exceptional, attentive and discrete at the same time - as an advantage plus member I was given a free upgrade to a huge queen size suite and the hotel staff accommodated my request for an early check in really well. The décor through out was immaculate - modern, fresh and luxurious although there are plenty of touches highlighting the history of the building including an amazing old style lift. The food in the restaurant was great (I had breakfast and some in room dinner). The hotel is central (across the road from the Sofitel) but quiet. I will definitely stay here again - certainly my favourite hotel in Brisbane (if not in Australia).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433789065~“The coolest hotel in Brisbane!”~I attended a conference here in October 2016 and the place will definitely be where I stay again next time in Brisbane.

review_430735958~“Must stay here in Brisbane”~We travelled to Brisbane for the opening of the Eagle Farm Racetrack in June. We were planning on staying at the Sofitel across the road, but that seemed to be full, and this Sofitel owned Hotel was recommended to us by the GM of Sofitel Queenstown. What a find! Beautiful Hotel, great bar & restaurant, historic building lovingly restored. If you're thinking about a base in Brisbane, this is it, easy walk to the Mall and transport~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_429826745~“Wonderful”~We had a near perfect stay at New Inchcolm. We let the hotel know we were celebrating a special occasion and they went above and beyond to make the stay memorable for us.

review_429019335~“Boutique Hotel”~The location is close to walk to the river walk area and also to the downtown core of the city and to the 'hop on/hop off buses'. We really enjoyed our stay here and found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was good, just tiny pieces of cheese to try to pick up. Our room was very nice and clean and a decent bed, but the bathroom design does leave a lot to be desired as it is an 'open concept' and hard to shower without getting all the floor wet. Also the taps on the sink are awkward to get water without spraying floor, and also getting it hot without it coming out in huge flowing action. Excellent coffee/tea facilities in the room as well.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_426934602~“Everything was amazing would go recommend to everyone”~Had dinner here tonight the service was amazing. Didn't have a booking, but luckily they were quiet. We had a drink at the bar and as soon as we mentioned we'd take a seat when they were ready they showed us to our seats straight away. The menu had something for every palate. The presentation of the food was perfect, the waiters and waitresses explained every part of the meal as they placed it in front of you so you knew what you were eating, we've frequented at The Ritz in London and never had such great service. All wait staff knew about all the wines on the menu and could give you informed assistance with your choice and whether it would go alongside your meal. I was with a friend from the UK who said he had never had such great food or service anywhere there, would highly recommend and will be back with more guests!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426621753~“Luxury Hotel”~It has taken 18 years but I have finally found my go to Hotel in Brisbane ! The New Inchcolm ticks every box and will be my Brisbane abode on all my future trips.

review_426512137~“Our stay at the Inchcolm could not have been better...”~After staying at the Inchcolm, it would be difficult to stay at any other hotel when visiting Brisbane. From the accommodations to the service, the experience was exceptional. The room had a modern decor and was very clean and well maintained. It was as if we were the first to stay in a brand new room. The attention to detail was impeccable.  We were staying in Brisbane to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. The staff made us feel very special providing a complementary bottle of champagne and a room upgrade. Many thanks to Lauren for providing us tips for touring Brisbane and making arrangements at the hotel we were staying at next on Hamilton Island.  The bar is well run with a good selection of beers and specialty drinks. In fact, my wife said the whiskey sour made by the Jordan Spieth look alike bartender was the best she ever had.  The continental breakfast had a number of fresh and healthy options. A great way to start the day. If staying in Brisbane, would highly recommend the Inchcolm for any occasion.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_426508648~“Elegant, gorgeous hotel in great location.”~We stayed in this hotel to attend a show at Qpac and though you could walk it, we caught a taxi, just $11.00. The hotel is heritage listed, New York style Art Deco and gorgeous. Beautiful rooms, lovely toiletries, great service. It is one of our favourite places anywhere to stay. Queen St mall is a short walk away, though up hill coming home. The service was very friendly and the valet parking was easy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere special. We will go back again. (See separate review for the restaurant).~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_425992610~“An unpretentious boutique hotel”~A hidden gem between the big Novotel and Sofitel hotels nearby. Well situated even though on first appearance it appears to be in the middle of nowhere. The main shopping centre is only about 7 minutes away, Central Station 5 minutes away but ask for directions instead of relying on Goggle maps. Room is furnished with all the essentials, including a Nespresso machine. Excellent service, with a special mention of the chamber maids. Down side? Not much apart from small gripes with the bathroom. The bathroom designer was aiming for minimalism rather then practicality eg, in the absence of a shower door water spashes everwhere; the vanity basin tap is either full on or off, a waste of water. And the mattress sinks in the middle if a couple sleep on it.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_425816988~“Stunning, calming and very stylish. ”~I had wanted to stay at this hotel for a while and can say it is worth every penny. I was given an upgrade to a loft room. Two levels of luxury. The interiors are lush and clean. Service from when I walked through the doors past the restaurant and into reception was faultless. The attentive and charming Sam checked me in and made sure I had everything sorted. The mini bar is well stocked, unlike a lot of hotels these days, and everything is a touch of a button, including block out curtains. Pillow menu. Massive TVs. Great bathroom products and robes. Will definitely be back and make sure my family and friends stay her.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_424881023~“Reinvention done with style and integrity”~The New Inchcolm has everything I look for in a hotel - architectural integrity, a strong sense of place, strategic location, a feeling of comfort and security, quality fitout, attention to detail, and either history or a new story worth telling.  The hotel's website will tell you the story about the building's history, however I was thrilled by the way it has been repurposed while retaining and celebrating original features. Old fashioned yet safely updated elevator - priceless! Timber paneling to die for, and a delightful bar and dining room. The room was gorgeous and the bathroom very cool (full sized mirror wall in the shower? Oh my.....) It's the kind of place you walk into and think 'I want to stay here forever'. Unless you want to live in a soulless monolithic bunker, in which case you should just move along and check into the Novotel.  I adored the New Inchcolm and it will be my hotel of choice in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424656020~“Great gem with nice service ”~A bit understaffed from my point of view, but still great service from the staff. Restaurant is amazing! Do get an Accor plus card before you there, especially if you are dinning as a couple. Location is great as well but the rooms are a bit small though.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424239331~“Recommended”~A very good experience indeed. The interior design is fab; lush indeed as someone called it in another review. There are some little drawbacks. It took me a few seconds to figure out how shower and water worked and also the lights. It would be useful to have instructions ;-). Some of the sockets in the room where I stayed (rm 204) did not seem to work although that was not a problem since there were enough that did. I managed eventually. Staff is friendly and accommodating but also can improve. The complimentary coffee capsules were brought quickly (but of course it would have been even better had room service not forgotten to refill them in the first place; also you would think that filling the water container for the coffee machine would be on the check-list.) I did not try the breakfast but the brekkie room is a gem ...  So overall, definitely a place I would try again. Even for a romantic get away ...~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_423947077~“Lush!”~Wonderful boutique accommodation that payed homage to the original features of the building while still keeping it modern and fresh.

Breakfast was well presented, tasty and well priced.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_423369990~“Not suitable for a business stay”~I usually stay at the Novotel next door which is the sister hotel to the New Inchcolm whenever I am in town and thought of trying it out due to the good reviews on TA. Unfortunately I would not be returning to the Inchcolm for the reasons below:  - No on-site parking. Your choices are Hotel valet for $40/day or side-street parking with a maximum parking time of 3 hours. (7AM - 10PM). Even though the sister establishment is next door, they can't even workout a parking deal together. This also reflects badly on the Novotel next door which I would have to think twice the next time I am in town as I went over to speak to the duty manager and was less than impressed with the manner of his reply.  - Shower pressure were low. - No complimentary wifi even as a silver accor member. I am sorry but at this day and age, failure to provide complimentary wifi just screams of the establishment trying to rip off customers.  - Breakfast was small which is acceptable due to the size of the hotel, however no hot food at all. Only cod slices and some cheese plus a few bread and cereal. Maybe it would be ok for the health conscious, but I rather have something filling to start the day. The bed was comfy and service staff was mostly courteous. Those are the only positives I could give the hotel.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_423174990~“Beautiful Boutique Hotel”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite in this beautiful Hotel earlier this month and thoroughly enjoyed our 5 night stay. The rooms are beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable, especially the beds. I loved the coffee machine in the suite, so wonderful to be able to make your own decent cup of coffee at any time of the day. The Bar area and restaurant were intimate and cosy with good service and food. I'll be back next time I'm in Brisbane. Julie~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_421932679~“Amazing little boutique hotel ”~This is the 2nd time we booked the 1 bed suite in this hotel and this time out friends also booked as we were visiting the Brisbane Festival. The design is McGallery by Sofitel and the finishes are just great. It's like quality old NY style. The beds are so comfortable and whilst the restaurant and bar are small, the staff are great and the food and drinks good quality. It's a little bit strange in that it sits on a corner, like a traditional old British pub maybe, so it's awkward when driving if you can't get stopped too long outside for the valet parking. It's a small price to pay however fora great hotel. Our friends who have worked at the Four Seasons internationally also loved it - and she's pretty hard to impress~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421611841~“Lovely property, housekeeping could improve”~We arrived at the hotel having driven from the Sunshine Coast and lunch on the River. It was late in the afternoon when we checked in. The building is beautiful and reminded us of arriving at an Arte Deco style hotel in London or Paris. The two bedroom suite was spacious, with an ultra modern bathroom which is the fantastic contrast one wants when in an older building. The colour scheme is fantastic and the coffee bar area called for a change a maxi bar was was well set out and pleasingly located in the room. All the decor was so well chosen and appointed. Great fabrics and colour scheme. The only let down was the house keeping. The bin in the bathroom was still full of rubbish and the drawer in the bedroom occupied by our daughter had rubbish in it as well. We went downstairs for a drink so I mentioned this especially to the young man at reception who just said, "sorry about that". No offer to have the bin emptied etc As it was only about 7pm this was achievable I would have thought.  We did not sleep well because the pillows on the bed were extra long and very firm  The sleeping pillows are kept in the wardrobe which we only saw in the morning. We had not taken the offer of the turn down service so did not realise that the pillows on the bed were for display only.  Breakfast was nice- great selection of quality teas and coffee.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
