review_478684340~“Weekend in the City”~Normally stay at a hotel but this looked a good deal on Qantas so gave it a try. Excellent from the front desk to check out all as per booking (wine bfast parking etc) Central city location excellent breakfast at Asana below. Rooms a bit dark but this seems to be the modern style. All clean and functional. Will stay again~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_478137675~“Modern and Good central location in the city”~Hotel is new and modern with the latest technology for curtains (self closing/opening by a button!) Rooms are just the right size.(not a shoe box) Had a mini kitchen which we didn't need and a little table. No complaints from me.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_478107642~“Whitsunday Event”~Great space in conference room, friendly staff and function manager of Capri by Fraser was very friendly, helpful and professional. The food was absolutely delicious! Catered for all foodies and I tried it all to my absolute satisfaction. Highly recommend. Compliments to the Chef also!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478098783~“Wonderful stay at Capri”~Staff were friendly and courteous. We arrived really early and they had a room ready and allowed us to check in early. Leisure facilities were modern and well equipped. We had wonderful complimentary canapés and drinks in the evening and the breakfast was good quality with plenty of choice. The room was comfortable and the shower (which can make or break or hotel for me) was fantastic - hot, powerful and plenty of room. Free WiFi, big television, free bottled water, and good quality coffee. The list goes on. Fabulous stay.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_477838373~“Modern, comfortable and affordable ”~I've stayed here a couple of times now; once of a business trip in 2015 just after the hotel had opened and recently with my wife over the easter period. I was impressed on my first stay, and again the second time! The hotel is well located in the CBD only a couple of blocks from the hustle and bustle of the mall, bars and restaurants (and casino if that is important to you). Only downside is the drop-off area accommodates 2 cars only so that could be an issue if you're arriving at a busy time. I've found the staff to be pleasant and helpful on both occasions; for example, on my recent visit they accommodated a late check out. The room itself is spacious enough for 2 people, with all of the amenities one would expect (eg, tv, desk, iron, kitchenette). The bathroom is also spacious and stocked with high quality finishes and soaps, etc. Asana, which is the restaurant attached to the hotel, does a nice breakfast; on my first visit, the options were exceptional, but on my recent stay these had lowered in quantity but certainly not quality. Capri by Fraser is now my "go to" hotel when visiting BNE for work or pleasure~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477325640~“Highly recommend this hotel”~Very well appointed hotel. Clean, quite and comfortable accommodation. Central location with nice spacious rooms. Staff were friendly and helpful. Had a couple of meals at the attached restaurant and would highly recommend it. Would certainly stay again if we visited the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477278763~“Stay Here! Great Location & Great Hotel!”~I'll definitely stay here again. The room was perfect except there wasn't enough natural light. The gym, sauna, steam room & pool were amazing. The staff are very accommodating. They also stand by their price guarantee of the cheapest rate.~4~5~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_477013813~“Great hotel in a top spot”~Fabulous hotel and great location.  Our flight arrived in Sydney at 7am and the hotel staff were so accomodating allowing us to check into our room straight away. We were in by 8am.  Had a beautiful buffet breakfast at Asana by Pete Evans and also desert and affogatos one night.  Could walk to south bank, queen street mall and eagle street pier so was really happy with the location of this hotel.  Clean and comfortable rooms.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_476682116~“Absolutely fantastic! ”~I am actually blown away at how great this stay was.  From the moment I checked in to when I checked out I couldn't fault it.  Room and bathroom were both great sizes and impeccably clean.  Comfy bed, equipped with in built powers outlets- this was a big plus.. I travel a lot and constantly have to move side tables and unplug lamps to charge my phone- a small detail I know but it's the little things right!  This hotel also had the best fitness centre I've seen.. and I've seen a few.  Modern equipment, boxing equipment and gloves provided, his and her steam and sauna rooms. Modern and clean change areas that also lead to the stunning indoor pool.  The food is next level, the restaurant Asana has an amazing selection of Paleo ( and some non paleo options). My dinner date was vegetarian and had a great selection to choose from.  My pork belly was spot on!  Another standout was the desert- def try the tasting plate.. or at the very least the pecan pie.  The staff were incredibly attentive and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was equally impressive, both paleo and non paleo options.  Although I stayed over a holiday weekend I always found I had my own space in the common areas, never over crowded and equally so never interrupted by noise in my room.  I would absolutely stay here again and would definitely look to stay at a Fraser hotel in other cities as well based on this experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476633940~“Modern and Sleek”~I stayed 3 nights in one of their Capri Club rooms. Located right at the top of the building on the 17th and 18th floors, these rooms are spacious (for city hotel rooms) modern and bright. Great service from the front desk staff on check-in, made sure I knew about all services and amenities available to me during my stay. Staying in one of the Club rooms, I enjoyed a buffet breakfast in a dedicated Club room. The hotel itself is well kitted out, with a sauna, pool, restaurant downstairs and a free to use laundry for those staying extended periods. Overall I found the room to be very comfortable, peaceful and quiet. The location of the hotel is great too, close to the Botanical Gardens, and the main shopping and lifestyle hub of Queen St Mall. My only issue with my stay (out of the control of Capri itself), was that due to the hotel being surrounded by commercial high-rises, there was a need to keep the curtains shut for privacy during business hours, as office staff in the surrounding building could see directly into my room. Beyond this little issue, my stay was fantastic, and I do intend on staying again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476628734~“Virtual windowless "panic rooms" with a substandard Club Lounge”~If you welcome a lack of vitamin D and a paid for "panic room" with near absence of windows (unlike the advertised photos) then this is the place for you. We originally booked the Club Room with Club Lounge access. The reception lacks sophistication and there was no offer to book in at the Club Lounge and be offered refreshments as they suggest. When walking into the Club Room on the 18th floor and turning to pull luggage through the door, one could be forgiven for virtually bumping into the bed itself. The photos on the website and booking sites are far from the reality. The only windows were two slim line windows by each bedside table; even the expectation of some city view or any adjacent building soon dissolved in what could best be described as a dogs box. On calling the reception to change rooms we were allocated (at an extra price) the last remaining one bedroom apartment 303 on Level 3. It has just one moisture laden window in the bedroom that is within the narrow atrium over the pool.The beauty of this is that you get the noise of people channelled into the room anytime from 6am-10pm. When we called reception the response was "are we trying to get sleep?" and were offered ear plugs. Truly it should be made into anything other than a room for guests. The pool itself was uninhabitable for anything but the likes of urinating children and it reeked of chlorine fumes indicating just this. Room 303 itself is nothing short of a panic room marred by sleep deprivation. The bath tub was the saving grace nice and deep, though with poorly positioned fixtures through the bathroom.The Club Lounge on the first floor has ceiling to floor windows but these are closed off to the outside with curtains. It was poorly supervised and for just one hour of evening service thoroughly neglected with no top up's to the food and no replacements to wine if that was consumed by guests as a whole. It is unfortunate for Pete Evans that his name is associated with the poor quality of food that is presented overall. Evening canapes one night acceptable the next under cooked and unremarkable with scrambled eggs for breakfast that barely saw a fork or whisk with separated yolk and raw whites amongst cooked and burnt sections. Overall this hotel is not recommended and particularly when there is a easily competitive selection of accommodation in Brisbane.~2~nan~4~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_476351182~“Reliable Comfort and Quality”~This was my fourth time staying at Capri by Fraser in Brisbane in the last year. It continues to deliver. The location is excellent, the rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Climate control is quickly responsive and I always get a good night's sleep. The bathrooms, and particularly the showers are excellent. Breakfast has been included in most of my stays and this is an added comfort that makes the morning go smoothly. Staff are young but have always been extremely polite and attentive to any needs. There are a number of utilities in the rooms (fridge, kettle, silverware, etc.) and a gym and pool that I haven't taken advantage of, so I can't comment extensively on them. Overall, I feel very comfortable in each of the different rooms that I've stayed, and given the competitive price, I would highly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_476307805~“Great City Stay”~We stayed here for one night after in between our cruise and catching a flight home. Great city location, close to everything. Staff were friendly and helpful. Nice clean, comfy room. Bed was comfortable. Not too far to the airport.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

So clean, rooms quite small but everything you need, from little kitchenette with microwave coffee machine and fridge. Bathrooms awesome with lovely toiletries bath robes and slippers. Had a club room...breakie included plus complimentary tea coffee etc throughout the day and an hour in the evenings including nibbles and drinks....awesome value for money. Quiet rooms and electric black out drapes......heaven~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475436669~“Very good stay”~Great location, staff at the check in desk were very helpful and friendly although I was a little frustrated at the check in time of close to 3 pm. The rooms are bright and fresh, comfortable beds and decent wardrobe space.The kitchen area is well equipped for a self service stay if you wanted. The bathrooms are really nice, excellent walk in shower and lovely and bright ( no makeup mirror though) Gym looked great, the self service wash and tumble dry machine are efficient and free. We tried the restaurant on two occasions for dinner and coffee, and whilst the food was fine, the service was laid-back bordering on slow - i'd be inclined to eat out in one of the many Brisbane restaurants in future. In short, my first time at a Capri and was very impressed and will certainly look for them again in the future.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_474813614~“Mini city break”~I couldn't really fault my stay without being picky Reception was quick friendly and informative. The Room was clean,smelt fresh bed was super comfy slept extremely well. Too well by the clock.  The Facility's was good gym,sauna,steam room,pool ect all clean and modern.  walk anywhere to mall shopping,restaurants,parklands or minutes to public transport or walk over bridge to Southbank. Perfect position. There is a nice restaurant in hotel by Pete Evans (Asana) we had brekky there which set us up for the day. Next time in Brisbane Capri will be first on my list for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474632364~“Good location”~This hotel was a good location for the solo/senior traveller. Even though the hotel is on a main street the traffic noise was minimal. Located near the Botanical gardens. Walk through these to the Goodwill Bridge (foot bridge) to the river, where there are many river cruises, pleasant walking and cafes. As a person who has no sense of direction it was so easy to find and such pleasant walking. The other direction from the hotel was the shopping mall and many more restaurants/cafes. The hotel was first class. Room spotless and comfy. The staff were all excellent, so helpful. The hotel restaurant food was very good (I had breakfast and dinner). The service excellent and friendly. It was expensive compared to UK prices but excellent value for Australia. Would stay at the hotel again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473373558~“Took pity on weary travellers...”~After a gruelling 24 hours flying from the UK how lovely to be greeted on arrival at 07:30 by a smiling and helpful receptionist. We were extremely grateful to be allocated a room immediately rather than waiting until about lunchtime. Perhaps they took pity on us because we looked like we had been in a tumble dryer!! Totally happy with our room, very clean, quiet, a comfy bed and great shower. I had chosen this hotel for it's position and was not disappointed. As first time visitors to Brisbane we found it to be well placed and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in the next 3 days. Used the pool to cool off after long days out. I did find it a bit cold but once swimming it was ok and having it to myself was a treat. Eagle Street Pier is only about 15 minutes walk with plenty of bars and restaurants and perfect with the river sparkling in the moonlight and bridge lit up. Southbank is a much further but we walked down and explored. The Botanic Gardens are a few steps away and good for a walk and water dragon spotting. Also went on a free tour of City Hall which was interesting plus a respite from the heat. Did not eat at hotel but the coffee was good, hard to find a duff coffee in Australia! Many thanks again to all the staff who were friendly and very helpful especially Concierges Lechlan and Chris who helped us with transfers. Liked Brisbane too, good atmosphere.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470408004~“Brisbane Getaway”~Fantastic hotel in great location. Close to everything. We stayed in a club room and were glad for the extra's that this inlcuded.

review_470378498~“Fantastic value for money for the product you receive”~The location was perfect, the staff were smart professional friendly and willing to help with every issue that arose. As I was there for a couples night to conclude our 22nd wedding anniversary , I was slightly let down by the fact that the sauna however this did not ruin the night and we were able to work with this as we see why it has been done that way. The room was very clean, perfect size and adequate for our needs and being able to book valet parking was a big bonus. We were disappointed with the breakfast as the sausages were very tough and the scrambled egg was tasteless similar to powdered egg. If you had your eggs made for you, then you would not of had this issue. We did make the staff aware and the manager spoke to us assuring they would rectify the issue as I would of not paid for the food we received as stated it was very disappointing. Would we go again? Yes we will and the value for money for the quality you get within the city has so far been the best value for money as we do normally stay at the Next hotel and the inchcolm as we do like to stay in high rating hotels. Thank you to the staff for making our stay injoyable and we will be visiting again, gaining another beautiful hotel to stay in the city. I would recommend this to anyone.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470192073~“Nice budget hotel”~We arrived at the hotel, to see if we could check in early, our room was ready,check in was so easy,went up to our room it was a nice room,nice bathroom, bed was comfortable, we stay in a club room, then we went down to the club lounge for canapés and drinks, the canapés were OK and drinks were good,the downside of the canapés not much choice,you should have a better selection of canapés to eat,have some more salad things, cheese and crackers, some more hot things,and you should extend it from 1 hr to 2 hrs like the other hotels do in brisbane, we woke up for breakfast next morning, it was a ok breakfast, should have more choice of fruit,more choice of Danish, more choice of sausage and some baked beans,I would stay back at this hotel because of the price,it only cost me $239 for one night in a club room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469798254~“Amazing experience !”~My husband and I booked a two-night at Capri by Fraser and decided to stay one more night.  The location is great - few minutes walk to Queen Street Mall and Southbank area in Brisbane. The staff were spot on. I don't remember their names, but there's was a thin girl with glasses, a blonde with braces, Lola and the manager Anapoura. They were all fantastic. There's was a small incident with the restaunrant, and they were great, including the manager of the restaurant on duty that evening. The rooms are very modern, new, neat, clean and comfy. We thought our first room was a bit too small, and the staff happily moved us to a bigger room. The breakfast on the Asana restaurant was really good, fresh fruits, great coffee. The chia pudding is amazing. We would definetely recommend to friends and stay with them again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_468444432~“Very impressed”~Came for a weekend in Brisbane to see some shows at the comedy festival, catch up with friends and have a little getaway. We like to avoid major hotel chains and stay at smaller places with a bit of personality and this place was an excellent choice. Got an excellent rate that included parking and an executive club level room with a late checkout and it was well worth it. The room is small and had no view despite being on the 18th floor, but it was modern and comfortable with an extremely comfortable bed and great shower (a massive plus). The gym was great and has thoughtful extras like cheap earphones for you to use (my headphones were flat and I was cursing just as I walked into the gym to see this nice surprise), and the indoor lap pool with a beautiful skylight was lovely. The steam and sauna rooms are a nice extra too. Checkin was friendly and quick. The club lounge was one of the best we've been to with an excellent array of drinks and tapas. The one hour service time is a little stingy though. Breakfast in asana was really nice. Would definitely stay again on our next trip up from the Gold Coast.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The rooms are slightly on the small side however they are very well decorated, the bathroom is also of a very good size and the beds aren incredibly comfy.  Upon arriving to the hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful and we were able to check into our room slightly early. The hotel has an impressive gym, indoor pool, sauna an steam room. I would 100% recommend the buffet breakfast which boats a large varied selection of foods to cater for all.

review_464888364~“Great location for a City visit - Great staff, clean rooms, close to Botanical Gardens.”~This was the first time I have stayed at this location and will be coming back. Picked this spot as we had a concert at the Gabba, Yes Adele.....Arrived Sat lunchtime, Valet parked the car $45. and left it there until pm Sun.  The rooms are nice with a tiny kitchen, so you can have a cuppa or take your own breaky.  The staff were very professional and friendly. The beds comfy, the buffet breaky at the Pete Evans Kitchen was busy but the food was great $20 for all you can eat breaky of organic bacon and eggs and sourdough, tea and coffee. A short walk to either Botanical Gardens, Queen St Mall, and $20 ride to the Gabba by Cab.  Yes all in all a Great stay.

review_463495855~“The best hotel of our road trip”~We have just completed a five week trip in Australia, staying in a variety of places, and this was probably our favourite hotel of the entire holiday. We stayed for three nights, our room was on the 15th floor and we heard little noise from outside, despite the central location and it being a weekend. The room was modern, spacious and clean, with a lovely bathroom fitted with mosaic tiling and sleek grey tiles. The room was serviced promptly every day. The location is brilliant allowing you to walk to the central shops and restaurants in one direction, or to the lovely botanical gardens, the riverside walkways and the riverside restaurants and bars in the other direction. The only negative was the expensive self-parking at 40 Aus. dollars per night and the underground car park was tight for two-way traffic. However the price is worth paying for the convenience of being right in the centre of the city and able to walk everywhere. We can't comment on the breakfast in the hotel as we preferred to go to local coffee shops instead. If we came back to Brisbane we would stay here again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463316463~“Great hotel”~Easy check in, good service, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, very clean throughout. Club room included canapes & drinks between 6-7pm which was pretty good. Breakfast downstairs was great, one of the better hotel breakfasts I've had, loved the Paleo smoothies, good to see a few different items to try.  Great location as well, would stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_463046014~“Beautiful Central Location”~Besides Asana Restraurant, our stay here was excellent. Great central location, concerierge service perfect and club room experience was sensational. Breakfast was quite bleak with selection, and although say eggs to your liking, it only served scrambled eggs. Sauna/Steam room was lovely however it is sectioned into male and female rooms. Pool was beautiful, although a little chilly for my taste. And the Bed was like a cloud!~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_462826987~“Stayed her by Mistake - what a find though”~Our flight was cancelled so Virgin Australia put us up here over night and I only wish it was for longer, but will definitely be back. Reception handled the amount of guests checking in all at once we such efficiency and the wait was minimal. The room was just gorgeous, clean and loved it. We headed down to the restaurant to get some well needed food and again did not disappoint. The only negative was that it was a fleeting visit but next time I am in Brisbane I will definitely be staying here.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_461037034~“Our second time!”~We were here for a weekend away to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed here last year also. Our experience was exactly the same.  The staff were amazing! So helpful.  The suite is very modern, clean and functional. Mini fridge, microwave, nespresso machine, comfortable king bed and a large ensuite.  The indoor pool (2nd floor) was refreshing. There is a sauna, steam room and a gym.  We love staying here because it's so close to everything. We park the car in the basement (extra cost) and there it stays for the whole weekend. Botanical gardens (market on Sunday), restaurants (every cuisine), shops, the Brisbane River and of course Southbank all within walking distance.  I would highly recommend Capri by Fraser to anyone and can't wait to come back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460991103~“Great room and staff”~I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference in Brisbane. My room was clean neat and very functional. The kitchenette was a welcome addition and my room was super quiet at night which was surprising since I was close to the elevator. The staff were excelent, polite and very helpful. I would return in a heartbeat.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460861408~“great place to stay in Brisbane”~IF you are looking for a convenient, very comfortable hotel to stay in Brisbane, then Capri by Fraser is a good choice. IT is well located in the city centre. The room was tastefully decorated, clean and adequate.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_460773219~“Amazing property ”~This hotel in new and funky. Everything is comfortable and clean. We had club access and enjoyed the nightly canapés and drinks. It's also a great quiet place to unwind and have a coffee. I'd like to thank Lauren who looked after us both nights. The Pete Evans restaurant Asana is fantastic for buffet breakfast. Can't fault this hotel~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460584660~“Quite ok”~Be careful with your toothbrushes, do not leave them out. And if you want them to clean your room leav the room before 10 o'clock. And when leaving to the airport use the shuttle service in hotel because it's cheaper than by train.~4~4~5~5~5~2~5~nan
review_460541322~“Great Hotel”~We booked this hotel fairly last minute for 11 nights as our Air BNB arrangements were cancelled by the owner last minute (beware!) It looked good from reviews and we were really pleased in the end that we did have to have a change of plan. We stayed 11 nights and it was an amazing location for everything. The recption staff were so helpful as I managed to come away without one of my medications and they found me a GP appointment that morning and had to make quite a few phone calls to pull that off. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are lovely. The little kitchenette is handy and there is room in the fridge to accommodate some of your own food and drink. Don't miss the opportunity for a stroll through the botanical gardens at the end of the road, they are spectacular. There is also Pete Evans' own restaurant within the hotel if Paleo is your thing. We tried it, not for us, but you shave to try everything once!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_458989819~“Nice with a few issues”~The hotel is modern, nice room, great bed and everything you want. Just watch out for the extra $40 for parking per night, also if you go down to the pool and use the bathroom you actually need your room key to get out of the bathroom!!!! Not sure how this complies with the building codes but you can get trapped in the bathroom with no way out, no way to call for help and the pool doesn't get a lot of use.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_458553591~“A comfortable city centre hotel”~We arrived after midnight and had a minor problem getting into the hotel- the doors were locked, only openable by a guest swipe card, we did eventually attract the night porter's attention and gain entry, but we did wonder how long we might have waited had he not been behind his desk. Once we checked in we found a very comfortable and well equipped room. The breakfast was good with a very wide choice of produce.~5~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

review_457960732~“Excellent Hotel”~Having stayed in Brisbane for work a few times, this is definitely the best paced we have stayed at. The room we had was sufficient enough in size. It was very clean and modern. We had a chance to use the pool, gym etc and found them excellent. The restaurant attached to the hotel, a Pete Evans restaurant, was incredible. Everything seems to be made from scratch, this was evident by the chefs who never seemed to stop preparing food, all day and night. It was well priced and would highly recommend it. Would 100% stay here again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

The room was quiet and easy to get a good night's rest. Staff were friendly and accommodating. This is my 2nd favourite hotel in Brisbane and I will definitely stay again. Only cons were how small the carpark is, very difficult you try and park. Also the check out service I received was very slow and could improve.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_457062836~“Best for business ”~We stayed on 12th floor(studio deluxe)..can't open blinds or you can read next doors computers. Very boxy...staff professional but detached.

review_456526256~“Great central location”~Modern up to date hotel at a reasonable city price in a central location in Brisbane within easy walking distance to the Queens Street mall and Southbank.

review_456295089~“Common Capri by Fraser”~I'm sure it was unique when it was conceived, but it's youthful staff lack the experience to bring your mind to ease over the simplest of concerns. The rooms are inconsistent, some are underwhelming and other are splendid.~3~3~4~2~2~3~3~nan
review_456064543~“Great location”~Stayed 4 nights in late January. Do not expect a grand hotel with big lobbies, lounges, bars, etc. - it is a 2 year old building, with basic facilities in a superb location in the centre of Brisbane. Our room was small but clean, well equipped, excellent bathroom and a comfortable king size bed. We had complementary access to the lounge on level 1 with soft drinks, coffee and snacks all day as well as a "happy hour" from 6 to 7 pm: warm snacks, antipasto and alcohol was available. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Restaurant facilities were available on the ground floor: Asana is a restaurant styled/themed (?) by Pete Evans the celebrity chef and paleo diet advocate. We had breakfast here every day: service and offering here was patchy. On Tuesday morning the kitchen was flat out preparing canapés and snacks for a function so that breakfast for guests was a secondary consideration. We run out of eggs, bacon, butter, cutlery, glasses, etc. - we noted TV cameras and a sign for My Kitchen Rules - no doubt this will look great on TV but our breakfast was very frustrating and disappointing as we constantly had to ask staff an they looked harassed and stressed about the requests.  The best part was the location: a short walk to my work for the 3 days and an easy stroll to the river, parks, lots of CBD venues and riverfront bars and restaurants. Convenience stores, chemist, banks, etc. were on the same street and Budget/Avis car rentals were across the road.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_456062222~“Great location!”~What a quaint hotel! I had a one night stay recently for a work trip & found this hotel to be super!  The staff at check in where so efficient & friendly which was a lovely start. The room is quirky & colourful & also has some really lovely touches.  The bathroom is spacious & the bathroom condiments spelt heavenly - I even took what was leftover which I never usually do. The sleep quality was pretty good too. I would definitely stay here again.

review_456035573~“Decent stay in the city”~My husband travels to BNE for business a lot and we often stay at Capri by Fraser. Rooms are small, but clean and well maintained. Downside was the rooms look into an office building so keeping the curtains closed all the time makes it feel even smaller and darker. The location is central to the CBD and makes it easy to get around. Staff are friendly and attentive.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_455786061~“Absolute Class!”~We had a room on the tenth floor with beautiful views. This place has not done anything on the cheap. Absolute class. The bed was spacious and very comfortable. The bathroom was amazing. Centrally located in the CBD. I will definitely be back. The only downside was paying $40 for parking your car there.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455334737~“Central and Clean!”~The hotel was really easy to find and access to the carpark was easy. We stayed in the Executive Studio on the 12th floor which had a great view down Albert Street to the heart of Brisbane. The room was lovely and clean just a little on the narrow side. The kitchenette was handy and the bathroom was great! The staff were always friendly and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable. We had breakfast every morning in the Asana Resturant and it was yummy! My son made use of the pool, sauna and steam room daily and the space was fantastic! Really happy with everything and would recommend anyone to stay here!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_454965231~“2 words”~Simply fantastic. Spent 2 nights in the capri before flying to London. Check in was a pleasure. Promt and friendly.  Reception staff are always very helpful from wifi problems to airport transfer.  The Paul Evans breakfast was nice. Bacon a little to streaky but paleo an added bonus as i follow this as a way of life. The lounge bar 6-7 was relaxing the buffet fresh and tasty and a good selection of alcohol.  Hotel facilitys are excellent, free use of washing machines and tumble dryers with detergent supplied free. The gym. Steam room, sauna and pool are all very clean well maintained. You dont really need to leave the hotel.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and i will be back.  My only gripe was. I was on the 18th floor and when the wind blew there was a metal on metal noise that woke me then kept me awake.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454779955~“Mostly ups - a couple of downs”~I stayed at this hotel a few times over the last quarter of 2016. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the beds are lovely. Sleep quality is A+ particularly if you have a room away from the lifts which have a very loud ding. Higher floors are also better to avoid traffic noise. Commitment to customer service is exemplary and responses to any minor matters are dealt with promptly. Now a couple of tips  1. The car park is terrifyingly tight. Unlike other reviewers I have not missed out on a place but navigating the micro spaces in that car park is not for the faint hearted. Also the communication between the booking system and staff who check parking during the night seems to be faulty. I have arrived back to my car on several occasions to find a note under the windscreen wiper advising I am not authorised to park and to see reception as they have my car registration details. The regularity of this occurring is annoying. 2. The restaurant is not that good. Service is very slow if you dine in and my room service experiences have been patchy. Don't bother with breakfast. There are plenty of good cafes in the area. 3. There is only room for two cars in the set down area at the front. One night I drove around the block 6 times because cars are not moved promptly out of that space. There should be a staff member out there at busy times because not everyone is considerate. Two spaces for a hotel is just not enough and there is nowhere else on that busy street to pull in. In all a good experience and recommended if you can be brave about the car park. Some of the best value for money accommodation in Brisbane. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454753103~“Home away from home”~I love the Fraser chain! This hotel is so central to the city and shopping, as well as a short walk to Eagle St Pier precinct or Southbank. The rooms are funky and spacious. I LOVE the gym, pool and steam rooms - it's the primary reason I stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454652781~“Small room, big breakfast”~Good location near the Botanical Gardens for some fresh air and space. The walk from the Airtrain at Central Station is fortunately down hill and takes about ten minutes. My room did not face the river and was small, with a linear kitchen (with coffee machine and microwave), a long table and chair for computer work but no space for any other chair. The bathroom is well equipped and the shower was great.  The Pete Evans cafe downstairs provided excellent breakfasts and I also had a good dinner there.  Staff were helpful and friendly.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~5~4~nan
review_454604367~“Home away from home”~Having stayed at least six times in the past six months, we feel we have experienced all the highs and lows and would still happily recommend it to others. The highs: 1. A great place to stay if you are doing business in Brisbane. Rooms are comfortable, modern and spacious and when sleep is the priority, the block out curtains and fabulous bed are great. 2. Staff are welcoming and friendly. 3. Wifi is free and reliable.  4. Great location  5. Indoor pool is lux  6. The spin and play concept, where you can pop your washing on for free while working out or going for swim is a wonderful service. Powder, machine and dryers all available for guest use. So great for long stays  The lows: Firstly - we understand the following things are completely out of the control of front desk staff and the criticism is not directed at them. They are suggestions for management to consider.  1. If you are staying more than two nights, a $300 hold is placed on your credit card. We literally live out of our suitcases and this is the steepest holding fee we have experienced anywhere in Australia. Most hotels recognise that if they have an imprint of your card, it is not like you can run off without paying for things and if they must take something, surely $100 is enough. To add to the inconvenience, it took more than a week last time for the holding fee to be released. 2. Two out of the six times we have stayed, the indoor pool has been out of action. Over the Christmas break, it was closed for several weeks. I completely understand unavoidable maintenance but the pool is on all their brochures and is a key selling point. I feel like guests should be advised before paying if it is closed, particularly during the summer months and free breakfast or something similar should be offered. 3.The car park is impossibly tight and is nearly always booked out despite costing a whopping $40 per night. During one stay, we had to park illegally on the footpath with several other vehicles until the cars were moved to another park a few blocks away. Again, no criticism of the way this was handled by the staff - they went out of their way to help in what I'm sure was a stressful situation but clearly it's an issue which needs to be looked at. Paying the $5 extra for valet parking. It is worth it!  4. Stay well clear of the lifts. Our most recent stay was great because we were at the far end of the corridor and couldn't hear a thing. During a previous stay we were woken every time the "ding" and the sound of doors opening could be heard throughout the night.  Overall, it is a great place to stay. It's just unfortunate that the staff are occasionally let down by things beyond their control.  We will be back.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_454191614~“Wonderful Stay, highly recommended”~The hotel is easily accessible, close to everything, bright and well presented. Funky Foyer, loved it! The staff were wonderful, ever helpful and the rooms were lovely. Very spacious and comfortable. I didnt have much of a view (unless you count watching people doing office work a view) but I'm sure if you were on the good side of the building it would have been decent from 15 floors up :) All in all, a fantastic hotel which I will highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_479325238~“"Funky, modern and well equiped for a great stay!"”~This is a fantastic modern hotel that is centrally located in Brisbane. I really enjoyed having a swim in the reasonably heated pool and appreciated the hot steam room and sauna to rest my tired muscles after a long flight. The restaurant on site has a paleo inspired menu which suited me just fine thank you Pete Evans! Overall a great stay if there is any critic for this relatively new hotel I would say book a bigger room as the standard deluxe is a bit small to move around the bed and gain easy access to the desk and your suitcase.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_479318490~“Everything you expect in a top hotel”~Tripadvisor reviews suggested a stay here should be good and expectations were indeed met and even exceeded. The extra cost of a Club stay was totally worthwhile in providing personalised check-in in the lounge, evening drinks and canapés and and an enjoyable breakfast at Asana (including barista coffee). A request for a quiet room (with a view) was met and staff were friendly at all times. Capri by Fraser is a great place to stay in a handy CBD location.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_479032528~“Modern hotel in a great location ”~Capri staff are extremely efficient and friendly. Our room was ready at 10am as they were expected our early arrival. Our request for a Midday checkout three days later was also handled without fuss. Our studio suite was clean, quiet, well appointed and very comfy if a little on the small side. The view was of a neighbouring office tower so we had to keep our curtains drawn for privacy during business hours. The location of the hotel meant that we could walk to every place we needed to go or to public transport options. Breakfast and meals at Asana by Pete Evans were all excellent.

Leisure facilities were modern and well equipped. We had wonderful complimentary canapés and drinks in the evening and the breakfast was good quality with plenty of choice. The room was comfortable and the shower (which can make or break or hotel for me) was fantastic - hot, powerful and plenty of room.

review_477838373~“Modern, comfortable and affordable ”~I've stayed here a couple of times now; once of a business trip in 2015 just after the hotel had opened and recently with my wife over the easter period. I was impressed on my first stay, and again the second time! The hotel is well located in the CBD only a couple of blocks from the hustle and bustle of the mall, bars and restaurants (and casino if that is important to you). Only downside is the drop-off area accommodates 2 cars only so that could be an issue if you're arriving at a busy time. I've found the staff to be pleasant and helpful on both occasions; for example, on my recent visit they accommodated a late check out. The room itself is spacious enough for 2 people, with all of the amenities one would expect (eg, tv, desk, iron, kitchenette). The bathroom is also spacious and stocked with high quality finishes and soaps, etc. Asana, which is the restaurant attached to the hotel, does a nice breakfast; on my first visit, the options were exceptional, but on my recent stay these had lowered in quantity but certainly not quality. Capri by Fraser is now my "go to" hotel when visiting BNE for work or pleasure~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Had a beautiful buffet breakfast at Asana by Pete Evans and also desert and affogatos one night.

review_476682116~“Absolutely fantastic! ”~I am actually blown away at how great this stay was.  From the moment I checked in to when I checked out I couldn't fault it.  Room and bathroom were both great sizes and impeccably clean.  Comfy bed, equipped with in built powers outlets- this was a big plus.. I travel a lot and constantly have to move side tables and unplug lamps to charge my phone- a small detail I know but it's the little things right!  This hotel also had the best fitness centre I've seen.. and I've seen a few.  Modern equipment, boxing equipment and gloves provided, his and her steam and sauna rooms. Modern and clean change areas that also lead to the stunning indoor pool.  The food is next level, the restaurant Asana has an amazing selection of Paleo ( and some non paleo options). My dinner date was vegetarian and had a great selection to choose from.  My pork belly was spot on!  Another standout was the desert- def try the tasting plate.. or at the very least the pecan pie.  The staff were incredibly attentive and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was equally impressive, both paleo and non paleo options.  Although I stayed over a holiday weekend I always found I had my own space in the common areas, never over crowded and equally so never interrupted by noise in my room.  I would absolutely stay here again and would definitely look to stay at a Fraser hotel in other cities as well based on this experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476633940~“Modern and Sleek”~I stayed 3 nights in one of their Capri Club rooms. Located right at the top of the building on the 17th and 18th floors, these rooms are spacious (for city hotel rooms) modern and bright. Great service from the front desk staff on check-in, made sure I knew about all services and amenities available to me during my stay. Staying in one of the Club rooms, I enjoyed a buffet breakfast in a dedicated Club room. The hotel itself is well kitted out, with a sauna, pool, restaurant downstairs and a free to use laundry for those staying extended periods. Overall I found the room to be very comfortable, peaceful and quiet. The location of the hotel is great too, close to the Botanical Gardens, and the main shopping and lifestyle hub of Queen St Mall. My only issue with my stay (out of the control of Capri itself), was that due to the hotel being surrounded by commercial high-rises, there was a need to keep the curtains shut for privacy during business hours, as office staff in the surrounding building could see directly into my room. Beyond this little issue, my stay was fantastic, and I do intend on staying again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476628734~“Virtual windowless "panic rooms" with a substandard Club Lounge”~If you welcome a lack of vitamin D and a paid for "panic room" with near absence of windows (unlike the advertised photos) then this is the place for you. We originally booked the Club Room with Club Lounge access. The reception lacks sophistication and there was no offer to book in at the Club Lounge and be offered refreshments as they suggest. When walking into the Club Room on the 18th floor and turning to pull luggage through the door, one could be forgiven for virtually bumping into the bed itself. The photos on the website and booking sites are far from the reality. The only windows were two slim line windows by each bedside table; even the expectation of some city view or any adjacent building soon dissolved in what could best be described as a dogs box. On calling the reception to change rooms we were allocated (at an extra price) the last remaining one bedroom apartment 303 on Level 3. It has just one moisture laden window in the bedroom that is within the narrow atrium over the pool.The beauty of this is that you get the noise of people channelled into the room anytime from 6am-10pm. When we called reception the response was "are we trying to get sleep?" and were offered ear plugs. Truly it should be made into anything other than a room for guests. The pool itself was uninhabitable for anything but the likes of urinating children and it reeked of chlorine fumes indicating just this. Room 303 itself is nothing short of a panic room marred by sleep deprivation. The bath tub was the saving grace nice and deep, though with poorly positioned fixtures through the bathroom.The Club Lounge on the first floor has ceiling to floor windows but these are closed off to the outside with curtains. It was poorly supervised and for just one hour of evening service thoroughly neglected with no top up's to the food and no replacements to wine if that was consumed by guests as a whole. It is unfortunate for Pete Evans that his name is associated with the poor quality of food that is presented overall. Evening canapes one night acceptable the next under cooked and unremarkable with scrambled eggs for breakfast that barely saw a fork or whisk with separated yolk and raw whites amongst cooked and burnt sections. Overall this hotel is not recommended and particularly when there is a easily competitive selection of accommodation in Brisbane.~2~nan~4~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_476351182~“Reliable Comfort and Quality”~This was my fourth time staying at Capri by Fraser in Brisbane in the last year. It continues to deliver. The location is excellent, the rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Climate control is quickly responsive and I always get a good night's sleep. The bathrooms, and particularly the showers are excellent. Breakfast has been included in most of my stays and this is an added comfort that makes the morning go smoothly. Staff are young but have always been extremely polite and attentive to any needs. There are a number of utilities in the rooms (fridge, kettle, silverware, etc.) and a gym and pool that I haven't taken advantage of, so I can't comment extensively on them. Overall, I feel very comfortable in each of the different rooms that I've stayed, and given the competitive price, I would highly recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_476307805~“Great City Stay”~We stayed here for one night after in between our cruise and catching a flight home. Great city location, close to everything. Staff were friendly and helpful. Nice clean, comfy room. Bed was comfortable. Not too far to the airport.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_475737855~“Wedding Anniversary Weekend”~This place is awesome from the get go. Friendly professional fun staff. So clean, rooms quite small but everything you need, from little kitchenette with microwave coffee machine and fridge. Bathrooms awesome with lovely toiletries bath robes and slippers. Had a club room...breakie included plus complimentary tea coffee etc throughout the day and an hour in the evenings including nibbles and drinks....awesome value for money. Quiet rooms and electric black out drapes......heaven~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475436669~“Very good stay”~Great location, staff at the check in desk were very helpful and friendly although I was a little frustrated at the check in time of close to 3 pm. The rooms are bright and fresh, comfortable beds and decent wardrobe space.The kitchen area is well equipped for a self service stay if you wanted. The bathrooms are really nice, excellent walk in shower and lovely and bright ( no makeup mirror though) Gym looked great, the self service wash and tumble dry machine are efficient and free. We tried the restaurant on two occasions for dinner and coffee, and whilst the food was fine, the service was laid-back bordering on slow - i'd be inclined to eat out in one of the many Brisbane restaurants in future. In short, my first time at a Capri and was very impressed and will certainly look for them again in the future.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_474813614~“Mini city break”~I couldn't really fault my stay without being picky Reception was quick friendly and informative. The Room was clean,smelt fresh bed was super comfy slept extremely well. Too well by the clock.  The Facility's was good gym,sauna,steam room,pool ect all clean and modern.  walk anywhere to mall shopping,restaurants,parklands or minutes to public transport or walk over bridge to Southbank. Perfect position. There is a nice restaurant in hotel by Pete Evans (Asana) we had brekky there which set us up for the day. Next time in Brisbane Capri will be first on my list for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474801627~“Staff were greet”~Only stayed one night but would have loved to stay longer. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs which was greatly appreciated. The club lounge was lovely, with very yummy food and great wine. Rooms were very nice and tidy. Would stay again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474632364~“Good location”~This hotel was a good location for the solo/senior traveller. Even though the hotel is on a main street the traffic noise was minimal. Located near the Botanical gardens. Walk through these to the Goodwill Bridge (foot bridge) to the river, where there are many river cruises, pleasant walking and cafes. As a person who has no sense of direction it was so easy to find and such pleasant walking. The other direction from the hotel was the shopping mall and many more restaurants/cafes. The hotel was first class. Room spotless and comfy. The staff were all excellent, so helpful. The hotel restaurant food was very good (I had breakfast and dinner). The service excellent and friendly. It was expensive compared to UK prices but excellent value for Australia. Would stay at the hotel again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474496611~“Perfect to unwind”~Perfect small boutique hotel for a girls weekend. Highly recommend the steam and sauna rooms. Luxury feel and comfortable beds. Great service at reception and at breakfast in the restaurant. Walking distance to restaurants on the river and botanical gardens. Very clean.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474477040~“Great Location”~We stayed two nights. We were able to enjoy walking to the Botanic Gardens and to catch the City Hopper. Also good buffet breakfast included in our deal. The hotel was quiet and sleeping​was good. Service was very good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474449319~“Half good half not”~We were a bit deceived by pictures of this place. Our room was very very small however was nice. Staff were nice and everything I guess we were just dissapointed by the size of the room and looking directly into a business building.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473373558~“Took pity on weary travellers...”~After a gruelling 24 hours flying from the UK how lovely to be greeted on arrival at 07:30 by a smiling and helpful receptionist. We were extremely grateful to be allocated a room immediately rather than waiting until about lunchtime. Perhaps they took pity on us because we looked like we had been in a tumble dryer!! Totally happy with our room, very clean, quiet, a comfy bed and great shower. I had chosen this hotel for it's position and was not disappointed. As first time visitors to Brisbane we found it to be well placed and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in the next 3 days. Used the pool to cool off after long days out. I did find it a bit cold but once swimming it was ok and having it to myself was a treat. Eagle Street Pier is only about 15 minutes walk with plenty of bars and restaurants and perfect with the river sparkling in the moonlight and bridge lit up. Southbank is a much further but we walked down and explored. The Botanic Gardens are a few steps away and good for a walk and water dragon spotting. Also went on a free tour of City Hall which was interesting plus a respite from the heat. Did not eat at hotel but the coffee was good, hard to find a duff coffee in Australia! Many thanks again to all the staff who were friendly and very helpful especially Concierges Lechlan and Chris who helped us with transfers. Liked Brisbane too, good atmosphere.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_472424612~“Bussiness trip”~I stayed two nights at the hotel the service and the staff were great. The price is very reasonable for the location. Walking distance to every attraction.  My only issue was someone was smoking on my floor and the smell woke me up at 1 am and by 4 am I had to call the front desk .  They tried to spray my room which helped but it made for a very uncomfortable stay so we checked out and stayed at another place.  I know there was not much they can do when people decide to break the rules.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472021417~“Central location, less than 5 min walk to Brisbane CBD! Stayed here twice and we will be back :)”~My husband and i have stayed here twice now and love coming back.  It is so centrally located! A short walk to Queen Street Mall and all their shops, cafes and restaurants. However, Pete Evans 'Asana' restaurant is right downstairs, so we did not have to go far for a great meal! The included breakfast was great and plentiful! My husband enjoyed the bacon and eggs and i loved the yogurt and muesli.  Rooms are modern, the bed is sooooooo comfortable and it was very quiet! I had the best sleep!  You also wake up to a great cup of coffee as each room has a Nespresso machine.  Looking forward to our next weekend away!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471341920~“Great location and facilities - loads nearby”~In the CBD and about a mile away from the Wheel - about 15-20 minute walk. Great location with plenty to eat and drink close by - hotel has nice pool and Gym facilities. Also washing and drying available to use and you can relax playing games consoles whilst you wait .... which may be a long time as the dryer was playing up.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_470681949~“Outstanding Hotel! Best Value!”~I was very happy with the staff, the room, the food, and the spa, sauna etc. It was nice to wake up to a beautiful buffet breakfast that had high quality, fresh food. In fact, Capri by Fraser doesn't skimp on anything. I loved the quality of everything. Very reasonably priced too. This is a very enjoyable hotel to stay at and I will definitely be back!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470408004~“Brisbane Getaway”~Fantastic hotel in great location. Close to everything. We stayed in a club room and were glad for the extra's that this inlcuded. Drinks and canapes in the evening and breakfast in the club lounge. Rooms are nice and modern and the bed and pillows are soooooo comfy.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470378498~“Fantastic value for money for the product you receive”~The location was perfect, the staff were smart professional friendly and willing to help with every issue that arose. As I was there for a couples night to conclude our 22nd wedding anniversary , I was slightly let down by the fact that the sauna however this did not ruin the night and we were able to work with this as we see why it has been done that way. The room was very clean, perfect size and adequate for our needs and being able to book valet parking was a big bonus. We were disappointed with the breakfast as the sausages were very tough and the scrambled egg was tasteless similar to powdered egg. If you had your eggs made for you, then you would not of had this issue. We did make the staff aware and the manager spoke to us assuring they would rectify the issue as I would of not paid for the food we received as stated it was very disappointing. Would we go again? Yes we will and the value for money for the quality you get within the city has so far been the best value for money as we do normally stay at the Next hotel and the inchcolm as we do like to stay in high rating hotels. Thank you to the staff for making our stay injoyable and we will be visiting again, gaining another beautiful hotel to stay in the city. I would recommend this to anyone.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470192073~“Nice budget hotel”~We arrived at the hotel, to see if we could check in early, our room was ready,check in was so easy,went up to our room it was a nice room,nice bathroom, bed was comfortable, we stay in a club room, then we went down to the club lounge for canapés and drinks, the canapés were OK and drinks were good,the downside of the canapés not much choice,you should have a better selection of canapés to eat,have some more salad things, cheese and crackers, some more hot things,and you should extend it from 1 hr to 2 hrs like the other hotels do in brisbane, we woke up for breakfast next morning, it was a ok breakfast, should have more choice of fruit,more choice of Danish, more choice of sausage and some baked beans,I would stay back at this hotel because of the price,it only cost me $239 for one night in a club room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469798254~“Amazing experience !”~My husband and I booked a two-night at Capri by Fraser and decided to stay one more night.  The location is great - few minutes walk to Queen Street Mall and Southbank area in Brisbane. The staff were spot on. I don't remember their names, but there's was a thin girl with glasses, a blonde with braces, Lola and the manager Anapoura. They were all fantastic. There's was a small incident with the restaunrant, and they were great, including the manager of the restaurant on duty that evening. The rooms are very modern, new, neat, clean and comfy. We thought our first room was a bit too small, and the staff happily moved us to a bigger room. The breakfast on the Asana restaurant was really good, fresh fruits, great coffee. The chia pudding is amazing. We would definetely recommend to friends and stay with them again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469794564~“Excellent service”~The service from we entered the hotel until we left was amazing. The staff was so friendly, and they have the best hotel breakfast you can ever get.
