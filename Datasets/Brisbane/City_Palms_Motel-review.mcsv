review_471845278~“Good Value”~Stayed five nights - booked single room but was given a triple at the rear with a small outside space. Room was clean and had double plus single bed but still plenty of room. Hotel is 10 mins walk from Fortitude Valley station and 25 mins from the CBD. Plus points : Kitchen area with sink, microwave, kettle, toaster, crockery.  Iron and ironing board  Free wifi which worked OK  Good aircon Minus points : Small bathroom but everything worked OK  Walls are thin so could hear next door occupants snoring  Noise from the car park in early morning  Overall, a reasonable hotel for what it cost. Staff are very helpful even if the building itself is showing signs of wear and tear. Very close to the pubs and clubs of Fortitude Valley.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_467429676~“It's a dump”~Don't bother staying here.The rooms are small snd shabby and it's noisy all night from traffic and other guests. It's a very old building and is poorly maintsined.We have stupidly stayed here twice but never again. ..~1~nan~1~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_462889136~“SO DISAPPOINTING”~Overall a very disappointing experience. Small annoyances: remote and a/c control didnt work, cold drinks machine did not dispense cold drinks, no snack machine either. A bit difficult to navigate the hotel with heavy suitcases, going up and down stairs, dodging corners etc. BIG ISSUES: the room was covered in dust, my asthma went over the roof. Dust, weevils, and cobwebs everywhere, even hanging from the walls and the ceiling. Couldn't connect to wifi anywhere in the room either. Spent one night there, when i mentioned the problems to the receptionist in the morning, the reply was "oh, well, sorry". Never going back!!!~2~1~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_454401368~“ALL YOU NEED IS CITY PALMS!!”~25 minutes by foot to the CBD, the City Palms Motel is the best choice in the middle-low range of price. The rooms are like a sort of apartments with private bathroom and private kitchen (with kitchenette, microwave and fridge). The wi-fi service is only available in the common space in the garden. Amazing staff!! Supernice and friendly!!~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_443632786~“Still great value”~I haven't been here in a few years and after last week's visit I'm glad it's just as fine as ever. For the price ( under $100 in Brisbane is very hard to find) it's fantastic - there's a small serviceable kitchenette if you don't want to head out for dinner, and the bed is clean and comfortable. Yes, it's basic, but the wifi is a fabulous extra. The other big plus is the super friendly staff, they go out if their way to make things run smoothly.  A word of caution though - if you have mobility issues this is not a good place, lots of steps, no lifts.  I'll be back.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_434203022~“Absolutely disgusting”~Stayed at the city palms for one night while attending some training in Brisbane, and I have never experienced such a poor hotel/motel in my life!! Upon arrival the staff were very rude and unwelcoming, there was an argument regarding the security deposit after he requested cash money and I had a feeling straight away there was going to be issues. When I got to the room it smelt old and stale, there was mould and dust everywhere the kitchen was foul and black, opened up the bathroom and had a very strong smell of bleach but mould everywhere and what looked like blood on the wall. I thought to myself it only one night just deal with it. Checked out in the morning by dropping key in the box. Now two weeks later I am being told I broke a door and the deposit money will not be refunded! This is obviously not the case as I treated the room with as much respect as possible even cleaned up my rubbish as I left. I would not recommend anybody to stay here unless you want the same dramas.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428959878~“Bedbugs nightmare”~We arrived at the motel in the evening, the manager helped us quite nicely. When we arrived in our room there was a towl from the previous guest. The kitchen in the room is black instead of white. I wouldnt recommend turning on the ceiling fan... because u will be covered in pieces of dust/grey/black stuff. The curtains in the room that are hanging above your head are brown instead of the colour it should be. Our neighbour was friendly enough to greet us... with his crackhead... all doped up!!! Making noise, scratching his face open.  But this was nothing compared to the nightmare when we tried to go to sleep... we found bedbugs!!!! Many of them!!! After being bitten... and checking the bed completey... we hurried up and packed our suitcases again and phoned the manager! We wanted to leave and go to another hotel and get a refund. When the owner arrived... he first said there were no bedbugs.. then suggested we brought them in... and only after pointing them out in the room... we could leave and get a refund.  STAY AWAY!!! DONT GO HERE!!!  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_398331964~“Cheap inner city”~Close to Brisbane CBD but in a shady neighborhood, blighted by heavy traffic volumes -Rental cost was cheap but with $15/ night added onsite car accommodation- better to arrive via rail, Very difficult to get in {or out} of shuttered driveway by car when checking in- arrive early in day after peek. Rooms shabby but with most items including some crockery an glassware. Stipulation over party embargo (you sign a pledge) but our last night was marred by an assumed drunken tenant next door who slammed unit and shower doors at midnight with such force that the wall of our room shuddered. Gritty location but some security offered inside. Free wi-fi as not extant, o slow to be unusable or measurable~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_397124023~“Great location, noisy and cold, but cheep.”~We stayed at this motel for 3 days, and the staff was very helpful. The rooms were dark and cold, which made us freeze at night. There was free wifi, but the signal at our room was very poorly. The router was placed in the back at the motel, and we didn't bother to go sit there. There was a kitchen, so we were able to cook, and cool our food in the fridge. The price was good, so you can say that you get what you are paying for.~2~nan~nan~2~2~nan~4~nan
review_396424110~“3 nights in the cheaper room ”~Very good position, 10 minutes walk of the nightlife, and near to the city by walk (30 minutes). There is exterior spa, not very warm, but ok.  The room is very small, and without Windows !! (Smell humidity a lot, every times).  Same Linen during 3 nights, no one changed somethings (cloth, towel, sheets...) there is no sponge for wash the dishes !  I agree, it's very cheap (50$/night), but I would not return, i prefer pay 10 or 20 dollars more for get something better.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_394533850~“Great location.”~Second visit to this property and whilst the service remains on top for a three star property, unfortunately this time the room cleanliness and attention to the basics did not. The bathroom was scrubbed within an inch of it life (keep in mind it is an early 2000''s refurb) as were the floors. Unfortunately the stuff in the kitchen needed washing before I could use it. The microwave was also needing a clean. There was only enough plate, soup bowl, coffee cup, teaspoon, just for one.  I am someone looking for value, but want things at a decent standard, so will have to think about going back.~3~nan~5~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_383097634~“Thumbs up for City Palms!”~Wayne and his lovely staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Excellent location and parking facilities. As a flight attendant in the service industry I can sniff good and bad service from a mile away but this motel definitely ticks the box of pleasant and appealing. I would recommend this accommodation to anyone and I would certainly stay here again myself.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_378539691~“Great value”~I wanted cheap accommodation for one night near Royal Brisbane hossie. I was looking for the Econo-Inn where I stayed about 20 years ago. I found it, this is it. I booked a studio room with a shower, and secure parking, and that's what I got. The room has shower, loo, microwave, tv, fridge, phone, free WiFi, airconditioning, a double bed, and most importantly COFFEE ! For the price, a lousy 65 bucks, I think it's sensational value. Ok it's an aging establishment, the carpet has some stains and the place could use a lick of the old Dulux here and there, but if these things bother you, go spend four times as much for the same thing elsewhere. I have no hesitation in recommending the establishment and it's staff to anyone wanting comfort without the yuppie frills. Thankyou, City Palms. I'll be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_377985711~“The most horrible experience ever !”~Stayed for a night to enjoy Fortitute valley Saturday night. Unfriendly receptionist staff and made me feeling un welcomed , but I didn't really think about it much back then because I was too excited to have Saturday night in the Fortitute valley. When I checked out, I asked kindly the reception staff about the security deposit they took from my bank card, but again with unfriendly respond ( was actually rather rudely ) he told me that it will be returned to my card in the next 4 days. One week after that I checked my card, the money had not been released, so I called the motel to ask about it and the receptionist told me to contact my bank to release the money ( it doesn't make sense for me, but I did it anyway ). When I got to the bank, the bank manager told me that they need the instruction from the motel to release the deposit money, so I called the motel again from the bank to get clarification. During this call the receptionist handed my call to his supervisor or manager because he was unable to clarify to me about the refund process. Surprisingly the motel manager / supervisor didn't give a better assistance nor solution but instead abused the bank manager and myself over the phone and hang up the phone. Knowing the matter had not been resolved in a good manner, I did call back the hotel and asked the hotel manager why he did such a think but then he told me that I was being ignorant and hang up again. I have been working in 5 star hotel industry in Bali in various management levels since 1991, and also have been working in various management positions in hospitality industry in Australia, have been travelling quite a bit including staying in many accomodations from motels to 5-6 star resorts...this is the first time I experienced such unwelcomed, unfriendly service and very rude service from the motel. There were no hospitality whatsoever ...so I will never return ever again to this place, I will tell all my friends and my network about this horrible experience. So be aware people, make sure you check the deposit money this hotel took from your card after you check out, if you ever stayed in this place.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336818666~“Great suprise for the price. Friendly staff.”~We only booked on the morning we wanted to check in and arrived early and they were very happy to store our luggage for us while we did some sightseeing. Staff were very friendly. Free wifi works well and is great when travelling. There is plenty of public transport within a few minutes walk from the front door. Plenty of places to eat nearby and a supermarket as well. The room was quite spacious and had a dining table & chairs, large bathroom with great shower, self-contained kitchen. The price was excellent for the location.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_335144746~“not bad at all”~The city palms is a decent place to spend some time in Brisbane. It is not really too expensive and is located at a 30 mins walk from the city The rooms are a little bit old and need some intervention, but overall they are clean. The staff is nice and available for every need and also for touristic suggestions.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_328866241~“Great location, great price, friendly service”~I picked City Palms as I needed somewhere close to Royal Brisbane Hospital and somewhere close to public transport. I could not have been happier with my choice. They were very happy to store my luggage for me as I had appointments prior to check in. When I arrived back, my luggage was already in the room, which was a nice touch. The room itself was very clean and much better than my expectations, based on the price. The beds were all new and the bedlinen obviously professionally laundered. There was cable tv on the large television and the air-con was lovely on such a hot day. To be honest, the property is older style, but in all of their advertising, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. The place is very well maintained, even for it's age. I stayed mid week and it seemed very quiet, which was a pleasant surprise. All in all, I was very happy.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_321931214~“Perfect for a Brissy night out”~Having previously lived in Hawthorne near Bulimba in a nice area, I knew when passing through with friends on our east coast road trip that we should stay in the valley for convenience on the evening.  Five of us stayed here and after the reception guy rudely demanded a bond (which took three weeks to be refunded) told us the rules and regs we checked into our room. Considering this was a motel it was awesome. We had a huge room with a matinee level up a flight of stairs with two beds, a double bed down stairs and another single bed. The kitchen was big and functional for some roadtriping girls.  The fridge was big enough for all of our wine .. The most important thing!  The bathroom was clean and roomy.  Would definitely stay here again.  Great room, great location and great price.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan
review_318833238~“Old World Brisbane”~I thought this place was wonderful. Old Queensland boarding house converted into a unique hotel. I had a single room that had its own balcony but no bathroom, but I rather enjoy going down the hall to the facilities. I used their kitchen to cook a dinner on two of the nights I stayed (5 in total) and I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the availability of cooking utensils. I rather liked the location opposite the old Queensland Museum and the only disappointment was that the museum had moved to the 'Cultural Centre', but the coffee was good and the staff friendly when I went over for a visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_308393573~“great value - lovely and clean”~we booked online for a one night stay - attending the boat show at the exhibition grounds just round the corner. Wayne one of the owners could not have been more helpful and pleasant even though we had booked through another site. The motel is quite charming - a blast from the past with timber floors and generous rooms. This style of build is hard to keep clean but it was spotless. Very central to the Valley. On a main road but we found the only noise came from some inconsiderate guests but that can happen anywhere. Will definitely stay here again.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan

We where not excepting to much because of the price however you can still be clean. The bath had dirty in the sills, no mattress and pillows protectors used ???? a big no no. Got towels the first day but nothing after that. The bath leaked water on the floor, so are towels where statured. The room upsides aircon was right outside our window which made a annoying noise all night. The front door had dirty marks up the wall. A good general clean with some elbow grease is in great need.

review_265382324~“Below average motel”~The City Palms Motel is in serious need of a clean up and full refurbishment!  We booked a family room for one night and thank god we did not need to stay longer! The room was well below average, very outdated and the carpet was filthy. The walls were damaged and there was a huge hole at the staircase which looked like it had been patched up extremely badly and cheaply. The bed & sheets seemed clean enough but the quilt covers were pretty dirty so we took them all off the beds. The one cupboard in the room was unusable as the door kept falling off and it was a potential accident waiting to happen.The microwave had a huge crack in the front of it so was basically unusable. My husband tried to use the iron to iron his shirt but it was impossible as the iron was sticky and damaged his shirt. The air conditioning kept making a loud banging noise every hour so you constantly got woken up during the night.  I have stayed in cheap motels before and have had so much better accommodation. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_259905646~“Cheap but does the job”~This place is cheap but fulfil all needs for a basic few nights or week.. It is in close to all the bars, restaurants and clubs in fortitude valley as well as being a 20/25 min walk into Brisbane CBD.  Rooms have air con, wifi, en suites and kitchenettes. The only negative is that the rooms are a bit dated but you cannot complain because of the price..

review_257368043~“Ok”~For the normal price the rooms are ok, but we stayed recently for a music fesival and were charged an extra $100 on top of the normal price for each night. Normally we stay here but the room we got downstairs this time was disgusting, you could be seen from the driveway while having a shower. The noise was pretty bad from people walking around upstairs. Also when we first walked in the room it smelt as though the room was wet and mouldy, upon further inspection we found the bed spread was damp, when we told reception they changed the bedspread and told us it had been raining for the last 2 days and they had trouble keeping anything dry. Friends in brisbane who live there said there was no rain for the last week? Reception was friendly.~3~nan~nan~3~2~nan~4~nan
review_255686546~“Disappointing”~The people in the room next door had a loud drunken party and the motel staff just left them to it. I didn't feel safe there at all and was very intimidated by the drunk men. Please don't ever stay here with children. Also, they advertised free wifi but it can't be accessed in the rooms so you have to sit outside with your laptop to use it. I would never come back to Brisbane for summer holidays after this experience. It was just so stressful, I needed a holiday after my holiday.~2~nan~2~1~nan~nan~2~nan

review_250876698~“Not worth the price”~I wouldnt stay at this motel again if you payed me. The rooms are very tiny and basic. The cleanliness and hygene is appaulling.Mouldy bathrooms,food stuck on cutlery,linen is dirty and stained,doors dont lock,air con does not work efficiently.Along with the rude service,when checking in you get told your room is ready,then when entering the room,you find it has not been cleaned from previous occupants.A huge inconvenience When you just want to settle in and get on with your stay.This motel requests a $300 bond and room prices vary from $80 and up.There is no cleaning equipment in the rooms but then when leaving you are expected to have the room,floors etc in a immaculate condition.It then comes out the bond of corse (sly and quick way to make extra money off holiday goers)We have stayed several times and refuse to stay here again.As advice,i wouldnt bother and go else where.~1~1~5~nan~1~1~1~nan

Then you only have three pillows in the whole room and when you ask for more they go well you have three why do you need them...well may be because I asked for them...then they say way didn't you say something before you left...well maybe I had appointment that I had to be at and there was know one there to say something too...I tried to get someone on the phone but of cause know one answered...this is way I could talk to any one...so everyone this is one motel I would not go too...one thing they have to remember if they want to keep getting people to come to there motel is to remember to treat people with respect and have a clean motel...~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_233340938~“Excellent value”~Decent motel and great friendly staff! We were a long stay from the beginning of August until October and can't really fault it, especially for the price ($58 per night) our room had a kitchenette and a balcony, little dark in the room and slightly out of date, but very clean. Beds are quite hard but bearable, didn't faze us much throughout our stay. Can be a little loud over the weekend, but the hotel staff will tell them to be quiet if it is too loud. It has a Spa and BBQ area too which can be nice.  Close to public transport and takes about 25 minutes to walk to CBD, grocery shops quite close by. Free wifi there and it is very reliable and fast. Flat screen TV with foxtel in the room too.  Overall it's great value and would recommend this motel.~5~nan~nan~3~4~nan~5~nan

review_227815816~“Fantastic value”~The City Palms is a no frills motel, a 10 minute walk from The. Brunswick Street Station. There are heaps of dining options in Chinatown, and as the room comes with a serviceable kitchen including a microwave, so self catering is a possibility. But it's the little things that really impress. There's a spa on the premises and unlimited free wifi, which 5 star hotels in Brisbane can't manage to provide.  I had a small problem with the fan, it was fixed within minutes if being brought to staff. If you're on a budget, and this part of town works it can't be beat.~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_224614115~“Cheap but noisy”~Great value for Money that's for sure, for $55/night you get a good room. BUT young people parting from midnight to almost day light robbed us of sleep for all 3 nights we stayed there! Party goers constantly running up and down the hall with stereos opening and shutting doors all night. We couldn't ring reception as the room phone didn't work and was very tempted to call the police. I see other reviews we aren't the only ones to experience the noise problems.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

TV was not working for some time. so i had to put up with the noise. the young people booked three or four rooms. kept their rooms open and were trafficking between the rooms also putting the radios on louder. i had a full day seminar and wanted to sleep early. the noisy people went away at about 12:00 and came back at 3:30 am which woke me up. Well then the came the police (with the owner) the police sorted them out big time. then there was no noise at all until l woke up at 7:00 am. it was a good thing.~5~5~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_203535168~“Noisy, not so clean and a bit farther out of town”~I was on my own so chose this hotel thinking it would be a safe walk to the James Street precinct. Its just that bit far out of town up the hill towards the hospital. My room had a generator that came on at 6.30am and it was loud and then kept coming on regularly after that. I would have thought a complex like this would have those sort of issues sorted. I didnt appreciate having to pay for the parking, we dont even do that in Perth, the most expensive city in Australia. It could have been a whole lot cleaner and the bedspreads are from a 100 years ago.~3~2~3~2~3~3~nan~nan
review_193617784~“City Palms Motel - Cheap as chips but not a dive”~We stayed here as it was close to the train to the airport and we had an early morning flight. Stayed in one of the back rooms (105) and you'd never have known you were on a busy road. Room was really clean and tidy, bathroom ditto. Paid less here per night than a double at backpackers in the centre of town and totally worth the ten minute walk into the CBD. The valley has some great little restaurants nearby.~5~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
