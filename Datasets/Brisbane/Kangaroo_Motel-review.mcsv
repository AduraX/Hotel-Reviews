review_243268607~“Inordinate noise”~Such a diabolical experience. I am a heavy sleep but due to inordinate traffic noise and lights in the street, I didn't get any sleep at all. The owner was rude and very defensive when I questioned how they could let such a room knowing full well what the outcome would be for the non suspecting traveller. I suggested he advise people what they were in for, his reply, "I wouldn't get any business". Many motels are located on main roads but they make sufficient insulation adjustments to counteract the problem. Did I say inordinate traffic, and I see I am not the first guest to find the management lacking in hospitality skills.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan

review_116518357~“Find somewhere else”~Honestly, one of the worst places I have stayed. The owner was extremely rude the room was right on the highway with no sound proofing to assist with the noise of the traffic that went all night. No coat hangers in the wardrobe. A strand of toilet paper and stone cold tiles. Yuk. Did I say the owner was rude! Not even worth $50 a night.. let alone the $235 we payed.~1~1~1~nan~1~3~1~nan
