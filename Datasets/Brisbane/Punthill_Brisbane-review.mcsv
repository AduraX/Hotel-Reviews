review_478063377~“Great location, great staff”~I stayed a few nights. The location is walkable to CBD. The room size is very large and the room was well equiped for a long term stay. There is a lot of street noise early in the morning from delivery and rubbish vehicles. I was on 7th floor.  Nice little indian restaurant across the road for late night snacks~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_474493746~“Good location close to CBD”~Was lucky enough to get a heavily discounted room for Saturday night. The rooms are very large with a small kitchenette and King size bed. Check in was great and our room was available early. The Punthill is located in Spring Hill a short walk from the CBD and also the Valley entertainment area. The apartments have the Jak and Hill restaurant where a delicious breakfast was available. Well worth staying~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471823266~“Great Stay”~Located in Spring Hill and just a short walk from central station this artsy hotel serves as a great base to explore Brisbane. You relax as soon as you walk into this hotel with the relaxed casual vibe and the friendly staff at the front desk. The rooms themselves are spacious with custom printed wall paper and art works by local artists hanging on the walls including in the bathroom and large comfortable beds, pillows and linen. I know noise levels can vary from one stay to another depending on the other guests staying at the hotel at any given time, that said the noise levels were at a minimum during my stay. Because this hotel located away from a main road it keeps the overall noise levels from the streets to a low murmur. If the weathers good take a walk up to Roma street park lands and enjoy the day exploring the surrounds or walk to Queen Street mall for a bit of shopping and come back and have a dip in the pool and make use of the BBQ facilities in the courtyard  area. The next time I'm in Brisbane, I'd stay here again.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470316267~“Superb”~Stayed at the Punthill Brisbane for 4 nights. The service is outstanding and all staff are a pleasure to deal with. Very friendly and helpful.

review_467969193~“Exceptional ”~We have stayed in both Melbourne and now the Brisbane hotels.  I cannot fault it at all. The rooms are large and spacious, with cooking facilities and a large balcony. Queen street and South Bank is walking distance away and there is a restaurant downstairs.  Parking is also available at extra cost, great place for a few day stay or business trip.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467939302~“Great Apartment, Great Price”~We stayed for three nights and our triple room here was one of the best bargains on our month long trip. A spacious, clean, well appointed modern room with comfortable beds and pillows, a well equipped kitchenette (with dishwasher) and table for three worked out perfectly for us. Nice shower, too. We were on the pool side of the building and it was nice and quiet. The room was such a bargain that we didn't mind paying $10 per day for wifi. (We learned after we left that you can join Punthill rewards and use the wifi for free.) We made our own breakfast in our room so never made it to the restaurant downstairs. Guest laundry also available. None of the other apartment hotels on our trip measured up to this one. Well done!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_465708991~“Comfortable boutique hotel”~Quirky boutique hotel, my room had a big balcony and kitchenette which would be great for longer term stays. The bed was super comfortable and decor was funky and off-beat (complete with chuppachups on the bedside tables). Not a fancy hotel (thin pillows, small pokey bathroom, old stiff balcony sliding doors, interesting lobby...and the slowest single elevator ever), but definitely very comfortable and could easily have stayed longer. Bathroom essentials provided. Reception staff were super lovely and even extended my check out time for free. Good location in spring hill, close to the city but still far enough to be nice and quiet.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465675776~“First time and not last”~The hotel is well situated within walking distance from the city, train and bus station. Elisabeth greeted us as we walked in without a reservation (we did not like the apartment we had checked in the night before so we were on the look-out for a new one). She was very helpful, informed and accommodating. We stayed for 6 days and enjoyed the peace and quiet afforded if you are on the court side of the hotel. The room is compact however well equipped with everything you may expect from a service apartment. Kind size bed and quiet air conditioner made for a good night sleep, every night. Dana was also friendly and helpful. Housekeeping on a couple of days was a little superficial, however, did not really bothered us, we were there to relax and enjoy Brisbane. The lift is a challenge, there is only one and it is so slow. The free Wi-Fi worked very well and very fast. There is a coffee shop at the base of the hotel which served enormous breakfast with friendly staff and a good breakfast selection; lunch/dinner menu is limited. Final words: we will be back.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_464744789~“What a lovely place to stay!!”~Great location, clean friendly staff with a great cafe for breakfast next door. Eay walking distance to the Southbank!! Everything you needed was supplied here and it is modern and tidy. Train stattion close by.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_463963975~“Outstanding customer service”~I had a room on the 10th floor, the views were great, the room was huge with an extremely comfortable king size bed, I had the best night sleep, sofa, remote controlled split system a/c, large flat screen TV, remote controlled Bluetooth clock radio, kitchenette with full size fridge, dishwasher & microwave and the balcony ran the full length of the room with massive sliding doors. The shower had excellent water pressure, which is rare in a hotel. Everything was spotless, including the sliding door tracks and bathroom vent. Revamped 4 years ago so it's very modern, light and airy. We were greeted by lovely, obliging staff and made to feel welcome. The lift is a little on the small side, slow and quite warm but everything else made up for this minor in-consequence and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Just a short walk [all uphill] from Central Station. A taxi home from Central after the show cost a mere $7. so if you're a little on the unfit side, [like myself] and dragging luggage grab a taxi. Return trip from hotel to the train station is all down hill. Will definitely be returning.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462637832~“Perfect stay!”~Wonderful apartment! The location is excellent, near the train and bus station and two steps from thte downtown.

review_462354227~“Loved it!”~Stayed at Punthill Brisbane for 4 nights. Arrived after a long flight hours before check in time - Mary juggled everything so we could have our room early, which was much appreciated. All staff friendly and helpful, apartments clean and comfortable, cafe downstairs does a mean bacon and eggs and gluten free options. Easy walk to city centre. Would recommend!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_461806478~“Great location”~Spacious rooms, walking distance to mall, railway station, riverfront. Free City Hopper ferry from Eagle Street Pier every half an hour provides easy access to Southbank. Full round trip on it just for a bit of a look about takes an hour and a half. There isn't anything spectacular to see, but it's helpful for getting an overview. There's also a free city loop bus. The staff at Punthill were very helpful and friendly. $25 a day for secure parking. Although you can pay for wi-fi, there is free access from one computer in the lobby.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_460962358~“ Comfortable, friendly and neat”~We stayed in the Brisbane outfit for a few days and found the location excellent. It is walking distance from Queen St Mall and a number of eating options around it.  The suites are quite spacious and are very well maintained, neat. The managers are very helpful and ensure the comfort of their visitors. Very accommodating. This place offers laundry room - so if you are traveling for a duration it's helpful! Internet is not available for free. A$ 10 per day or $3 per hour. However there is a common computer with internet access available for visitors that is free to use.  I'd stay again here!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460585545~“Good location, not many restaurants around ”~The Punthill Brisbane is part of the Melbourne based chain. The rooms are big, equipped with a handful kitchen, sofa and a small balcony. The bed is comfortable and the shower pressure is good. There is a cafe on ground floor that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner (except on Sunday night). It is a few blocks from Brisbane Central station, from where trains to airport and Gold Coast depart, as well as several bus lines.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_458405175~“generally delivers, but needs more attention to detail”~Good size bed and room, and very helpful staff. Now the negatives: thin walls, so lots of noise.

review_457638109~“Great hotel with friendly staff!”~Really liked the quirkiness of this hotel. Feels a little hostel like when you check-in, all in a very good way. Staff were super friendly and helpful and there is a cafe right next door called Jak & Hill which was very good. Our room was great and very comfy beds and pillows and great shower too. Location was okay, but a bit of a trek to the waterfront, but still doable. Would recommend this hotel as met all the expectations and exceeded some.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_457275661~“Very comfortable hotel! ”~We stayed at the Punthill for 2 nights for a weekend getaway. The room was lovely, very spacious and modern. I absolutely loved how soft and comfy the bed was, I slept like a baby! We also enjoyed the use of the outdoor pool to cool down as the weather has been so hot lately. The restaurant attached to the hotel was great, we enjoyed a very nice breakfast there. The staff at the Punthill were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is also very central, short walk to Southbank and central train station. Would highly recommend this hotel, I certainly would stay at the Punthill again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456658531~“Amazing service Quality Rooms”~Outstanding service and value for money appartments, could not have asked for more in the three nights we stayed there. Staff were professional and fun, restaurant was delicious and reasonably priced. And being so close to the CBD makes this place the perfect solution for a trip to Brisbane. Thanks for a wonderful stay and the next time we visit Brisbane you will be our first call.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_456617728~“Weekend of birthdays ”~Arriving on friday before lunch we were granted an early check in and also told we were allowed a late check out on departure. Yay! Our room was on the top floor, which for the 7yr old was super exciting, and after all the ridiculous heat we have been having lately the aircon was perfect. A little side note, the lift isn't super fast but for someone like me who suffers vertigo it's perfect. Our room was clean, beds super comfy and everything else great. Breakfast at Jak and Hill was super amazing and I'm definitely looking forward to our next stay. I love recommending this place to everyone but also wish i could keep it as my little secret.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_454162473~“Great stay”~Spent 3 nights here as we were attending a wedding in Brisbane and could not fault anything. Even before I got there, the staff were already accommodating with my request for an early check in guaranteed. Check in was a breeze and front of house staff were friendly, always a hello/good morning etc when we walk by and happy to help with any questions we might have. The room itself was adequate and modern and had everything one needed for a comfortable few days stay. Housekeeping was always done okay whenever we came back for the day. Location was not bad for where we needed to go. Great value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452486635~“Excellent value for money and location!”~We are regular weekend visitors to Brizvegas from our home on the Sunny Coast. It's the first time we stayed here and were very impressed. The location is a 10 min walk to the Queen St mall and 30 min walk to the Valley. Being the weekend there was plenty of cheap/free off street parking near by. The hotel has been refurbished inside and the large rooms are well fitted out and nicely decorated. They have a proper kitchen, a large flat screen TV and a great king sized bed. Very comfortable and clean. The staff were lovely and we had an excellent breakfast at the cafe downstairs. We'll definitely be back!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_446836916~“All the mod cons”~We were a group of three friends and we loved this place. Convenient city location. We were getting around on public transport and it was about a 5 minute walk to Central (Please note: there are hills) Let me start off with the comfort of the beds.  We were able to have 3 single beds and they were SO comfortable. I even asked them to let me know what mattresses they were using as every single one of us made a note of how comfortable they were! The small complete kitchen was an absolute bonus. The bathroom was on the small side but the inbuilt shower was very spacious. The cafe that adjoins the accomodation had some really tasty food and great drinks menu. Be sure to grab a bite there. We would def stay at these apartments again. The price was fantastic and was excellent value for money.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
review_445928571~“Cosy and convenient”~We were wrapt in finding the Punthill Brisbane everything that we read about. The team were really friendly, the rooms impeccably clean and well appointed and the location a short walk to almost everywhere. Only disappointment was the overly loud guests traversing the hallway - but you can get that anywhere. The way the room was set up made it perfect for three singles wanting to share the same room. Highly recommend this gem to others.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_445477035~“Pleasant Stay Close to Wickham Terrace”~Good clean rooms, Jack n Jill Restaurant downstairs, great food. Handy to Brisbane Private and Wickham Tce Specialists. Parking extra cost. King size beds and small kitchenette. Quite liveable for week or two. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445469973~“Great City Accomodation”~Doesn't look like much from the outside. It felt like a revamped youth hostel. The elevator was fairly small as well as the corridors but when you open the door to your room it all changed. It looks like they put all their effort into the rooms. They are very spacious an d comfortable with all the basics required for a comfortable inner city stay. You can easily have breakfast, lunch or dinner in your room but why would you when Jack and Hill is just next to the lobby with some of the best food available. Also an added bonus which we didn't realise till the last night is that they also do the room service. Good thing to otherwise we probably wouldn't have gone out at all for dinner.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445466900~“Always Reliable, Fantastic Staff”~Been a regular guest at Punthill for about two years now and I am always impressed by the staff, they always remember my name, my preference for my stay and they have fantastic recommendations for restaurants, short cuts to venues, city centre, central station, and even hair dressers.  My room has always been perfect, very spacious, walk in shower, balcony and basic kitchenette (even a dishwasher), I love the quirky decor, beautiful child's painting, their bed is amazing and lollipops on the bedside table. Thank you to the Punthill Brisbane staff for always making my stay an enjoyable one and making it my 2nd home  Merry Christmas and see you next year again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445416885~“Exceeded expectations”~We are a family of three just had our first morning coffee at Punthill and have to say it is a very well set up hotel especially given reasonable costs and good location. The kitchen has everything you'll need including full fridge, dishwasher, cook top, microwave and all dishes and cleaning supplies. Very clean and space, while a typical hotel room size, is all well laid out, lots of closets, nice big balcony, and great to have laundry room for use especially after being on live-a-board and diving in Indonesia for past month. We needed everything cleaned immediately !!  Have to pay 10 a day for internet which is high in our experiences outside Australia but we notice costs in some areas such as restaurants is higher than elsewhere so perhaps this is 'normal'.  Gym and pool are pretty good and restaurant handy for breakfast.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444771481~“Horrible! Don't stay here unless you want to spoil your holiday.”~I stayed at the Punthill with my wife during the first week of December and it was HORRIBLE. The mattress was too soft for my wife and she couldn't sleep a wink the first night. When we highlighted the soft mattress to the manager the next morning, he went into DEFENSIVE mode and showed us all the awards they received from Booking.com, Tripadvisor etc. Seriously, was it necessary? We only wanted to highlight that the mattress was too soft for us. We asked the manager if the mattress in another room was equally soft (we don't mind upgrading if the mattress was different) but the manager said all the mattresses were the same and they were purchased only 3 years ago. After a while, the manager reluctantly allowed us to see if the mattress in another room was ok for us. At this point I regretted booking Punthill and wish we paid for a better apartment. The Punthill is HORRIBLE - not only is the mattress too soft and uncomfortable, the attitude of the manager SUCKS, the kettle was rusty (thank goodness the manager wasn't at the reception when I brought it down to change it otherwise he might have said that all the kettles in the apartment are the same) and the swimming pool looked like it hasn't been cleaned in a long time (needless to say the swimming suits that we brought to enjoy the Aussie summer remained in our suitcase throughout the trip). My wife ended up sleeping at her sister's apartment instead for the rest of the trip - we should have just stayed at her sister's apartment in the first place and saved ourselves the money and the manager's bad attitude.  TripAdvisor, Booking.com etc should seriously consider taking back the awards as they are hugely misleading to other customers. Please do not stay here unless you want to spoil your holiday in Brisbane.~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan~1~nan
review_444117602~“Few Minutes Walk to Brisbane Museum”~Travelling for awhile need few things to do, takes few step to Indian Food Corner. Been here a while mostly not enjoy the living in the city but this apartment hotel has enough space for studio. Also not far from the airtrain.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_443955067~“Don't stay here if you want to sleep”~I don't understand why people gave such high rating about this place, which was the reason which led us to book 5 nights at this apartment. The bed was so soft that we (of small physique) just sink when we lie on it. It is the softest bed I have ever slept in. There is nothing we can do to it to make it firmer, even after taking off the mattress topper. We are told that the mattress is only 3 years old. So either the quality is so bad to begin with or it is badly in need of a replacement due to overuse. The extremely soft bed means for people with back pain (This is me), you cannot sleep at all. For people without back pain (This is my husband), you wake up with back and neck pain. This is a deal breaker for us. We ended up staying only 1 night (although we paid for 5 nights).  Other less severe negatives are: 1. The king bed is just two twins stick together with a Velcro slip 2. Wi-Fi is 10 aud additional per night.  3. Parking is 25 aud per night.  4. No complimentary bottled water or fruits or slippers or toothbrush or toothpaste. 5. Water kettle has rust in it.  6. Hair dryer was missing, we need to ask for it. On hindsight, we should have either stayed at the Frasier suites or at a hotel. Staying here was the worst mistake I made which ruined this trip for my husband, myself and family we were visiting. The only positive is that they put us in the quiet side of the building as per our request.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_442713016~“great room, great stay”~i recently spent 3 nights at the Punthill and l was pleasantly surprised. The lobby and halls are nothing special but the rooms are great!! I stays in a large studio apartment which had a kitchenett, king bed, two seater lounge, combined desk/table and balcony. It was one of the cleanest, best presented rooms l have ever stayed in and very comfortable. To add to this the staff are great and nothing is too much trouble. Attached is Jak & Hill's Cafe serving good simple food, i ate there on several occasions and was very happy with the food l was served, the menu is quite simple but the food well prepared and tasty, the only down side is the cake is closed saturday and sunday nights. The only negative is it's $25 a day to park there, l always feel a bit violated having to pay for parking when l'm already paying to stay the night. I highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442441978~“Disappointed.”~I read a lot of good reviews about this place so thought I'd give it ago.  Our room smelt old and like a ashtray had been sitting in the room for weeks. I alerted the staff. When they came they said they couldn't smell anything. Which I believe she was down playing it. She did offer to put me in another room. I couldn't be bothered moving rooms after a long day of travelling. The bed though. Amazing!!!!  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442012563~“Great value & great location”~This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. I was only in Brisbane for business overnight so being only a 5 or 10 minute to the CBD is really good.

Large very clean rooms; king size bed; lovely bathroom; full kitchen; comfy lounge; large balcony; heaps of desk space - what's not to love!

review_440982398~“Location, Service & Comfort. A Fantastic Hotel”~My wife and I booked the Punthill Brisbane to stay in with our 5 month old son for the end of November 2016. We arrived at Central Station and the hotel is only a 5-10 minute walk away, so great for us. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a lovely lady (receptionist), who checked us in 2-3 hours early with no hesitation. She was more than helpful, gave us a quick debrief regarding the area, hotel facilities and told us to come and ask her regarding anything else we may need. Facilities are great and consist of a small pool, sunlounging area, bbq area, a cosy outdoor (but sheltered) gym and Jack & Hills restaurant. We were also provided with a car parking space for a friend of ours without charge from the other lovely receptionist, when we asked if we could use it for an evening. The rooms were in great condition, bathrooms were great and equipped with toiletries, fully airconned, spacious balconies, built in wardrobes, comfy beds, sufficient kitchen area etc. Would recommend this to anyone wanting great rooms, great service, great price hotel within walking distance to Brisbane CBD. Will stay again for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_440284442~“Solid on all acounts”~Spent two nights at Punthill Brisbane a week apart and both times was pleased with the quality of accommodation, service and staff. My apartment was spacious, very clean and properly outfitted. Check-in and check-out was a breeze -- cheery but professional staff got everything handled with no glitches or fuss. The restaurant at ground floor level is very good, which offsets the lack of other choices nearby. (A pity that it closes early just after lunch on Sunday so finding dinner requires a healthy walk or a taxi.) The walk to the riverfront restaurant row is about five blocks --downhill --but the return walk uphill later at night is a bit eerie on the empty streets on a Sunday night.  For the price, this is a hotel that is hard to fault. I highly recommend it in this mid-level category.~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_440150375~“Another Great Punthill”~Punthill is my go to place to stay when visiting Australia, and Punthill Brisbane is the best yet. Only stayed one night when traveling up from the Gold Coast. Easy to find. Great location and just superb. Fabulous staff. Cute decor. Exceptionally clean and high quality touches. Loved the plunger coffee. Most comfy bed and pillows I have ever had in a hotel. Just loved everything about Punthill Brisbane!

review_439120879~“solid brisbane hotel”~the hotel is clean, located within walking distance of central station while also being close to areas like fortitude valley. Outside the heart of the CBD which is nice too - but despite many saying it is a great location (which it is) don't be fooled into thinking you are in the centre of the Brisbane city. That being said, given the way Brisbane is organized, and a lot of the places you'll want to visit being spread amount different areas, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_437920754~“Comfortable, practical, contemporary hotel in central Brisbane”~Centrally located, with onsite parking (at additional cost - but worth it for the convenience); we booked a room with a double and single bed which worked really well as the rooms are very spacious and configured in such a way to provide a degree of separation and privacy despite being in the same room. The decor was nicely contemporary, with nice touches of complimentary coffee bag for the plunger as well as the usual selection of instinct coffees and teas, toiletries etc. Very clean and decor in good condition throughout - the beds and pillows were especially comfortable! We ate breakfast at the 'breakfast only' establishment on the ground floor and had the best breakfast menu for a long time.

review_436680878~“Love this place!”~Our room for 3 adults was perfect! Staff are lovely and price was fantastic. The beds were so comfy, one of the best sleeps I've had in a hotel room. Good restaurants in the area and a nice walk to the main shops in the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436573879~“very nice place to stay”~This place is very clean with friendly staff, pool and a gym. It is central to all the attractions and the rooms are of decent size. I would recommend this place to singles and families and would definitely go back to stay there.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_435950481~“This is a place for you.”~We stayed here during the trip to Brisbane, location is good. The room is big, comfortable bed, I like extra pillows, there are some in the closet, full kitchen even though we don't need it but still good for making a cup of tea whenever I want. All the staff are very friendly and helpful, our 3 days staying here were very pleasant and comfortable like home, highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan

review_434776753~“nice and spacious”~We stayed only one night at The Punthill. The rooms are very nice and spacious, comfy bed, kitchenette. Friendly and helpful staff. The bathrooms are extremely tiny but there's everything you need. We found the location ok but not ideal. There's not much close by and it's a good walk to CBD. The restaurant downstairs is ok but nothing special. Overall The Punthill offers good value accommodation.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_434692010~“Some good. Some bad. ”~Decent hotel. We liked the rooms. They have everything you need and include a full fridge and kitchen. Great spot to grab food downstairs and close to a ton of other places including fortitude valley and queen street mall. I would place the couch in between the beds for a bit more privacy when sharing a room. They are super close together. Walls are pretty thin as well. You can hear a lot of walking etc. in other rooms.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433091215~“Good location and rooms”~The hotel was awesome and staff was great thanks guys. Rooms are the cleanest and worth every dollar you pay for :) also they have a late check out if you are good and polite to the staff :) I recommend it~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432626674~“Huge room”~This apartment hotel is close to downtown and what is even better close to Central Station if you need to get to the airport. We got a room/apartment on 10th floor with huge balcony, kitchen, sofa and chairs and as always in Australia, lovely bed - long and wide. Bathroom is rather small but lots of hot water, shampoo and towels. Nice lobby with direct access to the restaurant where you can buy your breakfast or dinner. Pool on the 2.floor. Great hotel~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_431011839~“Absolutely awesome!”~From the moment you walk in, there's a really cool vibe that feels different from other hotels/serviced apartments with a quirky modern theme from the moment you walk in to the rooms. Staff were exceptionally warm, welcoming and ever so helpful, perhaps the best customer service we received in Australia. Our room was perfect for our family and was clean, tidy and very comfortable, especially the bathroom/shower. Location was great as it was only a 10 minute walk to the city centre. We also had a secure car park without any issue. The walls in the rooms may be a bit thin as we were able to hear the cleaner in the room next door in the morning, however I think our floor was pretty quiet so we didn't really have any trouble with noise. Overall, great comfortable stay, I would book Punthill Brisbane again when I return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430812133~“A friendly welcome”~Stayed there for a business function. A friendly welcome upon arrival, swift help with carrying my bags up to my room, a clean and modern room and a comfy bed, couldn't fault the experience! The kitchenette looked great, the bird wallpaper was interesting. The 2nd floor balcony view was not ideal, however I didn't have the spare time for enjoying a view with my stay anyway. I wonder if any kids or toddlers have mistakenly ever coloured that bird wallpaper in, haha. Loved it, would go back for sure! Thanks guys~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429874236~“Great girls weekend away ”~This hotel is boutique and so trendy. Great location. Great price. Great cafe. Great rooms with kitchenette abd bigggg. Great service. Clean. Nice pool area and gym. Only issue for both rooms was we asked for twin beds. But one king changed next day. Thankyou for your hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429628849~“Would stay here again!”~Location was good for us. We were able to walk to most areas we wanted to visit. Found eating places and supermarket nearby. Close to Central Station, walking distance to main CBD and shopping. Room was modern, comfortable. Bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. Bathroom was probably not the best design but didn't detract from our stay.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_427274508~“Favorite Brisbane Hotel”~Punthill surprised us, it is my favorite hotel in Brisbane. Central yet quiet. Very modern and the service was outstanding. Rooms are comfortable, spacious and linen top quality. The restaurant serves outstanding food and great coffee~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426301573~“What a fabulous hotel!”~Sadly we only had one night at this wonderful hotel during a brief stop in Brisbane. From the lovely, friendly welcome at check-in, to the tasteful rooms, to the efficient check-out, everything was perfect. We enjoyed the special little touches - lollipops on the bedside tables, good coffee, quality toiletries and wonderfully comfortable beds. Location was great too - a five minute walk into the city centre. Would definitely stay again when next in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426026156~“Great getaway, plenty of room to move”~Great apartments. Nice size rooms , and kitchenette was handy to have. Perfect for a weekend stay, espcially for sporting events and suncorp stadium. Plenty of restaurants and supermarkets in the area .~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_424581999~“Great location, lovely, spacious rooms”~Spacious room with very comfortable beds. Quiet air con a definite bonus. Our bathroom was a bit small and the door was old and didn't open all the way. Kitchen very well equipped with coffee plunger, dishwasher, full fridge and more. Great if you are staying for awhile in Brisbane. $25 per day charge to park the car added on to the cost of the hotel. Easy walking distance to CBD.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_423998464~“Good CBD Hotel with car parking”~My husband and I, along with our daughter, stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It was walking distance to the city - just. The parking was convenient and reasonably priced. The room itself was quite small but well set up and nicely furnished and decorated. The beds were very comfortable. The outlook from the balcony was not fantastic, but to be expected in the city.The pool area was not very inviting, and in fact appeared to be green. The food at the attached restaurant was very good, both in taste and value. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, offering a short cut into the mall to reduce uphill walking.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_409069754~“Modern, comfortable, friendly helpful staff”~I booked this hotel as an overnight CBD stay. We live in the 'burbs so for the price of a return taxi home we stayed in town instead! The location is central enough, with just a 15min to the free city hopper ferry, but tucked away in a relatively quiet street. We parked up our car underneath the hotel, and walked everywhere. Our room was spacious, warm, and very comfortable. The cafe downstairs, Jak and Hill (?) serves yummy breakfast too!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_404453666~“Perfect for Brisbane Getaway!”~It's a perfect accommodation for several reasons. First, it's about 10mins walk from Central Station. Room is very spacious. Though not much view to offer, for 150AUD it's definitely a good deal! Staffs are kind and helpful, too. With warm smile, the reception lady took time to show us the city map and highlighted some places we might be interested to visit. She gave us some tips on what's going on (events, market and exhibition) and of course, means of getting from point A to B. Amenities like pool, bar, gym and so on are also available. "Jack + hill" is another good treat for staying at Punthill because aside from the location which is just at the ground floor, food is notably something that makes happy tummies!!! The hotel is also just 15mins walk from Eagle Street/ Riverside Centre where there are lots of bars and restaurants perfect for more food&drinks exploration, and of course not to forget the great view to complete a laid back experience!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404142652~“Perfect Location, walk to southbank, ride the ferry, queens mall, Ferris wheel, event center.”~This apartment has it all! You get complete apartment, king size bed in a separate room, a tv, and a full kitchen, in a quiet part of the CBD! The value for the price is great! The reception is great, they call a cab if you want, they give you walking directions, recommendations for dinner. Their is a restaurant on site, which was very good.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_403045507~“Great Place to Stay”~This hotel was surprisingly good. The front desk staff were great on both check in and out, luggage storage was easy and the room was clean and comfortable. A quiet room with a great shower. The premises is located within an easy walking distance to Central Station, the café in the foyer is also a top spot for brekkie. The only thing that is not ideal is the one lift and pokey corridors. I will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_402317689~“Clean, comfortable and great value ”~This is the second time I have stayed here and for some reason I just love it. The rooms are well appointed each with a small kitchen and a large flat screen TV. This hotel is great value and you can often pick up discounted deals. There is a great cafe adjacent to the lobby for breakfast. The hotel is a short walk to central station, I wouldn't recommend people stay here if they are unable to walk that distance (ask staff about the short cut across the road) which is around 300-400m with some stairs. The lobby and hallways are no frills which I like after all you are paying for your room not a lobby. Parking is also available for $25 per night.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400349075~“Extremely comfortable and excellent ”~Arrived late. Extreme ease to enter after hours. On first glance very impressed, one of the cleanest accommodation I've seen and believe me I've seen alot. Was very comfortable for two days stay. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397235337~“A big suprise”~We had had a stressful drive into Brisbane and a little difficulty locating the hotel. When we arrived the front office team member couldn't do enough to help us. He kindly offered a solution to park our car and get us to our room. It really made the difference. The decor in the room was very modern and with a generous balcony. Service was outstanding~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_397172174~“Loved it”~We spent one night at this hotel on a stopover. I absolutely loved it. Rooms are very trendy, beds SO comfy and toiletries provided rocked. Very clean and convenient location to Queen street mall and Southbank , we walked to and from without an issue. Jak and hill downstairs did the best coffee I'd tasted throughout our trip around Queensland as well as having other treats and main meals on offer. We stayed as family and had adequate room although you might want something bigger for a long term stay. Would be perfect when travelling as a couple or with friends.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395181913~“Clean, Friendly & Close Attractions”~Went to this hotel while we were travelling Australia celebrating our anniversary. Room was very spacious and room had everything required for a self catered apartment but also had that hotel feel as there was always someone at reception who were always happy to help. The hotel was only a 5 minute walk to the central train station. Plus a 10 minute walk to city centre. View from the balcony wasn't the prettiest but we didn't really mind because everything else in the hotel was brilliant.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_393206715~“Nice quiet rooms ”~Loved the decor on checking in. Very trendy boho chic. Rooms very clean and kitchenette stocked with everything you need. Laundry facilities and free wifi. 15 min walk to Fortitude valley for bars and clubs and 14 min walk into town. Can hire bikes from hotel but streets quite hilly so we didn't. Staff very friendly and great little cafe downstairs for yummy breakfasts and coffees. I would def recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_391841163~“Lovely stay”~Excellent aparthotel facilities in the room. Rooms very spacious. Beautiful toiletries! Lovely little restaurant on the ground floor! Receptionist hours are limited with might be a little disappointing for some. 10 - 15 minute walk from the centre which involves hills which we didn't mind! I would recommend staying here!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390936923~“Great place to stay in Brisbane”~Only stayed for 1 night but loved the clean, spacious room with funky decor. Bed was awesome!

review_388674950~“Love this place!”~Stayed for 2 nights and wish we'd stay longer. Room was fantastic, balcony in the room is great. Very chic, very smart, good size rooms, excellent beds and bedding, all round wonderful. We will be staying again. TIP: Pay for their parking - the other options nearby are so expensive.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386334520~“Wouldn't Change a Thing”~only had a quick 1-night stay at Punthill Brisbane, but I have to stay it was one place I will definitely be coming back to every time i come to Brisbane. The staff were extremely helpful when I arrived early for Check-in and had my room ready. The room was luxurious and made me feel right at home on a comfort level. I will recommend Punthill to any family/friend that is looking for accommodation in Brisbane definitely. Thank you so much for amazing stay! - Rebecca.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_385411608~“Couldn't be happier ”~Friendly staff. Comfortable room with a large bed equipped with the thickest softest pillow top I've ever slept on. Big TV and we'll placed furniture. Bathroom is small but we'll laid out and big where it counts (the shower). Large enough kitchen with all the amenities we needed and then some. Big fridge and plunger coffee provided. Heater worked really well too. Everything was so clean and looked well kept/new. The balcony was big with table and chairs and ashtray for smelly smokers. I was delighted to find a chuppa chup for each of us as a pillow lolly or whatever they call it. Much better than chocolate and very unique, plus a vegan friendly choice!  We would definitely stay here again. Great value.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382900029~“Outstanding Service”~We arrived after a week in a camper and were greeted by wonderful receptionist who was able to guide me to retail therapy. Lovely large room which was nicely appointed. Had a great sleep in the most comfortable bed ever. Highly recommend.~5~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_382634601~“Lovely central accommodation”~The hotel room was large, clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. You could close the curtains and be in complete darkness which I like. The apartment was fitted with everything you need for a city stay. Walking distance to everything. The staff aren't exactly helpful or seem that happy.. the lift is the slowest in history (recommend lower levels so you can take the stairs) The service at the restaurant at lobby level (Kak + Hill) is incredibly slow.. not great if your in a rush. Could not fault the room. Would certainly stay there again.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~2~nan
review_382579693~“What A Convenient Location”~This is a very well placed hotel whether you are going to Suncorp Stadium or the CBD of Brisbane.. Nice sized apartment style rooms with good conveniences & very quiet for the city. I would highly nrecommend Punthill.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_382348424~“Clean and spacious”~Upon arrival the staff were friendly and accommodating. We were given the key to our room - even though we were 2 hours earlier then check in. Parking was really easy, and situated in the same building as he hotel. The room was massive with a fully stocked kitchen and sitting area. Very clean. Excellent position. The cafe underneath - jak + hill - is well worth a visit for any meal of the day and fantastic coffee. Couldn't fault anything.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381362641~“Top location, great hotel, friendly staff”~A great location close to Central Station. Large, clean, modern well-appointed room with cooking facilities. Staff was very helpful. Our 4 nights went by too fast. We plan on coming back to this hotel.~5~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan
