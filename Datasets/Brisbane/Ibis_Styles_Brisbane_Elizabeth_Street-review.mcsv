review_478387547~“Back Again Nice But the noise...”~Cheap and really good value hotel - love the location and fittings. Close to all you need in Brisbane proper - this time stayed in a nice corner room BUT on the side right above the pub and the music didn't stop and vibrated the whole room till 1:30 am...and was on the 12th floor! It was HORRID. Stay on the side away from the pub and as high as you can - it sort of made the whole stay a downer.~3~4~nan~1~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478382381~“Great central location”~I stayed here for one night only. Chose this hotel because of its central location. I booked directly with the hotel - they offered me $17 upgrade to a room with a view overlooking the river and included breakfast. I accepted the upgrade and was not disappointed. The room not only had great views, the bed was amazingly comfortable, well appointed bathroom, wi-fi reception was good. Only negative nowhere to hang clothes. The breakfast was excellent and there was a good choice of food. Both check-in and check-out was quick and efficient Location wise to central Brisbane was excellent. Can certainly recommend and will stay there again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478092298~“Great location but sloppy housekeeping service”~I stayed here for business. While the hotel is in great location, easy to get to by public transportation, its housekeeping service left a lot to be desired. They're lazy and did a poor job cleaning the room. I've never stay in a hotel where the room wasn't made the whole day. Coming back to the room at 7pm and the room hasn't been cleaned was not a good experience! This happened few times over the course of a week while I stayed there. The staff were lazy and did a half-assed attempt to make the bed.  Other than that, the overall experience is just average. Will I stay here again? Hmmm, maybe not. There are plenty of other option in the city that offers the same value for money.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~2~nan
review_477939080~“Good value, well located, friendly staff”~The Ibis Styles in ElizabethSt is very well located for the Performing Arts for theatre visits and next to the Myer Centre. Breakfast, although continental was very good and could be upgraded to include hot items. Staff generally very friendly and efficient.~5~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_477890400~“Comfortable, clean, great views.”~We had a corner room on the 21st floor, with floor to ceiling windows with panoramic views. The decor was great and the bed was very comfortable. Room was serviced every day. Staff were extremely helpful and polite.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_477849932~“Very disappointing experience”~If traveling and accommodation will be like that in the future I’d rather go camping (nothing against camping).  We live in Melbourne and travelled to Brisbane on the long Easter Weekend. I always try to book our flights that we arrive early at the destination to make the most out of the first day. It was around 11am when we get to the Ibis Styles Brisbane on Elizabeth Street. At the check in desk the first upset. They asked for a $15 early check in fee! All my life, and I travelled a lot, I usually get a “yes, the room is free” or “no, but you can leave your luggage in the hotel”. The room was quite nice, but had no wardrobe. Not even a bench for a second luggage…how disappointing to get the clothes in and out of it. On the evening of the first day we found our room without to get cleaned and our towels still on the floor. At the front desk they told us that there was only limited room service due to the public holiday and if we didn’t get the info at check in!? Not the case. But how can a management run the hotel on reduced cleaning team on the peak time of travelling and holiday time. Nothing against the cleaner because they were quite friendly. The hotel was super full. They just tried to save money for cleaners in the wrong time (public holiday bonus). Anyway, on request we got new bedding and towels’ thanks for that. Other than that we have to mention that Brisbane is very nice. Loved it! Just try not to stay and dine on public holidays. The restaurants are not ashamed to take 15 to 20% surcharge on top of the bills – shocking!~2~3~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_477340437~“Great location”~Stayed one night, very handy to everything, walk out the front door and next door is Myers and the Mall. A short walk across the river to the Performing Arts Centre and the Wheel. Room very clean, not very big but fine for a short stop over. Ask for a river view as spectacular at night.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476883525~“Good for a business trip”~I stayed at Ibis Elizabeth St for 6 nights Great central location - walking distance to the main attractions. Great view from the rooms at the 17th floor. Tip: if you can choose, pick the river view on the south banks which is absolutely gorgeous, not the skyscrapers view which is rather boring. Rooms are super clean, tidy and full of little comforts for the guests. Free Wi-Fi is included and works properly. There are laundry services available which turn out super handy on a business trip.  Downsides:  - they forgot to clean the room and provide towels for 3 days - breakfast is quite expensive for the variety of food available - personnel at the reception was not always kind; while I was waiting in line, I also noticed discourteous behaviours with other guests trying to check in, who had difficulties speaking in English~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_476060806~“Urine stains & Terrible Service ”~My mum slept on someone else's Urine stains on her sheets for two nights before she realised. The lady told us she would take care of things, but we came back to the hotel at 5pm and nothing had been done. Still piss on the bed! GROSS! Heard nothing from anyone else our whole stay despite me calling front desk twice!!  Then the lady in the restaurant was possibly the rudest person I have ever come across.  Do your self a favour and stay somewhere else!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475955254~“Brilliant ”~Great hotel - the rooms were spotlessly clean and the bed super comfortable. Location was great right in the heart of the CBD and only a stones throw from the casino. The room itself was very modern and the bathroom was clean, great hotel for a short business trip. The breakfast was adequate had to pay an extra 10 dollars for the hot meal which isn't too expensive but there wasn't a wide variety but this said is a minor complaint~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474844001~“Convenient & Value for money”~The staff were efficient and friendly. The position is terrific, right next to Queen Street Mall. We had no car for this trip and thankfully didn't have to pay for parking, which is exorbitant in Brisbane. There are buses quite convenient if need be. The room is small, but there is everything you need for a short stay. I'd say their target market is the business traveller with little luggage. The wi-fi was good, the air-con worked well, and we had a bit of a view from the 19th floor. For the deal we got it was terrific value for the money.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_474434434~“Pretty good hotel ”~Stayed here for 2 nights for a work trip. Room was quite small but nice, room had a great view over the river. Bar fridge in the room was quite small and couldn't really fit much into it. Room was in pretty good condition, few scuff marks on the walls obviously from people's luggage. Got some spaghetti takeaway from the restaurant in the hotel, I think the meal cost $17? and came in a small Chinese takeaway container and felt like it had been heated up in the microwave as it was boiling hot to the point where I couldn't even carry it up to the room. Meal was terrible, pasta wasn't couldn't cooked for long enough and meat was average. I stayed on the 11th floor and I was surprised with how much noise I could still hear from the road throughout the night. Hotel staff were very friendly and hotel is in a great location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473339544~“A beaut of a place flying solo ”~I stayed at the Ibis hotel in Brisbane in February for three nights! And what drew me to this hotel was the colorful decor and rooms on their website! Being it my first time traveling alone it was a central, safe and friendly place to stay! The hotel is central to all the shopping you will want to do and walking distance to the river and the ferries! I never made use of a taxi or bus it was all walking even to the train station. They have very nice and accommodating staff, a restaurant and gym and everything was clean and well looked after. I will most definitely recommend staying there if you like simple and easy!  Thanks to everyone for assisting me while I was there~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473291324~“lovelg ”~we loved the ibis styles. the beds were comfy and the shower was powerful. the location is unbeatable, we were slap bang in the middle of everything. right next to the massive shopping centre and high street, and the river is just a stones throw away~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473257656~“Do Your Research Beforehand ”~We Booked through Wotif online. The paperwork stated parking available on site however this is not the case. You actually park in the Myer Centre then have to drag your baggage through the car park, then through the centre to the hotel as there is no unloading zone out the front. Our paperwork stated "Breakfast Buffet" but this is not the case - you have to pay an extra $10 person for hot food. Very frustrating because the food that you are allowed to eat is very basic. The room we had was about the size of a small child's bedroom, very cramped . Fridge did not work so we had to go to level 1 constantly to get a buckets of ice. Don't ask for two buckets as the staff will give you some attitude. We did tell reception about the fridge and they sent somebody up to have a look however the handyman stated that he knows nothing about fridges. On the positive side , the hotel is in a great location and is very clean. Did not suit us and I doubt we will be back.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473093228~“A Stylish Bird!”~Ibis Style in Brisbane's CBD has remained constant in my view. Always pleasant, efficient staff , good rooms and so handy to everything Brisbane offers. My last recent stay was one of the higher level rooms- a nice surprise with even a river view. An early arrival to reception took care of my bag until I returned to check in . Quite a help. The room itself whilst not large was more than adequate with comfortable bed, clean facilities, large TV with Fox channels. Ibis Styles is close to all Brisbane shopping, river cruises, transport ( some free ) and restaurants of all persuasions!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_472852562~“Great value in the heart of the city”~Hard to fault, great location, great rates, free internet and cheap parking next door at the Myer centre if you arrive after 4 and leave before 7am.

review_472582870~“Great views of Southbank”~Spent a very enjoyable Saturday night at a reasonable price. Stayed in a King corner room and the view from the floor to ceiling window was spectacular (for Brisbane). Close to the Queen Street mall, Treasury Casino and a short walk to Southbank. Join Leclub Accor, it costs nothing and you will get free internet during your stay. Room was clean and modern.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_472222726~“Great but no unloading/ loading zone at checkin”~Handy location, close to restaurants and river. Breakfast ok, suitable for business trip. There is no unloading/ loading zone outside the hotel, worse, it's a major bus stop for the rail station I think, so I was abused by bus drivers when my colleagues were unloading their luggage. Parking is down the road in a multi story underground carpark $38 overnight when verified by hotel. Be extra careful to remember exactly where you leave the car as it’s quite complicated getting back to the car next day. I tried to picking up my colleagues with all their luggage from the front of the hotel, but the bus drivers are quite aggressive, so I ended up circling the block twice, which is a 10 minute trip.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_471328527~“Dont let the smell in the foyer put you off”~When I first walked in the smell in the foyer was overwhelming. It reeked of what I thought was fly spray. I discussed it with the 8 or 10 people lined up for the one bloke at reception at 6pm on a weeknight? He told me they hired a consultant and that is their fragrance. A mixture of pine and citrus. It was more like yellow and black brand fly spray. I got past it and got to the room. They are very small but the bed and pillows are very comfortable. Bathroom is small but good. The gym is actually a room with no aircon. The water tank was empty and no towels. The machines looked like some of the guests had exploded on them. Trails of sweat everywhere. Luckily it was on 30 something degrees with 80 or 90% humidity. It was like working out in a sauna wearing someone else's sweat gear. Not good. No room service and not even a bottle of water in the room. But if clean comfortable bed with good pillows is what you are after this is as good as anywhere. If you want a decent gym, room service and some basics in the room this isnt the place. My biggest problem was the smell in the foyer. At least there weren't any flies!~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_470946503~“Deluxe King River View: Good, but nothing special”~Tried this motel out as we had an Accor Hotel gift voucher to use. Overall it was a nice enough hotel, but I would not say it's your best choice for a Brisbane CBD stay. A breakdown of the motel stay below: General: - No Parking at Hotel (park in Myer Centre for a Hotel Rate of $38) Positives: - comfy bed king size - great view (see photos) - good buffet breakfast ($20 on the day or $15 pre-booked) - tea and coffee facilities in room  - good shower with good pressure - has a gym (but it's small, no air conditioning, cold water or towels)  - large HD TV -$10 unlimited internet (but no free options) - Competitive pricing ($132 on a Tuesday night) - lobby staff very friendly. - well designed rooms for how tiny they are - in room ironing facilities. Negatives: - Hotel lobby smelt of very strong incense that assaulted the nose; - Paid for a buffet breakfast but nearly was refused entry because the motel had made a mistake and not put our room number down, so rather than giving us the benefit of the doubt we had to sort it out ourselves. This was extremely disappointing; - expensive overnight parking rate, it was much cheaper for us just to park after 4pm And leave before 7am for just $10!!! Rather than $38 through the motel; - No free internet (something I would have considered pretty standard these days) $10 per night for unlimited though which isn't too bad; -~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470709534~“Quaint Hotel & Great Location”~A very modern and clean hotel. Loved the location - a lot of restaurants and the Queen Street Mall is only a couple blocks away. There is city wifi which makes things much easier for out-of-towners. The room was comfortable, clean and spacious enough for 2. The staff was friendly also. Wifi in the room. Breaky was included with our room (check when you book) & was a great way to start our morning. Would book this hotel again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_469007201~“Don't stay in an accessible room unless you have to”~We were delayed on the way to Vanuatu, and after staying 7 hours at the airport, we were sent to this hotel. It was central and well looked after, with good desk staff. Our room happened to be a disabled room, but the only way we could tell this was that there was no furniture (at all!) in the room save a built in wardrobe with no door, tea and coffee built into the side of it, and the bed. No chair, no desk, nothing to put your things on. I think we had a bag holder. My back is bad and I hated having to drop everything on the floor and retrieve it later. The bathroom was spacious but same again, nowhere to put our toiletries but the thin piece of porcelain along the basin. No lid on the toilet even. Thankfully there were two hooks on the back of the door. We popped down to eat in their restaurant at about 8.00 pm, and because we had eaten at the airport, it was only dessert. We waited 45 minutes for the dessert! I think there was only one staff on, and we all turned up, but maybe a casual staff member could have been called. Luckily all of us on the flight by this time were socialising. Lovely place, but strange organisation.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~2~nan
review_468977891~“Accor Hotels deliver again”~I have found that whichever of the Accor group of hotels in which I stay, the result is consistently good. Staying at Ibis budget or Ibis Styles, the room is always clean, comfortable bed and a good clean bathroom. The amenities are always adequate. Often there is a good restaurant available, too. The hotels are usually well located. In my opinion these hotels are good value for money. If I want a little more comfort, or Ibis is not available, then one of the other Accor Group usually is available and provides for my needs.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_468397288~“Very good stay”~Nice modern hotel with well appointed rooms. I was on the 14th floor overlooking the river and South Bank - very nice view. Great location - right in the CBD, near plenty of restaurants etc. Walking distance to Central Station. The only negative - I found it unusual that there was no plug for the wash basin in the bathroom, and no hand towels provided. Overall, a very good stay, and excellent value for money. I would stay again, no problem.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_468078913~“Great stay”~A double room on the 12th floor over looking the main road, but so quite. Room bright and airy, good quality bed linen, fluffy towels in the bright and roomy bathroom, good loo roll too. Room clean and well maintained. Public areas nice. Hotel well located for the city centre, and easy access to bars and restaurants. Our room price (very reasonable) included breakfast and was very enjoyable in a bright and clean restaurant. Well worth the visit and will definately recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467907211~“Great location, good price”~We stayed here for the first time and it was so central. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. It was good because we could park our rental car in the Myer's car park which is only a couple of doors down from the hotel's main entrance. The hotel then validated the car parking ticket so you got a much cheaper rate.  The breakfast was good with a good variety of choices. The only drawback was the poor staff who were working were very overworked and there were only two staff on. It is a nice bright and clean hotel. Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_467349519~“Great location. Rooms are practical.

review_466973127~“Nothing special - but location is good”~It is difficult to be both hip and cheap at the same time. The details are always lacking and it just has the feel of trying to be something that it is not.

review_466427911~“Fabulous view, great location, but soured by bad experience”~My partner and I stayed here on the weekend of the Adele concert. For the positive, the view we had from our room was amazing! Brisbane is a gorgeous city.  However, I don't think that hotel had quite realised how many people would be staying; there was always a line up at the reception desk because there never seemed to be enough staff on. This was the same for breakfast. The restaurant did not have enough staff on and tables had many dishes piled up.  The worst part of the stay was after we had checked out. We realised we had left a brand new face wash in the shower and called 2 hours after checking out to ask if it could be put aside for collection later that afternoon. The person with whom I spoke, Callum I believe, told me he would call back within the hour after checking with housekeeping. By 3 o'clock, we had returned to Brisbane City, not having heard from Callum. We went to the hotel to follow up, to be told they had not sent anyone to check and to wait while somebody did. Unfortunately, we were forgotten about, again, and after 40 minutes of waiting, we spoke to Norman, who told us that someone had come to him 20 minutes prior to let him know there was no face wash found.  I found it disappointing that the staff were unwilling to follow up on guest inquiries, and seemed to forget us when we came back. Additionally, and more concerning is the seeming lack of integrity by staff towards guest's lost property. Although this was only a $30 face wash, if this is how I can expect lost property to be treated, it makes me wonder what would happen with something more valuable (eg electronics or jewellery).~3~3~nan~5~nan~nan~1~nan
review_466379544~“Location”~Have stayed at Ibis building before, but never ibis styles. I can see why they're the top of the range for Ibis. Everything was modern and clean, room was a bit tiny though, but was perfect for our one night stay while we went to the Casino and Irish Pub downstairs. The hotel is located right outside of both and takes no more than 3 minutes to walk there. Also right outside the Queen St Mall and Myer Centre. If you want a centrally located hotel in Brisbane, this ones for you! Especially with the nice rates as well. I booked 2 days in advance and still got a very good deal on our corner room overlooking the Brisbane River. Staff was were great as well. Will definitely be returning in the future!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465518768~“Central and clean but needs service improvements”~Stayed with friends for the weekend. The Pros. Very central - above the main shopping mall so easy to get around on foot Can pay extra for a 9 am check-in which is great coming off a long haul flight Rooms are light and airy with aircon Cons We booked a twin but were called to be told no twins available so had to have a king bed instead ( ok but we were friends, not a couple so not ideal). Upon check in our friend who booked afterwards was given a twin, so either they lied to us about no twins or don't respect those who book earlier. ( even more annoying as an Accor member) The bar/restaurant area has a very poor atmosphere - better to go out and eat elsewhere Housekeeping was non-existent - we asked 3 times for room to be made up, had the notice on the door and even stopped staff in the corridor but no beds were made, no towels changed nor anything replenished. When we complained at reception were told 'awww she's gone home' no solution offered and not really what I expect at 7pm after several requests. Overall if you want cheap and cheerful but don't expect high level of service then it's a good choice~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~2~nan

review_464647476~“Funky hotel let down by staff”~Really impressed with the first impressions of this hotel. Bright funky modern colours and in a great location. Hotel is in a great location, had great wifi and utilized space well in an abnormally small 18sqm room. Beds were extremely comfy! This was perfect for us for an overnight stay however I would not stay here if I was hoping to relax at the hotel as I couldn't sleep due to the loud Irish pub right outside my window. Now to the minor inconveniences to our stay....We were checked into our room earlier than the guaranteed check in time of 2pm and were gifted with a surprise $20 on our bill on checkout as payment for an early arrival which was not discussed with us on arrival. I had 2 x rooms booked and we had prepaid in advance yet when I got the the hotel the receptionist told me I was still owing $100 on each room. Lucky I had a copy of my confirmation letter on me showing the room I booked was $199 NOT $299 otherwise I would've been expected to fork out an extra $100 per room. The receptionist also had issues with out account on check out as we wanted to pay separately for 2 x $10 hot breakfast upgrades which must be a difficult task to split this account into 2 x separate payments. Staying over the Adele concert weekend I also would've expected to have more than 1 x staff member on the desk considering they were fully booked. All in all, I would return. I assume staff are only new and need more experience. Loved the different colourful floors.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464185663~“Stay for location. Don't if u want extras.”~Stayed here for work for 4 nites. As all other reviews have stated, being situated along Elizabeth Street is really amazing for travellers who just wanna stay within the CBD. The South Bank is easily accessible and all the shopping that you need is just behind the hotel. However, the hotel is really 'basic' - toothbrushes and bottled water are not provided . The room is comfortably small and the TV selection is really simple.  So before you decide, see what matters to you most. As I was on biz, I was happy with the fundamentals when it came to the room. But if with family, the Hilton is just down the street.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464059653~“Superior River View - AMAZING!”~This hotel is extremely well located. It is definitely worth to pay a little extra and book the Superior River View Room (superior = high floor, room sizes are all the same, except for corner rooms). The view is absolutely amazing! The hotel is brand new and the rooms are comfy. However they are small and have very little storage available, so not recommended for long stays. When you book a room with breakfast, you will be offered a cold continental buffet. To upgrade to a hot buffet, you will need to pay 10$ per day. The rose scent in the lobby is nice, but overpowering. It could be reduced a notch. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much mostly due to the location and the stunning view!~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463585264~“Best view in Brisbane”~I love this Ibis, its just the best location for the CBD and has views across to the southbank that must be the envy of all the others. 60 seconds walk form the Mall and the Casino. Perfect. The rooms are just big enough to be comfortable of 2 :) As an Accors member you need to go Wednesday evening for a meet and greet in the restaurant.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463346677~“Not sure I'd stay again”~Possibly the noisiest air conditioning we have ever experienced at a hotel. Not the best nights sleep due to the noise. The hotel was ok for what we needed, just a 1 night stay in the city. The location is good. Limited bathroom amenities are supplied, shampoo, no conditioner, no soap, just shower gel. I guess you get what you pay for? It was very affordable compared to other city hotels.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462921430~“No Free wifi in rooms. great location”~One of the main reasons i chose this hotel as on tripadvisor it stated that it had free wifi. so i expected that that was in your room. It would have been nice to be told that it was only in the common areas, or if you became a member. had already paid for a day as i was there for work. Also being told of the parking/been able to look up about the parking would have been hand before we got there. was not told of the validating of the tickets until we asked. It the little things that are annoying and would have even been nice to read about by other people that has stayed. now vent s over the location is great. staff friendly and rooms clean and bed comfortable. Now i know the deal with the above more than happy to stay again and recommend.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_461293478~“AMAZING HOTEL IN BRISBANE.”~We booked this "Budget Hotel" for an overnight stay, because all we wanted was a bed for the night. We planned to arrive late evening and leave the next morning. This Hotel is nothing like what we consider Budget. The decor is awesome, the bed was so comfortable, I fell asleep as soon as, my head hit the pillow and didn't wake up until my usual time 6am. Breakfast also was delicious. The staff are also very friendly. We'll be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_461064670~“Well located place”~I stayed a single night in this hotel. I arrived earlier and staff offered me a check in at 12:00 for an extra cost then I waited 14:00 the normal check in time. Room I booked was the cheapest then I was in the 4th floor where you do not expect to have an wonderfull view.  The room is very well equiped!! The real advantage of this hotel are location/price. I recommend this hotel if you want to be close to shops and main streets.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461063772~“Paid wifi. Expensive parking”~Ibis hotel rooms and service was all good. But it had paid wifi in rooms and free in lobby. It does not parking of its own. Customers are to park in myers street car park. They have a deal with myer car park for $38 whole day instead of $72 but you can only enter in once. No multiple entries allowed!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_460803468~“Nice Hotel but With Problems”~Staff were very good and helpful. Check-in and check-out quick and efficient. Excellent location, although no in-property parking. Food in the restaurant/bar was below the standard expected for the price with slow service. Plenty of bright colours abound and the rooms are good although a little on the small side but compensation for the views if you are lucky enough to get on the river side. Fridge in room was either faulty or else the wrong model as it barely kept water bottles at a drinkable temperature - at a guess it didn't get below about 12 degrees if that. Good hotel for the price but could easily be a great hotel if the disappointments are addressed.~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_460590979~“Unexpected gem right in the heart of Brisbane City”~Ibis Styles on Elizabeth is a charming, modern, clean and comfortable hotel, that, given its location, I would have expected to pay a lot more for. You can literally pop into the Queen Street Mall without raising your body temperature - everything you need is extremely close. Highlights for me have been the value for money, free wifi, the exceptionally comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower, air-conditioning,  I would have really liked a jug of cold water in the fridge, but other than that, I have found my stay here to be very comfortable, relaxing and homelike.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_460492663~“weekend getaway”~nice clean comfortable hotel, amazing location great facilities. Rooms were good sized and had all amenities. Staff were nice and friendly. Breakfast was a let down - empty containers and not a great variety for $20 per head a bit expensive too~4~4~5~4~4~4~5~nan

review_460186188~“Trying...and occasionally VERY trying!”~The Ibis does not pretend to be an upscale facility. This hotel is well-located with a river view available convenient to the CBD. The rooms are small but functional and reflect the "budget" approach. My complaint is relatively trivial. I assume it is part of the hotel's desired "style" but the blaring music in reception intended to make the younger set welcome is alienating to the actual clientele comprised of business people and budget conscious travellers. One can neither hear nor be heard by staff at the reception desk and in an aside, two of those staff agreed with my observation regarding the noxious level of sound. My second complaint concerns the practice of puttung a hold on the credit card for the full room rate plus $50. In my case, they processed that hold twice and reportedly could do nothing to correct that error assuring me it would be removed when the actual charge was processed. I personally don't like the process because it can neither be easily explained nor understood.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459915672~“Great fresh new hotel 💐”~Overnight stay to attend the Bruce Springsteen concert. Arrived early (midday) but was checked in without any problems. Bright fresh reception area and really happy and friendly staff (check in and check out next morning). Room was small but perfectly laid out, bathroom functional and well lit.

review_458239229~“Clean, new, good access to everywhere”~I have stayed at this ibis styles for 4 nites. First of all, the location is great. You will see the Myer right next to the hotel and the south bank park if you cross the beautiful bridge on foot.  The building is new so everything inside the hotel is clean and fresh(doesnt smell) The breakfast was also great. They have yogurt, fresh fruits, coffee, tea, croissant, bread, oatmeal and so on for cold. You can also upgrade your meal to a warm breakfast if you pay extra charge.  The wifi is optional as far as I know, and in my accommodation plan the wifi service was included. The wifi speed was quite good.  I definetly want to stay this hotel again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457833505~“Good for the price”~Nice new hotel in a brilliant central location. Literally everything is on your doorstep! Good standards of cleanliness and everything you would expect and need in your room.  Bed was really comfortable. Only slight downsides were the room was very small and the gym was a typical hotel token effort of a gym, made worse by the air con being stuck on hot so I had to work out in a sauna!  For the price though you can't go to far wrong with this hotel~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457708984~“Great service awesome room and fantastic location”~As above I have always thoroughly enjoyed every stay at this hotel. Friendly staff excellent value for money. If you wish to make a great trip even better you can do as we do, after check out head up to the Sofitel and enjoy the seafood smorgasbord lunch. Then you can catch the train from central station ( under the Sofital) and head in to the airport very content!!!!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_457270236~“It tries hard to be trendy”~Nice little hotel in the middle of the city. Had a basic room overlooking the casino and Southbank which was nice. Room facilities were basic as was breakfast but for less than $130 a night not too bad. I would bother paying the extra for the continental breakfast - just head 'round the corner to any number of cafes for something much better. The colour scheme of the foyer and restaurant/bar tries too hard.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457079894~“The facilities and location is B0$$.”~I spent couple of nights here and it was a great experience. The location in the center of Brisbane CBD is amazing for its more than fair price. The rooms are small but are exactly what a business person requires during their stay in Brisbane City. The rooms have modern facilities, especially their bathrooms. I found no problems with noise even during a Friday night. The hotel has a small gym with some choice machines. Customer service definitely can be improved with the right mindset, but acceptable levels. Book direct and prepay your bookings to save money, and you have the choice of paying a small fee for early check-in from 9AM, full-breakfast option, or 5pm check-out. They don't have parking but if that is the only issue, then happy days. Join the Accor Hotels loyalty program for added benefits over time.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~nan

review_456916080~“Good City Location”~Just stayed one night here. The Lobby staff were welcoming and a special mention to Lisa who looked after us. The decor throughout the hotel was modern and very colourful especially the carpet! The bed was very comfortable and good pressure in the shower. A little disappointed when looking for a small object in the room that the shelving over the TV had not been dusted! The hotel only opened a few months ago. I would recommend a stay here as I will return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Bad things: - no room to unpack your stuff - no shelves, no cupboards, no drawers. Very small rooms. We had to take all our stuff in our suitcases. No shelves in a bathroom to arrange your cosmetics. In a laundry room there were 4 washers but only 1 dryer. After washing a lots of our stuff (after already 3 weeks vacations) I spent almost all night to dry them.~3~nan~5~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_455772684~“Night After a Week in Asia”~After a hectic business week in Asia, arriving back in Brisbane, I decided to have a chill out night in Brisbane before returning home to the Gold Coast. The Ibis Styles Brisbane Elizabeth Street is the perfect place for one.  Funky decor, bright, airy & plenty of light with great views of the Brisbane River, it is great value in comparison to many a more expensive Brisbane CBD Hotel. Centrally located, short walk from Central (Brisbane) Station, this hotel is my go to while transiting or on business in Brisbane. Excellent staff & speedy check in / check out makes for a fabulous experience. Stay there ... you will enjoy~5~5~4~4~4~5~5~nan

review_454976294~“The place to stay”~I recently had need to attend a funeral in Brisbane with my 84 year old mother on a walker .We live on the Northern Beaches of Sydney with views of the ocean and had just experienced hotter weather than Brisbane gets so was hoping that the Hotel would be well air conditioned for our stay . It was and the lifts are lighting fast The views of the south bank night and day from the luxurious bed are amazing from room 2305 .A corner room situated just below the owner of the hotels suite. Floor to ceiling glass Its is fresh funky and very comfortable and reasonably priced Easy access to main mall, myer centre, casino and great restaurants and bars You really are in the middle of things The bed and linen is (not kidding) the best I have ever slept in. I had to share the queen bed with my mum but you would never have even known she was in the room. Bathroom although small was well done and easy and safe for mum to use and great shower head pressure The breakfast room is fantastic bright ,food above par for hotels .Staff could not be more helpful with luggage to car even and help watching mum while I went to hire car Above and beyond I believe in service required . If we get to travel again This is the go to Hotel in Brisbane .~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_454618077~“Great location and service”~We loved our rooms but also loved the location so close to shopping and to the casino for some in our party.

Breakfast is this charming, eclectic cafe was also great!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_454323656~“Fantsastic views”~Our room had a fantastic view across the city and the river, huge floor to ceiling windows (but good curtains to block the morning sun). Even the bathroom had the floor to ceiling views. The bed was very comfy and the room was modern, tidy and clean with good aircon. The central location was very convenient (we had no car) close to shops, restaurants and bars.  The room rate was very reasonable and included a basic continental breakfast.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_453973527~“Very comfy.”~Very comfy hotel with all the usual faculties in the room. Good choice of tv channels. Air Conditioning standard throughout the hotel. Good access for wheelchairs and pushchairs.  Parking is in the shopping mall car park at the rear of the hotel. As a guest you get a discounted rate but it's still quite pricey. No other choice as the street parking is confusing. But you must validate your ticket through the hotel or you will be charged full rate! That's not for the faint hearted.  Good choice of breakfast foods, we only had continental all you can eat, but for a $10pp fee you can have the cooked breakfast all you can eat. Various cereals and types of bread on offer. Fresh juices and hot drinks, fruit and yoghurts.  Very clean hotel, friendly staff and quiet throughout.  Roughly £50 a night we paid but had booked 9 months in advance online.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_452859543~“Great location”~Loved it... in the heart of the city. Check in/out does get busy but no rush as we were on holidays, but they could probably use another person at the counter on occasions. Had read reviews that the rooms were a bit small but there was only 2 of us and it was fine. Only used the room for sleeping and the bed was so soft.. had no problems sleeping. That is really the main thing I worry about when we go away is the bed because if you cant sleep you don't enjoy it and well they have got the most important thing right. The bathroom is small but only was having a shower and it was very clean so again the important things are all taken care of. Breakfast was continental but it was great. You can choose from different cereals, my favourite is muesli and it was delicious. Should of asked what brand they use as I loved it. There was a range of bread/toast options, fruits, ham, cheese, and pastries... everything you need to start the day. Could upgrade to cooked breakfast but we didn't feel the need as we love cereal and fruit.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_452506655~“Terrible service, air-con not working”~We arrived at the Ibis Styles Elizabeth Street, Brisbane at 1:50pm on Saturday the 31st December 2016 and the first thing that we noticed was the line up to check in was out the door, not a great start but probably to be expected on New Year’s Eve. Once we were checked in, we proceed to our room, a western facing room on the 18th floor with floor to ceiling windows, and the first thing we noticed walking into the room was the smell of stale air and stinky cleaning products. To get to the hotel we decided to park at Southbank to avoid the $30-something dollar a night parking in the city and then walk across Victoria bridge through the 38 degree heat, bags in tow, so naturally once we arrived in our room all we wanted to do was relax in our nice air-conditioned room, however, when we entered the room we found that the air-conditioning had not yet been turned on. We immediately turned the air-conditioning on and decided to go and purchase some necessary grocery items while we waited for it to cool down. After arriving back at the room we found that the air-con was still not operating and while loading groceries (including cold meat and alcohol) into the impossibly small bar fridge we discovered that it too was not cooling properly (what are the odds?). We called down to reception to see if we could find out what was going on and were told that it was probably just our unit playing up and if we reset it with our room key it should be back to normal. We followed the instructions we were given and waited until 3:30pm but still no results so we called reception again and this time we were told that air-con throughout the entire hotel had stopped working and that they would have someone call us back to give us an update. After not hear back from anyone for over 45 minutes we called reception and asked if it would be possible to cancel our stay and get our money back as we had at that point been sitting in a room with no air-conditioning, no fans, no windows and no ventilation for over 2 hours and haven’t been given any indication of when it might be fixed. We were told by hotel staff that as we had booked through Booking.Com instead of directly with them we would have to contact Booking.Com to get them to request a refund on our behalf, being NYE it then took us around 1 ½ hours on hold to get through to Booking.Com call center where a very kind gentleman put through the necessary request for refund to the hotel. When we approached hotel staff again we were then told that the person authorised to approve refunds was uncontactable as she was “too busy at her own New Year’s Eve party with family” so we wouldn’t know until New Year’s day whether or not our refund was going to be approved. We decided to persevere as we were not willing to leave not knowing whether or not we would be refunded for a two night stay (almost $600), however, after being told multiple different and conflicting stories we had finally had enough and decided to check out of the hotel at around 8:45pm. On leaving we were able to speak to a manager who informed us that there were no guarantees as to whether or not we would be able to get our money back should we choose to leave but that they would have someone contact us the following day to lets us know what was going to happen. After not hearing from anyone from the hotel for 2 days after the incident we decided to call and follow up and were then sent an account stating that we would only be receiving around half of the room fees back as they had wrongly recorded in their system that we had stayed one night instead of checking out. We then called the hotel a second time and after much debate were told that we would receive a full refund back within 48 hours. 4 business days after that call there was still no sign of our refund, we called the hotel yet again and were told yet more lies. In the end we have received all our money back but to be honest that really isn’t sufficient compensation for the absolutely horrific service that we experienced while staying with Ibis Styles Elizabeth Street, Brisbane. We are understanding people and appreciate that sometimes these things happen, but the lack of communication and constant stream of lies we were told throughout the evening and for the days following are what have angered us the most. We will be telling everyone we know never to stay at your hotels again. Kind Regards,~1~nan~nan~1~1~nan~1~nan
review_451997148~“Great views and excellent stay”~Stayed on floor 24 with views over Brisbane river. Hotel is very handy to shopping and performing arts centre. Very comfortable bed and air conditioning very welcome on 36 degree day but room took a few minutes to cool. Clean and tidy with excellent shower and handy fridge. Parking in adjoining Myer centre car park is handy and the discounted rate for hotel guests is very good but Brisbane parking is very expensive. Limited space outside hotel to park and unload but quick access from car park. A little noise from adjoining room but not enough to disturb sleep. Booking system and reception very helpful. This is the second Ibis Styles we have stayed in and enjoy the service and experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451969323~“Good location. Fun hotel”~Last minute getaway and decided to try somwhere new to stay.  Great location and a funky feel to both the hotel main areas and rooms.  Beautiful city views with all the modcons needed.  My only 2 issues were the very vibrant colours in dome areas. Which did seem to give you a bit of a headache at times if u come from a dark area. And the blacklit lift area was a little disconcerting as made you feel like you were entering an attraction where somone would jump and scare you.  Over all great place and the corner room with floor to celing windows. Very nice.  Great place on a budget.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451823812~“Convenient ”~My wife and I had an overnight stay at this hotel while I spent a day at the cricket , and my wife spent the day shopping. The hotel is very well positioned being right in the cbd, within walking distance of a lot of entertainment venues and restaurants. Of course there is the shopping as well. The hotel itself is very functional with excellent sound proofing. We didn't eat in as there were too many fun restaurants close by. Only downside is that there was no in house car parking, and we had to take our chances in a public car park next door.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_451400458~“R &R trip before going back to work”~Loved the bright colours shown on their web site so decided to try it for my mini break. Loved my room. Sprung for the king bed with a river view, spectacular.  Located on the 22nd floor and didn't hear a thing. Must remember to ask for the same room next time. Continental brekkie was enough for me. Located beside the Myers Centre, transit buses, taxi rank around the corner, free circle bus stop in the next block over.  All the staff were friendly and helpful, not just the "have a nice day" spiel.  Will definitely return.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451147062~“I really wanted to love”~The location of this hotel is five star and was just perfect for our pre cruise stay of one night. So close to shops galore and an easy stroll to Southbank. The service was good when checking in. They did forget to give me my welcome pack and in my excitement I didn't realise. When I went to get it later that night they couldn't find it. No biggy as we weren't planning on using the drink voucher anyway.  Quick to access from the airport and not far (15min) to the cruise ship terminal. What let our stay down was the noise. I had requested a quiet room and unfortunately we were placed on the fifth floor, overlooking Elizabeth Street. This seemed great at first, until bedtime when we realised there was a VERY loud and popular pub next door. Even with ear plugs in I could hear the banging music for hours. Our travel buddies had a room at the back of the hotel and on a higher level and they said their room was reasonably quiet.  Continental breakfast was included and was enough to start the day. Basic but acceptable. Wifi was terrible and we just couldn't connect so just used our own data.  We did pay the extra $15 for early check in which was fantastic when flying in early. Being Accor members we were given flexibility on our check out time which was a plus.  With so many positives it is just such a shame the noise was so bad.~3~4~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan

review_450850836~“very good, almost 5 star”~There were a lot of good things here...the bed was superb; the room technology (TV, wifi, even a little blue tooth sound-system-cum-alarm) was very good; the aspect -- We splashed out on a corner king room -- was excellent; the overall standard of maintenance was clearly good; and the location was very handy. There were also, however, a few items which (in our view) held it back from 5-stars, viz. there was only one chair in the room (really annoying and easily fixed); there was no mini-bar which seemed odd for a premium room; and the layout was not well considered with a large 'dead' space in the entry area that could've accommodated a suitcase stand and even a desk to leave more of the window/view area unobstructed and also make the overall room seem more spacious. The parking arrangements ($20 overnight in the Myer Centre carpark) are also noteworthy in that they're reasonably priced for a CBD location -- That's good -- BUT they require lugging suitcases through the shopping centre, onto the street and then into the hotel. All-in-all though, a good spot to stay in Brisbane CBD.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_450646278~“Fantastic service”~We (two couples) had booked a night at the Ibis Styles, Brisbane for New Year's Eve (2016-2017). Everything was handled well but because of the hot weather and the number of guests, our air conditioning packed in. I do not blame the hotel. It was just bad luck. Nevertheless, they handled our immediate check out (at 10pm) very well (well done Coleman) and compensated us with a replacement night at some later date with an upgrade and a full buffet breakfast. We used that last night and, once again, the staff were excellent. I was most impressed. Well done  The hotel rooms were clean and well equipped and, apart from the air conditioning, all else went very well. P.F.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_450627823~“Brilliant location”~We stayed for a few nights at the Ibis Styles in the heart of Brisbane.  Close to all the best shopping, food and even the casino, you are walking distance also to places like South Brisbane and Fortitude Valley.  Now the rooms are very small when entering but because of the breathtaking views you soon get used to it as it feels larger from the wall of glass.  It has most things one needs and the staff are really lovely. The rooms and hallways could do with some more focus on cleaning and presentation as you will see in my pictures. It wasn't soul destroying but could be improved.  The restaurant is great for breakfast and you could not be in a better spot to visit this vibrant city.  Great mid ranged hotel well worth the price.~4~5~nan~3~nan~nan~5~nan
