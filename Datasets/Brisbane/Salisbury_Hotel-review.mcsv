review_472016340~“Mid week time off from cooking.”~Great value steak meal - good quality meal for under $20 fresh salad great chips and the steak is always cooked the way I order it - medium rare. Staff are always efficient and friendly. Wife said to give a 3 star because the atmosphere is not so hot but we just go there for a mid week feed which is always good so I'm giving a 4 star. Also easy access and plenty of car parks.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440476754~“Good location and clean rooms”~I booked one night at this hotel as we were having a 40 year school reunion at this hotel's bistro. I thought this would be convenient as I wont have far to go after at late night of drinking and socialising. The night actually finished at 2am. Rooms have been refurbished and are clean and tidy but basic. My room was small (Queen room) but my friend who was also staying at the hotel had a much larger room (Queen/Single) The accommodation is located at the rear of the hotel and I found it very quiet and had a great nights sleep. There was plenty of coffee, tea sachets provided with adequate long life milk in the fridge. Bathroom provided 2 small soaps but surprisingly no shampoo or conditioner. Wall mounted flat screen tv was convenient to watch from the bed. Air conditioning was a split system so operation was quiet and provided nice cold air conditioning. Location is good with a small shopping centre nearby coffee shop etc with McDonalds next door. Bus stop is a 5 minute walk away and you can get to Westfield Garden City or the city by the 120 bus. The hotel provided reasonable value at $95 per night.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_357438314~“Great value, great location”~Look, it ain't the Ritz but for $105 per night, it's a great little find. The rooms are clean, plenty of tea and coffee supplies, air con works and its not noisy or stinky. The food at the restaurant was pleasantly surprisingly good. There's a McDonald's on site that delivers to your room 24 hours a day, heaps of shops near by. But most of all the staff were all really really lovely. Professional and we'll presented and really nice people.  If you need a quick stop good priced place to stay, I highly recommend the Salisbury Hotel~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_221656823~“Salisbury”~Stayed here for 3 days as was close to an event we were attending.it was a motel room which was average but very clean . It is in an industrial area so not much around the area. It has a big hotel attached which has a bistro, sports bar which has nice meals. Good outdoor area attached to the sports bar. The rooms are out of the way around the back and away from the bars. Lots of parking. Staff very helpful.The only downfall is they don't do breakfast .~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_213539441~“A reasonible budget option if you need to be in this area”~Check-in is done inside the Sportsman's bar, and the manager there (Brett) won't be winning any awards for "welcoming warmth" but he WAS quite efficient. The rest of the staff were friendly, and the sportsman's bar is a great place to chill-out, get yourself fed and have a few quiet beers. A wide range of meal options in the sportsman's bar go for $12. The room is basic but clean and comfortable with the few little essentials people want, like coffee/tea set and a bar fridge. Aside from the two blankets provided there are no means of warming the room during the cold snap which was happening at the time. The room is serviced daily, but not thoroughly cleaned as such... fresh towels, bed made (same sheets), bin emptied is about all there was to it. The shower was very weak (thanks to compulsory water saving shower heads in Brisbane) and it took an age for the hot water to flow. No internet or wifi in the rooms, but I was told by one of the regulars in the bar that IF you purchase a coca-cola product in the sportsman's bar you could get a wifi password to use in there. The doors do not have a "spy-hole" which is something that should be addressed considering the open location where anyone can just wander past. I had a woman knocking at my door at 11pm at night wanting me to "drive her somewhere" which I declined to do. There is no phone in the room to quickly contact reception if any security issue should arise, you're on your own. For a rate at under $100 per night, the Salisbury was good value overall and suited my needs.~3~4~4~4~3~3~3~nan
review_164836393~“Good value”~Good value room in a nice clean hotel. The hotel also has good priced meals. It is a good honest working mans pub that also offers rooms. Located close to alternative food opportunities and with a bottle shop close by you are almost spoilt for choice. Perfect for what I wanted when I stayed.~4~5~4~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_159236285~“Affordable, comfortable, and perfect for accomodation during sports events”~We wanted a basic, affordable, neat and tidy room with two beds (queen & single), for evenings as we were involved in a tennis event at the Queensland Tennis Centre, and we certainly got what we wanted. The Salisbury Hotel/Motel was very reasonably priced, and conveniently situated, with a Subway, Mcdonalds, Zarraffas, Foodworks, and Burger takeaway next door. The rooms are far from the road, so are very quiet, which enabled us to get two good nights sleep. Will definitely consider returning for similar events.~4~5~5~5~4~4~4~nan
