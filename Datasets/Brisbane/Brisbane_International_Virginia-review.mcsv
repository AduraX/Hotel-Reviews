review_478383617~‚ÄúA bit of a surprise and a good one.‚Äù~Stayed here for 2 nights - was initially a bit concerned as people I asked in Brisbane had never heard of this hotel.  Yes, it is an older style building and is on one level but, is has been renovated and is very comfortable, the bathrooms were very clean and the room design works well. It is a very large place and is at first a bit tricky to find your way around but there are plenty of signs.  I ate in the restaurant one night and the food was excellent.  I had breakfast twice and there is a choice either a continental or full breakfast ‚Äì again very good food. I was here for a conference and the facilities were very good, they were well set up with technology and the Wi-Fi worked well in both the guest rooms and the conference rooms. The food provided for the conference was again very good. Another advantage is the hotel is very close to Brisbane airport ‚Äì about 15 minutes by road. Can recommend to stay or as a conference facility.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478103415~‚ÄúComfortable, Quiet & Cosy - Good $$ Value‚Äù~As overnight guests attending the Brisbane Entertainment Centre this was Ideal Accommodation as only 10 minutes away. The King Room was very well appointed, comfortable & cosy.. By shutting the Bathroom Door made the Spacious Room Quiet (Nil Road Noise).. Free Parking was available directly at our Door. Staff at both the Reception & Restaurant were very friendly & helpful.. We found the Tariff to be Extremely Reasonable for an overnight stay within approx. 20k's of Brisbane City with Free Parking.. We would definitely recommend & would definitely return in the future.. Well done Brisbane International Virginia continue with the Room Refurbishments they are very tastefully completed!..~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_477734425~‚ÄúWedding March 2017‚Äù~In March of 2017 we had our wedding at Brisbane International Virginia. The whole experience was excellent and they ensured our wedding day was a lovely occasion to remember. Jodie managed our wedding and she did an amazing job, making sure our day was special and even though rain could have spoiled our day she ensured an indoor ceremony at the Alexander Room was organised and that it still was really nice. The Kentia Room is where we had our reception and the room simply looked stunning. The effort which the staff had gone to in setting it up really showed and we can't thank them enough. The food was great and our guests all told us how much they enjoyed it as did we. The staff on the night were friendly, professional and ensured our night ran smoothly, and all of our guests had a wonderful time as did we. Some of the wedding party stayed at the hotel and they were very impressed with their stay, the rooms and the service. My Best Man who traveled over from Perth and stayed at the hotel for 4 nights thoroughly enjoyed his stay and made particular good mention of Peter at Reception and David from the Restaurant.  Overall the whole experience was magical and we are so thankful to all the staff at Brisbane International Virginia for providing us with such a great wedding and we would have no issue in recommending them to anyone who is planning their own wedding and looking for a venue to hold it at.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476252907~‚ÄúExcellent for a stopover‚Äù~We stayed here overnight for a layover, to rest after a long flight. It met all our expectations. The location distance from airport is reasonable, 10 to 15 min by taxi around $35 each way, Good value for a triple room and both beds were super comfy. The room was quiet considering it is next to a main road. As an added bonus they have a really good restaurant on site, RockLily, which was good value for lunch, (see seperate review). The airconditioning worked really well - super quiet and very efficient. Room was very well cleaned and lovely linens. Staff we spoke with - Sharon at check-in, Peter to book us an early taxi and lovely waitress (blonde/pink hair) - name escapes me - all a credit to this hotel/motel. Pool is small and only has a couple of loungers however it turned out to be a bit to cold to risk getting in! For us this was an excellent motel style establishment for a one night stopover.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_475388880~‚ÄúExcellent value for money‚Äù~The staff were fantastic, the facilities were excellent. The restaurant was a wonderful experience with great food.

review_474824057~‚ÄúBereavement visit ‚Äù~This little place was a great little place to stop over for the night before flying out home. It was clean and simple as well as well priced. Restaurant a little over priced going by the menu, but very handy to local takeaways.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472856233~‚Äúlook else where‚Äù~Unhelpful staff-poor lighting made for an unimpressive stay.The mini bar in my room was empty-fearing I might be charge for the contents- I was told so rudely some rooms have it and some not-you are the have not-when I asked if I could have some items-we had traveled a long distance I was told virtually bad luck. Breakfast was cold on delivery to my room and the coffee even colder. The lighting was terrible in the room and the TV so low it was difficult to watch.~2~nan~2~2~nan~nan~1~nan
review_472323861~‚ÄúTired, tried hard though‚Äù~Our room was a little tired to say the least. No fly screens on any of the windows for a start, so no fresh air, although the AC worked fine fresh air can be fun too. Bathroom and fittings a little sad. Not much to speak of in the area either although I am sure a bit more hunting would have turned up a couple of places to eat. Pho Ever, a Vietnamese restaurant is just down the road and is well worth a visit for good inexpensive food with a healthy smile and good service. Meanwhile the Virginia, good points are lots and lots of rooms so any function or conference there would be a winner indeed.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_471780197~‚ÄúRooms are tired and not best value for money‚Äù~I checked into the hotel mid evening , the 2 bedroom appartment was very tired looking in arrival and a few mosquitos present in the room, in addition the wireless was not working which was a pain as urgent to complete some deadlines for work . Breakfast was well organised and good quality of food and friendly staff. Just feel that it did not represent good value for money.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471539191~‚ÄúüëéüèΩ‚Äù~The place claims it's a 4‚≠êÔ∏è. I would say it's maybe a 3. Clean enough but a little sketchy looking. They advertise free wifi. We didn't get it. Our neighbours couldn't access it either. We were told it was just down but our neighbour had been there for2 days and hadn't been able to log on! Reception didn't care at all. Just kept saying I don't know how to fix it. The area it's in really sucks too. Nothing to see or eat nearby mostly industrial businesses around it. We stayed 1 night and left because it sucked!! And it was expensive for a crappy place!!!! Wouldn't go back!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467902133~‚ÄúClean & reasonably priced accommodation‚Äù~We stayed just one night at the Brisbane International, Virginia( passing through). It is actually more like a motel than a hotel. We had found it on line. Re location: it was a $ 35.00 taxi ride from the airport -- (no shuttle), so once we paid 2 cab fares it was not such a great bargain -- it is on a very busy road (6lanes) but it was very quiet for sleeping. It is in an industrial area --so there is not much around. The place was extremely clean, the pool quite small but nicely laid out, and the grounds were well maintained. We ate in the restaurant and the food was good.  It was a great passing through spot -- beds good, staff very pleasant, & restaurant much better than average.  We would stay again if passing through Brisbane.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Wifi great speed 60mb+ bus stop very close bus 310 about 40 minutes to city good take away choice close but also had vgood meal in restaurant. If cooking in room rangehood is useless had to open doors and windows. No bbq area available to cook outside on site. Pool area and pool nice. Laundry good has a gym that looks fairly new (through window....on holiday , not going in !). Telstra mobile coverage good. Some traffic noise during the peak hour but ok at night~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_463936134~‚ÄúAn Excellent Choice.‚Äù~We stayed here overnight ready for the airport the next day. The rooms were excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful. The room was spacious and clean. The hotel is well located just off Sandgate Road and very close also to the Entertainment Centre. The evening meal was something out of the box - in fact an evening out for a meal could be ideal.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463676678~‚ÄúBest feature is proximity to the Entertainment Centre‚Äù~We chose BI-V because of its proximity to the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. Set on a sprawling site, the rooms are motel-style accommodation. Furnishings are a little jaded but otherwise comfortable. Housekeeping looked surprised when we would not let them service the room at 9 am. You need to book ASAP when there is a big concert at the Ent Cent. Overall, BI-V satisfied our needs.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_460566233~‚ÄúLovely Spot‚Äù~Stayed here on arrival in Brisbane after 32hrs of international travel. Room was quiet, comfortable and clean, a great spot after a long journey. Staff were lovely and considerate ad gave us a late checkout to allow for extra sleep.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459470077~‚ÄúVery nice property with resort feel, well presented, clean and tidy‚Äù~immaculate presentation with friendly staff, excellent room , stayed in apartments at rear on second level due to the fact there is a separate dining lounge away from bedroom. Table and chairs so this was important to have business meeting next day. Only issue I had was the roadside room I had was very noisy due to traffic and very thin windows, had to turn up air con to drown traffic noise out, my advice is to ask for a internal room away from road as its a real race track at night, apart from that I will definitely stay again , good gym too~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_459097133~‚ÄúRelocation to Queensland‚Äù~We relocated from Sydney to Queensland in January. The move was made so much easier by our stay at Brisbane International - Virginia.

review_456799028~‚ÄúClean and really comfortable bed, really friendly staff‚Äù~We arrived late but that's not a problem with the 24 hours reception. Next morning was Australia Day and we were to late for breakfast (untill 9am..) so the reception called several places to check if anything was open. So they really did an effort, that was really nice.  Not a charming bathroom and you can't put anything on a hook or something because the shower is separate from the sink area.  But clean, good wifi and an amazing bed. Maby the best we had in Australia! So good.  Also laundry and pool available. Free parking!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The beds are very comfortable with well appointed kitchen. The Grandchildren loved the swimming pool it had a very nice shaded areas with comfortable daybeds to sit and relax. The bonus is the places to eat or get takeaway just a short stroll away.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Although we did not cook meals etc it was nice to be able to make cuppa's and have Wine etc in the fridge.

review_455886267~‚Äúmisleading as airport hotel‚Äù~hotel was listed as an airport hotel. no airport transfer available and would refer to it as a motel and definitely not a 4 star hotel. uber ride 20-30 dollars not under 10. only good point was the friendly restaurant staff.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_453501947~‚ÄúExceptional customer service‚Äù~The staff were so helpful, from the confirmation call the day before to checking in, they couldn't be more helpful. Our room was a twin and had an adjoining door which was a tad thin because we could hear the neighbours very easily. Beds were very comfy. Shower was over a bath and it tended to be quite high to get in & out of, also a little slippery. There is a very tropical resort type layout which was nice. We opted for the buffet brekky and it was more than enough. We would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We stayed in a two bed apartment which was clean and comfortable. Free wifi was a hit and a second TV in the bedroom was a bonus. We only stayed for one night so it was more than adequate.

Having stayed in many of the accommodation options within reasonably close proximity to the airport I found this to be the best value of them all. The layout of the property is great, the room was large, well presented and with a big bathroom. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Even the mini fridge and air con were quiet. There is a restaurant on the premises, plus there is a tavern and take-away options nearby. I was concerned that noise from traffic might be a problem but this did not prove to be the case. In fact it was very quiet. I will definitely stay here again if working in the area.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_440082889~‚ÄúOk‚Äù~Not worth the price paid. Stayed there for 4 nights. Rooms, bathroom and kitchen are old and dark and in need of a renovation. Beds were comfy. Not far from shops if you have a car.  Had an issue with payment as they took out two payments. Dealt with four different people until I was given an answer as to why I was charged twice without my authority. The male receptionist was not pleasant to deal with. Only one receptionist seemed sympathetic to my concern and gave me the name of the person I needed to speak with and a good time to reach her. Reimbursed a week after check out.  Would not recommend unless it is the only available place to stay in the area because it is not worth the price paid.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Both burgers accompanied with undercooked chips. $36.00 later i stated to the waitress Sarah my dissatisfaction and the value of a Hungry Jacks burger in comparison.

review_436521488~‚ÄúGreat Staff, Great Room and very Good Price A1‚Äù~Having stayed here two years ago we where hesitant to rebook...... but it suited our needs. Upon arrival we where met with a smiling and genuine front desk clerk and when I mentioned that we had had a bad experience previously, the desk clerk imeaditly looked up our last stay and offered us a great deal on our two room apartment.  On our way to the room we did get lost and Sue, who had obviously finished work and was leaving on her push bike, stopped us and then, let us follow her to our room. Sue was on her way home, but her little act of helping us, after a long drive, meant so much to us. I would like to nominate Sue for employee of the month.  Thank you for our wonderful stay, the room was spotless, the beds luxurious, the towels felt thick and freash,which all led to a great stay.  We will be back ......thank you on the front desk.

review_432268314~‚ÄúVery nice location, near the airport‚Äù~After listening to our wingy taxi driver from the airport, we were greeted to a very nice staff member at 10.30pm and kindly told us where the nearest pub was haha. (which we went to). The bed and pillows were fantastic, probably the best I have slept on in a motel. The bathroom was clean and updated. Very nice. Would stay there again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_431677639~‚ÄúConvenient‚Äù~Excellent location to the entertainment centre. Very friendly and helpful staff. Arrangement and organisation of transport to the entertainment centre was very efficient. The maxi cabs were on time and easy to locate both before and after the show.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430411180~‚ÄúA little dated but very comfortable.‚Äù~To find a comfortable place to stay for a budget I do recommend. A bit of an older place but still well looked after. Dining here an excellent choice with good food and wine and friendly staff. Whilst I was there their were several business conferences going on and speaking to the attendees they all thought it was excellently arranged and food was great. Also whilst in the dining room noticed a few couples out on a romantic night. They appeared to be having a very pleasant time.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_429572557~‚ÄúHolidays‚Äù~Has been a lovely place to stay. Very helpful and staff are always smiling and very polite. Rooms are clen and comfortable. Stay in a unit with bedroom and kitchen. Room serviced very day. Could not ask more than that. Will stay here again in the future.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429125546~‚ÄúFirst Timers ‚Äù~We found the airport well signed from valet parking right to boarding our flight. Most of the airport staff were friendly and helpful although we found the Virgin check in lady complacent like we were just another family leaving the country (it was 8am on Sunday morning, she didn't have a smile nor was she pleasant) . The airport had convenient points to charge phones. Amenities were clean. The Coffee Club was expensive for breakfast.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428665834~‚ÄúConvenient location‚Äù~We stayed here for one night before heading to the Sunshine Coast. We did not arrive until after 8pm so the location was great. The room was clean. Very comfy pillows.  We had also needed a cot which was clean and cute Winnie the Pooh towel was provided for our toddler.  The only thing that I didn't like was the shower curtain! I hate shower curtains. If it sticks to me in the shower, how many other people must it have stuck to!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427305975~‚ÄúComfortable overnight stay in great location close to airport‚Äù~Our flight from the UK arrived late at night so we were very relieved to find that this hotel was only a short, straightforward drive from Brisbane airport and then the following morning we were perfectly positioned, directly on the road to our destination of Noosa and the Sunshine Coast. The location could not have been more perfect for us and great for an overnight stay. The 24 hour reception was something I had looked for due to our late arrival too and we were delighted with the friendly welcome we received and the easy check-in process. The motel style hotel grounds were beautifully kept and the room itself was very comfortable and had everything we needed including free wifi. Highly recommended!~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_426776520~‚ÄúBusiness conference‚Äù~Good location for a conference reasonably close to airport. Motel style accommodation but appreciated having grounds to walk around and getting fresh air walking to conference room and restaurant - for price this was great value~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425209102~‚Äúideal place to stay‚Äù~this property was wonderful for many reasons none the less friendly staff and good meals. location was excellent and there was shops across the road for convenience. close to 2 major shopping centres . Bit noisy with the wedding happening~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425127945~‚ÄúGreat apartment‚Äù~The front office staff are very professional and friendly. The 1 bedroom apartments are spacious and fully equipped with kitchen, 2 x 2 seater sofa and large bedroom. The food from the restaurant is always of a high standard. There is a well equipped gym and the location of the resort is very close to shops, transport and the Brisbane entertainment centre.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424228418~‚ÄúTasmania Under 16 Boys/Girls Futsal Trip‚Äù~From the moment we arrived on Sunday till we left on Friday the staff were wonderful. We were a group of 19 - 15 teenagers and 4 adults. all the staff were friendly and prepared to go out of their way to help us. Nothing was ever a problem for them - from putting bottled water in their restaurant freezer, ensuring that our meals were always ready on time. thank you all so much for making our stay with you an enjoyable one.

review_422980580~‚ÄúHome away from home‚Äù~From check-in to check out everything was outstanding. Reception, House staff and Management go out of their way to be of service. A superb experience all round. We are regular guest and also use the services for our non-business accommodation in Brisbane. Handy to Airport and all public transport.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_422072537~‚ÄúWas a bit disappointed ‚Äù~Booked in to stay for 3 night for business due to convince. On my first day I was expected to have nice clean sheet as anyone would but when I turned the bed at 7.30pm what I saw discussed me, not only the bed sheets not changed there were lots of hair from previous guest, I then rang the front desk David answered the phone I explained what happens he got off the phone as if he was in a hurry without giving me an answer so I waited expected to come change the sheets but no one came, so I rang the service desk again at this stage it was around 9.30 I ask if any one is coming to change the sheet but this David sounded very annoyed he? He told me everyone is off duty have to wait until the morning at this stage I was also very annoyed, I am tired and I certainly can't sleep in that bed. Funny thing is This David guy is asking me what I want him to do the service people if off duty. End the end he change s room for me.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417326475~‚Äúfamily stay‚Äù~We stayed here as a family of four because we had to catch a early flight to airport. This motel was a little further from the airport than I thought but there were no problems finding the motel and getting to the airport. The unit we had was clean and spacious. It was reasonably priced when we looked at one nights accommodation for four people around the airport. I thought there would have been lots of noise as this motel is located on a very busy road, however when the windows were closed it blocked the noise out well. Would stay again if we had an early flight. The only down side was that my children were really looking forward to having a swim in the pool, however it was not heated and it was very cold.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_416016582~‚ÄúFriendly staff, nice room‚Äù~I stayed in a one bedroom apartment, on a single bed in the lounge room. The bed was fine, the couches were comfortable and the kitchen had all the necessities. I was staying on site for a workshop so didn't really leave the precinct. There is a set of cafes and convenience stores across the road. The apartments do back onto a main road so there was some noise, but not enough to keep me awake. Pool is not heated.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_415117480~‚ÄúMotel style hotel‚Äù~Convenient for airport. Booked here overnight after weekend on Gold Coast. The room was a little noisy as located next to a main road into the city. The airport is only a 15 minute drive if not during rush hour. There are restaurants across the road and fast food outlets.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~5~3~nan
review_414845275~‚ÄúExcellent customer service & a comfortable room‚Äù~Good size rooms with free parking right outside our room. We got free high speed wifi. The customer service was exceptional, a special mention to Aaron who was amazing. The room was spacious and clean. We loved the bathroom set up, shower & toilet in one room and the vanity was separate. With 4 females staying in the room this was ideal as we could still do our hair and makeup even if there was someone in the shower. Our room had a small private courtyard also. Located on Sandgate Rd, it was easy to find & perfect for our overnight needs. With just a short drive down the road to the Tombul Shopping Centre and the DFO. The Airport was quite close too. While we didn't take advantage of the onsite restaurant, we did read over the menu which offered a great range of dishes at very reasonable prices and had excellent reviews. It was only a 5 minute drive to the RSL Club. There is also a number of dining establishments directly opposite the hotel. We will definitely be returning to this lovely, friendly, quiet hotel in the future.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_413058916~‚ÄúGreat quiet location. ‚Äù~Great hotel at a convenient location to the airport and freeway. We stayed in a two bedroom villa and it was very modern, quiet and warm with split ac's in each room. Large bathroom and a kitchen will full facilities. It looks like these units have had a very recent upgrade. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Great stay !!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_408173989~‚ÄúSimple, easy and friendly.‚Äù~We had to stay overnight in Brisbane before catching our next flight up to Indonesia, and the Brisbane International - Virginia was the perfect stop-over motel. It was reasonably priced and of a very high quality. The staff were friendly, the room was quaint and basic but was not expecting anything more. Everything was extremely clean, and the only minor annoyance was the extremely loud bathroom fan, but easily ignorable. The restaurant was another particular highlight, with extremely good food at a very reasonable price. We had to stay on a few extra hours, as not to arrive at the airport too early, and the staff were happy to oblige for a small $AUD20 / hr surcharge. Overall, extremely satisfied.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_402364441~‚ÄúNice room. Friendly staff. No comfort bed‚Äù~My husband and I stayed at the Brisbane International Virginia on Thursday the 4th of August in room 62. We were greeted by very friendly staff. Prior to this I spoke to staff on the phone to see if we could drop our belongings off before check in because we had to take our car somewhere for some work. This wasn't a problem. We were even able to check in early. I also spoke to a manager because my online booking didn't go through as expected. There was a free breakfast deal however it was only one breakfast per room. I think that was a pretty poor offer. I understand there a lot of corporate guests however the offer would have more incentive if it was for up to two guests. The offer is a little deceiving. I've never seen a breakfast offer for only one breakfast. We didn't bother with the one free breakfast. Our room was a nice size with a couple of nice comfortable chairs plus a desk and a small table and chairs. There was only tea and coffee facilities. There was no microwave unfortunately and the bar fridge was tiny. The bathroom was nice however for a four star complex I was surprised to find a shower curtain instead of a shower screen. The bed was a big let down. It was so uncomfortable. We had a really bad night sleep. It felt like it had collapsed. It was super soft with no support. When I laid down I rolled to the middle of the bed. It was awful. Not very good for a four star complex. We would only stay here again if we were guaranteed a comfortable supportive bed and a better breakfast deal was thrown in. Quite honestly you shouldn't have to pay for the accommodation if the bed isn't 4 star quality and causes a poor sleep. The bed comfort is what brings people back. Having to pay for a bad night's sleep leaves a bitter taste. I thank you for your very friendly obliging staff though.~3~nan~nan~1~nan~4~4~nan
review_401936568~‚ÄúClean and comfortable‚Äù~Called last minute for a room and found a very friendly and helpful Kerry on the other end. The room was great for our needs, enough room for 2 adults a child and an infant for a comfortable nights stay. Having a restaurant onsite for a quick breakfast was great with an early start to get to the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401063338~‚ÄúLoved our stay!‚Äù~The front desk service was friendly, professional and prompt. The room was big and beautifully set out. The price was extremely reasonable. Only thing was the highway right outside our window was pretty loud, but other than that, 10/10! Great location for access to the Entertainment Centre!  Thank you! We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396368856~‚ÄúHad better ‚Äù~I stay there last year same time and had an awesome experience. This time not do good. On arrival average service. Was told I could check out at 11am and at 9.45 get s call asking when your going to check out do house keeping can clean. Normal check out is 10am. So I could of left the room at 1 min too. After spending $650 had to prove I didn't use water and coke from mini bar. All in all poor experience this time.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396091117~‚ÄúGood accommodation‚Äù~I spent 4 nights at this hotel in July. The hotel is very spread out on a large site . Further from the Brisbane Airport than I thought -a $40 cab fare. Room very good , spacious , clean and quiet , serviced daily . Breakfast ( extra cost ) was very good . Dinner is available in the on site restaurant each night -choices a bit limited . Prices competitive. There are a number of "takeaway" type places ( eg Subway, Hungry Jacks , a Turkish restaurant etc ) and an ("expensive!!) convenience store across the road. The nearest hotel is about 10 minutes walk away -I was told that the meals there are quite good~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_395680444~‚ÄúPlenty of room‚Äù~Stayed with family on route. Stayed in apartments. Plenty of room, reasonable amenities and comfortable beds. Air conditioning helpful even in winter. Didn't use gym, pool or restaurant so can't comment. About 10-11km from airport. Some road and room noise but all manageable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_391589780~‚ÄúOk for short stay‚Äù~We recently stayed for 1 night in a 2br villa (2 adults & 2 children). We chose this place because we were going to a morning session of Disney on Ice at the Entertainment Centre so the location is perfect, only 5 minutes drive! We arrived an hour early for check in but that was not a problem, our villa was ready. The lounge, kitchen and dining area were quite small, in fact the dining table barely fits. It was right up in a corner so we couldn't even all sit at the table at once. The tv in the lounge lost the signal a few times, and the tv in the bedroom barely had a signal at all. A few Foxtel channels, but 4 sports channels and not much else. Not even a movie channel. The bathroom was quite modern but the rest of the place was quite old and run down. The fridge was not much bigger than a bar fridge, which was ok as we only needed to put a few things in, but was quite old and dirty. The pillow cases on one of the beds were worn and discoloured and even had a couple of holes. We went for a walk to the pool just for a look, and I know it's winter and no one probably uses it but it looked like it hadn't been cleaned for weeks. Free wifi was good. Overall the place was clean, other than the window sills which were quite dusty/dirty. This place was fine for a one night stay, and if I needed somewhere close to the airport or Entertainment Centre I would stay again but the villa was too small for any longer than 1 night, with 2 kids. I would probably book an apartment next time, as it was a few dollars dearer maybe it's a bit bigger?~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389980013~‚ÄúNight away‚Äù~Have stayed at international Virginia a few times it is close and handy to places u want to eat and have a quiet nite away We have enjoyed the continental breakfast for an extra $10.00 and we have had some good deals .~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_387208184~‚ÄúGreat value for money‚Äù~We stayed here to go and watch Nitro Circus which was at the entertainment center. The motel was easy to find and check in was quick. They booked a taxi for us to be taken to the EC that night. We had a two bedroom Vila which was large and even had a kitchen. A quick walk down the road and there is an IGA and bottleshop. We didn't eat in the restaurant but the menu looked great. Would definitely stay here again. One adult and three kids, great value.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
