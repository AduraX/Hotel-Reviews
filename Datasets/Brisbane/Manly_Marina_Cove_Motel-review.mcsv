review_475949108~“Easy and relaxing”~I had never stayed here before and my employer booked me in. The management were fantastic and easy going. Nothing was a problem. Being on the water front allowed for relaxing times just cruising around. I will definitely be back!!!!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473962044~“Noisy”~Could hear conversation in the surrounding rooms, sneezing, and everything else you don't want to hear. Pillows were almost solid so you couldn't use them to muff the noise. Could hear people walking up the stairs to their rooms. Very shoddy, no idea how it got 4 stars. It was the joke of the wedding attendees. Very very overpriced for what it was. Long list of rules (including call them if noise was a problem and don't leave it until the morning to discuss noise, indicating that noise is complained about). Late check in, early check out, tacky interior and pool, commercial auto soap dispensers, no tissues, cheap soap, just everything was tacky and cheap.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473718280~“Terrible!”~Made you feel as welcome as an STD. First trip in a long time to Queensland and someone forgot to tell these guys about the state's reputation for friendliness. Front desk passive aggressive and all guests treated with extreme suspicion. Rooms sterile and overpriced. Better off bringing a tent and setting up in the car park. Best bit of the Manly Marina Cove Motel is the exit sign.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472303664~“Work n Play”~Great place clean and fresh the reception was friendly and a great help and nothing was too much  Excellent location close to Lytton for work and great spot for winding down along the Esplanade close to restaurant s on a short stroll and the cafes~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463059850~“Great motel”~Excellent location and service at this motel. Walking distance to centre of Manly. The Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron is based next door and is a great place for food and coffees. We will certainly be back!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460841780~“Just perfect”~Stayed here for my birthday as we were visiting a local restaurant. I was really pleased with the high standard amazing view. Extremely helpful friendly receptionist Everything from the extremely comfortable bed luxury bathroom and toiletries. High standard linen pool was really nice the breakfast at the yacht club a few steps away was delicious and memorable. I would highly recommend his wonderful hotel. Well done~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_458367137~“Beautiful Yachtie Motel”~The Marina Cove Motel is situated inside the grounds of the Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron "RQYS" and is very secure. The gates are locked at night. Marina Cove guests are welcome to eat at the RQYS cafe or restaurant. My Husband and I stayed at the Marina Cove when we were looking at a yacht to buy, at the RQYS.  The rooms at Marina Cove are beautiful! Much care has been lavished on decor and everything is clean and sparkling. Rooms with Moreton Bay views are available. Our room looked out towards mangroves and the bay. I still enjoyed the twisted mangrove shapes and sky! The rooms are on the expensive side but worth it as the Motel is on the RQYS grounds. However; it is a short stroll along the Esplanade to Manly, with everything the foreshore has to offer, including an IGA shopping area, many restaurants and a wading pool for those hot days.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_456838492~“Best fully wheelchair accessible accommodation so far”~I highly recommend this place if you are in a wheelchair the access is outstanding. Bathroom was 100% accessible, I would have liked a small shelf to put my toiletry has there is no where to put anything on. I have limited ability and use my assistance dog to help me with basics, this was set out brilliant. Plenty of room to move your chair around the room and bathroom. Easy access to small bar with kettle microwave and small desk. Clean neat and cosy. Wheelchair car park, good access to room. Only down fall is the door to enter your room is a fire hazard door and very heavy especially on wheels. Highly recommended wish there where more hotel/motels around to this standard~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_456543687~“Nice motel, friendly and helpful owners”~Rooms are clean, modern and well equipped & furnished. The owners are exceptionally friendly and helpful and keen to make sure you have a pleasant stay. They keep a close watch on any noisy guests or inconsiderate behaviour, better than most motels. They right next to the Yacht Club which is handy for dinner, drinks etc. I didn't try the in-house breakfast at the motel, but they are a 900m walk from the Manly Village which has a range of cafes, pubs and restaurants. For breakfast, Cambridge Lane Espresso is the best cafe in the area.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_452292721~“Good overnighter”~I stayed recently for 1 night to attend a wedding. Called and spoke with Paul to book and was checked in/out by Sue. Both were absolutely lovely, explaining the check in sheet and expectations of management when staying at the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. I would recommend Many Marina Cove to people looking for a great place to stay when in Manly or Brisbane.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_451781749~“Only let down by a the pillow and the pool.”~This place is great. It is very clean and tidy and for what you pay, makes it a very good deal. Great location across from the QLD Royal Yacht Squadron. We were here for a sailing regatta and it was the prefect location. If you want to visit other parts of Brisbane you will need a car, but in this heat I am happy to stay by the water as the breeze is lovely! This place is only let down down by my pillow which is lumpy and not that comfy and the pool, which needs a bit of maintenance - the light was hanging off and some bolts exposed on the side (unsafe for kids). I have no qualms recommending this motel!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450894332~“Pleasant stay”~We recently had to make an unexpected visit to the Manly area & needed accom at late notice. Called Manly Cove direct & Sue was very helpful in arranging our stay 3 nights. The motel was very clean & rooms are a good size & I found extremely quiet. Manly shopping centre was an easy stroll along the foreshore. Brisbane Yacht Squadron was a really nice location however service was a little indifferent. Overall Manly is a lovely area & we'd be happy to visit again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450843460~“Top place by the Marina and bars and restaraunts”~What a top find close by all Manly Beach, we went for a New Years Eve party at the Trailer Club and what a great place rooms were large and clean location was great a 300 meter walk to everything, The owners where very friendly and even loaned us some Hawaian shirts for our party. Thanks again and I can highly recomend this Motel to Families and singles.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_450297473~“Very nice stay”~We stayed here on our way to a camping holiday on Moreton Island. This was our first time staying here, and it sure won't be our last. Convenient off street parking with security gates on a night. Close to the RQYC where you can dine. The rooms were clean and you were generally able to park outside your room. Recommended as a great place to stay.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_447583232~“One night stay for a little getaway”~We were down this way for a friends birthday celebration and decided to stay the night instead of the 50 minute drive home Pre-booked the room on line and payment wasn't required until arrival We booked a first level room and it is quite large and has a small balcony with a view of the bay  The motel is placed inside the Manly Royal yacht squadron precinct and it's very quiet and is surrounded by a beautiful setting of foreshore, bay and marina Guests can use the cafe, bar or restaurant within the squadron facility and purchase drinks to take back to your room Breakfast is available downstairs but we chose to head out to one of the cafes in the area Oh you also get a small brownie on arrival which is a nice little treat There is also a lift to get up to the first floor if stairs are an issue  Our room had shower over bath so not sure of options for mobility or disable issues~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446656663~“Lovely!”~Only stayed overnight but great all round experience. Good check-in, lift to room, clean and tidy and lovely outlook to bay from balcony. Plenty of parking outside with the yacht club across the roadway.  Special mention to staff/housekeeping who posted 2sets of iPhone/pad chargers 'and' cords back to me, that were left in room after stay. Thank you.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_442727269~“Recent refurbishment is great”~Been staying here sporadically for business over past 3-4 years. Recent rennovations and styling are fablous. As always location is beautiful to wake up to water views and birds. Walking path along Moreton Bay is nice before/after work. High speed Wifi is free and fast. Easy walk to great cafes / restaurants. Only gets better beach time. Super friendly staff.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442280940~“Lovely location”~Great place to stay, very clean, plenty of room, quiet location yet there is a very handy club across the car park. Hand to all shops and great restaurants.

review_440988555~“Nice relaxing location. Good rooms and helpful staff.”~We had a pleasant welcome. The man upgraded us to a sea view without us asking. He gave us great advice about what to see and local amenities. It was nice to get real personal consideration. The hotel is clean and tidy, the room was quite large and comfortable. Wifi was good.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_438435559~“Beautiful location & firiendly staff”~I was sent to Brisbane for a week long training course and accommodation was organised by my employer - pleasantly surprised by the Manly Marina motel - far and away the nicest place my work has ever booked. Staff were very helpful and explained the services available, the local area and answered any questions I had. The room was spacious, clean and very well appointed. parking was right out the front and the free wifi was fast and reliable (a very nice change from the usual snail paced services offered in Australia) large flat screen TV with a variety of foxtel channels and a well appointed little kitchenette. My only two gripes - a step in shower over the bath - it was quite high and for more senior visitors could be problematic, and the bed - while a king, was waaaaay to hard - it was difficult for me to get comfortable enough to sleep!~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_435497567~“A Comfortable Place to Visit Manly”~The motel was in a great location - an easy, picturesque stroll into the village. The room was comfortable and the air-con was great - a nice enough view from the balcony looked onto the bay. Whilst we didn't have the opportunity to use the pool, it looked inviting. The reception was terrific an the ladies were very helpful. For some reason our room wasn't made up in the morning - not sure if there was a miscommunication. Parking at the motel was difficult as there was a function at the Yacht Club next door. Whilst the signs said :Motel Parking Only", i don't think all the cars were motel guests.~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_428037100~“Shack with a view”~We stayed at the Manly Cove weekender cottage and it was the shabbiest place we have ever stayed in australia. The paint is peeling off, the floor planks are loose. Not maintained at all. 1950's cooking stove. Not all windows can be closed. The second bathroom mentioned in the brochure is a dirty dunny under the house to be reached through a garden wilderness.  This is not boutique, but shabby.  Lots of noise from the manly harbour village and the car park, especially early in the morning and late at night. The views in the cottage are excellent though and so is the cleaning (except for barbecue that was not clean).  This cottage was a great disappointment. The argument that is was cheaper than the other cottages in manly and hence a shack, does not fly for me. Best to be demolished, especially as we understood the owner does not want to futher invest a penny in it. That shows.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423340036~“Spacious, Comfortable Room”~Lovely location on the grounds of The Manly Royal Yacht Club. Different rooms have balcony views of the yachts. Sue - manager/reception was very helpful & welcoming.  Comfortable bed & excellent desk light. Balconies are close so if you have neighbours using their balcony with loud conversation as I did for one of the nights it's just the luck of the draw. Stroll along or power walk the Esplanade to the main hub of Cambridge Parade. Enjoyed my 3 night stay taking in the sights & restaurants at Manly.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_418252974~“Spotless but oh such hard beds and overpriced!”~Spotlessly clean and convenient if you need to be in Manly. However the beds are hard...and when asked for 2 singles I was told it would be an extra $40.00 to split the beds. This would take it to $230.00, expensive as you can find luxury accommodation near the city for just $200.00 including breakfast and free parking. Will not be staying again, they have a monopoly and are using it to their advantage for what is an average Accomodation.~3~2~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_412183559~“Quiet and Comfortable.”~We had a great long weekend at the motel. Nice and quiet, very comfortable bed, great position and cool boats to look at. The shower was over the bath which I don't like, and the water pressure was fairly low, but most places are the same these days. We would definitely stay again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_410348954~“very comfortable and quiet place to stay”~We recently stayed here for 2 nights and had a lovely relaxing time. The room is comfortable and clean and very well equipped.

The room was incredibly clean, fresh and comfortable and we actually had a fantastic nights sleep on the bed. Our only disappointment was that we only had enough time to stay for one night, will definitely be finding/making the time to visit again and will definitely be staying at Manly Marina Cove Motel.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_377439305~“Excellent!”~Spent 3 weeks staying at the Manly Marina Cove for work. Absolutely lovely place, great service and great people. Nice rooms, with king size beds, views from the balconies, room to relax, decent wifi and everything you might need away from home and a short walk along the harbour to lots of great restaurants and cafes. Service was exceptional! Everyone who works there was lovely, from the room service ladies, the desk staff and especially Sue! She was always happy to help, answer questions, book restaurants, decipher train time tables and often pre-empted our needs. Sue even hand makes lovely fragrant bath bombs, to relax with while you visit. I've never felt so spoilt while traveling for work :)~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_364703532~“Great location, perfect hosts!”~Immaculate, comfortable spacious room in a great location right on Brisbane's bayside, A great alternative to the Gold Coast if you want a relaxing stay near the water but don't want the hustle and bustle of Surfers Paradise. Sue and Paul are wonderful hosts and it is obvious they go to a great deal of effort ensure their guests have an enjoyable stay. The RQYS restaurant and bar is right next door and it's just a short drive or 10 minute walk along the Esplanade to any number of other eateries in Manly. We attended a family event at the RQYS restaurant and can highly recommend the food and service there.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_364032239~“Fantastic motel!!!!!”~This motel is fantastic! I had the pleasure of staying here for 3 weeks for work. Not only is the motel lovely and in a great spot, the owners Sue and Paul are absolutely lovely. They made my stay more than comfortable, felt like my home away from home. Anything you needed they were more than happy to help whether it was making a dinner reservation for you, handing out home made bath bombs, needing help with the iron or just to have a nice chat. The rooms are modern and of a high quality and very spacious, plenty of parking, and great restaurants all within walking distance. I was pretty sad when I had to check out because I enjoyed my stay so much. I would highly recommend staying here you will not be disappointed!!!! I will definitely be back to stay on a more social visit. Thanks again for looking after me so well Sue and Paul, very much appreciated. I will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_361978592~“Great location, great rooms, great hospitality”~We are locals in the area and were always wondering what the motel situated next to the RQYS Marina was like. We never thought we would have to stay there, however due to a building project gone bad we had to find somewhere last minute for a couple of days. I called and Sue was wonderful, even though it was school holidays and they were incredibly busy she felt for us and upgraded our first night in the Commodore's room with a wonderful view. She could have easily put us on the ground floor which was the same price. She also makes delightful heart shaped bath bombs, which was just what the Dr ordered.  We weren't sure how long we needed to stay, it could've been up to a week though we just had to wait and see. We had to check out of the Commodore's room and then rang her when we found out we needed to stay another night in a normal queen room. This was also nicely appointed and had the same facilities but in a different layout.  RQYS is just a walk across the road and has a lovely café and restaurant (restaurant is closed Monday and Tuesday but you can still get pub grub type food in the café). It is situated right on the water and you can day dream about which boat you would like to have.  Thank you Sue and Paul, we can definitely recommend staying in your fine 4 star motel.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_360758498~“This place is perfection! Beautiful views and exquisite accommodation!”~The rooms here are very spacious and cleaned everyday to an exceptional standard! Sue, the check-in chick and owner is so welcoming and makes you feel truly feel at home.  The beautiful views from your room, exceptional aircon and bath make for a very relaxing escape at the end of your day! Sue's home-made bath-bombs also work a treat!   The washing facilities, internet and pool are fantastic, and I will definitely be staying here whenever I return to Manly!  It is the perfect place to stay for a relaxing escape or for business trips.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_360741979~“Home away from home”~I had the pleasure of staying at this motel for a 3 week period and in all that time I couldn't fault it. Owners Sue and Paul welcome you as if you are stepping into stepping into your own home, which considering they themselves live there I guess you are. My fellow colleagues and I all commented on the warm and friendly welcome received upon arrival and that feeling remained throughout the duration of the stay. As we were away from home during a stressful period, the owners provided home made bath bombs for the girls and an esky/ice for the boys afternoon beers my the pool. Away from family for Easter we also received a few chocolate eggs to mark the occasion. The hotel is perfectly located next to the marina with a large carpark with easy access to the front door. The local pool, shops, pub and restaurant are all within walking distance. If you after a nice weekend escape from the city without trekking hundreds of kilometres then this place is for you. Would come back in a heart beat.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_353248230~“South Passage sailing”~Went over to Manly and spent the night at the motel had a family room which I shared with group of friends. Motel managers Sue and Paul suggested dinner at the Yacht Squadron next door which is a one minute stroll across the car park. Once at the Royal Brisbane Yacht Squadron you have the choice of an a la carte menu or more relaxed cafe style dining. As an out-of-town visitor this was a great option. Breakfast is served at the motel either cooked or Continental and there is a pool and barbecue available for guests. The Family room is spacious and has comfortable beds. It is hard to believe you're in Brisbane when you are staying at the motel. The South Passage Tall Ship sailing experience was recommended by Sue and is a must do bucket list experience for anyone interested in the water and boats. The South Passage day trip leaves from a public jetty located about 15 minutes walk from the motel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_350449956~“Nice & quiet & beautiful position”~Nice place to stay , more than adequate rooms plus now there is a choice of breakfast at the motel or their partner the Royal Yacht Squadron next door.

Very good portions & very good value .~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_349870255~“Access to Yacht Club a big bonus”~Stayed for 8 nights in January with 2 other couple (adjacent rooms on first floor) for softball tournament in nearby Redlands and could not be happier. We did not have cooking facilities in our studio rooms so especially enjoyed the temporary membership of the Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron next door. We had lovely breakfast, drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee there on most days looking over the gorgeous marina full of yachts and all thought the setting of the motel could not have been bettered. We also took the opportunity to crew a yacht for free on the Wednesday (WAGS day). That was a great experience. The motel itself was very clean and the bed extremely comfortable, I slept very well which is unusual for me. You can hear doors being slammed outside your room but thankfully I only really noticed that on one occasion around 7am. The studio room itself is a good size although the bathrooms are a little on the small side but still perfectly fine. Our friends next door had the Commodore Suite which provides an extra living room in addition to the bedroom. I was pleased to have a small fridge, kettle, sink and crockery/cutlery. Very adequate for our needs as we ate out most nights, although we enjoyed one meal in when we sat on the balcony. Very peaceful although the balcony wall itself does block your view when sitting down. Plenty of really good restaurant/cafe options in Manly itself or nearby. Lovely walk along esplanade on the Sunday to the local markets and Manly outdoor pool. Sue the manager was extremely helpful and all 3 couples very much enjoyed our stay there together. We are still reminiscing about lovely evenings at the Yacht Club!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_349236033~“Excellent place to stay”~We are from the UK and stayed here in 2012. It was very good then so we decided to come back. Same again.
