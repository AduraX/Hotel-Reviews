review_471763189~“Perfect location to see Brisbane and park for free”~We stayed here 3 nights and needed a place to park a hire car. The location is ideal with just a short walk to the city, only about a block from central station, and the room was spacious with all amenities including laundry facilities. Reception were friendly and helpful. The cafe over the road was really good, and reasonably priced. The pool was beautiful and we felt so spoilt in the central city with loads of space and a big balcony.  Wifi was pretty limited to our bathroom and entrance way, but reception was constant if we sat on the loo. It could be noisy if parents let their kids holler in the hallway, but the sight of me in my nightie at 0630 was enough for them to bugger off. Overall, this is a really reasonable place to stay, in a top location. The parks nearby are worth checking out.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_452575874~“Large, clean & comfortable and within walking distance to Central Station and the CBD”~Stayed overnight in a 2 bedroom apartment in December 2016. The apartment was very large, clean and comfortable and within walking distance to Central Station and the CBD. The apartment is not new however has everything required for a comfortable stay. There is a large fridge, microwave and dishwasher and plenty of cutlery/crockery which would be great for a longer stay. The apartment is very large and has a seperate lounge and dining area as well as a balcony so there is plenty of space for the family. The apartment is in a great location with several restaurants/cafes in the street below and a supermarket within walking distance. Loved that it was so close to the train station making it so easy to get to and from the airport or anywhere else you need to go. Enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again when next back in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451795130~“Great Location”~Nice inner-city apartment that is modern and well appointed. Our apartment featured a large master bedroom with an ensuite, separate main bathroom and a second bedroom. The lounge / dining area was spacious and well appointed and the kitchen was very functional.  The apartment had underground parking which was convenient, however spots were not assigned which would be an improvement.  The pool and spa were enjoyable and well maintained; the tiles around the pool area can be very slippery when wet. Free WIFI is available but only on the pool level.  There was no recycling bin that we could not find in either the apartment nor in the complex, which for apartment style accommodation seems to be an omission. We would have been happy if there was a central recycling bin that was identified in a information booklet in the apartment. The location is very close to the centre of Brisbane such that for most things it is easier to walk that use a car. Great access to restaurants, nearby shops and the mall. Enjoyed our stay and would use again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_447630092~“Old and Solid with great location. Can be noisy for light sleepers”~Big room with all you need furniture wise. Free parking, good washing machine and dryer included, pool area is good with a shade area also under the bbq. However free internet in room would have been good but for price wasn't a problem as could access from pool area. Street very noisy from about 430am as bars and cafes rubbish gets emptied into trucks as well as general traffic noise but then again its in Brisbane CBD so to be expected. Very basic initial supplies and even only half a dishcloth so be prepared to buy everything for a stay longer than a few days!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443640294~“Affordable City Chic”~First of all, the room that we had was amazing: clean and chic. The building is well situated to the CBD (central business district). Now for all the wonderful details. You can take a taxi directly to the hotel/apartments, but if you take the AirTrain from the airport (domestic or international) you will find yourself at Central Station. There is a short cut to get to the Astor, but it's too complicated to describe. If you are a first time visitor, like me, you want simple directions because you want to get to your destination without getting lost. Here's the easiest way to get to the Astor from Central Station:  Exit the Station on Ann Street and turn right to Edward Street. On Edward Street, make another right. Cross Turbot Street. Keep following Edward Street and you will cross Wickham Terrace. Continue until you come to Astor Terrace, then turn right. Astor Apartments will be located on your right. The staff are very friendly. Be aware that the staff hours on weekends are from 9am to 10 am. Just one hour for Saturday and Sunday, so make sure you are able to talk with staff particularly if you want to set up a taxi pickup for early in the morning as we did. We were in room 1103. It has a pretty good view, but what really struck us was the apartment itself: very nice, chic, and well-appointed. The balcony was an added bonus. The kitchen even has views of the city! This room is an apartment and not your typical hotel room! Wifi is free, but can only be accessed on the third floor, where the pool is located. There is a flat screen tv in the living area, and the apartment even comes with DVDs with such family favorites like "The Godfather" and the entire "Aliens" collection. If you are a coffee drinker, don't forget to bring your single drip coffee cone. There is no coffee maker. You're fine if you like tea. If there is something I would like to see changed, it would be a plastic mat in the bath tub because it can be slippery there. This is really the place to stay in Brisbane if you want more bang for your buck. You are within walking distance of downtown, as well as two grocery stores (Woolworth's).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441841645~“Great Central Location!”~Stayed here at Easter time in a two bedroom apartment. It was perfect. Like a home away from home. The location was also perfect as we were able to walk everywhere. The fellow at reception was very helpful - especially seeing as we were going to arrive after hours, we had all the information we needed to check in. Will be Back.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_434449160~“Good location”~I booked to stay in a one bedroom apartment was a little 'old fashioned' with regards to the kitchen equipment - it definitely needed an update. The large open plan sitting room opened into a balcony with a table and chairs too. There was an odd set-up with regards to the TV - there was a shaped granite worktop along the wall by the front door which (I feel) had a dangerous pointed section which could hurt a child if they hit it. The TV was fine but the cables were very short and if the TV was moved, the cables came out! There were also lots of HiFi units next to and under the TV which may have worked, I did not try them - they seemed quite old. The air conditioning was very old and noisy and the back was inside the wardrobe in the bedroom which was draughty when the door was open. The bathroom could do with renovating as quite old, but still adequate. Apartment block location was fine as was the reception staff, but if I returned, would request a different apartment.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429826075~“Good Value”~Great position, and a little bit 'old school' up market Hotel. We enjoyed our stay in Brisbane, and very happy to be walking distance from everything CBD.  Didn't do the breakfast option, but did get a morning coffee there and saw everyone else's breakie. Would do it next time... Pleasant stay, all good, no complaints.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_425718940~“Great apartment, really enjoy our stay.”~Clean & tidy apartment with everything we needed, including a pool and spa, which our family used everyday. Apartment was close to all amenities and central station just around the corner and main shopping center only a few blocks away. The service was very friendly & very helpful. We as a family really enjoyed our stay and would recommend.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_419613742~“I loved my stay... It was a long stay.”~I stayed in room 1303 from mid-July to mid-September 2016 for work.  The unit is a self contained unit. The unit has the characteristics of a renovated unit however when maintenance was required on the staff at the front desk promptly arranged for the maintenance to be undertaken.  The building is not brand new so don't expect a 5-star experience but for families looking for 3.5 to 4 star self contained property, this one is pretty good.  The room is serviced weekly but for an additional fee you can have it serviced every day. It has a cooktop, pans, crockery, an electric frypan, egg poaching saucepans and general kitchen equipment. The oven is fan forced and yes it has a dishwasher, abet an old school one but hey, who wants to be doing washing up while on holidays or after a hard day's work in my case.  On level 3 is the pool area. There is an electric BBQ, table chairs, a fridge, a spa, pool and sauna. They are clean and in good working order - yes know as I used them a few times to cook some sausages, chicken and steaks for my dinners. By my own admission, the place is pretty quite and private. You don't hear much noise from the other guests and residents. Even in School holidays there was space and privacy and you don't see much of well.... Anyone else in the place.  The television has limited Foxtel channels but all the Free to air HD channels their is in Brisbane but so is looking at the TV. The view from the balcony and lounge room is excellent as your on the top floor and extends to the east from the CBD to Moreton Bay, the port, air port, Harbourside, Newstead and The Valley (Fortitude Valley). There is also a supermarket within 800 metres walk or you can walk down the hill which is a bit steeper to the Cbd shops.  Central station is within 2 blocks so that makes it very easy to access the train network and Spring Hill loop free bus comes up the hill if your feeling lazy. However if you have a car parking is available in the basement. The headroom height can be an issue if you have a 4x4 or for you have roof racks loaded up with stuff. At the time of writing this review the parking was free for guests and there were some long spaces availilable for trails and long vehicles on basement level 2 The downside to these units is that there are a lot of other units around and it can be noisy on a Friday / Saturday night. Your on the edge of the entertainment district and CBD so a bit of street noise is expected. If you want quiet I would recommend staying elsewhere.  The unit's environment control system is in the cupboard and this makes a small rumble as you sleep. The first night or two I considered it "noisy" but after that I got use to it and it just became background.  Brisbane has an international airport so you are not going to escape aircraft noise. This includes helicopters going into and out of Hospitals again the soon become ambiance noise and it can be quite fun to watch them circle around land at the airport.  Sunday morning bells! The churches in the area chime their bells a 9am for about 20 minutes. While the location of the churches are not in the immediate area their chimes can be heard for some distance around them. Again your in the CBD a bit of ambient noise is expected or stay elsewhere.  If I'm ever back in Brisbane to stay for work, I will be asking to stay in these units this - this one in particular.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_415871510~“Lovely Apartment”~Clean, spacious, central. Excellent apartment round the corner from the central station and close to all amenities. Five of us staying there and there was loads of room. Everything was really clean and modern.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_388970844~“Nice apartment but a bit noisy”~Stayed here one night while in town visiting friends. Apartment was spacious, comfortable and clean, if a little tired and in need of some minor maintenance (eg cupboard door hinge in kitchen).  Service was friendly and helpful, car park was good and not too tight and location very good. Only drawback was the plumbing in the block seems quite noisy - rushing water at odd times overnight and the usual traffic noises you'd expect in this location near the city. Overall good but not great.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_388069915~“Decently priced and good location”~Family visit for a two bed department. Apartment somewhat dated and felt a little dirty as a result. Parking was good, location great.

review_376635830~“Great location”~We stayed here for a week when we arrived in Brisbane. Location of the apartments is very good, close to the train station and the shops.  The apartment itself was very clean and spacious more than enough room for the 2 of us. Great to have a laundry and always nice to have a balcony.  The only negative was the kitchen, there was no oven just a microwave and a portable electric hob. The saucepans were tiny and we requested a bigger one, we didn't have 1 big enough to cook a meal for 2 in. The utensils were ok but a serving spoon would have been useful.  Overall a good experience and would use again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376330712~“Another wonderful stay”~Yet another wonderful stay at Astor Apartments. I have stayed 2-3 times a year for the last 6 years for events such as EKKA, State of Origin, concerts and getaways . Over this time I have seen stylish improvements to reception, apartments, common areas and level 3 pool spa sauna bbq area. All overseen by caring managers Mark & Tania who have always given a warm welcome, spotlessly clean apartment and comfortable bed. Love the location. Walking distance to CBD and shopping. Great restaurants in the street and the train station behind us if I need to go further a field. Leave the car at home but there is free parking if needed. Thank you once again for your hospitality will back.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_375340640~“Home away from home.”~We spent 8 nights here for our Brisbane holiday. We were disappointed with our first room which was a large studio despite us booking a one bedroom apartment. The managers were very good though and moved us to an apartment with a separate bedroom which was fantastic. The new apartment was large with good views and had a large lounge and dining room, good kitchen and separate bedroom and bathroom. The pool area is excellent, roomy with lots of furniture for hanging out and using the free WiFi there. There are barbecues, a swimming pool and a spa. We really enjoyed the location and could walk to Queen St and Eagle St Pier in 5 minutes. There are bike stands nearby if you want to use the city cycle scheme. The train station is also very close although we just used the trains for the airport. Very happy with our stay. Would definitely return.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_371278671~“A little let down. ”~The apartment was well presented, clean, tidy and a good location. Security parking was easy. A large apartment with a comfortable lounge room, Foxtel, spacious balcony, heated spa, sauna and pool.  The main bedroom had no TV. The cooking implements were short on supply as were cups, glasses etc. Taps kept dripping. Worst of all was the fridge didn't work. (Didn't realise till the next day). Internet was very slow and only located near the pool.  ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359644415~“A large budget apartment”~The apartment overall was great for the money. We weren't expecting 1 bedroom apartment to be as big as it was. The kitchen was fully equipped however, we were only provided with a very large fry pan and large pots. Some words of advise, don't leave any food or crumbs (from the toaster) on the kitchen bench. We noticed some tiny brown ants. It is a little run down but that is expected from a 3.5 star. The apartment is also close to Central train station and a 8 minutes walk to Queen St mall (just take a pathway from the back thru a small shopping arcade).~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_352505515~“Perfect for the independent traveller”~Astor Apartments offers one and two bedroom apartments with weekly housekeeping (additional housekeeping is available) that are ideal for the independent traveller. I stayed in a one bedroom in December 2014 for two weeks and again in December 2015 / January 2016 for five weeks.  The location is just a short walk from Central Station which means convenient access to trains serving the Sunshine Coast to the Gold Coast. Ask about the short cut to the station. A bit more walking gets you to Queen Street and the rest of the CBD area, Two Woolies and a Coles (for food) are within reasonable walking distance. Astor Terrace is a short road so only has local traffic and is quite quiet. Accommodations include a fully equipped kitchen (4 burner cooktop, oven, microwave, dishwasher and full size fridge), a good sized bedroom, laundry (combination washer / dryer), ample living / dining space and a roomy balcony. The photos on the website are accurate. All facilities were spotlessly clean. The air conditioning worked well and was more efficient if the blackout drapes are kept closed during the day. The room comes with a vacuum and brooms to manage between the weekly room service. A wifi package is available however I travel with my own wifi so didn't need the package. There is also a pool, sauna, spa pool and lounging deck for residents and guests. The experience was most enjoyable. Everyone was very friendly. It is more like home / apartment than it is hotel and extremely good value.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_346742064~“Excellent Apartment for family”~We rented a two bedrooms apartment. The unit was spotless clean. The facilities in there were sufficient for daily cooking. The parking was not assigned but there were plenty slots to be found. The only minor downside was the wireless connection was only available at the public area which is at Level 3. However, we can still reach the connection when we were near the lift on our apartment level. Overall, we had a great time at this apartment. Looking forward to stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

A spacious, clean apartment with a fully equipped kitchen. Lots of windows and a balcony. We were on the same level as the pool, which was a great asset after a long day out.

review_342666175~“Airconditioning Not Working in Most Rooms, No 24/7 reception, Restricted Free WiFi”~The apartments are very spacious - palatial by New York standards. But the facility is ageing and was probably upscale 20-30 years ago. They appear to be replacing high end accessories, furniture and appliances with very low end purchases. The reception opens on restricted hours, so if you arrive from overseas without a cell phone, you're out of luck! The manager's apartment button did not work. Typical Australian poor service, with no apologies for cock ups, just defensive explanations for why things aren't happening/working. Explanations you don't give a ratsass about when you're melting in the heat, locked out (even though you've arrived at the 2:00 pm check-in time on a weekday), and exhausted. Pool area is very large, with a tiny, V E R Y slippery, tiled pool without disabled access. Plenty of space to have friends over around the pool area with tables chairs, outside fridge, barbeque. Each apartment has a spacious balcony. Linen and pillows good, comfy full or double bed. Mediocre water pressure. Big step over bath & no grab bars. Full kitchen with minimal, but acceptable, dinnerware. This place has everything you need, including a full laundry room, but decor awful. Black carpet: ugh. Remember if you're booking online to mark that you need airconditioning - then they'll have to put you in one of the rooms where the aircon actually works. The third room they tried finally had mostly reliable, retrofitted AC. This is a multi function building and there's apparently a dispute with the condo association about installing new a/c - to replace the existing noisy units that just blow room temp air and do not dehumidify. So watch for the Fawlty-Towers-like descriptions: Free wi fi is only on the third floor and was not working most of the time I was there, and you can't stream movies very well (A few gigs of data in Australia is considered a lot and is expensive). 24/7 reception is a euphemism for an onsite manager you can call anytime, IF you have a phone, and who won't show up if he's taking a sickie or an early-mark (sick leave day to take care of personal business or leaving early 'cause he or she had better things to do). There was an acceptable amount of secure, underground, parking spaces. Close to the Brisbane downtown shopping and business district and minimal traffic noise. Popular cafe restaurant across the road.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~1~nan

review_333650607~“Awesome apartment perfect long or short stay”~Stayed for 3 nights, arrived out of office hours but easy instructions were left for us. Very central easy walking distance to shops, restaurants. Very well equipped. Plenty of parking easy to get in and out. Didn't use the Wi-Fi as not worth the price per night. Plenty of leaflets in reception for things to do. Very quiet even with windows opened. Be good to have screens on windows and patio doors so could keep open at night instead of using air conditioner. Having a balcony was great. Would recommend and will stay again. Trolleys in the car park were fantastic for taking up luggage and shopping, great idea. The only downside was the bath/shower taps very low when using shower have to be careful if water is hot when you go to adjust it.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_333599120~“A bit of a mix!”~Pros: Very large, central, small but good pool area, adequate kitchen and laundry, free Wifi at pool, free parking, reasonable cost, some receptionists knowledgeable and helpful, balcony. Cons: No free Wifi in room, very limited reception duties at the weekend, no servicing until you stay over a week, leaking fridge reported twice and not mended, dirty sofa and carpet, very dirty air conditioning unit outlet (Legionaires?) Limited information in room. So it's up to you to decide what is important to you! Personally, I found it adequate but I wouldn't rush back there - too much good competition around so I feel they have to up the ante a bit.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan

Reception was very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. We stayed in a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment on the 12th floor. The kitchen had adequate cooking utensils and the laundry was equipped with a washing machine and dryer. Living area was very spacious and the balcony was a great bonus.

review_316240791~“Great location and super spacious”~My son and I stayed here for a week during the September school holidays while I attended a conference. Both bedrooms were large doubles, and we found all the beds comfy. It was lovely weather at that time of year and both the bedrooms and the living area had large sliding doors which let the breeze flow right through. I was also impressed that there were fans on stands in the bedrooms in case the nights were hot. There is airconditioning but we never needed to use it even though some days were over 30. The kitchen was a good size, with all the expected facilities, and the living room very spacious. Our living area and the main bedroom faced east so the afternoons were cool. There were also large balconies on that side of the apartment and a smaller outdoor area on the kitchen side. We were on level 3 where the pool is, so it was very easy to slip out and have a quick swim. The pool area also faces east so is shaded in the afternoons. The location is close enough to walk to the shopping areas. There is realistically nowhere to park in the cbd that is closer than the apartment. The parking was very convenient - easy to access and no impossibly tight spaces etc.as in so many hotel parking areas. I have noted other reviews that mentioned the noise. On level 3 we could not hear any traffic from Turbot st etc. The only noise that remotely bothered me was the commercial waste removal trucks in the mornings - but that happens everywhere. Am thinking up reasons to visit Brisbane in the near future so I can stay here again!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

The kitchen was well equipped and the living room was large and comfortable, especially the sofa. Unfortunately the bed was less than comfortable for my husband who suffers from back pains from time to time, however the living room more than made up for the bedroom being not so comfortable. The wifi area was convenient and we used the hot tub one night and it was warm enough to use. Thoroughly recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The hotel is very well situated, within walking distance to city centre and close to supermarket. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_299114581~“Astor serviced apartments Spring Hill Brisbane”~Well located, a short stroll from central station we had a comfortable 3 night stay in a 2 bedroom apartment. The apartment had all we needed and there is a pool and BBQ with a large area to sit and relax which we used one evening. Would happily stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

review_287413278~“Don't stay here unless you likes it before ”~I've stayed at astir once before and the room was great. It was nice and large, though on my second stay the room I got though was large was very old and rundown. On asking the receptionist if I could move rooms to a nicer one, he just looked at his screen and said it was full, and gave an excuse of the rooms are individually owned and they are decorated in the way of the owner that owned that apartment. That's fine, but the standard if the room was really not only, old mismatched furniture, no blankets, the centre slooping bathrooms, it feels like the owner went to a salivation army and picked up all the things they could for cheap and put it into our room. The floors were wooden, but you could tell they were old with the lack in colour and parts where they were coming off. For the receptionist to say that they check the rooms twice a year this is very questionable is this room is very bad. They could at least make the rooms uniform. All the receptionist could say was next time book through us direct and not through cheap websites, what type of an answer is that? I paid the same price two weeks prior but got a better room. I know for next time go for a trusted brand, as mercure hotek was offering the same deal and price. Sorry astor won't be coming back due to this unlucky event.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_284448031~“right where you need to be - close to all transport”~The Astor is so handy, 700mtr walk to the main train station, a gentle down hill walk to Queen Street for shopping (10 minutes) - heaps of bars and cafes near by, its got it all. The apartment itself was spacious and tidy.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~3~nan
