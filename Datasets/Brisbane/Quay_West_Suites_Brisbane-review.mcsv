review_479119415~“Staff made the stay”~Our two day stay at Quay West was made by the excellence of the staff. Josh in particular made every effort to meet our needs and was informative and courteous on every occasion we requested advice or assistance. The room was well provisioned, clean and well equipped. We would recommend Quay West as an excellent starting point for a visit to Brisbane. Our room overlooked the Botanic Gardens which gave an excellent early morning view to start our day~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478966147~“Lovely Setting”~Loved staying here - close proximity to the Botanical Gardens and river was a bonus. The apartment was very spacious and the pool was great. Waffles with bacon and icecream for breakfast is not something we would normally have but we had it both days of our stay.~5~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_478050543~“Pleasant place for a pre wedding drink!”~We went to a wedding nearby at Old Government House and found the small bar at this place to be a nice little quiet place for a Saturday afternoon drink. Very plush looking hotel and have previously been to the restaurant.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473973608~“Great Location just needs some Tweeking”~Ideal for being close to the city highlights and South Bank. Car parking has a premium price at $40 a night. Internet access can be expensive fortunately we are with Accor Plus and is free with package, movies are expensive also, no Foxtel either. The suites are self contained ideal for longer stays, the king size bed is very comfortable. Staff were friendly and responsive to our needs. The in hotel McMahons Restaurant is small and has a limited menu. The food is great the cooks do a fine job however the table staff struggle with doing the restaurant service but also the room service, it appeared one was competing with the other. Breakfast is a hit and miss affair, we waited for more than 15min before our order was taken, two other guests who were there before us went to the bar to ask whether or not they are going to be served. Next time I think I'll take room service and enjoy the balcony view. Anyway had a great and enjoyable stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_471535900~“Location perfect ”~2 bedroom apartment, wrap around balcony, walk across road to Botanical Gardens. Staff very helpful and friendly. Breaky option quiet limited downstairs, but a short walk to the centre mall no problem..Great location.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471417207~“Nice location but tired facility”~The Quay West Suites are perfectly located, just minutes from the central shopping district an opposite the botanical gardens, but the rooms are a bit dated.  The rooms are comfortable and clean but little maintenance and changes of furnishings have been made. The overall look is pretty dated like stepping into a 1970's house. Aside from that, the central location makes it easy to visit the vibrant South Shore waterfront and the shopping district. Parking is a problem and your only real choice is to take the hotel valet parking at $40 a night, bear this in mind when planning your stay. All in all we were happy with the location but think the room could have been a little cheaper.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_471027443~“Apalling Internet Access”~I have trouble getting over the bad internet access here. Everyone travels with multiple devices these days. The internet in the rooms is not free - in fact it's expensive. There is free internet in the foyer. But only for 30 minutes! Rooms are big and have fantastic views...but come on guys...it's 2017!~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~1~nan
review_469346124~“A certified ACCOR "Hotel" disappointment ”~As a platinum member of ACCOR we booked this hotel as they claim they are a 5 star hotel but they are actually NOT! You can have a great location hotel or a fancy looking photos posted on facebook but see it for yourself. The hotel BADLY needs a renovation plus they have reckless staff specifically housekeeping.  Let's start with the ONLY Positive and the only reason of giving 2 stars: The McMahon Restaurant people, Tim, Andrew, Emily, Nica & David who are very professional and very attending staff! The hotel's location/our room view & room is spacious! Upon arrival: They saw us arrived, none of them helped us to get our baggage from the cab considering they saw us we have a baby on board. Also, late check out as platinum members we're entitled of late check out free of charge. Gary tried to double check for us but Mayak from concierge interrupted he thought we're only staying for a night and we said nope! we're staying til Thursday. He then, suggested to keep checking with concierge for availability in the following days during our stay. Housekeeping Issues!!! Bathroom: Pubic hair left on the bathtub! And my husband and I were disgusted. My mistake was I forgot to take a photo of it but instead I cleaned it as we have a baby with us. It was Sunday and don't want to stress! Monday-A cleaner has to ask me to move the baby cot for her?! Makes me think "who's the guest here?". Did not even vaccum, she just basically make the bed and put towels/toiletries in the bathroom. She can't wait to get out of the room! If I didn't tell her what to do she wouldn't initiate. Tuesday-The do not disturb sign is hanging on our door! YES! But at around 1:50 pm I noticed someone left a small card in our door-they put a line on 7pm but instead they make it 2pm which made me called the Manager Chris. I asked him if the housekeeping is until 2pm only? Is that how it works here? He said, No! We're open til 10pm. Do you want us to clean your room now?. I also brought up regarding the late check out and he advised to call back the day before we check out to check availability. 5minutes later, received a call from "Housekeeping Manager Donna", who sounded very tired and irritated in talking to me-she stressed out that my do not disturb sign is hanging. I said yes it is, also asked her is the housekeeping til 2pm ONLY?! She said "YES"! But,do you still want to make up your room? (Diverted the convo). So, both managers have different sides here?? Wednesday arvo, took Manager Chris advice to call them day before check out for late check out as having a baby on board is self explanatory and besides we're entitled of late check out as Platinum members! Spoke to Josh, who's pretty proud of organising a 12nn checkout that we expected to be later than that! He was explaining that "it depends with the occupancy and availability". Told him, that I want to speak to Chris put me on hold for 5 mins got back to me, saying they can occupy us for 5pm late check out with 100AUD fee. Am like?! We're entitled of free late check out! They should be mindful that if you're a platinum member you have to spend at least 8,000 AUD/ year with ACCOR hotels. I told him for the past 3 months we spent over 11,000 AUD just staying with ACCOR Hotels (business or holiday). This hotel was totally a mistake! The only reason we booked this hotel is Sofitel and Pullman was sold out! He end up haggling with me for 3pm late check out for 70 AUD and became 50 AUD the cheapest he can offer because he was explaining that residents shares housekeeping with hotel guests. Lol! Yet they are an ACCOR hotel & claiming they are a5 star hotel! He end up granting the 3 pm check out free of charge because I told him we never experienced this from Sofitel & New Inchcolm who are certified a 5 star hotel. For example, if Sofitel couldn't grant us a 5pm late check out they will offer 4pm at least the max. He waited for me to share our excellent experience with Sofitel and Mgallery before actually granting the late check out that THEY could've granted us HASSLE FREE! Overall, They should be an ACCOR "2 star Hotel" and they don't have the right to claim they are a 5 STAR ACCOR HOTEL!!! We will never book this hotel ever!!! What an absolute disappointment!!!  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469328460~“Not a 5 Star Hotel”~The Quay West seems more like a dated residence that rents out spare rooms rather than a hotel. A lot of the occupants appear to be residents. If staying here you should expect lax front desk service, old furnishings/fittings and minimal benefit to any Accor status you might hold. The "hotel" has limited staff. We weren't helped with our bags at check in. It was normal for there be no staff in sight at the restaurant and at times nobody was behind the front desk.  Daily room cleaning was more of a "cursory tidy-up" rather than a proper clean. There was a lot of pubic hair in the bath when we checked in. It seems that housekeeping is only really available until 2pm, because one day at 1.55pm we still had the "dnd" sign out and someone stuck something under the door saying call reception by "7:30pm if room cleaning is required" with the 7:30 crossed out and replaced with "2pm". The cleaner was however very nice. The hotel has little character and is reminiscent of a nursing home.  We requested a cot and high chair, they weren't in the room when we checked in. But, we did get to check in early and they did ultimately get sent to the room.  The restaurant is okay. The menu is a bit limited and the main meals vary in size dramatically but the food is okay. The chairs are worn and tables decorated with IKEA fake plastic plants. Meals invariably took a long time to come out. Whilst there was only ever really one person serving at the restaurant, they were always very polite and professional.  The view from our room was spectacular.  The internet is decent and free for Le club members.  There is a ok pool and a small gym but the spa bath is indefinitely out of service.  Our biggest issue was the extreme negotiations required to secure a late check out. I travel weekly and am an Accor plus platinum member. The main status benefit is late check out as my weekly routine is to meet my family back at the hotel after finishing work to travel to the airport together. We requested late check out before arriving, then every day at the hotel without any confirmation. Finally, my wife was offered late check out for $100. Upon explaining it should be free due to our status price negotiations commenced: the offer was eventually dropped to $70, then $50 and finally (after much fuss) $0. I have no idea how this place gets 5 stars. The rooms feel like they may have been worthy of that in the 90's and there is basically no service. Perhaps it's the view.  I'm actually confused as to why it is an Accor hotel... it's not really a hotel, rather an expensive serviced apartment with skeleton staff. Will avoid in the future.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467091799~“Great location”~Stayed here for two nights recently with family. The location is great, on the edge of the CBD, adjacent to the botanic gardens. It was a short walk back into the cbd. Outlook was gorgeous, over the gardens to the Brisbane River/Kangaroo Point as well. The apartment was nicely fitted out with a couch, dining table, kitchen, and 1 bedroom. Bathroom wasn't the flashest (maybe a little dated), but ok. I'd definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_466395497~“Spacious, clean rooms with sensational views”~The Quay West Suites Brisbane is perfectly located on Alice Street on the Eastern Edge of the CBD in the heart of Brisbane. Guests who book the river view rooms will be treated to stunning views over the City Botanic Gardens to the Brisbane River and Woollongabba (The 'Gabba - Brisbane Cricket Ground). The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The decor is beginning to look a little dated. Rooms are generally very clean, although the carpet would benefit from a through shampooing or replacement. Although booking a "Breakfast Included rate" the menu was somewhat spartan, no cereals offered, and several items were for an additional fee, e.g. espresso-based coffees. Moderately-priced, this property provides for an affordable, yet conveniently-located stay in the heart of Brisbane. My check-out could have been more efficient, as the sole staff-member was engaging another guest in a protracted analysis and discussion of their bill, while I, and other guests were forced to wait for service.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_466151592~“Getaway”~My husband and I stayed here for a night and we were quite impressed. The suites are spacious with a living, kitchen, laundry, bathroom and the view of the Botanical Gardens is exceptional! It's situated within a 15-20min walk to South Bank where we had a beautiful meal. They only had valet parking, but this didn't bother us.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465179946~“Has potential but...”~Great location and I do t mind the decor at all, however my issue was with the amount of black hair on the bathroom floor, the shower, the bed and god knows where else, I assume it is from the cleaners and if so I strongly suggest they wear hairnets. The doors all had dirty hand marks over them and as I attempted to wipe them myself it was definitely an oversight in their part. Apart from this it would have been a lovely stay, like I said excellent location, great views and balcony is of good size. This place does have the potential to be excellent and 5 star worthy if they just pay more attention to the cleaning.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464929613~“Great city”~This is a great hotel in a great location , we had a suit on the 20th floor overlooking the Royal Park and the Brisbane river , we had a large bedroom with TV , a utility room with washing machine and tumble dryer a small kitchen and a lounge with TV. We found the staff very helpful , and we would not hesitate to stay here again if we ever came back to Brisbane.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464186430~“Outdated room”~The photo can say a million dollars but when you go in the room reality hits you. That what i got from the outdated room. Being in the city with resturants, southbank and great view of the park you would expect the room to be what you paid for. Sadly it wasnt the case. Perhaps the award was given to the hotel when it was still the 20th century.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456593698~“Always a winner”~We last stayed here 8yrs ago when we travelled to Australia and it was an obvious choice when we went back this year. It's in a brilliant location, five minutes walk to the harbour, central shopping just around the corner and opposite the beautiful botanical gardens. Our one bedroom apartment was spacious and had everything you needed, including a washing machine, dryer and washing tablets (great if you have been travelling like us). The apartments are spotless, the staff were incredibly helpful and we would stay here again every time. My only comment would be the restriction on wi-fi and only being able to use it for 30 minutes in the lobby (unless you pay for it in your room) in this day and age free wi-fi should be a given.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455126084~“Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere...”~Unless you like to scratch your knuckles as you open the refrigerator door, prefer horrendous wifi, the most poorly designed interiors, knocking your head against a ridiculous light shade, little to no kitchen items, a swamp of a bathroom with windows that don't close and poorly working air conditioning. This place is not worthy of the Accor brand. The only ++ are the staff are lovely the gym was decent and the food was pretty good but these poor wait staff were so overworked!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454821013~“Fantastic location ”~It's the location that makes these appartments. Opposite the botanical gardens, walking distance to river stage, Southbank, these appartments are well situated.  Some of the fittings and fixtures are s little dated like the bathrooms however everything works, staff are very helpful and pleasant. Concierge parking is available, on street parking is limited and restricted.  The pool and gym are clean, well maintained. Recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454425522~“Great location”~Due to unexpected circumstances stayed 1 night in a 1 bedroom apartment and the 2nd night in a 2 bedroom apartment. Checkin quick and efficient. Friendly staff The rooms are dated but I love them as far as I am concerned quite big and spacious. Beds very comfortable and good selection of pillows. Air conditioning great...night and day selection so that the ac is directed to the higher use area for those times. Kitchen very basic but enough to get by. Small dishwasher..my only gripes no jug to fill with water as the days were quite hot. Also would be nice to have ice available not an empty container in freezer! Bathrooms great, bath and separate shower. Great toiletries. Laundry washing machine and dryer...small area but adequate . Both rooms had balconies and great views. The 2nd room we were in was extremely noisy as next to construction site and building started well before 0600 . We were out most of the day however very annoying the times we were in our room. Both rooms we weren't provided with soap powder for washing machine, no linen for the fold out bed and we had problems with Wifi which when connected was extremely slow. Staff were very helpful on all occasions  Loved the location..just across from Botanic Gardens. Short walk to Southbank,shopping centres, eating places and coffee shops. Breakfast was included in our package. Meals were excellent although a little slow but we weren't in a hurry so it didn't present a problem.  We would stay here again......~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453923415~“Tired ”~The hotel is in a great location for families with the park across the road and everything nearby but the hotel rooms are looking very tired.

The gym was disappointing and very basic.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452304049~“alright”~Hi Quay West Myself and Husband stayed for 4 nights and 5 days over the new year period in January. It was great until we had to take our own luggage to our room, ciggie butts on our balcony, was told 199 a night and then received bill and that went to 209, 229 a night, because of different nights was not informed of that in the beginning shame on you, also a 40.00 credit card fee WTH and to top it all off I left a small cardigan behind and was charged $16.85 for postage, seriously. So much for customer service...Will not recommend and will not stay again, for the money~3~1~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_450614770~“Great location and view”~Stayed five nights here on the 17th floor in a two bedroom suite. The unit has wonderful views to southern, botanical gardens and towards the city. The bedrooms were comfortable and clean. The kitchen was equipped only for the very basics. I had to clean one pit before use and there isn't a fry pan. There is an oven with a grill, micro wave (old) toaster, dishwasher and hot drink making facilities. Air Conditioning kept the place cool. There is a small laundry with a washing machine and separate clothes dryer. The bathrooms (2) are clean and usable in a tight space. There is off street parking at $40 overnight with valet service so add this onto you account. This is a great location, easy walk to shops, CBD, gardens, public transport and ferry services. We had one room service meal which was OK for the money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450039886~“great location, but terrible in every other way”~We stayed at their sister property in Sydney and had a lovely experience. Neither property is very new, but both have excellent location to make up for it. However, the Brisbane one lacked so many basics: our room was booked for a family of four, but there were no linens for the sofa bed. When we called the front desk, the answer was that there is no housekeeping and he could only bring up the sheets and I would have to make the bed because he was the only person on staff - at 7.00 p.m. on a weekday... seriously?  The beds were so uncomfortable that none of us slept well. I think we would have done better to sleep on the floor - if I had thought it was clean enough. The shower is slanted so that all the water runs out of it to the drain in the middle of the bathroom floor - which means once one person has showered, there is a puddle in the bathroom until housekeeping comes the next day - ALL night, and all morning - we were constantly concerned about someone slipping at night. The 'kitchen' was laughable. There are no dishes - we couldn't even find cups for water! I can't imagine I could have, if I had wanted to, prepare even a simple boiled egg!  We were here in the height of summer, but the days we were there it was rainy and a bit cool - we had hoped to enjoy the pool on the afternoon of boxing day - but it was freezing cold. I know it's summer, but it could have been heated to accommodate the chilier weather. The pool in Sydney, although indoor, was heated to a very comfortable temperature. Knowing we would stay at multiple properties, I joined the Accord club to include Wifi in our stay. There is daily usage limit that even two people checking basic email outstrips and after that it is slower than dial-up in the early 1980's! It was ridiculous. The Brisbane Council free Wifi was faster!  We needed to park a car overnight for ONE night, but would have arrived after 11 p.m. and would need to leave by 6:30 a.m. They told us they could not help us with getting into the garage between those hours and suggested we park on the street. On our last morning, we thought we'd have our breakfast there - they took SO LONG we almost missed our flight, despite being in the restaurant and having ordered almost four hours ahead of our flight - and there was ZERO traffic. The view is amazing. The location is amazing. But there are other places right next to it - look there and save yourself the bothers.~2~nan~4~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_449556168~“Our nightmare”~It's our first time to Brisbane and it should be a very great trip. However, the last two nights in Quay west Suites were our nightmare. They didn't provide housekeeping even we hung the tag of "refresh the room" on the doorknob since noon. The most exaggerated is the shower head had been leaking over two days and it seriously influenced our sleep quality. When we complaint these fatal problems to the hotel counter, they did nothing and just said their rooms are fully booked. See that's their quality.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447850427~“Great position in the CBD”~We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment for one night only. Sadly was only on 2nd floor so no views. Pretty good value for 4 adults which included breakfast. Breakfast was not quick but was delicious. We were not in a rush so it didn't bother us - if you were perhaps you should ask them to hurry it along. The room was good for what we wanted - oldish but still fine. Clean apart from the windows - pretty dirty. Valet parking not cheap at $40 but convenient. Fabulous position across from gardens and easy walk to Southbank etc. We grabbed some bikes near the gardens and rode around everywhere - just make sure you can get helmets with the bike cause not all of them have them.  Yes rooms could do with update and better furniture but we were hardly in the room anyway and it was fine!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_447320895~“Best Views & Amazing Location”~We stayed at the Quay West Apartments in December 2016 for a couple of nights in and out of Brisbane. The apartments, although older, are spacious and tidy. The 2 bed apartments is perfect for a family of 4 and we felt extremely comfortable during our stay. The service is friendly and mostly efficient. Breakfast service is slow but the food is delicious. Check-in and check-out was efficient and easy. The views are spectacular and the location is superb. Directly across the road from the Botanical gardens which are magnificent, a 10min walk to South Bank and any shops you may need. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_447028276~“Never get tired of this location”~Stayed for Xmas. Booked two one bedroom apartments. Never get tired of this location. Has to be the best location in Brisbane. Easy walking distance to malls, yet far enough away so not bothered by mad crowds. Botanic gardens are superb, with option to walk or ride. Staff were very attentive despite a very busy Xmas functions going on. The apartment style rooms with great balconies are very user friendly.  It is getting a little tired though, with the usual little things just starting to malfunction. needs some work. Having said that the staff were very responsive. Excellent value for money. Highly recommend a stay.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_446531735~“Great views from here!”~Having done our research on apartments with good outdoor space and centrally located we were not disappointed upon arrival at Quay West. We stayed in a two bedroom suite on the 17th floor, which had excellent river and botanical garden views from a spacious balcony. As we were here just before Christmas we enjoyed the bonus of being able to see the nightly fireworks along the South Bank from the balcony. The apartment itself is spacious and well appointed, although certain aspects of the decor could do with an update. Also the kitchen drawers were short of a few utensils, including a frying pan and the oven had no grill pan - or oven gloves. Not a disaster, but these things would be welcome. But my main gripe is that you have to pay for wifi in your room (it is free in the ground floor lobby, though). These days I'd expect it to come as standard, especially in a large chain such as Quay West. Having travelled around Europe, and stayed in small family run places and large concerns where wifi has always been free, why can't wifi be free here too? ( We also encountered the same issue in North America)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_441635466~“Disappointing ”~We chose this hotel because of its 5* status, and it was the beginning of an overdue holiday!  On arrival there was no one at the check in desk so we had to wait outside the hotel doors and talk on an intercom to a lady in a call centre, we had to shout out our credit card details before we were then directed to a safe outside with our room keys in. There was no staff by the pool so we had to go back into the hotel for a drink. The spa by the pool was out of order, and the sunbathing loungers were infested with ants.  We also had issues with the wifi, we were told you were only allowed a small limit per day, this was no good for us as we needed to book further travel and hotels.  The rooms were clean and tidy, however were old fashioned.  When we managed to talk with staff they were friendly and happy to help.  Overall, disappointing for us but a convenient hotel for the city.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439141178~“Disappointing”~Mum and I were looking forward to having out very first vacation together in 28 yrs. When we arrived to our two bedroom suite, we opened the door and went in to find every single door, window cupboard wide open (including the microwave) the lamps had all been knocked over and it was obvious something wasn't right. We rang reception as we were afraid someone had broken in. They told us just to shut all the doors and everything was fine, that the cleaners leave it open for final inspection, clearly that didn't happen. The carpets were all stained. The door leading from the bedroom to the balcony was broken so couldn't be locked. There was blood stains on the bed spread. Faeces on the bathroom wall (which we had to clean) the bathrooms were mouldy and had not been cleaned properly as there was snot on the shower walls from where someone had blown their nose in the shower. The bathroom amenities had not been replenished and empty packets were left on the bathroom counter to "look" like there were products in them. The tea and coffee amenities were not replenished and when mum asked the young gentleman that delivered our room service if we could get some more tea and milk he replied, "the cleaners have finished for the day, is it urgent?" No, a cup of tea is not urgent but it would have been nice.  There was a building being constructed not 30m from out suite, and construction began every morning at 6 am with Jack Hammers etc. We were not informed of this when booking in, it would have been appreciated if we had of or we would not have stayed there because we were looking forward to a rest.  When we ordered room service and when we were finished placed our tray outside as requested. These trays didn't get collected for over 24 hrs, along with everyone else's on that floor. It smelt like an old rubbish bin full of food scraps when you entered the hallway. The best part of our stay was the room service. The food was AMAZING! Apart from there we will never stay there again or recommend it to anyone!~2~nan~5~1~nan~nan~2~nan
review_437916666~“Good location, hotel dated, dirty, demoralised and in disrepair”~Great location across road from the Botanical Garden but a bit of a hike to the South Bank or shops, especially with young children.  The problems started when we arrived - to be told the pool had a leak and couldn't be used - offered the use of a pool in another hotel 2 blocks away - but not what we had wanted for our holiday break with the kids. No attempt had been made to let us know ahead of time, and no real attempt to make amends.  In the room there was a nice touch of a bottle of fizz for my wife's birthday. The room had lovely views across the river and botanical gardens, which wasn't noisy for a city hotel overnight. The internal furnishings were at best dated, grime all around the kitchen and blinds, odd cupboards in bedrooms from previous wardrobe assemblies. No TV in the back bedroom. Basic TV in main bedroom.Unable to get computer to communicate via HDMI into any TV to watch films through the laptop. WiFi only free for 30 mins, then charged.  When I booked the room I asked for twin beds, but was told hotel couldn't do this - in room it looked like this facility used to be the case but now only configuration was 2 double beds.   Decor throughout hotel warn, dated and dingy. Even the chairs in the dining room were worn through on the edges.  Breakfast was a very tiresome experience. There was no breakfast buffet, other than tea, dishwater coffee and fruit juice. The breakfast menu was sophisticated but the meals when they did eventually arrive were not very filling, other than the waffles / pankcakes with masses of syrup which the children of course loved, but even these were luke ward and chewy - freshly warmed up in the microwave I wouldn't be surprised. It took almost an hour for breakfast to be served and we were told one morning by the waitress that she was overworked - hard to believe when we only saw a maximium of three other tables being served at any one time. Servicing of the room let a lot to be desired - OK with young kids it can sometimes be a bit of a bomb site, but at the very least empty the overflowing bin in the bathroom, wash the kitchen sink and make an effort to vacuum the floor - perhaps even refresh the bathroom toiletries! Car parking is expensive and inconvenient - as a guest you do not have direct access to your car which you can only get to with the help of the receptionist - As reception isn't staffed overnight this can be a bit of a pain. At the end o our stay I did bring all the above to the management's attention, who let us off having to pay the car parking premium, and I would hope there has been a positive response - but I fear the problems here run very deep.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_434992161~“Spacious and Comfortable!”~Beautiful location across from the City Botanic Gardens and very large suites with all amenities and appliances including washer and dryer.  Big wide balconies allow the opportunity to sit outside and take in the view of the park and the nearby river. Not sure what the city view rooms overlook but if you have a choice, I'd recommend the park view.  With it's quiet lobby and restaurant, the Quay West combines a boutique hotel feel with fully equipped and comfortable rooms.  Some tips: As the reception desk is open from 6am till 11pm, early morning departures are best arranged the night before.  Wfi is available for a fee, however the Quay West is a member of the Accor hotel group. It's worthwhile to join the Accor Hotel program as members receive free internet access during their stay. Finally, there's a large residential tower going up right next door to the hotel. This makes for some noisy construction sounds during the day but that ends well before evening and the windows and balcony doors are effective at cutting out most of the daytime noise.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_432793722~“Lovely views, great and large rooms with a full kitchen”~Friendly staff and great rooms with views. Opposite the gardens which is just lovely for an afternoon stroll. The breakfast is only to order so no buffet. Eggs bendicts were lovely. I had the barrumundi in the evening and that was amazing.  Local to everything including great restaurants around the corner as well.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_427493910~“quick stay but a good stay”~Stayed one night here in a one bedroom suite, lovely place with views over the botanical gardens and the river. The rooms are older style but lovely and spacious. the bed was divine and had a great sleep. Parking expensive @ $40 but for Brisbane prices not too bad. Staff wonderful and efficient. Lots of restaurants close, we ate at Moo Moo which was wonderful. Breakfast a la cart and sufficient, no buffet offered. Defiantly would stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_422988600~“Great location, lovely property”~My family and I have stayed at Quay West Suites a few times now and it is always our top choice for a stay in Brisbane.  The hotel is centrally located and most rooms have views over the lovely Botanic Gardens.  The rooms are great with separate laundry (a bonus when traveling with little ones!) and a kitchenette.  The staff have always been friendly and helpful.  I recommend buying some groceries at a supermarket beforehand if possible as the convenience stores nearby are very expensive ($5 for water, $5 for 2L milk).  We hope to stay at Quay West next time we're in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_415519009~“"Go To" Place in Brisbane”~We stayed here for 5 nights last week and the room was exactly as photo on website showed. The 1 br apartment was spacious and very clean and very well appointed. It was just like a home away from home. The bed was a NZ super king and very comfortable with good linen and ranch sliders out to the deck from both lounge & bedroom was convenient, and the deck was great with furniture to sit out and enjoy the lovely view of Botanic Gardens. I have to say this is one of the best places we have stayed, anywhere, all things considered. The water pressure in shower was good and someone brought up brownies on a plate and bottled water just after we arrived ! If you are an accor member the wifi is free and meals in the restaurant have the usual discount of 50% for 2 people per membership. And, the wifi was fast in our room. The front desk people were helpful and we will definetly stay again.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_415267104~“Super”~This hotel has everything you want to have from a 5 star. Big and spacious rooms. Rooms are very clean. People at reception are very nice and help you in any matter and needs you might have. Breakfast is very good. Perfect position to visit Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414514258~“Fantastic Location”~We stayed for a weekend with our three kids. I cannot fault the staff,very friendly and extremely helpful. The young guy on reception when we arrived was especially helpful and gave great advice on where to go and what things to see. The room was very clean and plenty of space for all of us. The views were absolutely amazing. We had a garden view suite that overlooked the botanical gardens but we also had views of the river - just perfect. The kids loved the pool. We arrived early as we thought we could look around the local area before checking in and were thrilled when we were told we were welcome to check in straight away. Checkout is not until 11am so we had plenty of time for the kids to squeeze in another swim and to have breakfast which was included. The breakfast was really nice. We all had something different and no one was disappointed. We asked if we could leave our car in the carpark after we had checked out and was told we could leave it there all day if we liked. It just made it so much easier to make the most of our weekend. Would certainly stay again and will definitely recommend to others.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_413801787~“Home away from home”~We spend so much time at this venue. Simply because our business dictates we stay overnight in Brisbane. The reason we choose this particular venue is because of the staff. We are made feel welcome throughout out stay; northing is too much trouble; the service is wonderful; and the restaurant provides a wonderful cuisine which changes regularly for dinner. Although the breakfast menu does not change, it is adequate. The Brisbane Club which is located nearby directs its clients to this venue for breakfast.  The views from the hotel are spectacular looking across to the Brisbane botanical gardens and to the river.  The cleanliness of this hotel is exceptional.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_411751997~“Mixed feelings”~Stayed for 4 nights. The location is excellent for easy access to the city and great views over the gardens and river if you have a room on that side. The one bedroom apartments are spacious - large living area with a functional kitchen and a separate bedroom - both have access to the large well appointed balcony. The bed was very comfortable, though there were no extra blankets provided and Brissy was having a bit of a cold spell at the time. If, as we were, you are located on a lower level floor, the street noise in the early hours of the morning may bother some people. The apartment we stayed in was in need of some TLC. The bathroom and kitchen, while in need of some modernisation, were also both in need of a good clean. Evidence of long standing dust and dirt were evident on doors and cupboards that would take 5 minutes to clean - not a good impression. More concerning was the erratic shower temperatures that scalded and froze the body without notice. Notified guest services after a couple of days of experiencing this but assume that it is difficult to address on a weekend. Overall impression - great location spacious rooms in need of some quality monitoring.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_406490652~“Good spot”~Nice place to stay, only stayed one night. Room was big. Bathroom smelled mouldy, but room was nice overlooking botanic gardens with big balcony. Best thing was excellent customer service, awesome restaurants in area. Valet parking expensive $40.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405884155~“Something is not right”~I have stayed here a number of times previously and always really enjoyed staying here, but this time things were off. The rooms are great, self contained, bathtub, lovely balcony. However, my bathroom bin hadn't been emptied from the previos guest, there was a pen under the couch, no card to advise how to contact reception etc, and a hair on the shower wall that was not mine. I did notify reception about the bin, card and pen (I had already picked the pen up) and they were fixed while I was out. My room was serviced three times during my stay, toiletries were replenished once. Breakfast was interesting. I have never had to request butter for my toast. Great location, comfortable bed, but maybe some staff need more training.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404035778~“Great appartments”~We stay in one of these suits on a recent trip to Brisbane. What at great location. The Botanical Gardens were right across the road and the city centre within walking distance. It is also only a short 5 mins in the car across to south bank. We were on the 16th floor and had amazing views. Its also a great place to stay if you are running in the Brisbane Marathon as the race starts almost right out the front. It took me all of 2 mins to walk to the start line.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_403413227~“great location opposite botanical gardens”~If your doing the Brisbane Marathon this is the place to stay. Start line is 50m away. Motel itself is excellent with some amazing views across the gardens and looking down the river.  Shops, restaurants are all only a very short walk away and there is plenty to choose from. Lifts a fast and large. We'll be back!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_402992005~“Wow wow wow”~This is a great place. Right across the road from the botanical gardens , easy walking distance to Parliament House, the Treasury Casino, the shops , Southbank and restaurants. This is a great place to stay  The suites are great , clean, big and exceptional views of the river , and at night just a wonderland  The staff are amazing , nothing short of exceptional , and big thanks to Tom on front desk who just made our stay  But all staff on front desk and in the restaurant are great  Highly recommend you visit this hotel.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_402300995~“Another great stay!”~We return to this establishment regularly.  The reason being that their staff (particularly management and reception) are extremely friendly, always ready to assist, and treat us with a smile each time they see us. Makes us feel as we are in a 'home away from home', which is much appreciated, particularly when travelling to Brisbane on a regular basis. We like what the apartments offer us, and we would not even contemplate the idea of going elsewhere ................ keep up the good work!!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
