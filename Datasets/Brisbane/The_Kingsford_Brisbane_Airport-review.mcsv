review_476305634~“Modern and Clean”~Stayed here for one night in between our flight and cruise......modern decor and clean. Room was quite small but was all we needed. Great black out curtains. Staff were very nice and helpful, no problem for late check out. Easy walk to get food. Quick taxi ride to the ferry terminal. Great place for a stop over.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_464441164~“Mrs”~We booked this hotel as we had an early flight next morning and it was very reasonably priced. For a small fee we received transport to the airport and were also able to leave our vehicle there for 2 weeks. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who was very helpful. Being on one of the upper floors was no problem as they have a lift. The room itself was very clean and comfortable. Would recommend this hotel if you need to be at airport early.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462325562~“Over nighter ”~I would of been better sleeping on the floor because the bed was that hard. Seriously have you had a plumber install the showers and baths? Looks great but useless and leak everywhere not to mention I felt like I was going to fall through the floor as it's not supported under it. At least they were clean ... ish! A dusting wouldn't hurt!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452933086~“Disappointing”~Arrived late evening - young lady on the front desk was lovely - her day nearly complete with only 20 minutes to go. She advised the aircon had been put on in our room which i thought was a lovely gesture. This is where the good vibes ended. The room was hot the aircon was not working at all you can't open a window obviously for safety reasons so the room was stuffy. There are some trouble shooting instructions for the aircon so it may be a regular occurrence but .... we followed these to no success at all. So we were hot, tired and irritable then the television turns off every 15 minutes for no reason. Although the rooms are somewhat modern the bathroom is poorly designed you have to walk under the rain head shower to turn the water on so you get hit with a load of freezing water (no way around this) also the frosted panels look lovely and modern my issue is they are only frosted half way up the wall therefore if you are sitting on the toilet everyone can have a full view as it is clear glass on the lower half. You cant call anyone for assistance as there is no after hours number. You cannot go out to your car as you need to take the room key which in turn shuts all power off. You leave a $100 additional security deposit which does not get returned for 5 days. My lesson if you think it looks too good to be true it probably is. Would we stay again... definately not SUPREMELY DISAPPOINTED!~2~nan~nan~nan~1~3~3~nan
review_449024139~“GREAT LOCATION”~Book in staff were excellent , extremely helpful and friendly . Room was great [ suited us ] . Air conditioner like most hotels, was too small for the room and a bit noisy . Breakfast was good . Would Recommend this hotel for staying in this area.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_444583014~“Not much sleep”~Very modern and friendly staff. The rooms are clean and modern ( maybe a little TOO modern as lights and water are different then normal and difficult too work out) bed was firm but no difference in the pillows. They are all full and not good for a tummy sleeper. Also one of my hates are the beds that don't have sheets and only have Doonas. It's great if the aircon is working but the BIG problem with the aircon in the room we had is it works for around 3 minutes and then shuts off for 5 minutes which doesn't make the room very cool and in December in Queensland this is not good. Consequently I got around three hours sleep before a five o'clock wake up to fly to NZ. All in all won't be going back.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444144293~“Fantastic service, great location”~My overall experience was fantastic for this boutique hotel. The Receptionist provided exceptional customer service by cheerfully helping me with my requests:- change of rooms to a larger room as I had some guests coming over for a pre-dinner drink, sourced me a phone charger as I forgot to bring my own, made me aware of the 2 for 1 drink special, gave me advice on where to go for dinner (and provided me with a local map). Great location, few minutes walk from restaurants etc, the room was spacious and nicely fitted out. Double glazed I believe, as there was no road noise even though I was facing Kingsford Smith Dve. Very happy and I will come back.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_441641093~“Excellent accommodation”~Excellent accommodation, friendly staff who are genuinely interested in you having a great stay. Highly recommend. Location is excellent near the airport and for me a Christmas party in nearby Portside wharf.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_440551379~“Comfortable, clean, very friendly and helpful staff.”~The rooms are clean and comfortable and perfect for a night or two if you want to be close to the airport and eat street markets. A bit small if you wanted to stay any longer and probably good for couples but the glass walls for the bathroom are totally see through. Evelyn at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Our room was at the back so no road noise but the air conditioner didn't seem to cool the room sufficiently. Would stay here again as long as I could get a room at the back.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438600167~“Boutique hotel”~Very modern and newly furnished. Quirky bathroom with glass walls to bedroom only partially obscured. Ours had a bath with shower over, but non adjustable as it was set in the ceiling. Result? Water flooded the bath rim and then ran down the side and onto the floor, a known issue apparently which may be fixed. No wardrobe, only 2 hangers on the wall. Probably as it is used mainly for airport travellers. Small cafe attached. Lots of eating a short walk away~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_436525993~“The flush keeps flushing all night automatically ”~I recently stayed here for one night for work. On arrival the room is modern and very Scandinavian looking furniture. It's a space saver Studio with use of vertical wall storage for things like iton board and to hang clothes on hooks. The bathroom floor is made of the camp style plastic material and all toiletries are nice and fixed to the bathroom walls using bottles. The worst parts were my room was facing the road so had noise, the bathroom flush kept flushing itself every 15 minutes all night and the air con kept turning itself off all night which made sleep inpossible given it was 35 degrees in Brisbane. Will not stay here again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435703658~“I love this hotel”~This is a lovely place to stay - close to the airport - and all sorts of other amenities. It is such a well-designed modern space and I loved my room. It has lots of great design touches - and the service is excellent. Definitely a place to stay next time in Brisbane.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433160195~“I am a little disappointed!”~It's not very often that I need to make a negative comment. We stayed here for a night over the weekend, it was my husband and his brothers birthdays, we were off to the races. Some things we really liked eg. Booking, checkin, service at desk The disappointing part was the queen bed and pillows were so uncomfortable, the aircon was so hard to regulate and the final thing was we were told that we could have breakfast in the morning which was then cancelled. It's a shame really, this hotel is perfect for going to the races.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_432667993~“Impressed with airport ”~It's the early hours of the morning so not a lot open but I travelled to NZ in March and it was great then too. The toilets are clean and there are lots of them. This time I noticed a charging station . Might not be new but it's really good idea.  There are so many different kinds of seating and areas. The duty free makes every day look like Xmas.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429985424~“Brisbane Domestic Terminal”~My first visit to the Domestic Terminal and I was really impressed with the facilities and atmosphere. I especially appreciated the vast seating areas for travellers and visitors, and the availability of power/usb points. In some airports you struggle to find a seat and trying to recharge your mobile device is near impossible. Well done Brisbane Airport management.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424874566~“Perfect ”~The Kingsford was perfectly located and offered me everything I needed to rest after working very long days. The rooms were very comfortable, modern and soundproof. Staff were also very welcoming and attentive. I found the Kingsford the perfect place to rest. Andrew.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424201837~“Mixed review”~Our first impression was great. Very friendly and helpful front desk girl. Room was newly refurbished, modern and clean. But there was nowhere to hang clothes, no window to open for a bit of fresh air and the smallest fridge I've ever seen. Our room was meant to be made up the next day. We were out from 7am-2pm for back and it hadn't been done. Very disappointed. I was in the shower as we were going to a wedding when housekeeping knocked on our door at 2.15. We told them we would be out in 1 hour but they never came back. Apart from that great location. Ferry across the road. Eat Street within walking distance and cafes, pub and race course nearby.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_420688550~“Unpretentious with delightful staff”~Nice room with plenty of space and a big screen tv though only free to air channels. The free bottled water was a nice touch as was the free hi speed wifi. The staff were outstanding.....so friendly and helpful. The location is a little challenging unless you need to be in Hamilton or have an early flight.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417955238~“Fine no-frills accommodation for a an overnight stopover”~Modern and well-located accommodation, close to the airport and local eateries. Room had enough of the necessary appointments for an overnight stay, though the glass wall between the bed and the bathroom doesn't afford much privacy if you're staying with others. Also, beware if you have a shower over a bathtub - the water totally floods the bathroom floor - the design is terrible. Also, nearly all of the toiletries located in the shower stall were empty, including the body wash which was as frustrating as it was inconvenient.  I arrived late and didn't utilise the cafe for breakfast, so can't comment on the available meals; in-room tea, coffee and complimentary water was supplied. The girl who checked me in was very friendly and polite. Bed and pillows were super comfy, I didn't have a problem with noise, though I specifically requested a quiet room. Car parking is limited. For the price - depending on the room type - overall it's reasonable value.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_411220247~“An excellent Disability room”~An excellent hotel close to Brisbane airport. Close to a variety of restaurants. We requested a disability friendly room and we were given an excellent room that met all our requirements. When we booked the room (on line) we were able to see pictures of the layout and this was very helpful. Staff at the hotel were excellent and very helpful. Would definitely stay there again. Excellent for a short stopover~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_409126609~“Great staff in this noisy little hotel”~A late arrival, the girl on the desk couldn't do enough to help us which we were impressed with. She was certainly an asset to the property! Well appointed but cosy studio apartment but no eating area so had to perch on the bed to share dinner with my hubby. We found it very noisy during the night - no double glazing or heavy drapes to help block the traffic noise.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_408560619~“Close to airport and Eat Street market”~Suitable for stopover for early morning transit to airport and walking distance to Eat Street market (Friday night). Small room. If you are a light sleeper, do not expect to sleep well if booking one of the street facing balcony rooms. Bed comfortable and staff service impeccable. Breakfast menu is limited.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_407208476~“Great Location but No One's Home”~It's proximity to the Brisbane Airport and the CBD is excellent and it is modern and clean. One disappointment however is that since last staying here customer service has fallen away with reception (outside hours) being handled by a Call Centre in NSW and there being no Night Manager on site. Other than that and being charged 3% for using Amex it's a good hotel to stay when either flying in or out of Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403971361~“Very modern and clean + free WiFi”~I loved my stay at the Kingsford. While the room is small, it is very cleverly designed to make the most out of the space provided. It's a very cute room with everything you need. It has free parking, free WiFi with no limit so it's great for business stays, Flat screen TV, Iron & ironing board, clean bathroom with the showerhead mounted from ceiling, and the beds were super comfy! I have to say also, the rooms were extremely quiet.  Also of particular note was the service received not only from the front desk staff, but also the cafe staff. All of them were extremely helpful and attentive. The only draw-back was breakfast - at $38 it was a little steep for two coffees,a ham & cheese croissant and avo on toast. However, my review is focusing on the room so it gets an excellent review from me!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_403966323~“Honeymoon ”~We stayed here for one night and when we mentioned it was our honeymoon they immediately gave us free champagne to enjoy in our room.

review_399013070~“Locations is great”~I just needed somewhere to stay overnight close to the airport. Rooms are small and modern and have all amenities. Glass walls separate bathroom from bedroom area, so avoid if this may be a problem and pay for somewhere more expensive. Arrived on a Friday night, and went to the night food market, across the road, and about a block down. I was alone, and it was night, and I felt safe, so great location. Very near a petrol station, so you can pick up bits and pieces from there too. Front desk staff are very accommodating, and service is excellent.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_394937321~“Font desk staff are the BEST ever!”~The Service was second to none in this little hotel. The rooms were small and since there were 2 of us staying 5 days we upgraded to a suite for $25/day. After this were were comfortable. The girls at the front desk would bend over backwards to help in any way possible even though they were working alone (one at a time) and having to constantly multi task - they did it with a smile. They really went out of their way - thank you so much girls~4~nan~3~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_393767868~“Find Somewhere Else”~The bathroom with toilet is separated from the bedroom by glass walls. Is spite of the areas of frosted glass, sitting on the toilet was not a private experience, more like a deviant form of entertainment. In the morning I needed to shower and leave earlier than my wife who was intent on catching up on some sleep lost through travel. When I turned the bathroon light on, the whole bedroom was illuminated, waking her up. Having got her full attention, I then entered the shower cubicle, separated from my wife by one piece of glass and one metre in distance, I found to my great annoyance that the shower tap was broken and did not work. No staff stay on the property and the Reception is only manned from 7am - I was leaving before then. The hotel management have not responded to my e-mails detailing the hotel's shortcomings and seeking a refund.  We will not be staying again and will actively recommend anyone we know to avoid the place. .~1~nan~nan~nan~1~3~1~nan
review_382963785~“Fantastic location”~This was a fantastic location for when you need to take an early flight or get into Brisbane late. The restaurant had some difficulties on the evening we stayed but overall the service was pleasant and our stay was enjoyable.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_377088231~“Good value”~Stayed here for one night for a quick stopover in Brisbane. Fairly luxurious feel to the room considering the price with some nice little touches including slippers and good quality shampoo, conditioner & shower gel. Woolies is across the road along with a range of restaurants. The other hotels on Kingsford Smith Drive are all pretty tired and run down so if you're looking for somewhere decent between the airport and the city this is a good find!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_373957954~“Stop over Hotel”~Arrived late in the evening, around 22.00, no reception but easy access from telephone service at entrance door. Rooms clean and functional, be aware no where for a drink at this time of night so grab a bottle at the airport if you want a night cap.~4~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_373188805~“A luxurious overnight stay”~Has the feel and quality of an urban Hilton Hotel room - and has a hot tub! Great online as well as personal service. Top location for an airport accommodation. I cannot express enough the gratitude I feel for this very clean and comfortable experience. I don't actually remember when I've felt this refreshed after a long, tiring flight. The rain shower and Appleby toiletries were an especially unexpected touch of extra magic!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_370356915~“First stop of honeymoon...”~We had the most wonderful service here. I would say the nicest check-in/reception I have ever experienced in a city motel.

review_368338439~“No problem at all”~We stayed here just the one night prior to getting on a cruise ship. It was perfectly located a short taxi trip from the airport, and we were within walking distance to shops, cafe's and even the cruise terminal itself. The place was clean and modern. I had read some reviews about the glass bathroom wall separating the bed and bathroom area, but it was frosted glass, it wasn't an issue at all for us. All in all, i would stay there again definitely.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368078436~“Great staff and location. A haven after a long-haul flight”~SO recommend this hotel. It's close to the airport, but not too close. The staff are truly welcming. We have atayed here twice. LOVE the location, smart urban chic hotel, all the extras, like sleep on a cloud bedding, flat screen tv, black out drapes, quality toiletries and coffees, glass front fridge...and across the road, woolworths open late, sushi bar, gym, and freat coffee place, Italian up the road and 24 hour 7-11. Downstairs you can buy great coffee and meals and breakfast. Dont miss this one.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

Great pressure in the shower and absolutely no flooding issues if you close the door. Frosted glass in the bathroom so you will need to like who you sharing the room with. Ultra quiet cannot hear any outside noise. Definitely recommend.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_360536656~“great staff”~this is one of the best airport hotels I have stayed in for a while, I wont ever look around for anything else just book the Kingsford you wont be sorry. The staff go that extra mile for you and nothing is to much trouble~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_360275680~“Disappointing...and that shower!”~I looked at TripAdvisor after we had booked this hotel for an overnight stay prior to an early morning overseas flight, and most were spot on and I was pre-warned about the negatives, so thanks fellow travelers.  We had 'upgraded' to a suite just prior to arrival, and I am glad we did, as it was the smallest 'suite' I have ever stayed in! Sparsely decorated but with barely enough room for our bags and just two hooks!  And the shower! Others had commented on the flooding, but it is seriously a ridiculous shower design, with the floor flooding the entire bathroom after the shortest shower. So in order to prevent injury you spend considerable time mopping up the floor with the one washer and bath mat after you shower. With all the comments about this issue, why has this not been fixed yet? Some positives is that the one staff member was friendly and competent, booking was easy, and the hotel is modern with free parking (not secured) and wi-fi.. However the hallways and lifts need aircon and for what you pay you are probably better off with one of the older but 'larger roomed' hotels/motels on this 'strip' close to the airport. The negatives outweigh the positives here and will not stay here again.~2~nan~3~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_358369380~“Find somewhere else”~Very small room. First thing you see when you walk in the room is an ironing board hanging on the wall. The fridge is small and no icebox. The shower was only lukewarm that night and boiling hot the next morning.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_356917990~“Comfortable bed and luxurious”~This was a very nice hotel. We stayed here the night before flying out. We loved the room and the luxurious accommodations within. Prior to booking this room we inquired about kids staying and could only find a note that there was no extra charge. We ended up having to sleep one child on the love seat and one on the floor. And ask for extra blankets and towels. For it had only been adults I would have rated this excellent.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355524899~“Convenient with great staff”~Stayed for one night with my daughter before seeing her off on a cruise. Have to say that although beautifully appointed, with Villaroy Boch bathroom fittings, modern light fixtures, and the most gorgeous little ketttle and stand - the clear glass door to the bathroom and the frosted bathroom/bedroom wall make this hotel only suitable for people who are very familiar with each other to stay at, Seriously though - a delightful place with fantastic staff - they went out of their way to look after us and were delightful whilst being professional and efficient.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_351166423~“Clean and modern room needs better air cond”~Stayed here for one nigjt before departing on a cruise from nearby terminal. Hotel is nice and modern with great features. Also had a good breakfast downstairs but hotel needs air cond in the hallways and hiest bedrooms should have it turned on ready ready for check-in. Was about 60 degrees in our room as all locked up with no windows open or air cond on. Other then that we were quite impressed with the room and our stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_349609393~“Nice room but strange policy”~Very nice and modern hotel with a location in an uninteresting neighbourhood. Personnel friendly and helpful. They asked for a deposit of more than the rooms price in case anything should be broken or damaged. I have never before experienced that from neither hotels, motels or B&B's. Very odd not a place I would go again!~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~2~nan
review_345929551~“Chic and well located”~Lovely room with modern chic fittings; very quiet despite having a room at the front on the road. Some suggestions: a full length mirror needed (only mirror is vanity in bathroom); needs top sheet (only doona); not sure why a $150 credit card payment is taken on arrival which then takes three business days to go back into your account (I know next time to take $150 cash so I can get it back on departure). Overall, a good stay though!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Staff was helpful to arrange for an airport transfer with a short notice, and the room provided our much needed rest. it was large, clean, bed was comfortable, staff offered to give us a morning call, location was not too bad. you could stay nearer actually at places like novotel and all, probably more pricey.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
