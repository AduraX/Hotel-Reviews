review_476647479~“Enjoyed our Stay”~We stayed at this property for two night over Easter in April 2017 as we were attending a show at the Tivoli Theatre. The art and urban funky design very different and appealing.  We had a king size with courtyard room which was lovely, clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a little small as was the living area but not too bad. The carpark is next door and each time you want your car you need to go to reception where a staff member will come and open the carpark open for you. The staff were very obliging in this regard. The car was very secure at least but found it frustrating at check in on where to park the car before being given access prior to check in. The rooftop bar is lovely, thoroughly recommend it. Would give the burger bar "Churo" a miss, very ordinary and expensive for the rubbish it was. There are other more appealing choices further up Constance Street. We went to Churo for lunch, yuk! Gave it another for Breakfast and again yuk! Bacon cooked on hotplate where burgers are made, foul taste.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_476330335~“Well worth a stay”~I really liked Tryp. The noise from downstairs took the shine off, but it was excellent in all other regards. They thought of everything in the room, including a coffee machine and fast free wifi. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Cool place. :)~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476315351~“Great place but choose a quiet room”~I really loved my stay at Tryp. It has a great vibe, excellent security, modern original decor, and is well located. The staff were fantastic and cheerfully went out of their way to ensure I had a great stay. Thanks Stuart and Chris!! I wish I could give it five stars but I had a room on the noisy side of the hotel, above the cafe and next to a bar. Despite being on the third floor, I could hear the pumping noise from down below when I was trying to sleep and even from the shower with the bathroom door closed. This was a Sunday night. Well worth staying here, but be sure to specify a quiet room.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475785349~“Unsure. ”~Decor was funky and lots of good artwork to admire. Good location and comfy beds. Only negative was that the room smelt like eggs! Not sure why but didn't complain. Staff were lovely and very friendly.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475116549~“The best hotel”~Tryp Fortitude Valley, is one of the best hotels in Brisbane! The rooms are beautiful, the beds incredibly comfortable and the staff are exceptional! It is modern, with the beautiful artwork throughout, and the level of service from the front desk through to the staff servicing the rooms, is second to none! The Churr restaurant on the bottom level is an added bonus.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474811813~“NEW funky hotel, great staff”~Great hotel, love the funky decor. Staff where brilliant even showed us around the room and how to turn stuff on. Close to everything, and short walk to city, or bus and trains. Highly recommended for solo or couple. Only downside is the room windows don't open,so live in air-conditioning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473707805~“Recent stay at the Tryp Hotel Brisbane”~The staff were wonderful, extremely helpful. The room size, even though small, was well designed and throughly well appointed even down to the coffee machine. We attended a wedding on the roof top and it was an excellent venue.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_473497573~“Very nice.”~The staff were terrific; friendly, helpful and eager to assist. The hotel seems new and has an interesting motif with different artists decorating different floors. While the room was a touch small, that didn't matter as we were out most of the time. The room had all the amenities, plus some luxuries. The gym was great. Again, a bit small but contained all we needed and more. The hotel was situated close to the train station so getting anywhere was easy and there were some nice restaurants and cafes nearby. Will definitely return.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472237282~“Great Hotel! Amazing Service! Awesome Location!”~Hi, I recently stayed at the Tryp hotel by Wyndham in Brisbane. Luke at the front desk checked me in, and was very friendly through the process! Once I had completed check-in, I asked about things to do in the area as it was my first time staying at the hotel; Luke asked me if there was anything in particular that I was looking to do, and then recommended a number of different restaurants, and pubs that I might enjoy. I did follow some of his recommendations and really enjoyed my dinner.  The hotel itself was very unique. My room was spacious, and had great lighting! There were blue lights behind the normal lights, and you could leave those on in the evening and it looked very nice. I thought window was pretty cool! There were automatic blinds, so when I wanted to get some sleep, I could just click the button on a remote, and the shades came down.  My bed was incredibly comfortable! Maybe a little bit too comfortable, as I did not want to get out of it in the morning! haha  I was traveling for work, and had some work to get done, and the wifi was very easy to connect to, and it had a strong connection. That was a major plus for me.  The bathroom / shower was very nice, and I really liked the amenities. Aside from matching the look of the room, being trendy, they were good quality. The towels were nice, heavy, and there were plenty on the rack.  The room also had a nice closet area, with the mini bar, and coffee set up on top of the shelf. It had a really nice Vittoria Espresso pod machine, and the cool double walled glasses. I was able to enjoy a great coffee and be ready for the day!  I had breakfast downstairs at the restaurant, and it was fantastic.  I can't say enough, it was a great stay, and I am looking forward to my next visit!  I travel frequently, so when you get such friendly service from everyone, and the comfort of the room being as great as it was, it really makes a big difference.  I would strongly recommend staying at the Tryp by Wyndham Brisbane!  Thank you Luke, and to everyone at the hotel for a fantastic stay!  Best,  Andrew~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468709627~“Groovy hip hotel”~Stayed overnight & was impressed by everything. The hotel is unique & artsy. Staff are very friendly & helpful. Very new & immaculately clean. Rooftop bar & central to Valley restaurants & bars. Parking station next door. Would highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468468245~“Everything here is amazing: clean and neat rooms, AMAZING staff and fantastic facilities.”~I stayed here for 4 nights with my girlfriend and we had the opportunity to try a couple rooms. The staff are freaking amazing. Everyone we met there was ultra friendly and they really went out of their way to make sure that we had a really good stay there. You can ask the reception staff anything like "Where's a good place to go for breakfast?" and they will give you plenty of different options based on what you like.  All the housekeeping staff were wearing Black Milk clothing (awesome uniform) and were really happy to say hi as you walk past them in the hallway. We put out the "do not disturb" sign for one day and were not bothered at all. The rooms are pristine, the attention to detail in both the setup of the rooms and the cleanliness is perfect. They all have an interesting graffiti/street art style, with nice artwork hanging in each room. They also all have blackout blinds (literally making it night time at any time of day) and two sets of lighting (dark blue mood lighting and normal lighting).  All the rooms have free wifi and a Smart TV (with movies on demand you can watch). The internet speed was alright, I was getting about 3-5mbit (fast enough for browsing and watching youtube with no buffering). I don't know what it was about the beds, but they are truely super comfortable. I had an awesome night sleep every night. I wish I could steal one of the pillows! The location of the hotel is really great, you're half way between China Town/Brunswick St Mall/Train station and James Street. There's a LOT of restaurants and clubs to choose from, no matter which direction you choose to walk in. Also, being in the middle of Fortitude Valley, you can get an Uber within 3 minutes at any time of day. The first room we were in had an internal spa (they call this the King with Internal Spa) and we spent 2 nights in this room. It was really spacious and very quiet. I spent a day in the room with a serious hangover, so the mood lighting really helped me recover (also, the room service from the Chur restaurant downstairs meant I didn't have to leave the room at all). The second room we had was the King with Outdoor Spa. This room is the bees knees. The outdoor spa is really clean and will comfortably fit 2 people (up to 4 if you squish in a bit) and had a TV you can watch from the spa as well as the TV in the room you can watch from the bed. The room was a bit smaller than the first room, but it was fine for two people. The door to the balcony was double glazed glass so with the doors closed you couldn't hear any noise from outside. The third room we had was the King with Courtyard. It was the perfect size room. Our only issue with this room was that while the sound proofing between the rooms is really good, the private courtyards don't have soundproofing between them. We had some very noisy neighbours staying up at about midnight talking and playing music outside. Thankfully, the reception staff are glorious. I called reception and they came up and talked to the people next to us and suggested they move to the shared library at the end of the hallway (a win for them as they had more space + couches there and a win for us as we could get some sleep!)  In short: Everything here is amazing: clean and neat rooms, AMAZING staff and fantastic facilities. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_468192561~“Small but delightful”~While the room was small it was very funky. Great bathroom - loved the piece of glass artwork masquerading as a hand basin. And even though my view out the window was a wall, it featured some striking street art. The giant female eye staring at me was a little disconcerting though.  The staff were great and I slept like a baby. Would definitely stay there again!~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467159701~“Quirky, cool and comfortable”~Well..everyone said to us that we were mad going to Brisbane in January. It is so hot there they said. Well yes it was but the welcome was warm at the Tryp. Very helpful and a really cool room and I don't just mean the air conditioning.  The location was a little disappointing on the ascetic scale but for convenience to the train station it was worth it. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_465691506~“Weekday Stay”~Funky interiors, trendy bathroom design with long white tiles, black grout, black matte finishing and bright, colourful graffiti basin. Our room was spacious. Great location in the Valley. Easy and quick check in and check out process. Wonderful artwork in room, common areas and surrounding hotel. Parking on and off site.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_459479511~“Clean, friendly and very well cocated”~I stay at this hotel often and the standard is inconstant and very good,the staff are very friendly and helpful. Room are funky and clean. It's well located in the Valley with lots of great restaurants in walking distance.Short walk or quick taxi to the city center. The hotel is quite and you can just sit and chillax.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_458592935~“Great stay”~Great stylish hotel, with modern comfortable rooms. Staff are very kind and helpful. Parking is down the road in a public multi story parking area. Rooms can be a little small. Location is excellent right in the middle of fortitude valley. Will return.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456278104~“Stylish, friendly, great place”~Recommended by a friend, the Tryp lived up to the recommendation: well located, well priced, very stylish and staffed by very friendly people. I loved the art and decor in particular! And Chur Burger cafe on the ground floor is well worth a visit too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455791204~“Fantastic overnighter in the Valley”~Funky hotel, excellent and very helpful staff. Small room, great bed, very well stocked mini bar with a Nespresso machine. Fresh and ultra modern-esque. Artsy throughout. Super comfy king bed. Definitely will stay again and recommended! Short walk to the station, Wickham hotel and restaurants.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455264831~“Unrivaled Urban Cool”~We have stayed here twice with my son who is in a wheelchair and access is great, although navigating through the doors can be a bit tricky with bags etc. The accessible room is large with a double bed, great coffee and good wifi. The bathroom is large, spacious and well appointed. There is a large shower bench and grab rails. We love the blue LED mood lighting and is handy at night time! Staff are very friendly and helpful and will help with bags etc if needed. We love the industrial urban feel of the hotel and its at the quieter end of Fortitude Valley.  I also had a standard room with a double bed. They are not huge rooms but comfortable, well appointed and cosy. Close to lots of great spots in the Valley, nightclubs, chinatown, markets eateries etc. Everything you need for a short stay is there with great customer service!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455088852~“Awesome hotel”~Artsy hotel located in great location, would recommend to friend. We took the train from the airport and the walk from Fortitude Valley Station was 5mins. 25min walk to the city (if you're fit to walk), 10min cab ride to cbd or south bank. Close to restaurants, cafes and Chinatown. We stayed in a King Room which was spacious and funky (no balcony). Bathroom is a little unusual as it has glass all around and a glass sliding door to enter. From the toilet there was a mirror in the hallway that looked on to the bed, so if I had to keep telling my partner to look away. Overall great location, room is super clean and tidy. Had no issues with wifi. Staff were friendly and helpful, including room service staff. There is a bar that is open on the weekends on the side of the hotel and a rooftop bar. We were staying on the 1st floor and had no issues with noise, even with Chur burger outside, this was no issue either. Room has sliding blinds which was perfect to block out the heat of Brissy and daylight.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455057246~“Cozy Room”~We stayed here last December to watch the Coldplay concert. Rooms were a bit small but we travel light so it was okay. We loved the bed, it was very comfortable! And the internet TV with the wireless keyboard was great!  Though a bit pricey for a room only rate and we had to pay for parking, the staff were helpful and accommodating to our inquiries.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_454824216~“Funky inner city hotel”~Charming and funky hotel rooms centrally located close to the city and close to China town! It's youthful, funky and the staff are upbeat and friendly! They give great local coffee and dining recommendations.  If possible ask for an outdoor spa room.  Fast internet, good mini bar and comfortable bed. There is access to a nearby pool and it's possible to have safe secured parking for $25 per day.  It's close to everything in Fortitude Valley so very conveniently located.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454147785~“cool but down to Earth”~This place is very arty, great location, and the rooms are very well designed for the hipster market. From the artwork on the façade to the graffiti laneway and pop art inspired rooms, their is an attention to detail that makes this a fun but sophisticated place to stay. On a Saturday night, it was party central, there is a night club on the room and the adjacent laneway was buzzing, however our spa suite on the first floor could barely hear the noise due to the double glazing. What impressed more than anything however was some of the best staff service we have encountered on our extensive travels. Despite (or because of) their youth, they smiling, attentive and proactive, I would go back for them alone.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_452855553~“Awesome”~Spent 2 nights here in FortValley. Very different. Very unusual. Very nice. This place is for couples only. Quaint rooms, smallish but all you need for sleep and shower. You'll like it here as we did. Lovely staff, very friendly. Awesome Cafè downstairs. Good prices. Good variety of food. Great coffee. Enjoy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451776753~“Best hotel stay ever!”~We checked in on Christmas Day. Even though the staff were working on the holiday, they were cheerful and pleasant and extremely helpful. They tried to find us places that were open for food on Christmas and even loaned us hotel umbrellas so we could venture out in the rainy weather. They printed things for us, came up to our room to help us if we needed, and were extremely helpful throughout our stay. The room itself was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. We stayed in the room with the outdoor spa overlooking the city view. It was an amazing experience, nice and private. It was very relaxing to drink a bottle of champagne outside in the spa and look at the night sky. The TV outside was awesome too so we could listen to music.  The curtains for the sliding door were great. Very easy to use and pretty cool! For a tech nerd, this hotel had all the things that made me smile. Near-field keys for doors and lifts. The automatic curtains. The blue ambiance lighting. FUN! The artwork around and as part of the room was great and made the stay more enjoyable and fun. I would absolutely stay at this hotel if ever in Brisbane again.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_451017642~“Loved it!”~I loved every second at the Tryp! From the minute we arrived and met the wonderful staff on reception we really felt like we were on holiday! The hotel is amazing inside. I just turned 50, so I'm no spring chicken but I could still appreciate the impressive array of street art thought the property. The huge mural on the wall outside the restaurant has to be seen! There are many quirky features, from the bare concrete stairs to the glass lift. From the hand made glass sinks to the great mood lighting. There was surprises round each corner. The room itself was adequately spacious. Not huge. I had a great room though with a huge balcony that contained a lovely Jacuzzi which was great for relaxing after a long days sightseeing. The only downside was the view! The hotel is situated in Fortitude Valley which is full of bars and restaurants but also office blocks and car dealerships, which is all we could really see from our balcony. The rooms were spotlessly clean. I loved the glass doors into the bathroom. The openness of it all didn't bother me or my wife. The toiletries were of a high standard. The bed was really comfy but oh! The pillows!! Where do you get them from Tryp? I want some!! There was an iPhone docking station / alarm / radio. A fantastic coffee machine. Iron, hair dryer, in fact all the gadgets you could need. Plus! A well stocked mini bar with reasonable prices! Downstairs is a great burger restaurant called Chur, that we used a few times too. All in all it was an amazing stay and if I ever get back to Brisbane, I wouldn't look for anywhere else!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449442541~“Just what the Dr ordered”~Had an amazing stay. Great price and the food at Chur was yummy. Have room service too which is great. The staff are lovely and bend backwards to help out. So glad we took time out to stay. Hooked on Fintan Magee art too now.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_448782160~“Funky hotel”~We stayed at this hotel in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. I was concerned about the funky decor thinking it was a young persons hotel. But I needn't have worried. The room was well equipped. Had a very tasty breakfast in their restaurant. The staff were very helpful and informative. On arrival we were escorted to our room, which doesn't happen very often in hotels. Nice touch.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_447622313~“Great Experience Again”~Stayed at the Tryp again for 3 nights. As always the staff were wonderful and all would acknowledge you when you met them anywhere. Love the quirky artwork and character of the building. Close to everything. Easy check in with Luke.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_446831084~“Great value for money”~We stayed here for a night on the way through to the Sunny Coast. It was great. Amazing value, a good location and very friendly staff. The rooms are on the small side, but for the price, you really can't complain.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_446107433~“Prettyyyyy, prettyyy, pretty good.”~The staff, location, restaurant, and the look of the hotel are all amazing - 10/10. The bathroom lacked privacy from the rest of the room which would be very awkward if you had any guests. I would also say it was slightly less than perfectly clean. All in all though, very impressed and definitely a hotel with plenty of personality and style. Would recommend it, and would stay here again as long as I wasn't having visitors.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444142760~“Take earplugs or avoid altogether if you prefer to sleep before midnight”~We had originally booked two rooms, including one for my 76 yo mobility impaired mother, who ended up having to cancel. Because my husband and I arrived early they allocated us to the room with the accessible bathroom for mobility impaired customers on the 4th floor, which was fine. The room was clean and comfortable.  However, when they say they have a bar on the rooftop – be aware it is not a lounge or cocktail bar, it seems to be a full on night club. So our Saturday night stay from the time we got back to the room at 8.30pm to 12.30am, all we heard was the doof doof doof thump thump thump of … I guess some would call it music. This was not just annoying background noise – as the night went on it was so loud my eardrums were vibrating (granted only on every other or third doof doof). We asked at reception if we could shift, but were told there were no rooms available and that the bar only had a licence to midnight. Needless to say we had an awful stay here. Our friends were on the 1st floor and they also had a rough night because the restaurant also plays loud music till about midnight. On check out at 7am we were told - it is clear we have a bar on the roof. I was flabbergasted, as this suggests that knowing there was a bar on the roof, I should have known and expected that the bar played incredibly loud music till the wee hours of the morning that would disturb any chance of sleep before 12.30am! It is unreasonable. I’ve stayed all over the world in hotels with roof top bars and never once had this be an issue and for many we have been on the top floors. It is incomprehensible to me how this establishment takes money from people who pay for accommodation expecting a decent and comfortable night’s sleep, knowing that on certain nights, that is just not going to happen! If we had known about this, we'd have popped out to Fortitude Valley to look around and caught a taxi back to the central Brisbane area. Furthermore, I was incredibly angry that they would have put my 76yo Mother in this room. She would have had a very poor night’s sleep and then been even more impaired when it came to moving around. To top that off, it is absurd they have this room as mobility accessible. Mobility impaired customers would have no choice but to stay in that room with that noise. I would also note that placing the ironing board under the bed for customers to pull out is fine, but for mobility impaired people, particularly those in wheelchairs it is unacceptable. Also people in wheelchairs still like to lay their toiletries out in the bathroom – those tiny little spaces aren’t suitable.  The staff were really nice, the hotel itself is in a good location for the train station and numerous bars and restaurants. I suspect that this hotel would be just fine for young folk who head out till the early hours and that's great, but if you need a good nights sleep - take earplugs or look elsewhere. Next time we’ll just stay in the Brisbane CBD as taxis are so cheap, you can get out and visit a few areas or get to the train station fairly easily.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_442961322~“Trendy, smick, Hotel”~This is a wonderful little Hotel in a great location close to all great things in Fortitude Valley. Staff are exceptional and very friendly. The décor is absolutely stunning, quirky designs, mood lighting. Rooms appear to be soundproof as during the night there was a very loud storm (apparently), we slept like babies and didn't hear a thing. The blockout blinds are a great idea. The bed is very comfortable.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_442755534~“Trendy, funky, cool hotel to stay.”~The front office given us a warm welcome. Front Office chris very nice guy, checked us in, show us to our room. He was patient to explain the amenities and facilities in our room. We felt like VIP at that moment, very good practice to show the guest of their rooms. The rm size was good for 2 person. The only part we surprise was no toothbrush in the toilet and the bed too soft. Maybe they should practice to put in instead for all rooms.  We are here for the ColdPlay concert and Chris assisted us on which the best way to go to the stadium. We really enjoy the stay in TRYP. The rest of the front office was also nice. Thumb up for this hotel. I definitely spread good words for TRYP. Best recommended. Funky, trendy and cool...~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_441837839~“Funky with great service”~I stay at The Tryp regularly for business.  The rooms are funky, well presented, and comfortable. The service is friendly and super helpful, it's always lovely arriving to a smiling welcoming face. During my most recent trip I was upgraded to a spa room. Relaxing in the spa after a long day at work was a special treat!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441301562~“Funky little hotel”~The front desk staff (Kim?) were amazingly welcoming and informative.  The whole architectural design of the hotel is edgy and interesting. Back in the 1980's I was involved in a range of social justice programs trying to change attitudes to 'street art' (graffiti). This hotel renovated in 2015(?) actually celebrates street art by having a different artist decorate each floor. The photos on line are pretty accurate - if you like them, you wont be disappointed with the real thing. Another personal connection, my children's mother's family were devout Freemasons - and the building that now houses this hotel was a former Freemason's building. But I digress... You'll love this hotel - but one drawback. The bathrooms have a clear glass sliding door - meaning that whomever you are traveling with will get to see, hear and smell your more intimate bodily functions! If you are traveling alone, then you'll have no problem!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_440975006~“Street Art Theme Hotel for Millennials”~This hotel made me feel really old. And I’m in my early forties.  Choosing a hotel comes down to what kind of place makes you feel comfortable and what you value. Tryp is a good hotel- it just wasn’t for me.  Tryp's street art theme is like “the art series hotels” for millennials. But unlike the art series hotels, this one might not age so well.  There were small quirks and inconveniences that annoyed me:  -air con crackled like old school radio static,  -a very narrow, small space to place bags, which meant I put mine on the floor, -getting on wifi meant turning on the tv to get a unique login & pw for your room- great for security, but the PW didn’t change daily, so they could have just written it on the room card,  -the window didn’t open and the blackout shade on the window couldn’t be raised,  -because of the cool sink design you have to push in the sink plug in a sink filled with water to drain it.  Rather than enhancing the aesthetics or experience, the mainstream music videos on constant loop were just loud. What would have been more authentic was offering a photocopied local street art map highlighting areas to explore, or providing curated signage about the street art in and around the Tryp property. Tryp is a decent hotel, with competent, engaging staff. It was clean and in a terrific location-- about 15 minutes’ walk to downtown, 5 minutes’ walk to public transport and cool places on James St and Brunswick.  From a value perspective, I got a much bigger room, with breakfast, right off Queen St Mall, in hotel that also uses bright colors and “style” to attract guests for a good $50 less. My comments really come down to personal preference.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_440282433~“Great citivacation”~My husband & I were gifted 2 nights at Tryp. We had not even heard of this hotel, but we were amazed and surprised. The location of the hotel is great, whilst we live in Brisbane and often pass through "the valley" we have never stayed here. The hotel is in a central location not far from the train station and the city bus is at the end of the street. The hotel is really cool with street art featured throughout. A really hip and happening area, growing fast with apartments being made from the old buildings. James St and its shopping and eating area is just 1 block away. We arrived late and the staff were very helpful,my husband had his push bike and the staff were very helpful in storing the bike so he could do an early morning ride. Our room was on the 3rd floor and we were pleasantly surprised by our room. The decor fits the street art theme. Loved the coffee machine/pod and the mood lighting. I have to get some of those bedside lights - they are great. The bathroom was great, modern, arty and very up to date with fittings. The linen was lovely and crisp and plush towels. The room size is adequate for city travelers hotels and are comparable with European hotels of the same standard- we spent 6 weeks in Europe last year. We really enjoyed our stay here. We ate our evening meal at Chur - attached to Tryp, but ate all other meals at some of the many eateries near by. We would happily recommend staying here, the service, atmosphere and location were great~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_439196755~“Great Stay”~The hotel is conveniently located near Fortitude Valley train station and it's easy to reach should you choose to travel out of Brisbane for the day. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the city centre. The room was very clean and quiet it was the perfect size with me been a single traveller. The restaurant on site had good food at a reasonable prices though there's plenty of options nearby. The staff were really helpful and advised where to visit in the city. I would definitely stay there again should I visit Brisbane.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_438867048~“Perfect Stay”~The coolest hotel I have ever stayed in. I had told friends I was going to Brisbane for the first time and they gifted me a room for the night and it was one of the best gifts I had ever received. The infrastructure was super rustic and the interior design artistic. My room was super cozy, comfortable, and came with generous essentials. Most notably would have to be the staff. Mark was an absolute legend. Helped me find places to go, where to eat, and a bit of history on the hotel building itself. He even gave me a charger for my phone when I found that I lost mine. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437937810~“Not bad for a short stay”~Hip space with lots of paintwork around the place - the one in the lift shaft is interesting. Got to be the narrowest corridor I've seen - it's a conversion so you get quirky features like that. Price is very good for what you get and it's certainly convenient with a Chur downstairs and bars nearby. Bathroom small but funky. No cups/mugs for coffee/tea but the glasses are thermal ones...threw me initially.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437913448~“A Stay in the Valley”~A funky hotel in the heart of Fortitude Valley, close to train station, restaurant on premises and others close by. Excellent staff. Not too keen on the glass bathroom doors but had all facilities we needed. Rooms and corridors very bright and cheery, room on small side but OK for short stay. Restaurant bit noisy for my tastes but good food and well priced. I would stay again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437683032~“1st tryp to Brisbane”~Very pleasant hotel close to restaurants, transport and the city and river. The staff Re the difference in this hotel. We were always greeted with a broad smile, and a 'welcome back' each time we walked in. Always asked how our day was, and the staff expected an answer, it wasn't just a polite query. All staff we encountered, from reception to cleaning staff could not do enough to ensure your stay was enjoyable.. The rooms are small, but adequate. I guess most people don't need to spend 24 hours a day in the room, which in this case is just as well. Unusual décor, from a baby boomer perspective, but it was tasteful and interesting. I really liked some of the paintings. A good base from which to start your exploration of what Brisbane has to offer. WiFi speed and access is the best I have experienced in my travels.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_437351019~“Lovely snug hotel in the centre of Fortitude Valley”~Tryp Hotel in Fortitude Valley offers great value for money, the rooms are fantastically appointed with modern facilities in a luxurious manner. The rooms are very small, we upgraded to a King Room and were in a tiny area with very little space so I'd imagine the basic rooms were little more than small box rooms. The rooms are decorated with artworks from local street artists, so fascinating and interesting to see.  The website states there is no onsite parking, but we walked past what seems to be a carpark, so it might be worth contacting the hotel for more information. We parked at the Valley metro carpark which offers a $10 hotel rate.  The rooms have nice extra touches like iPhone compatible stereo alarm clocks, electric window blinds and coffee maker (free to use). The staff were really friendly and helpful, we were shown to our room on arrival.  The only negative is the restaurant, due to an intense lightning & hail storm on our arrival, we chose to order food from the downstairs restaurant and it was pretty awful. The vegetarian options are very limited. We then had breakfast there the following morning, and again it was pretty awful. They didn't have 2 items on one of the breakfast options, and were out of a side option (we were there very early so were surprised they were out of brunch options on a sunday). The breakfast we ended up ordering was pretty average. The restaurant also was playing very loud music before 9am on a Sunday morning which felt a bit out of place as most people were just out for a lazy Sunday brunch.  Tryp hotel is excellent value for money, in a great location, with great staff and great facilities. Just make sure you eat elsewhere.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_434461492~“A quick TRYP to Fortitude Valley”~We took advantage of a three night promotion at Tryp - Brisbane people all our lives but we  only ever travel through The Valley. My first swimming lesson was at The Valley Pool many years ago, and my husband worked in Dogget Street in his early days. The Valley has changed. There are beautiful buildings being renovated, new buildings are being built, and the area is surprisingly very clean.   Our room was ready when we arrived a little early and a lovely staff member took us up. We loved the art work. The room was very dark with the great block-out blind - those Melbourne people who are surprised that the sun rises so early in Queensland should be very happy. The blinds worked very well, and we had a bright sunny room whenever we wanted.   The room is not large - but there was plenty of room for the two of us. We didn't want to stay "home" all the time. Transport to Brisbane by train and bus is so convenient.   Overall, we could not fault this hotel - the staff; proximity to transport; free wi-fi; and especially access to The Valley swimming pool.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434167874~“Not my choice!”~This was my first experience of a Wyndham Group hotel and because my partner is a Timeshare member , agreed to our stay. Unfortunately , I was not happy with the room size , being too small and felt claustrophobic. The bathroom was adequate but needed more noise suppression! Bed was comfortable and the facilities offered within the room were good , particularly the free WiFi. On arrival ,we were warmly greeted and taken to our room by an attentive staff member. At the front desk we inquired about parking, seeing we were returning from the Gold Coast late the next day. We were assured there would be parking on our return so didn't think any more about . On our return,quite late , there was no one in attendance at the desk to ask about parking so we left the car in the street , signs appeared ok, and went to bed , extremely tired after a long day! Imagine our surprise the next morning to find our car on a tow truck!! Yes , we didn't read the hotel details prior to arriving and paid the ultimate price!  All in all, it was in a good location , but sadly we won't be returning to this "Art" hotel. Street art has no appeal for me I'm afraid. Too conservative I guess!~3~nan~4~nan~2~nan~3~nan
review_433098493~“Awesome Stay”~Great place to stay, staff very attentive, helpful and kind. The personal touch of them coming up and showing us the room and how it all works was great. The graffiti was a big hit with the kids my daughter now wants a mural in here room. Thank you TRYP for making our sons birthday a memorable one.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_431657545~“Overnight stay”~Comftable cosy room. Colourful but classy room and bathroom. Great graffiti on all floor levels. Top floor has a lovely seating outdoor area. Colourful and inviting library. Complementary bottle of wine was great. Very friendly and informative staff.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429859620~“Not the best of times”~While this establishment definitely has it perks, we unfortunately had a pretty bad time here.  We were placed into a handicapped friendly room, which meant that the bathroom amenities were down a lot lower, and very basic, instead of quite fancy as per any photos of this place we saw online. The floor creaked everywhere, as though we were hanging on some loose metal scaffolding, definitely an uncomfortable situation.  We decided to grab a beer from the mini bar, reasonably priced.. but that's when things really went south. A few hours later my partner woke up, having to run to the bath room to throw up. We discovered the next morning that the beer he had was 4 months passed it's use by date, with the other one in in the fridge 8 months passed it's use by date. That would mean that the beverages in the fridge hadn't even been looked at in 8 months! Shocking really!  We were offered a replacement, which we didn't have to pay for. But that was it really.  The best part of this hotel would be the location, and the restaurant joining it. Other than that, I wouldn't go back.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429503906~“convenient, trendy, helpful staffr”~We really enjoyed our stay here - the staff were super friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to help with any question. Housekeeping staff the same. The room was very trendy and modern, with a comfortable bed, and great shower. Located close to buses and trains, and with some excellent restaurants, clubs and cafes within walking distance, this is a great place to stay.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_429006591~“Funky”~Great Customer service. Very funky with quality.close to everything in Fortitude Valley. Room Service is good. Went there several times for business and staff remembers me with a small welcome card and lollies.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428605970~“Super funky vibe”~Stayed only one Saturday night, if we had time would have stayed another. The hotel is extremely hip with murals painted all over the place. The queen rooms are very small but that didn't bother us as they were well set out and crazy cool. Flat black tapwear, huge shower, awesome sinks, sexy-as-hell blue LED mood lighting making everything in the room glow. Actually had decent free Wifi, almost non-existant in Australia as every other hotel is stuck in a dark-age where they charge ridiculous money for tiny amounts of crappy internet after giving u 5mb or one hour only for free - Not Tryp :) Stayed on a We were on the 5th floor and unfortunately the arvo sun baked the big black window blind so much that the aircon couldn't keep the room cool, however we went out and came back after sundown and everything was solved :) To be fair, if you trade the view of Brisbane for a view of a wall covered in ultra cool murals on a lower floor, the son wouldn't cook your room so it might be better? Overall we'd highly recommend the hotel regardless! The entire area is very very hipster, with crazy venues like the one right next door that was an old warehouse full of crappy lounges and furniture from your grandmas house (looks like a Vinnies!) - packed with hipsters till the early hours and like nothing you have ever seen before. Of course the location is PURE GOLD. Right in the heart of Fortitude Valley - just a few blocks walk to Brunswick St & the coolest night-life in Brisvegas - Bars, pubs, dance clubs, restaurants, strip clubs, pretty much all open and serving till 5am, and at that time there is still thousands of punters around! Stayed on a Scoopon that include parking/movies etc. was really great value!~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_428124864~“Great service and terrible sleep”~This hotel provides a great first impression. The staff are friendly and welcoming even taking you to your room which is a nice touch. The room is small and the balconys are so close with only a aluminum screen which blocks out no sound. Between noisy neighbours which sounds like they are on your balcony and noise from the bar next door it was a terrible nights sleep. Until this lack of sleep i would have recommended this place purely for the staff and location. If u dont want sleep....come and stay....if you do want sleep....go somewhere else!!~3~3~nan~1~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428082773~“Convenient”~Good hotel, convenient location. Rooms are small and pretty basic. Many rooms are also quite dark due to lack of natural light. Ask for one on the top floor if you like natural light. Bed was very good. Friendly, motivated staff. Not sure if I would stay again as there are quite a few hotel nearby that have similar rates but a much higher standard. Overall I had a pleasant stay.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_426792224~“Hip, Modern, Cool”~I really enjoyed my stay at TRYP. The location can't be beat w/ the throngs of bars and restos in the Valley. James St, full of boutiques and eclectic restaurants, is only a five minute walk from the hotel. CBD is a solid 20-30 minute walk, but so easy to get to. New Farm is about the distance and worth strolling to.  If you're coming from BNE Airport, take the train and exit the FV Station. The hotel is only 7 minute walk from the station.  The staff are all pleasant and special thank you to Nina for allowing me to get an early check-in (after traveling nearly 16 hours from Los Angeles, it was a welcome treat). The rooms are definitely on the smaller side, but I there is room to wiggle around. I love the funky decor of each floor...my room had these zig-zag patterns in multiple colors...I also loved the blue mood lighting. Amenities include a minibar, espresso machine, cable TV, free Wi-fi, iron and board. There's also a gym on the 5th floor which contains free weights and a few cardio machines.  There is a rooftop bar open in the afternoon, but I didn't have the chance to check it out. Though, from what I saw, it looked interesting with open spaces allowing great views of the Valley. Chur Restaurant is open for paid breakfast. Otherwise, many restaurant options within a 10-minute walk of the hotel. I did have concern the guests would be rowdy (as it's a hip hotel), but never had any issue. Plus, it's not a place backpackers stay...it's adults and it's a grown up place. I highly recommend if it's yr first time or returning to BNE. Really great place.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_426517734~“Great location”~We recently stayed mid week at Tryp. Staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are funky with great artwork and were very clean. The only downfall was the coffee served in the cafe on ground floor. It was horrid.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_425694887~“Great stay, such friendly staff!”~The staff at the hotel are some of the most helpful and most friendly Iv ever come across. The rooms are funky and the beds are very comfy. Perfect location for restaurants, bars and easily getting into the city.

review_418282209~“A lot going on here, but overall nice.”~Very kind and helpful front desk, though realized later that I was asked to present my card and pay upfront for parking, and then upon checking out was asked to present my card a second time to pay for the same night of parking. In my jet-lagged haze it didn't occur to me til after I left that I'd been charged twice. And this is all after being misinformed online that the hotel offered free garage parking to guests - which is the whole reason why I booked the stay. Aside from all that, I still found the staff to be very nice, if well intentioned. The property itself is very bright and splashy. Not so wild about the glass door on the bathroom, and not sure why hotels go for that these days. "Look at me, look at me, I'm wiping!" Fine if you're staying alone I guess. Or an exhibitionist.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_418255268~“Awesome hotel in good location”~Sadly I was only at the TRYP Hotel for one night, but I wish I had more time to enjoy this gem of a hotel in the Fortitude Valley area. The location is good... it's not too far from the CBD and it's very close to a cute shopping and restaurant area in Fortitude Valley.  The hotel is modern and cool, and the rooms are really edgy and well done. The bed was super comfortable and the room and bathroom were spacious and clean. I really liked the blue mood lighting, though I wasn't sure at first if it would keep me up all night (it didn't). The shower is visible from the sleeping area, though frosted glass is strategically placed to block your private bits. Still, if you're traveling with friends and aren't yet at that comfortable place, this room is probably not going to give you the privacy you want.  The staff was so friendly and helpful! I didn't arrive until 11 pm, so I missed room service and I didn't feel safe walking around by myself to find food. The guy working the front desk suggested ordering Dominos for delivery and helped me to do so when my attempts to call Dominos failed. He even brought the food to my room, which was so nice and went above and beyond what I would expect someone at reception to do for a guest. Thank you for curing my hunger pangs!  The next time I visit Brisbane I'll be back at this awesome hotel for a longer stay. It was a good value, excellent room, and stellar service.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

The staff in the hotel all young but enthusiastic and very helpful and very informative and all went out of their way to help and assist any need and question very impressive, My wife and I had a very relaxing time and are making plans to go back to stay very soon a most enjoyable place.

review_398141027~“Funky hotel with attention to detail”~Stayed here for two nights and what a great find! Probably one of the funkiest hotel I've stayed in with bright colours and a cool vibe running through it. Surprisingly for Australia the wifi was brilliant and quick and we connected a few devices upto it. The coffee machine in the room was a nice touch. Everything we used in the room, even if we hadn't finished it was replaced or something else left. The staff on reception were wonderful. We wish we could remember names. We needed to print some documents off which the hotel kindly did free of charge (20 pages worth!!). They always asked how our day was and showed real interest in what we had done. The car parking is close by and $25 AUD per night which we thought was reasonable compared to other city hotels. It was a short walk to everything down at the Emporium. A beer from the minibar was $8 which we thought was reasonable. We tried the nachos and a burger at Chur Burger too which is attached to the hotel and that is definitely worth a visit too! We will definitely return here should we need a hotel in Brisbane again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397155722~“Funky hotel with city vibe”~Stayed here with my husband for a night for a wedding. Right in the centre of the Valley - perfect if you want to go out partying!

Nice, new, and close to both train and the lovely James St. And has free wifi and seemingly good rooftop bar and restaurant (did not have time to try them).  Only complaint is that the bathroom door is clear glass and doesn't provide privacy.  Would stay here again, next time will know to bring the kool aid!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395997020~“Great decor and friendly staff”~We stayed in a queen room last night using our Wyndham timeshare. The room (and hotel) was beautifully decorated and, whilst on the smaller size, it was perfect for a night or two. Our bathroom was quite private and everything was clean and in good working condition. Not much place to put clothes but, as we were only staying for one night, it was not a problem for us.  We wanted to go to Chur for breakfast but they only open at 8.30am on weekends so went to one of the other many cafés in the area. We will definitely return to Tryp hotel, it exceeded our expectations.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_394617605~“Funky rooms”~Stayed here for one night only on a weeknight for business. The staff were very friendly, with the person at the front desk walking me all the way to my room and showing me how the tv and the lights worked.  The room was a normal size - just basic studio suite. There was a vittorio pod machine which came in quite handy. The room was decorated similar to the halls and the reception of the hotel - bright and funky. What I liked was the fact that you could completely shut the window to block out all the light, which would have been great for a sleep in.  Shower head was powerful and the room came with its own basic bathroom amenities.  The hotel had its own restaurant, Chur(?) and I ordered two of their entrees - the macaroni and cheese croquettes and the buffalo wings. I had originally hoped for something healthier without having to resort to salads but there wasn't much on the menu- mostly burgers, but prices were reasonable. The servings were massive and unfortunately I only ended up eating half. I also tried their ala carte breakfast with poached eggs. I love that I could get room service for this. Coffee at the cafe was great.  All in all, it was a good stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476647479~“Enjoyed our Stay”~We stayed at this property for two night over Easter in April 2017 as we were attending a show at the Tivoli Theatre. The art and urban funky design very different and appealing.  We had a king size with courtyard room which was lovely, clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a little small as was the living area but not too bad. The carpark is next door and each time you want your car you need to go to reception where a staff member will come and open the carpark open for you. The staff were very obliging in this regard. The car was very secure at least but found it frustrating at check in on where to park the car before being given access prior to check in. The rooftop bar is lovely, thoroughly recommend it. Would give the burger bar "Churo" a miss, very ordinary and expensive for the rubbish it was. There are other more appealing choices further up Constance Street. We went to Churo for lunch, yuk! Gave it another for Breakfast and again yuk! Bacon cooked on hotplate where burgers are made, foul taste.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_476315351~“Great place but choose a quiet room”~I really loved my stay at Tryp. It has a great vibe, excellent security, modern original decor, and is well located. The staff were fantastic and cheerfully went out of their way to ensure I had a great stay. Thanks Stuart and Chris!! I wish I could give it five stars but I had a room on the noisy side of the hotel, above the cafe and next to a bar. Despite being on the third floor, I could hear the pumping noise from down below when I was trying to sleep and even from the shower with the bathroom door closed. This was a Sunday night. Well worth staying here, but be sure to specify a quiet room.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475116549~“The best hotel”~Tryp Fortitude Valley, is one of the best hotels in Brisbane! The rooms are beautiful, the beds incredibly comfortable and the staff are exceptional! It is modern, with the beautiful artwork throughout, and the level of service from the front desk through to the staff servicing the rooms, is second to none! The Churr restaurant on the bottom level is an added bonus.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

While the room was a touch small, that didn't matter as we were out most of the time. The room had all the amenities, plus some luxuries. The gym was great. Again, a bit small but contained all we needed and more. The hotel was situated close to the train station so getting anywhere was easy and there were some nice restaurants and cafes nearby.

review_472237282~“Great Hotel! Amazing Service! Awesome Location!”~Hi, I recently stayed at the Tryp hotel by Wyndham in Brisbane. Luke at the front desk checked me in, and was very friendly through the process! Once I had completed check-in, I asked about things to do in the area as it was my first time staying at the hotel; Luke asked me if there was anything in particular that I was looking to do, and then recommended a number of different restaurants, and pubs that I might enjoy. I did follow some of his recommendations and really enjoyed my dinner.  The hotel itself was very unique. My room was spacious, and had great lighting! There were blue lights behind the normal lights, and you could leave those on in the evening and it looked very nice. I thought window was pretty cool! There were automatic blinds, so when I wanted to get some sleep, I could just click the button on a remote, and the shades came down.  My bed was incredibly comfortable! Maybe a little bit too comfortable, as I did not want to get out of it in the morning! haha  I was traveling for work, and had some work to get done, and the wifi was very easy to connect to, and it had a strong connection. That was a major plus for me.  The bathroom / shower was very nice, and I really liked the amenities. Aside from matching the look of the room, being trendy, they were good quality. The towels were nice, heavy, and there were plenty on the rack.  The room also had a nice closet area, with the mini bar, and coffee set up on top of the shelf. It had a really nice Vittoria Espresso pod machine, and the cool double walled glasses. I was able to enjoy a great coffee and be ready for the day!  I had breakfast downstairs at the restaurant, and it was fantastic.  I can't say enough, it was a great stay, and I am looking forward to my next visit!  I travel frequently, so when you get such friendly service from everyone, and the comfort of the room being as great as it was, it really makes a big difference.  I would strongly recommend staying at the Tryp by Wyndham Brisbane!  Thank you Luke, and to everyone at the hotel for a fantastic stay!  Best,  Andrew~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468709627~“Groovy hip hotel”~Stayed overnight & was impressed by everything. The hotel is unique & artsy. Staff are very friendly & helpful. Very new & immaculately clean. Rooftop bar & central to Valley restaurants & bars. Parking station next door. Would highly recommend.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468468245~“Everything here is amazing: clean and neat rooms, AMAZING staff and fantastic facilities.”~I stayed here for 4 nights with my girlfriend and we had the opportunity to try a couple rooms. The staff are freaking amazing. Everyone we met there was ultra friendly and they really went out of their way to make sure that we had a really good stay there. You can ask the reception staff anything like "Where's a good place to go for breakfast?" and they will give you plenty of different options based on what you like.  All the housekeeping staff were wearing Black Milk clothing (awesome uniform) and were really happy to say hi as you walk past them in the hallway. We put out the "do not disturb" sign for one day and were not bothered at all. The rooms are pristine, the attention to detail in both the setup of the rooms and the cleanliness is perfect. They all have an interesting graffiti/street art style, with nice artwork hanging in each room. They also all have blackout blinds (literally making it night time at any time of day) and two sets of lighting (dark blue mood lighting and normal lighting).  All the rooms have free wifi and a Smart TV (with movies on demand you can watch). The internet speed was alright, I was getting about 3-5mbit (fast enough for browsing and watching youtube with no buffering). I don't know what it was about the beds, but they are truely super comfortable. I had an awesome night sleep every night. I wish I could steal one of the pillows! The location of the hotel is really great, you're half way between China Town/Brunswick St Mall/Train station and James Street. There's a LOT of restaurants and clubs to choose from, no matter which direction you choose to walk in. Also, being in the middle of Fortitude Valley, you can get an Uber within 3 minutes at any time of day. The first room we were in had an internal spa (they call this the King with Internal Spa) and we spent 2 nights in this room. It was really spacious and very quiet. I spent a day in the room with a serious hangover, so the mood lighting really helped me recover (also, the room service from the Chur restaurant downstairs meant I didn't have to leave the room at all). The second room we had was the King with Outdoor Spa. This room is the bees knees. The outdoor spa is really clean and will comfortably fit 2 people (up to 4 if you squish in a bit) and had a TV you can watch from the spa as well as the TV in the room you can watch from the bed. The room was a bit smaller than the first room, but it was fine for two people. The door to the balcony was double glazed glass so with the doors closed you couldn't hear any noise from outside. The third room we had was the King with Courtyard. It was the perfect size room. Our only issue with this room was that while the sound proofing between the rooms is really good, the private courtyards don't have soundproofing between them. We had some very noisy neighbours staying up at about midnight talking and playing music outside. Thankfully, the reception staff are glorious. I called reception and they came up and talked to the people next to us and suggested they move to the shared library at the end of the hallway (a win for them as they had more space + couches there and a win for us as we could get some sleep!)  In short: Everything here is amazing: clean and neat rooms, AMAZING staff and fantastic facilities. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_468192561~“Small but delightful”~While the room was small it was very funky. Great bathroom - loved the piece of glass artwork masquerading as a hand basin. And even though my view out the window was a wall, it featured some striking street art. The giant female eye staring at me was a little disconcerting though.  The staff were great and I slept like a baby. Would definitely stay there again!~4~3~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467159701~“Quirky, cool and comfortable”~Well..everyone said to us that we were mad going to Brisbane in January. It is so hot there they said. Well yes it was but the welcome was warm at the Tryp. Very helpful and a really cool room and I don't just mean the air conditioning.  The location was a little disappointing on the ascetic scale but for convenience to the train station it was worth it. Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_465910072~“Fun and edgy but still refined-great stay ”~Great hotel if you want something a little interesting and hip but still fancy and refined. I loved it and would highly recommend as it's great value and cool.  Pros:  -Absolutely wonderful staff - Chris at check in (I think it was) was a delight. - super clean and new. Nice decor and comfy bed, good toiletries and coffee and tea -you can order breakfast up from the restaurant at normal prices with only a $5 delivery fee -such a nice change from the usual insane room service prices. And breakfast was great. Cons: -the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is it is a tiny bit lacking in natural light if you're in a standard room. You can pay extra for a courtyard room if you're bothered by that. I would give it a 4.5 if I could as I think it's a minor thing but for me 5=perfection.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465691506~“Weekday Stay”~Funky interiors, trendy bathroom design with long white tiles, black grout, black matte finishing and bright, colourful graffiti basin. Our room was spacious. Great location in the Valley. Easy and quick check in and check out process. Wonderful artwork in room, common areas and surrounding hotel. Parking on and off site.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_465447381~“Funky and modern”~if modern and funky aren't your thing then you may be best avoiding this place. I loved everything about it from the paintings, to the blue backlights, the gorgeous sink and choice of shower heads. Walking us to our room was an unnecessary addition by reception but nice all the same. We tried the burger place for breakfast and they even cooked my eggs perfectly, I'm incredibly fussy about eggs so this is a big thing for me and we went up to the rooftop bar at night for a cocktail too. Try the English Country Garden it's delicious. Free wifi - internet tv, with foxtel, air conditioning and our own courtyard. Love it!~5~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464642186~“Great location”~Very nice modern style hotel in a perfect central location. The rooftop bar was nice for a drink before heading out for a night .

It's well located in the Valley with lots of great restaurants in walking distance.Short walk or quick taxi to the city center.

review_458592935~“Great stay”~Great stylish hotel, with modern comfortable rooms. Staff are very kind and helpful. Parking is down the road in a public multi story parking area.

review_456278104~“Stylish, friendly, great place”~Recommended by a friend, the Tryp lived up to the recommendation: well located, well priced, very stylish and staffed by very friendly people. I loved the art and decor in particular! And Chur Burger cafe on the ground floor is well worth a visit too.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455791204~“Fantastic overnighter in the Valley”~Funky hotel, excellent and very helpful staff. Small room, great bed, very well stocked mini bar with a Nespresso machine.

Short walk to the station, Wickham hotel and restaurants.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455264831~“Unrivaled Urban Cool”~We have stayed here twice with my son who is in a wheelchair and access is great, although navigating through the doors can be a bit tricky with bags etc. The accessible room is large with a double bed, great coffee and good wifi. The bathroom is large, spacious and well appointed. There is a large shower bench and grab rails. We love the blue LED mood lighting and is handy at night time! Staff are very friendly and helpful and will help with bags etc if needed. We love the industrial urban feel of the hotel and its at the quieter end of Fortitude Valley.  I also had a standard room with a double bed. They are not huge rooms but comfortable, well appointed and cosy. Close to lots of great spots in the Valley, nightclubs, chinatown, markets eateries etc. Everything you need for a short stay is there with great customer service!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455088852~“Awesome hotel”~Artsy hotel located in great location, would recommend to friend. We took the train from the airport and the walk from Fortitude Valley Station was 5mins. 25min walk to the city (if you're fit to walk), 10min cab ride to cbd or south bank. Close to restaurants, cafes and Chinatown. We stayed in a King Room which was spacious and funky (no balcony). Bathroom is a little unusual as it has glass all around and a glass sliding door to enter. From the toilet there was a mirror in the hallway that looked on to the bed, so if I had to keep telling my partner to look away. Overall great location, room is super clean and tidy. Had no issues with wifi. Staff were friendly and helpful, including room service staff. There is a bar that is open on the weekends on the side of the hotel and a rooftop bar. We were staying on the 1st floor and had no issues with noise, even with Chur burger outside, this was no issue either. Room has sliding blinds which was perfect to block out the heat of Brissy and daylight.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455057246~“Cozy Room”~We stayed here last December to watch the Coldplay concert. Rooms were a bit small but we travel light so it was okay. We loved the bed, it was very comfortable! And the internet TV with the wireless keyboard was great!  Though a bit pricey for a room only rate and we had to pay for parking, the staff were helpful and accommodating to our inquiries.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_454824216~“Funky inner city hotel”~Charming and funky hotel rooms centrally located close to the city and close to China town! It's youthful, funky and the staff are upbeat and friendly! They give great local coffee and dining recommendations.  If possible ask for an outdoor spa room.  Fast internet, good mini bar and comfortable bed. There is access to a nearby pool and it's possible to have safe secured parking for $25 per day.  It's close to everything in Fortitude Valley so very conveniently located.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454147785~“cool but down to Earth”~This place is very arty, great location, and the rooms are very well designed for the hipster market. From the artwork on the façade to the graffiti laneway and pop art inspired rooms, their is an attention to detail that makes this a fun but sophisticated place to stay. On a Saturday night, it was party central, there is a night club on the room and the adjacent laneway was buzzing, however our spa suite on the first floor could barely hear the noise due to the double glazing. What impressed more than anything however was some of the best staff service we have encountered on our extensive travels. Despite (or because of) their youth, they smiling, attentive and proactive, I would go back for them alone.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_452855553~“Awesome”~Spent 2 nights here in FortValley. Very different. Very unusual. Very nice. This place is for couples only. Quaint rooms, smallish but all you need for sleep and shower. You'll like it here as we did. Lovely staff, very friendly. Awesome Cafè downstairs. Good prices. Good variety of food. Great coffee. Enjoy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451776753~“Best hotel stay ever!”~We checked in on Christmas Day. Even though the staff were working on the holiday, they were cheerful and pleasant and extremely helpful. They tried to find us places that were open for food on Christmas and even loaned us hotel umbrellas so we could venture out in the rainy weather. They printed things for us, came up to our room to help us if we needed, and were extremely helpful throughout our stay. The room itself was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. We stayed in the room with the outdoor spa overlooking the city view. It was an amazing experience, nice and private. It was very relaxing to drink a bottle of champagne outside in the spa and look at the night sky. The TV outside was awesome too so we could listen to music.  The curtains for the sliding door were great. Very easy to use and pretty cool! For a tech nerd, this hotel had all the things that made me smile. Near-field keys for doors and lifts. The automatic curtains. The blue ambiance lighting. FUN! The artwork around and as part of the room was great and made the stay more enjoyable and fun. I would absolutely stay at this hotel if ever in Brisbane again.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_451017642~“Loved it!”~I loved every second at the Tryp! From the minute we arrived and met the wonderful staff on reception we really felt like we were on holiday! The hotel is amazing inside. I just turned 50, so I'm no spring chicken but I could still appreciate the impressive array of street art thought the property. The huge mural on the wall outside the restaurant has to be seen! There are many quirky features, from the bare concrete stairs to the glass lift. From the hand made glass sinks to the great mood lighting. There was surprises round each corner. The room itself was adequately spacious. Not huge. I had a great room though with a huge balcony that contained a lovely Jacuzzi which was great for relaxing after a long days sightseeing. The only downside was the view! The hotel is situated in Fortitude Valley which is full of bars and restaurants but also office blocks and car dealerships, which is all we could really see from our balcony. The rooms were spotlessly clean. I loved the glass doors into the bathroom. The openness of it all didn't bother me or my wife. The toiletries were of a high standard. The bed was really comfy but oh! The pillows!! Where do you get them from Tryp? I want some!! There was an iPhone docking station / alarm / radio. A fantastic coffee machine. Iron, hair dryer, in fact all the gadgets you could need. Plus! A well stocked mini bar with reasonable prices! Downstairs is a great burger restaurant called Chur, that we used a few times too. All in all it was an amazing stay and if I ever get back to Brisbane, I wouldn't look for anywhere else!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449442541~“Just what the Dr ordered”~Had an amazing stay. Great price and the food at Chur was yummy. Have room service too which is great. The staff are lovely and bend backwards to help out. So glad we took time out to stay. Hooked on Fintan Magee art too now.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_448782160~“Funky hotel”~We stayed at this hotel in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. I was concerned about the funky decor thinking it was a young persons hotel. But I needn't have worried. The room was well equipped. Had a very tasty breakfast in their restaurant. The staff were very helpful and informative. On arrival we were escorted to our room, which doesn't happen very often in hotels. Nice touch.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_447622313~“Great Experience Again”~Stayed at the Tryp again for 3 nights. As always the staff were wonderful and all would acknowledge you when you met them anywhere. Love the quirky artwork and character of the building. Close to everything. Easy check in with Luke.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_446831084~“Great value for money”~We stayed here for a night on the way through to the Sunny Coast. It was great. Amazing value, a good location and very friendly staff. The rooms are on the small side, but for the price, you really can't complain.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_446107433~“Prettyyyyy, prettyyy, pretty good.”~The staff, location, restaurant, and the look of the hotel are all amazing - 10/10. The bathroom lacked privacy from the rest of the room which would be very awkward if you had any guests. I would also say it was slightly less than perfectly clean. All in all though, very impressed and definitely a hotel with plenty of personality and style. Would recommend it, and would stay here again as long as I wasn't having visitors.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444142760~“Take earplugs or avoid altogether if you prefer to sleep before midnight”~We had originally booked two rooms, including one for my 76 yo mobility impaired mother, who ended up having to cancel. Because my husband and I arrived early they allocated us to the room with the accessible bathroom for mobility impaired customers on the 4th floor, which was fine. The room was clean and comfortable.  However, when they say they have a bar on the rooftop – be aware it is not a lounge or cocktail bar, it seems to be a full on night club. So our Saturday night stay from the time we got back to the room at 8.30pm to 12.30am, all we heard was the doof doof doof thump thump thump of … I guess some would call it music. This was not just annoying background noise – as the night went on it was so loud my eardrums were vibrating (granted only on every other or third doof doof). We asked at reception if we could shift, but were told there were no rooms available and that the bar only had a licence to midnight. Needless to say we had an awful stay here. Our friends were on the 1st floor and they also had a rough night because the restaurant also plays loud music till about midnight. On check out at 7am we were told - it is clear we have a bar on the roof. I was flabbergasted, as this suggests that knowing there was a bar on the roof, I should have known and expected that the bar played incredibly loud music till the wee hours of the morning that would disturb any chance of sleep before 12.30am! It is unreasonable. I’ve stayed all over the world in hotels with roof top bars and never once had this be an issue and for many we have been on the top floors. It is incomprehensible to me how this establishment takes money from people who pay for accommodation expecting a decent and comfortable night’s sleep, knowing that on certain nights, that is just not going to happen! If we had known about this, we'd have popped out to Fortitude Valley to look around and caught a taxi back to the central Brisbane area. Furthermore, I was incredibly angry that they would have put my 76yo Mother in this room. She would have had a very poor night’s sleep and then been even more impaired when it came to moving around. To top that off, it is absurd they have this room as mobility accessible. Mobility impaired customers would have no choice but to stay in that room with that noise. I would also note that placing the ironing board under the bed for customers to pull out is fine, but for mobility impaired people, particularly those in wheelchairs it is unacceptable. Also people in wheelchairs still like to lay their toiletries out in the bathroom – those tiny little spaces aren’t suitable.  The staff were really nice, the hotel itself is in a good location for the train station and numerous bars and restaurants. I suspect that this hotel would be just fine for young folk who head out till the early hours and that's great, but if you need a good nights sleep - take earplugs or look elsewhere. Next time we’ll just stay in the Brisbane CBD as taxis are so cheap, you can get out and visit a few areas or get to the train station fairly easily.~2~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan
review_442961322~“Trendy, smick, Hotel”~This is a wonderful little Hotel in a great location close to all great things in Fortitude Valley. Staff are exceptional and very friendly. The décor is absolutely stunning, quirky designs, mood lighting. Rooms appear to be soundproof as during the night there was a very loud storm (apparently), we slept like babies and didn't hear a thing. The blockout blinds are a great idea. The bed is very comfortable.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_442755534~“Trendy, funky, cool hotel to stay.”~The front office given us a warm welcome. Front Office chris very nice guy, checked us in, show us to our room. He was patient to explain the amenities and facilities in our room. We felt like VIP at that moment, very good practice to show the guest of their rooms. The rm size was good for 2 person. The only part we surprise was no toothbrush in the toilet and the bed too soft. Maybe they should practice to put in instead for all rooms.  We are here for the ColdPlay concert and Chris assisted us on which the best way to go to the stadium. We really enjoy the stay in TRYP. The rest of the front office was also nice. Thumb up for this hotel. I definitely spread good words for TRYP. Best recommended. Funky, trendy and cool...~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_441837839~“Funky with great service”~I stay at The Tryp regularly for business.  The rooms are funky, well presented, and comfortable. The service is friendly and super helpful, it's always lovely arriving to a smiling welcoming face. During my most recent trip I was upgraded to a spa room. Relaxing in the spa after a long day at work was a special treat!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441301562~“Funky little hotel”~The front desk staff (Kim?) were amazingly welcoming and informative.  The whole architectural design of the hotel is edgy and interesting. Back in the 1980's I was involved in a range of social justice programs trying to change attitudes to 'street art' (graffiti). This hotel renovated in 2015(?) actually celebrates street art by having a different artist decorate each floor. The photos on line are pretty accurate - if you like them, you wont be disappointed with the real thing. Another personal connection, my children's mother's family were devout Freemasons - and the building that now houses this hotel was a former Freemason's building. But I digress... You'll love this hotel - but one drawback. The bathrooms have a clear glass sliding door - meaning that whomever you are traveling with will get to see, hear and smell your more intimate bodily functions! If you are traveling alone, then you'll have no problem!~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_440975006~“Street Art Theme Hotel for Millennials”~This hotel made me feel really old. And I’m in my early forties.  Choosing a hotel comes down to what kind of place makes you feel comfortable and what you value. Tryp is a good hotel- it just wasn’t for me.  Tryp's street art theme is like “the art series hotels” for millennials. But unlike the art series hotels, this one might not age so well.  There were small quirks and inconveniences that annoyed me:  -air con crackled like old school radio static,  -a very narrow, small space to place bags, which meant I put mine on the floor, -getting on wifi meant turning on the tv to get a unique login & pw for your room- great for security, but the PW didn’t change daily, so they could have just written it on the room card,  -the window didn’t open and the blackout shade on the window couldn’t be raised,  -because of the cool sink design you have to push in the sink plug in a sink filled with water to drain it.  Rather than enhancing the aesthetics or experience, the mainstream music videos on constant loop were just loud. What would have been more authentic was offering a photocopied local street art map highlighting areas to explore, or providing curated signage about the street art in and around the Tryp property. Tryp is a decent hotel, with competent, engaging staff. It was clean and in a terrific location-- about 15 minutes’ walk to downtown, 5 minutes’ walk to public transport and cool places on James St and Brunswick.  From a value perspective, I got a much bigger room, with breakfast, right off Queen St Mall, in hotel that also uses bright colors and “style” to attract guests for a good $50 less. My comments really come down to personal preference.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan

review_440282433~“Great citivacation”~My husband & I were gifted 2 nights at Tryp. We had not even heard of this hotel, but we were amazed and surprised. The location of the hotel is great, whilst we live in Brisbane and often pass through "the valley" we have never stayed here. The hotel is in a central location not far from the train station and the city bus is at the end of the street. The hotel is really cool with street art featured throughout. A really hip and happening area, growing fast with apartments being made from the old buildings. James St and its shopping and eating area is just 1 block away. We arrived late and the staff were very helpful,my husband had his push bike and the staff were very helpful in storing the bike so he could do an early morning ride. Our room was on the 3rd floor and we were pleasantly surprised by our room. The decor fits the street art theme. Loved the coffee machine/pod and the mood lighting. I have to get some of those bedside lights - they are great. The bathroom was great, modern, arty and very up to date with fittings. The linen was lovely and crisp and plush towels. The room size is adequate for city travelers hotels and are comparable with European hotels of the same standard- we spent 6 weeks in Europe last year. We really enjoyed our stay here. We ate our evening meal at Chur - attached to Tryp, but ate all other meals at some of the many eateries near by. We would happily recommend staying here, the service, atmosphere and location were great~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_439196755~“Great Stay”~The hotel is conveniently located near Fortitude Valley train station and it's easy to reach should you choose to travel out of Brisbane for the day. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the city centre. The room was very clean and quiet it was the perfect size with me been a single traveller. The restaurant on site had good food at a reasonable prices though there's plenty of options nearby. The staff were really helpful and advised where to visit in the city. I would definitely stay there again should I visit Brisbane.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_438867048~“Perfect Stay”~The coolest hotel I have ever stayed in. I had told friends I was going to Brisbane for the first time and they gifted me a room for the night and it was one of the best gifts I had ever received. The infrastructure was super rustic and the interior design artistic. My room was super cozy, comfortable, and came with generous essentials. Most notably would have to be the staff. Mark was an absolute legend. Helped me find places to go, where to eat, and a bit of history on the hotel building itself. He even gave me a charger for my phone when I found that I lost mine. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437937810~“Not bad for a short stay”~Hip space with lots of paintwork around the place - the one in the lift shaft is interesting. Got to be the narrowest corridor I've seen - it's a conversion so you get quirky features like that. Price is very good for what you get and it's certainly convenient with a Chur downstairs and bars nearby. Bathroom small but funky. No cups/mugs for coffee/tea but the glasses are thermal ones...threw me initially.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437913448~“A Stay in the Valley”~A funky hotel in the heart of Fortitude Valley, close to train station, restaurant on premises and others close by. Excellent staff. Not too keen on the glass bathroom doors but had all facilities we needed. Rooms and corridors very bright and cheery, room on small side but OK for short stay. Restaurant bit noisy for my tastes but good food and well priced. I would stay again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437683032~“1st tryp to Brisbane”~Very pleasant hotel close to restaurants, transport and the city and river. The staff Re the difference in this hotel. We were always greeted with a broad smile, and a 'welcome back' each time we walked in. Always asked how our day was, and the staff expected an answer, it wasn't just a polite query. All staff we encountered, from reception to cleaning staff could not do enough to ensure your stay was enjoyable.. The rooms are small, but adequate. I guess most people don't need to spend 24 hours a day in the room, which in this case is just as well. Unusual décor, from a baby boomer perspective, but it was tasteful and interesting. I really liked some of the paintings. A good base from which to start your exploration of what Brisbane has to offer. WiFi speed and access is the best I have experienced in my travels.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
