review_478386442~“Good Deal”~This hotel offers a good deal for patients attending St Andrews Hospital Spring Hill Brisbane. Our room was large with 2 Queen beds, Bathroom had space to move. Breakfast was included as well as free parking. Will stay here again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477311754~“Great service, comfortable and quiet.”~We have stayed here a few times now and every time we are impressed with the service.

We will be staying here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473939097~“Not quite what I was expecting”~My wife and I stayed a couple of nights last week at this Hotel on the basis that the website and reviews gave a generally good reflection of the hotel, and that it was very close to where we had to attend a conference. We had the package with Room, breakfast and parking included. To be honest the room didn't live up to my expectations. The staff were friendly and generally helpful, the breakfast was just fine and the room was clean with a comfortable bed. For some reason, each lift has an automatic deodoriser spay that gave an overpowering smell that could affect your breathing if you had asthma or an intolerance to strong smells (which is the case for my wife). When this was mentioned to a staff member (twice) I felt like this issue was ignored. Some websites indicate that the room has a mini-bar, room service and restaurant, but this is not the case at the moment. You'll need a car to buy a coffee, food or a bottle of milk! The restaurant does exist, but doesn't do main meals. This Hotel has great potential, but at this time, hasn't achieved all that it could (or says it has!).~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_470419448~“Room was clean and modern but . .”~The Watermark reception staff are really helpful and professional. The room had clearly had a recent refurbishment and was very nice and the air conditioning worked well. Unfortunately the hallways and the lifts are not air-conditioned so on a warm or hot Brisbane day, you walk out of your room into a fug of humidity in the hallway and lift. The restaurant and bar are open for breakfast only so if you want dinner you need to order takeaway or go walking. There are some good restaurants about a 20 min walk away. Unfortunately as I was in Brisbane for work with late finishes and early starts, the walk in the dark down to Boundary street on my own on a very hot night was not something I wanted to do. The pool is great. The buffet breakfast was comprehensive but the sausages were truly disgusting and the poached eggs I ordered just didn't arrive. On the last morning I came down to breakfast fairly late and would have been OK if someone had told me it was too late to order but my order was taken and I was left sitting and waiting until they started to stack the chairs. No eggs.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469921933~“Convenience was the key”~The staff were amazing and having breakfast included was awesome but not having dinner/roomservice when raining made it inconvenient. The room itself was great. Clean, tidy, well lit. For business it was perfect.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463055138~“Great Service”~Had a quick trip to the Watermark for a business workshop and was blown away by the service. The onsite workshop had a well thought out design and staff were helpful in ensuring our needs were met. The food was also fantastic.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460085949~“Great staff but noisy a/c and busy road”~The gentleman on reception was really helpful in providing us with a map with ideas of places to explore and eat. The room was fine but the air con was noisy and needed updating/servicing. The windows and net curtains were also dirty and needed a good clean. Although we were on the 5th floor the noise from the main road was quite bad as there is no double/secondary glazing. As we were only there for 2 nights the lack of sleep wasn't too much of a problem. There was also no dining or bar facilities which was a disappointment. The small pool was a bonus.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_457029635~“Convenient place to stay”~This was a convenient place for visiting Brisbane and no complaints about the cleanliness of the room. However, the a/c was very noisy no matter what the setting and traffic noise a bit bothersome but earplugs from the flight over helped!!!. Being on the top floor with no noise from above was a bonus. Staff were helpful but, despite two receptionists saying they would print out onward directions, nothing ever was forthcoming! There was no dinner facility but we were not bothered as dining facilities were basic and aimed at businessmen in a hurry. If that suits then all well and good.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456285739~“Excellent Customer Service & Very Accommodating”~We recently held a 2 day conference at the Watermark Hotel, this was arranged very last minute and the staff at Watermark Hotel - especially Thersia - were very friendly and accommodating to our needs. Nothing was too hard for them. We had a lot of changes with our accommodation needs and venue requirements and they met every single one outstandingly. The food prepared by hotel staff was really good and had many comments from our staff on how much they enjoyed it. The staff were even happy to arrange meals to suit a couple of dietary requirements we had forgotten to mention before the event.  I would definitely recommend the Watermark and Thersia to anyone who wants a friendly & welcoming stay or requires a venue for conferencing/function needs, as the team at Watermark go above and beyond for you.  A massive thank you to Thersia for her constant help and support even in areas that were outside of her role! Look forward to seeing you all again~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_455769392~“Couple of Days in Brisbane”~Very friendly staff, rolled my ankle and were fantastic in providing ice and offered a bandage. Really enjoyed the location, just a little bit out of the CBD. Great value for money. Would recommend and certainly would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455291388~“Another happy stay”~We stayed here on 17 January and once again were very happy. The rooms are always lovely and clean. We usually book on one of their special deals which includes their buffet breakfast. We always enjoy this. This little extra, good service from the staff and their free car parking are the main reasons we keep going back.  On this occasion, we were fortunate to be given an upgrade and were delighted with this.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454628985~“Average”~The staff were welcoming and helpful. Was disappointing to find out only on arrival to room, that room service facilities would not be available during my stay, was not notified at time of booking or at any time prior to check in. As this was one of the main reasons I booked this place was very disappointed. Offered alternatives via ubereats and deliveroo, but most items arrived cold and soggy. Room was clean and cosy for a single person. Lovely shower and large bathroom. Aircon was outdated and very loud, but the hotel is on the main road so you can't hear much over all the traffic anyway. Definitely take ear plugs.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454383481~“Great night”~Had a great stay at the water mark for my birthday. The buffet breakfast was awesome. Only thing that let it down was the air-con, it was a hot night and the air-con did not get below 27. It was set at 22 and was blowing hot air out. Also the ducted fan in the bathroom was not able to be turned off so was pretty noisy all night. Rooms were clean and hotel looked amazing. Love that it was so close to south-bank and the city. I would stay again and would recommend it to others~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453697589~“Nice modern rooms”~Stayed here for one night before flying to Melbourne. Check in was swift and upon entry into room was pleased. Rooms have had a nice touch. Recommended.

review_453494867~“Convenient Hotel in CBD”~The Watermark Hotel is good hotel for visiting Brisbane. it is close to the main train station (Roma) and a free bus operates in front of the hotel during weekdays and transit the main downtown commercial area.The hotel is moderately priced, clean and has excellent reception staff who can provide one with useful information on the main sites and activities in Brisbane.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_451981445~“The good the bad”~On the whole our experience was great , room clean and tidy room service excellent,the staff all very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was not operating for lunch or dinner.( this was only for January) they had about 50 restaurants online that you could order in. Only supplying breakfast which was excellent, the staff supplied every patrons food requirements, all fresh juices tea and coffee. Only one gripe our air conditioning was terrible it barely kept the room cool, the temp in Brisbane was high 30's and there is no other ventilation.(605 was the room).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449451352~“Christmas Night”~After a day of travelling it was wonderful to relax in the well appointed twin room at the Watermark Hotel. Comfortable beds with good pillows (always a sign of a good hotel) a beautifully appointed bathroom and excellent room service breakfast are the norm at The Watermark! The staff were lovely and friendly as always!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448145735~“Good hotel for the price but needs a refurb in many areas, great Restaurant (551)”~Good priced accom, room had been refurbished but the air con was set to one temperature and it struggled was really hot all day & night as it was a very hot day. The pool badly needs work there was a pool light floating by two long cables in the pool, and there were kids swimming had to report it three times finally someone came, said it was safe as was only 9 volt put a witches hat next to the pool, was not fixed..and no one seemed concerned about the safely of a child getting tangled up in it. On check out the next day still had not been looked at, the comment was oh the pool lights broken again is it, we must get that looked at! The flooring around the pool was buckled , broken & lifting, and the glass wall surrounds were dirty and un cleaned. The Restaurant however was very good both for dinner and breakfast 9 out of 10!..I would eat there stay else where, much better options around for the same price like Hotel Uban in walking distance.~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_446894008~“Great stay and lovely staff”~The hotel is great, large rooms (we had a twin room for 2 adults with 2 babies), perfectly clean and well maintained. I write this review to give a special thank you to the staff who was lovely & very helpful. They offered to help organizing food while everything was closed (public holiday) and also let us enjoy the pool all afternoon after check out while waiting for our flight. The hotel is perfectly located, just in front of a beautiful garden with lots of playgrounds, flowers and waterfalls. It's also a walking distance to the city, Myer Center, and South Bank. I highly recommend staying there!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445968091~“Not a great experience in general”~Travelled woth work, upon check i was told i had to pay for my room when the company had already paid... very confusing and not well handled. When i got to my room the TV didnt work and it was generally grotty and not clean. The only saving grace was having access to a balcony. I decided to stay quiet and order roo service on my first night there and i must say this was a dredful ordeal, they offer A special at receptin but it took me an hour and having three call backs to order my food. Training required or least having staff that can communicate in English needed. They then tried to ghet me to sign a slip with the food at full price. Nightmare. It then got worse when i added Breakfast to my room and went in the morning after a run ready for a good feed to find sub par scrambled eggs one type of bread and not much else. Suffice to say i cancelled the breakfast of my room and just took a black machine made coffee away which was absolutley dreadful. How can a hotel not have fresh ground brewed coffee i dont know. No Gym either which is a major let down. The only decent experience i had was checking out. Absolutley not 5 star, id say2/3~2~2~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan
review_445678282~“Quality for Money”~A really nice hotel and excellent value for money. The room was clean with not much traffic noise. Great free wifi and really enjoyed the bar and restaurant. Good prices and very friendly and attentive staff. We stayed here about 8 years ago and since then it has been nicely refurbished. About a 10 minute downhill walk to City Hall and shops. Taxi fare back was $7. Recommended.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_443799302~“3-star hotel”~not impressive and hotel seems dead. didn't see anyone. they barely have a lobby... looks more like a motel. room was sub par and bathroom not so great. it is loud outside. would not stay here, but location is near the park which is nice.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443701305~“So nice!”~Handy for us as we wanted as close as possible to St Andrew's Hospital. IGA, cafes, restaurants all within close walking distance. Service & room cleanliness were top notch. Very impressed & would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443630087~“Highly recommend this place”~Our trip to Brisbane did not get off to a great start when we received rather nasty service from a prebooked hotel suffice to say at the last minute we booked at the Watermark. I can not recommend this place enough! We arrived within 5 mins of booking and the reservations guy was absolutely awesome, he greeted us warmly explained everything throughly and even recommended some buget eateries located near by. Parking was affordable at 18$ and is secured underground. The facilities are immaculate and for the price you pay and service you recieve it is well worth it. We enjoyed it so much we decided to stay one more night and once again the man at reception was only too happy to help. Located right across from the Roma street parklands it is well worth the stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442722200~“Friends meeting”~We when there with friends to have a nice quite meal with friends. The food and drinks are fine but we had a noisey party of nurses which spoilt our night. It was very hard to talk as the party was over the top.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_442513082~“Noisy”~It's located in a very handy spot, with a free bus to the city right outside. The staff were friendly, and everything was clean, unfortunately our stay was marred by the noise from the construction site outside our back window which stated work at 5.30 in the morning! Nice place to stay, but we won't be coming back until the building works are finished~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_441872472~“Great location”~The Watermark is across the road from the beautiful Roma St Parkland and our room had a beautiful view of the park and the city. Rooms are comfortable and modern with individual airconditioning units rather than a centrally controlled unit. Reception staff were friendly and we paid a bit extra for car parking. Good location for walking into the city but beware Brisbane is hilly and hot in summer.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440963084~“A bit far from town.”~Good sized rooms and decent wifi for work. The inside is nicer than the outside. Rooms are newly renovated and each room comes with a coffee machine. Service is acceptable. It comes with a outside pool.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_437883987~“Service was lacking”~A/C wasn't working properly, reported after first night, told "see how you go tonight and let us know tomorrow if it's still not working". Surprisingly; didn't work on the second and final night either! Told them at checkout, called management down, was told "you should have said something last night!" Um, no, yo should have listened to us on the first night. Rude and condescending at checkout.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_436584775~“Good city break”~Stayed for three nights after coming back from a cruise. Good location on hill overlooking the city. Easy to walk into city centre - about 15 min walk either through the park or on the main road. Rooms were average size but comfortable and clean. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  We arrived on a Sunday and unfortunately the restaurant and bar were closed that day. Had breakfast on the last morning - $19.50 each for continental breakfast which we thought was a bit expensive. Bar prices - $7.00 for bottle of beer. Only a 10 min walk through the park to Roma Train station - ideal if you want to explore a bit further.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_436045809~“Great Service at the Watermark, Brisbane”~The courteous and dynamic staff provided exceptional personal service at much superior levels to that which I have experienced in 25 years at 5 star hotels including Ridges and the Park Royal (now the Crowne Plaza) in Canberra, and the Crown Hotels in Melbourne. This extended beyond service within the hotel; to include effort to understand what each person wanted to do while they were on holiday, and the types of cuisine they preferred to eat when outside the hotel, and they seamlessly organising this for them or providing detailed directions. There is a warmth and interest from the staff which made me feel special; and everything was attended to efficiently and effectively. The restaurant, bar and pool areas are stylish with a relaxed ambience; although the pool is not a large one I assume due to the limited size of the outdoor area. The only improvement I could suggest is a spa in the pool area.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434628247~“Fantastic 1 night stay”~1 night stay was very nice. Clean room with comfortable bed, quiet hotel & good view over the city gardens.

review_434143488~“another visit to Brisbane”~as usual the Watermark lived up to expectation. As a Frequent visitor I guess one expects standards to be maintained, and they have been. Location, access, decor and staff are good, as it the value for money.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433398933~“Amazing Staff - made you feel at home!”~We had our planning days at the Watermark and all of the staff raved about the rooms, the food and the people! We were so well looked after and all of our needs were met. We even were blessed with a lovely gentleman Jason who opened the bar early for our rowdy group so we didn't have to wait back in the office. A super special mention goes to Thersia - the lovely lady who organised the whole event for us. Without her sincere dedication and guidance it wouldn't have been half as good as what it was! Thersia - you are a super star and really one of a kind - the Watermark is very lucky to have you! I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel as a place to stay or a venue to host your own planning days/conference. A+~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433388061~“Wonderful service in a great location”~I had the pleasure of attending a conference held at a function room in the Watermark Hotel in late October. The staff were attentive, welcoming and a pleasure to work with. They made organising the catering, IT details and room hire an absolute breeze. Tersia from the Front Desk was of noteable assistance, her helpful and warm nature really made our national managers feel at home.  The hotel was itself was very modern and in a great location. As a Brisbane local I had no need to stay in the hotel, however heard glowing reviews from all of our national managers on the comfort of the beds and overall feel of the rooms.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

Not only does she deliver on all aspects of events planning, she has goes above and beyond to make the entire process a seamless experience. Nothing is an issue for Thersia and her follow-up on all requests is well above what I have seen from other venues. To say I am impressed by the standard she has set would be an understatement. Thanks to Thersia’s hard work and dedication she has won us over as returning customers for all of our scalable workshop events within our QLD team.

They looked after us as if we were family. They greeted us with smiles and enquired after our every need.  The room has very comfortable beds and a wash your worries away shower. There is secure undercover parking and excellent clean common areas. However, it is the personalised service that made the stay for us.  Each time we made the easy stroll to the hospital the delightful staff were waiting for us with refreshments on our return. Our every need was catered for including excellent restaurant catering with a lovely menu and wine list. Breakfast with full choice buffet and poached eggs to order. Much needed barrister coffee as well.  Thankful especially to Helen, Jason and Chloe who took the extra time to be especially caring.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Tonight was the first time that we have eaten here. The steak was as good as I have had & cooked to perfection. Broccolini cooked perfectly as well. Very attentive staff & good bar manager who recommended a red I would not have picked and he was spot on. Would thoroughly recommend eating here if the same chef is on. He or she really know what they are about. Looking forward to coming back. Peter Hugall.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_430726896~“Oktoberfest weekend”~Free Parking. Beautiful comfortable King size bed. Lovely shower and clean throughout. We loved our stay. We stayed in a king room on the 5th floor with a balcony. The only downfall is that (other than the hotel restaurant) the nearest restaurant or shop is a decent walk. In terms of comfort and value for money - this is a fabulous choice.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_429899739~“Nice enough hotel, breakfast was a disaster”~We booked into a suite on our recent stay. The room was very good - spacious and modern and very clean. Lovely big bed. All of the manchester was beautifully clean and high quality. Our check-in staff was a trainee, so we excused the lack of information/service provided. We had cocktails and tapas in the afternoon in the restaurant. Both were superb. The bar tender was very chatty and helpful and the outlook across the pool and over to Roma St Parklands is nice. Breakfast was a serious disaster. Apparently there was a mass-influx of guests at the same time for breakfast and the kitchen couldn't keep up. There was absolutely no food available and when it did come out, the poor staff were practically mugged at the kitchen door. I couldnt even get a cup of coffee (no cups available). After about 45-minutes we gave up and left. If not for the bungled breakfast, we probably would have given our stay a rating of 4 or 5.~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan

The hotel's location on the edge of the CBD provides convenient access to all parts of the City. The rooms are always clean and comfortable, and the restaurant provides a good breakfast before departure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422019058~“Great room and service”~Booked at in morning for a room that night. Got a complimentary upgrade to king room. Very large, nicely decorated room, with great bed and well set up bathroom. Even ended up with a partial view of riverfire fireworks. Bed very comfortable an room well equipped. Free wifi and parking was a bonus. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Great value for money.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_421968418~“Night in Brisbane”~We stayed in this hotel one night on 24th September 2016. The hotel is in a great location with easy access in to the city and just across the road from Roma St Parklands. We booked on line a couple of weeks earlier and it was nice to get an email from the hotel a couple of days prior to arrival with helpful information on the hotel, parking, etc - a nice touch. Check in was very quick and easy and the reception staff were very welcoming. If parking is not part of your package it costs $18 per night. We stayed in a King room on the fifth floor. The room was very well appointed, clean and quite spacious. A great view across Roma St Parkland to the city. Free Wi-Fi is available in the room. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant - a nice buffet with a good selection of well prepared food. A coupe of negatives - the only coffee available is from a push-button machine so we gave this a miss. Boiling water for tea bags is also available from the machine but not that easy to operate. Also the waitresses were a touch over zealous in clearing away plates - my wife's plate was taken from her while she was still eating!!! Overall an enjoyable stay - just needs a few finer touches. Final comment - the lift must be the clunkiest, jerky lift still in operation! Watch your step as it does not always stop level with the floor.~4~3~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_420159434~“Good place to be”~Nice location, easy to get to city, close to beautiful Roma Street Parkland. Getting in/out was a bit slow due to roads and traffic. Clean rooms with modern feel. Some issues at breakfast but these were quickly rectified by the restaurant manager.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418661078~“Watermark Hotel”~A big shout out to Jess who was wonderful and made everything incredibly easy for me. Overall the staff, the room, and the service was amazing. I couldn't fault anything. I will definitely being staying here again when I am back in Brisbane~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418637445~“Nice Stay”~Room nice, however the lifts felt old and in need of maintenance. Food was great and atmosphere was great. Included breakfast was enjoyable and easy to access. staff were very helpful and nice to deal with.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415941452~“Amazing place to stay”~I stayed here for 2 weeks in august 2016. My work sent me to Brisbane and put me up here. I found the hotel in general to be really clean tidy and rooms were very nice. The staff were what made my trip though, the restaurant and bar staff - young Jason in particular would go out of their way to ensure you were happy and not left waiting. Could not recommend this hotel highly enough! Next time I am in Brisbane for a holiday I will stay here for certain.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_415918548~“Great Hotel”~Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and clean. The Restaurant was awsome and the food was excellent. I will be definitely staying again next time im in Brisbane. The staff couldnt do enough to help you.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414706823~“Pleasent Stay”~We stayed for for 1 night and found the property to be beautiful and the staff to be vety professional however for early travelers I feel breakfast should start earlier, rooms have poor lighting and the shower heads are not practical...~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413328580~“Honeymoon in Oz”~The Watermark Hotel Brisbane is a nice, clean hotel. It's near everything. Breakfast we thought was very highly priced but it was a buffet all you can eat style. Maybe we just didn't eat enough. Rooms were a good size, with nice view. Staff could be a bit friendlier and could also brush up on local knowledge. When asked what's near to see we were faced with blank faces, followed by I'm not sure what are you in to? We didn't know what was there. We stumbled ourselves on the beautiful Southbank.~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan~3~nan
review_412956152~“Disappointed”~Won't be back sorry, expected a lot more, delivered little. Frequent visitor to The Watermark on the Gold Coast so decided to venture to the Brisbane one and have a weekend away but unfortunately I couldn't even compare. The GC one was far superior. Very poor service in the restaurant by one person in particular, even though the other people did their best to help. We were about a minute away from walking out~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412885843~“Hits the mark.”~Our room was spacious and well appointed. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and complemented with a small lounge, desk and small table and chairs. There was nothing that we thought the room needed and everything was clean and in good condition.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_409695364~“Happy Returning Customer”~We always stay at the Watermark when we go to Brisbane, good location, on site parking, great rooms , great breakfasts and beds very comfy with their mattress toppers!. Last visit when we arrived I needed to change to a double room (two queen beds) as my son had also come to Brisbane for the night, Jess upgraded to accommodate this at no extra charge. Upon check out Alex tracked down where they source their mattress toppers so we could buy one for ourselves.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_409037716~“2 Night Stay”~The room was a good size. I stayed with a friend & we had a Queen size bed each. On arrival the Girl at the front desk, Jess was very welcoming & explained all that the Watermark had to offer. Breakfast & Dinner on level 1 plus the pool & parking was available. It is very central being on Wickham Tce. Close to Roma St train Station, walk to the city etc.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_408047737~“Great find, great hotel”~We were looking for somewhere cheap and cheerful to stay for a few nights until we found permanent accommodation and ended up staying here. There was a deal online for 109$ per night that didn't include parking. For parking it's an extra $18 per night or you can book directly with the hotel for either $129 or $139 depending which night and it is included in the price. We read a lot of review saying the car park was a bit of a nightmare which I have to disagree. It was a lot easier to get around than other hotels we have stayed in. It is a bit of a squeeze and could be a little bit more difficult with a big car but nothing a good driver can't handle. The room was spacious and service every day. Staff couldn't do enough for you and were friendly and professional at all times. The hotel is across the road from Roma Street parklands and it was nice to wander around here, it was a short walk to st George square. The minibar was fully stocked but the fridge left room to add your own bits of things should you want to. We didn't go to the restaurant but room service is available. We accidentally over slept on our last day and then I really wanted to watch the olympics and reception were more than happy to accommodate a later check out which was much appreciated. The wifi is probably the best wifi we have experienced in Australia! We would return to this hotel again if we needed to.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405440947~“Happy Customer”~I have stayed at the Watermark Hotel on numerous occasions and always feel very comfortable and happy with the service I receive.  The hotel always has a high standard when it comes to presentation and cleanliness and the room are spacious and inviting.  I recommend the Watermark to all my colleagues when travelling to Brisbane and I will continue to be a loyal customer of theirs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404700638~“Excellent service. Great location”~We stay here when ever we come to Brisbane for the footy as its walking distance. Have stayed here a number of times and we are never disappointed. Friendly staff and the rooms are clean and the upgrades have just made it all that better. Would highly recommend~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404682052~“The right spot”~Stayed 2 nights in a king suite. Delightful room, spacious, comfortable and with a great view of the park and city skyline. Accessible secured carpark close to the CBD. Inclusive breakfast was a bonus. We'll be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404411215~“poised above Roma Parklands”~This is not a grand hotel, but my favourite in Brisbane. A 10 minute walk down through Roma Parkland to the city, or bus or train station, and an easy walk to QPAC. Recently modernised, clean, and the bathroom soaps, moisturisers are non- allergenic . Had a NY style steak which was fabulous in their restaurant. Only complaint: no fresh milk in the room fridge, but plenty of those tiny milk things. No gym, but an open air pool and a laundry. Give it a go and see what you think!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402581523~“Tidy rooms.”~Newly renovated. The rooms are fresh, clean and tidy. Shower is great! It has a free fall shower head or the removable handle.  Mini bar, kettle and coffee machine are provided.  The view isn't exactly the greatest but at least you still get a balcony and fresh air. Buffet breakfast is great! We also had a function win a buffet dinner which was just as good.  Staff was friendly. Service good. Just avoid the elevator during peak hours... It's terrible. Kept jumping to floors that the buttons hadn't even been pressed for!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399815362~“Comfortable, modern hotel with friendly staff”~We just stayed for the one night at the Watermark after a week in Noosa having never viisted Brisbane. The hotel is not in the centre of town but a 10-15 minute walk through the glorious Roma Parklands takes you to Queen Street Mall and another 10 minutes to the river and across the bridge to the Southbank. The hotel has been recently refurbished and the rooms and public areas are modern and well designed and very comfortable. We found our room very clean and well equipped with a view over the Roma Parklands - there is some noise from the road but it is not significant. The staff were without fail friendly and helpful allowing us a slightly later checkout and giving an upgraded room. We did not eat in the restaurant but did order some burgers on room service which was efficient and tasty at a reasonable price. Well done Watermark - many hotels could learn from your performance. If we stay in Brisbane again we will certainly come back.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_399774025~“Great corporate meeting venue in central location”~We have used this hotel irregularly over the past few years but this was the best I've seen it. The staff & function people were great, with the restaurant service good. Food was as good as I've seen it. Thank you to Tersia & team for a great meeting - we'll be back!~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_398281430~“Watermark Hotel – Good Spot”~Stayed at the Watermark Hotel at a corporate rate of $185 a night. Reception was smooth – always a good sign. The room was a good size and spacious enough for two people and luggage. The beds (two queen) were excellent – great night’s sleep. Modern bathroom with the standard stuff. The room came with a personalised welcome card and a little goodie box with a drink, choc bar and crackers – far from expensive but a very nice touch. Roma Park is across the road and the Normandy Pub is 5 minutes’ walk down the road. Due to time issues I could only managed to get a quick beer but this pub looks like a good spot to perch for a couple and have dinner.  Would I stay again – sure would.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_397708485~“Beautiful Place”~Such a wonderful place to stay at, the room was perfect for me and my partner. Service was excellent, very welcoming people. Will definitely be staying with the WaterMark hotel next time i'm in Brisbane!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_396454602~“Great value for money”~Rooms were tidy, clean, spacious and modern. The restaurant/bar area has a lovely feel to it and nice views out to the street. Across the road from the Roma Street parklands which is beautiful to take a stroll in or explore. Reception welcomed us warmly and was very helpful. Excellent value for money. We enjoyed our stay here and would come again.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_394894957~“Bonus night in Brisbane curtesy of Virgin”~Due to a delayed flight we were put in in the Watermark by Virgin, it was a lovely hotel. We walked down to the river's edge, about 20 mins, and along the boardwalk and ate at E'cco Bistro. So we stay at the Watermark again. Great room and friendly staff. A nice bar next to the restaurant overlooking a park and the city skyline.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_394110080~“Nice Hotel overlooking Roma Street Parklands”~A very comfortable Room with balcony overlooking the City and Parklands. This is the third time we have stayed here and would recommend it to friends & family. The free city loop bus during the week is a bonus. The Roma Street Parklands are across the road and an enjoyable walk through them to the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_391525784~“A comfortable room with a view”~We enjoy our stays at Watermark. Staff are always very helpful and cheerful. The breakfast is very satisfying. The room had a lovely view of Brisbane, particularly of the Roma Street gardens. It is delightful to stroll across the street and through the gardens as you walk into the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390243978~“More suited to business stays”~My husband and I stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. The staff at check in were so lovely and friendly, and the foyer is quite modern and welcoming. Our room was smaller than we anticipated from the photos on websites, but that didn't bother us.  The bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom decently sized, however the kitchenette was almost non-existent. There was only mini-bar options and a small (hotel standard) fridge. No microwave or anything which made it hard for us food-wise, and we had to eat out for almost every meal. We decided to not eat at the restaurant because we wanted to walk around a bit more, but all food options were quite expensive. Free wifi in the rooms is fantastic!  Also parking was $18 a night which we were not told at any stage in the booking process, and even at check in, the staff didn't mention it, just asked for our registration. It was only at check out that they asked for more money and told us why. Also, being on the main street, we got a bit of traffic noise.  I feel like the hotel is more suited to a one or two night business stay rather than couples on a romantic trip.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~5~nan
review_387668529~“Good place for a small function”~We held a function here for 40 people including live music and the Restaurant and Bar were a perfect setup for the size our our event. The service was very attentive, the buffet meal was excellent and a good night was had by all.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_387639582~“Quite enjoyable”~We had 1 nights stay at this hotel and it was peaceful and relaxing. The room was clean and the view was great. The breakfast was delicious. I love the pastries. We look forward to staying at the Watermark again in the future.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
