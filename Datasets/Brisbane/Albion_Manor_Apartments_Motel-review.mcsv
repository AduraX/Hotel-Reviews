review_467743628~“Very Friendly and Comforting”~From the time of check in until the time out it was just pleasant and humorous with the couple Managers/Owners who would try to make you feel home. Had lots of laugh and were given good advise of things we were interested in. Will come back eventually on the way back from "Sunnie" to the south.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_467436817~“Follow on from past review”~We recently returned to Albion Manor after an absence of 2 years and found it had improved even more than its previously high standard. We were warmly welcomed by Marlene and Dale as if we were members of their own family rather than merely being guests. We made greater use of their breakfast catering plus sampling Marlene's excellent Long Black and Cappuccino expresso coffees during our visit. Marlene's breakfast pancakes are a real treat and even better if you order a couple of rashers of bacon on the side [my apologies Marlene for adding to your future cooking load but they were full of flavour and beautifully cooked]. The convenient location and proximity to bus and rail transport is a bonus for those not wanting to drive in Brisbane plus the airport is not far way for air travellers. Excellent accommodation, convenience and value for money - what more could we want :-)).~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_463063388~“Friendly and Helpful”~Spacious, clean and good value for money. Despite being on a busy road the room was very quiet. Tons of eateries nearby. Undercover parking (you need to book that too.) We booked two rooms. Both these rooms had ample provision for computer use.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_448682321~“Well managed with that family touch”~It was our first stay at the Albion and we had no complaints. It's run by a very friendly couple who aren't afraid to provide that bit of extra service when you most need it. Very spacious rooms and a comfortable stay all round. There's a pub, restaurants and a BWS all just 5 minutes walk away. We'll definitely be back when we next stop in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447103076~“Family stay ”~Checked in with 2 adult children as a central point to catch up with family north west and south- comfortable and convenient for easy travel out of Brisbane- stayed for 6 nights- hosts really looked after us~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445090375~“Christmas Party stay”~I agree with all the good reviews. Will stay here again. It was excellent. Very friendly staff, clean and convenient location. We attended a party at the race course and it was very close by. Good kitchenette facilities. Lovely pool area to cool off in the heat, and our room was well air conditioned.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442244172~“This place ticks all my boxes”~My husband has to stay here for 4 weeks for work so i have popped up for a few nights.  This place is just lovely. Its spacious and clean and set up really well. Ive met the owners and they have bent over backwards to look after my husband and his work mates to ensure they have a lovely stay.  This place is close to the airport but situated not under the flight path so the only noise is the cars which are heaviest during the day. Everything is close. A walk will get you to the pub or the Brisbane river or some shops with a small drive away to larger shops.  Cant fault this place!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_437241021~“Excellent place to stay”~Visited Brisbane for my daughters wedding and wanted somewhere nice to stay. Albion Manor was ideally situated, spacious suites and very clean with everything in working order. The room smelled clean and fresh on arrival, was quiet and strictly non smoking. The owners were a very friendly, hard working couple who lived on site. Help was on hand with our luggage and a trolley was available for our use as we left early before reception opened. We will certainly be returning and recommend it to all. Couldn't fault it !!!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_435702676~“Couldn't fault our stay here ”~Arrived around 8:30 am after a 26 hour flight and our room was ready for us to check in. The location is close to the airport and easy to find. The room had everything we needed, was clean and tidy and a variety of restaurants were in walking distance. Dale and Marlene couldn't have done anything more for us. They were so helpful and friendly with guiding us on where is best to go and looked after us well. Would recommend staying here. Many thanks to Dale and Marlene~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432345064~“Albion Manor Motel”~Great stay, walking distance to Albion Hotel and many very good restaurants (Thai, Indian, Italian, Turkish as well as the Bistro at the Albion Hotel). Under cover car parking the Breakfast in house was good as well as take-away close by. Would stay there again price completive with other establishments in the area.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_427352413~“Ticks all the boxes”~The Albion Manor Apartments hit the spot for me and I'd happily stay there again when I'm in Brisbane for work. I was looking for a place that could offer the magic five for working travellers - a serviced apartment where I could make my own meals; affordability; a comfortable bed; parking for my hire car; and free wifi so I could work in the evenings. The Albion is old-fashioned accommodation, in a good way - and it ticked all five boxes. My apartment had a main room with a big new comfortable bed, huge built-in hanging space, and a small enclosed veranda with an extra single bed. Sliding windows and shutters let you control the temperature and light yourself. The bathroom was roomy and kitchenette was all I needed. Although it's straight off a main road, my room faced on to the side street and I slept soundly without being conscious of traffic noise. The parking under the building is also accessed from the side street which makes it less hectic to get into. The wifi was free, strong and consistent.  The Albion also ticked the affordability box for me - the cheapest room I could find in the CBD was one and a half times the price and parking was going to add another whopping $42 a night on top of that. At the Albion the wifi and off-street parking were included for free. Another real old-fashioned value-add, for me, was the owner Marlene, who was funny, welcoming and helpful and added a spark to the end of my day.  The only suggestion I'd make for the owners, Dale and Marlene, is that the little low table could be swapped out for a full-height table - the breakfast bar is okay for using a computer, but a bit more space would be even better.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418423149~“Good place to stay”~We spent 3 nights here & enjoyed our stay. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean and the bed and pillows of good quality. The location is good, with the nearby train station making getting around very easy. Marlene and Dale are welcoming and friendly and happy to answer any questions. We were in a room on the ground floor near reception at the back of the building. Kitchen facilities are good. The pool was sparkling clean. I would recommend this as a good place to stay.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_416937942~“Amazing ”~Albion manor is an amazing place to stay for business or leisure, so close to the city, with train stations and bus stops within a very short walking distance. The rooms are always very clean and the staff are always so friendly. I have stayed here so many times for business for up to 5 weeks at a time. Great place to stay~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416632482~“Easy and well located”~We only stayed one night while waiting for a connecting flight. We didn't actually see any of the staff as we arrived late and left early. On notifying the motel of our late arrival entry keys were left in an outside security box. Easy access in an older but well appointed large family room with two separate areas for sleeping. All the ammenities you require. Very comfortable bed and quiet even though the room was close to the road. Easy access to the airport (although not the closest by any means) was a great selling point, about 10 kms, not 7.8 that Trip Advisor says. The pool looked good but wasn't used by us. I stay again.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_413686857~“Everything you need and friendly host”~Great place to stay, had everything I needed. Ironing board/iron, cooking facilities, fridge. Room was clean and everything provided. Friendly owners and great value. I forgot a couple of documents I needed for a meeting, the owners straight away helped me print them - free of charge. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend for anyone looking for a affordable stay close to the airport.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412582075~“Such a wonderful surprise”~Only stayed one night in the 2 bedroom suite as I needed to catch a very early flight to Bali. This hotel really had more than I expect. Full utensils for cooking and plates, bowls cutlery etc. So neat and tidy with very good wifi. The owners are not only wonderful hosts but great fun to chat with. I would not hesitate to stay here again.Also just under 10mins to the airport at 3am in the morning. Oh and nice outdoor smoking areas for us rotten smokers.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_408100943~“Nice place to stay”~First time staying here for business. The motel is very clean and well organised. The room I had was exceptionally clean and well furnished. The mattress had a couple of springs poking through along the edges but it was still comfy. The location is excellent. Just a few mins from the CBD and a short walk to some fine restaurants and coffee shops. The only let down was the wi-fi. It wasn't very strong, kept dropping out and then stopped pretty much altogether which was frustrating, especially whilst in the middle of conference calls. Apart from that, nice pleasant stay :)~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_405188291~“Close to airport.”~Arrived late from Perth, conveniently close to airport, shuttle bus to Apex car rental. Good instructions on Parking and where to locate room key. Comfortable bed, clean and well presented. Reasonable price, everything we needed for two nights. Would stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399456378~“Small town friendliness, cosy rooms”~Marlene and her husband gave me such a warm welcome and had a lovely home cooked meal ready for me when I arrived. Rooms are clean and spacious. There is also come goodies in the fridge. The manor has a real homely feel about it. I will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_385978490~“Secure, convenient and proximate to Brisbane CBD”~The motel is well connected to Brisbane CBD by public transport. It is very secure, neat & clean with all required amenities. Dale & Marlene are very friendly and made me feel at home away from home. Brekkie was excellent and being a vegetarian, the hosts specially catered for me.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_381733746~“Great place to stay”~Rooms are very spacious and beds very comfortable. Fresh milk given on arrival. Selection of drinks and snacks at very reasonable prices. Walking distance to many restaurants, a pub and great coffee shops. It's nice to feel welcomed at this motel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381714807~“Great spot”~stay here often with work and great place and great hosts and they do a very good big breakfast or there is the choice of great little cafe down the street near the pub, there s also a turkish restaurant near the pub as well~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_380429668~“impressed”~Severe storms delayed flights and I arrived at motel at 1am. Motel accommodated my late arrival brilliantly. Clean, spacious room was waiting, very comfortable bed and a great hot shower...couldn't have asked for more after a long and frustrating day. Thank you Albion, will stay again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_374051561~“Very convenient accommodation”~An affordable accommodation. A comfortable place, with friendly people. Good, and convenient, parking available. This place is in a great location. Close to many great places to visit. Best of all, it's walking distance to some great spots. It was walking distance to a nice hair salon, a nice cafe, and a big sporting events field/building.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_372553351~“Great place to stay. Just what we hoped for.”~The owner managers are great hosts. They provided us with a lovely home cooked meal, including a delicious, fresh fruit salad when we arrived from the airport around 8:30. We felt well taken care of and highly recommend the Albion!The beds were comfortable and rooms were spacious and clean.The price is reasonable. We would definitely return next time we need a hotel in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369729526~“Clean and Comfortable”~Lovely managers, made us feel very comfortable. Have stayed here a few times, close to airport. Extremely clean and comfortable. Although we only stayed overnight it was perfect for our needs. Will stay again.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_365989361~“Amazing managers, handy location”~This place is a fantastic place to stay, managers are super friendly and helpful. Food is amazing! Extremely handy to Brisbane, short walk to rail and 3-4 stops to city or a short cab ride. Close to restaurants, pubs, shops.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_363796671~“Best motel in Brisbane ”~Have stayed at this little motel for 3 months now for work and couldn't recommend it any higher to anyone looking for accommodation in Brisbane!  Managers very welcoming and easy to get on with!! Rooms cleaned daily and always spotless!!!  Meals cooked by mangers are beautiful aswell!!!  Will be back !!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353644949~“Home away from home ”~I have been here for a little over a month and could not be happier with my stay.  Dale and Marline made me feel very welcome, good folks. They always have time for a chat.  Great rooms with ensuite, kitchenette, lounge, TV and patio area. Shared areas include hooded BBQ(sparkling clean), swimming pool, undercover parking and laundry. It's located about 4km from Brisbane city. Short walk from the train station. South Bank, Fortitude Valley and the City are all easily accessible. When I come back there is no question I'll be checking here first.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353430844~“Reunion with old school mates”~Room with double bed - spacious. Had sleepout with extra single bed. Very clean. Surprisingly quiet for upstairs near Sandgate Road. Close to the things we did - Doomben Races, Albion Hotel, cafe and Suncorp Stadium. Spent time in the pool. Staff were very helpful and pleasant~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_352495625~“Great welcome”~My wife and I manage Motels and understand the importance of a friendly welcome, this was delivered in spades from the managers Dale & Marlene. Our room was clean and comfortable. We opted to dine in and ordered both evening meals and breakfast. Our meals were delivered on time and well they couldn't be faulted. Generous, tasty home cooked meals that could show some restaurants a thing or too. Well done guys, keep up the good work.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_350665659~“Lovely place”~This was a clean, comfortable lovely place for a stopover - or maybe even a longer stay. I was en route and looked for lodging near the airport. Reception was friendly and helpful. Be careful, though, if you take a cab - there is a restaurant nearby called the Albion Hotel and the drive left me there instead of this one which is called Albion Manor Hotel. There is also a very nice Thai restaurant down the street with good food and a friendly owner.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_350443755~“Great place”~The owners are wonderful, they could not do enough for us. It is in a great location with plenty of parking and the rooms are spacious. We had dinner there and the food was home cooked and very good. It only took about 15 mins from airport and very easy route~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_346771727~“Friendly service and great location”~Stayed for a full week on business, the Management are very welcoming and friendly. The home cooked meals are generous and great value. The rooms very clean and spacious. Nothing was ever too much trouble. I will definitely be back. Well done!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_345054722~“Fabulous apartments”~I have stayed here a few times before catching early flights the next day. This time it was time for my 'baby' son . Aged 22 and 6'3" tall to go to U.S.A to work and travel. We arrived just after 2pm so we could have a swim, relax and for me to enjoy my last night with my son for a long long time. Dale couldn't of been more helpful . Making sure we have everything even pool towels. Also offered some emotional support to me as I was a bit emotional about my son going. Will be staying there again next time. So close to everything. Very clean and spacious~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_342962228~“Great place to stay”~Stayed for 4 days January 2016. Motel has live-in managers who really care about your stay. Very friendly, very clean and spacious rooms (wife's first comment on entering. She hates the sticky residue on hard floors left by some cleaning products). Room we stayed in had a kitchenette with reasonable sized refrigerator, cooktop & microwave. Free undercover parking as part of room. Managers are very involved with making sure your stay is pleasant. A variety of eating places nearby, and onsite meals in room. There was no issue in having family members visit for a barbeque. Good location not far from city, shopping centre, airport or cruise terminal. Original selected this room because of good reviews and apparent size of room, and wasn't disappointed. Will return for sure.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_342954428~“Very Good for a Short Stay”~Overnighted here before an early morning flight. Room was clean, comfortable, and well appointed - good value for money.  Restaurants nearby, and a short drive to the airport. Would certainly stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339571237~“One night- Post flight in before heading out in am”~Easy place to find. Taxi from Brisbane airport $27. Great welcome by hosts! Cool. Has everything you need. Quiet. Recommend. Good value for money. Nice breakfast in am delivered. Restaurants for dinner nearby. Would stay again pre or post flights.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339274536~“location, location, location!”~Exactly where I needed to be. Although an older motel, room was clean with good facilities, especially the bathroom as I needed wheelchair friendly access. Staff were very friendly, always eager to help. A short drive to the city, airport, dining and shops. An ambulant person could do a lot on foot. I will be staying here again if I need to be in the same area. The room had an airconditioner, I found it a little noisy at night. A small kitchenette meant I was able to store/make some food for myself if necessary.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_336760638~“Clean and Friendly Value for Money”~My wife booked the evening . Reception friendly, everything clean and even fresh coffee in the morning. Restaurants close to walk too. I have stayed in many similar places and this one is up there. Cars under cover. Would only recommend you open the windows if aircon is too noisy or too cold. Will stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336586848~“Outstanding Service at an Affordable Price”~We were really impressed by this establishment. The owners/managers welcomed us with exceptional 'old-school' service and our room was spacious and clean. The rates were extremely reasonable and the motel is in a great position relative to the CBD, airport and most other sporting and entertainment venues. We will certainly consider staying here again in the future. This property represents great value for money and provides a very favourable alternative to staying in the heart of the CBD. It is particularly handy for families and our hosts went out of their way to ensure our comfort.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_336297779~“Nice, clean, spacious & a relief”~The apartment is located near a busy road but the rooms are quiet. The room is spacious, clean and well catered for and off street parking is available. The apartments do not appear to be near any shopping or restaurant districts so you will need to work out the public transport or use a car. Good for visiting friends and the work stop overs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_333472680~“Clean & comfortable. Friendly management.”~VERY clean, comfortable & affordable accommodation. Dale & Marlene were very welcoming, friendly and helpful.  The Manor is close to restaurants. (The Thai UP the hill is reasonably priced. We had Thai Green Curry with chicken and a Penang Curry with chicken, rice and a serve of spring rolls. Very flavourful and cheap too).  There's a BWS next to pub at bottom of hill. What more do you need? (There's also a convenience store up the hill opposite the Thai restaurant). Oh, & free wifi and a pool. And close to Airport. Highly recommended! Thanks for the hospitality!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
