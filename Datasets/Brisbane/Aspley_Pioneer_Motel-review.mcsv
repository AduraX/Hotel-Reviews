review_469751940~“Clean and tidy”~Closest motel we could find to Eatons Hill for concert .... place was clean/tidy, which is what you want when travelling.... modern furniture unlike some motels we've stayed in.... only shame it wasn't a better day to enjoy !!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457715455~“Peeping Tom”~Just checking out of the Aspley Pioneer Motel ... The Manager says 'Make sure you move the furniture back before you leave '... I say "How do you know I moved anything? '. (We did move one bed around so my son could see the TV and did move it back before we left the room.... during our stay we decided that we did not require room tidied so no staff had entered our room..and had left the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN on door our entire stay.) He answered ' I looked through the windows and seen you moved the bed'... I am not sure this is true as we had curtains pulled. ..I think he entered our room without us allowing him to... I am not happy with this Peeping Tom / Burgler of a Manager at The Pioneer Aspley Motel.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452520264~“Nothing too much trouble.”~The owner/manager had a very dry sense of humor which we quite enjoyed. He noticed that I was utilising a travel mobility scooter and erected a short ramp to assist access. His cooked breakfasts were a good start to our days - appreciated as we were visiting for a family funeral. Nice to see an owner actively around the place. The Rice Cafe over the road in the homemaker centre also had great food and staff. Considering the reason for our visit everyone made us feel very welcome and comfortable even though they did not know the reason for our visit. Thanks to All~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_447291969~“Lovely place to stay ”~We only stayed for one night on our way up to Fraser Island. It is a lovely place to stay. Very clean. The gentleman who owns the place is lovely and very helpful. Great location. We will definitely be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434992012~“Great value close to city”~Family run motel with friendly customer service Amazingly comfy bed Great hot shower We were only staying one night but stayed a second night The room was lovely and clean again the second day Great value for area Good having toaster and microwave oven too Only issue was noise from adjoining child care centre during day time hours Plenty of eating options nearby some offering motel customers good discounts ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433422240~“Overnight Brisbane Northside”~Needed a bed for the night before an early morning international flight out of Brisbane. We have stayed at this motel previously and found it to be to our liking. Rooms are typical smallish, motel type from last century with basic amenities like cable TV, microwave and tea /coffee making facilities. Bed are ok and very little if any outside noise. Also plenty of options for an evening meal including a steakhouse across the road and the Hornets Club a 10 minute walk away, quicker if you catch the traffic lights.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427620070~“Clean, well priced”~We stayed here for accommodation for a family wedding relatively nearby. The rooms were a good size, the beds comfortable and the room and bathroom clean. The parking was adequate. The steakhouse across the road is an advantage. A good choice if you need to stay in this area.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_426837122~“Good Motel, reasonably priced and near shopping.”~Booked in for one night. Found the room clean and comfortable although a bit noisy with the child Day Care Centre right next door but only during the day. No restaurant, no place to sit outside, very minimalistic but an "OK" place none the less. Within 750M of a hotel and shopping centre, plenty of takeaway places to eat at (Red Rooster just across the road) etc. Steakhouse also across the road. Car parking spaces are a bit limited and very little room to get out. Prices are about average. You could do a lot worse.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_411977351~“Very comfortable place to stay”~The room was big and clean. The bed was really comfortable. Just how I like it. The hot water in the shower was instant. The fellow at reception was very friendly. It was really good. We only stayed the one night, but if you're going to the Brisbane Entertainment Centre or Eatons Hill Hotel - this is a great location. Plenty of restaurants in walking distance. I would definitely stay there again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_387910745~“Clean, but "free" wifi costs $$$”~Very clean, simple, large, comfortable rooms. Free wifi advertised on various sites is incorrect. It only offers paid hotspots not connected to the motel. Safe, walking distance from restaurants and public transport, very nice motel managers. Offers discounts to area restaurants, free cable TV and good aircon.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_385774696~“Girls night away”~Stayed at the Aspley Pioneer as we were attending a concert at Eatons Hill. We arrived around 2pm and had a friendly welcome. We stayed in a twin room and it was very clean and my bed was comfortable. I would stay here again as its in a great position with plenty of shops around. Nice little motel for an overnight stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_379181413~“Comfortable bed and armchairs. Very clean and an exceptionally good rate.”~Welcome stay in a very comfortable, clean room. For what we needed accommodation for over 2 nights, this provided everything we needed including free Wi-Fi which was necessary for us to have. Although it was positioned near a main road, there was very little traffic noise. Because the weather turned cold, a small heater in the room would have been welcolmed.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_343743491~“Clean and comfortable rooms”~Great place to stay for a travelling family. Rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable. The motel offers free Wi-Fi access and has a pool that the kids really enjoyed. Staff was friendly and the check in process was quick and easy. We found the location to be great as it was close to shops and restaurants and not too far of a drive to attractions. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_342723924~“Lovely, quiet motel”~Room was neat and tidy. Motel was near a main road but was nice and quiet. Bathroom was small but functional, the hot water supply and pressure in shower was great which you don't always find in a motel. Only down side was air conditioning blew straight onto our heads while in bed so you couldn't really sleep with it on. Room was quite warm without it on.~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan~5~nan
review_336104692~“Nice surprise for a motel!”~We frequently need to stay at a motel for one night while travelling on business. Most of them are old and tired, small rooms and noisey.  Aspley Pioneer Motel was a pleasant surprise.  The rooms were upgraded and had nice amenities - comfortable queen size bed, good pillows, fluffy towels, a new, large screen TV, free Wi-Fi, and a sitting area in the room. Price is about the same as we pay for much lower quality motels. It is within walking distance of several restaurants and is close to the Brisbane Entertainment Centre and airport. We would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_325623524~“Wouldn't stay here again”~I was disappointed with the dated decor and facilities, the unfriendly staff, the reluctance to supply extra sugar etc and the lack of any place to sit outside. It would have been fine if it had been $80 but not for $120~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_309656431~“Handy, quiet location and good sleep”~i stayed there for a night on a recent visit. It was handy for me and reasonably priced. The room was large and the bed comfortable. The reception wasn't very welcoming and the air conditioning was too noisy to leave on when trying to sleep. I would stay again but would check first if they had a room with a modern air-conditioner.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~2~nan
review_305558029~“Clean, Quiet, Easy to Find”~Was checked in by a gentleman (sorry I dont remember your name) who was friendly and helpful. Room is basic but very clean and had all you need. Comfy bed, plenty of room, nice and quiet location. Discounts offered if eating at a couple of restaurants near by. Would stay again~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_265421617~“Ver clean and tidy, managed with care”~Stayed in March for a quick overnighter and was pleasantly surprised. Very clan and tidy both inside and out. The room was a good size and although you are in the middle of a very busy business and retail area the noise was not noticeable. Although it didn't bother us there is a child crèche next door and you do get the pleasant noise of young children during the day. Outside there is a nice little pool and good BBQ equipment and seating etc in a small enclosed section with lots of plants.Great value for money and would definitely stay again. There is a great little byo Thai restaurant surrounded by some of the large chain restaurants just around the corner in walking distance, food was great.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_260232914~“Clean and has everything you need”~A nice little motel. It has great free wifi, air con, and it's close to restaurants and shopping. It was very clean. A lot of the fixtures seemed brand new. The bed was comfy, housekeeping came each morning, and it was quiet. There was a mini fridge, jug, and toaster. The hosts were very friendly too. Would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_256275792~“Nice clean room to put your head down for the night.”~It was clean, well decorated and had a fridge . But it was dark and you could here the people outside and smell their cigarette smoke. It had restaurants nearbye, some with a 25% discount on food if you showed your room key. Location near shops including Chermside and just off the Gympie road into Brisbane. Man at reception very cheerful. Wifi very good. All in all they made the very best of a very basic building.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_242341258~“Little Charmer”~After a bad experience with another local motel dropping my booking for another that was staying longer, I happened upon this little charmer. I turned up with no booking and only needed one night, they were welcoming and lovely. The room was clean, tidy and very comfortable. Such a convenient location to restaurants and shopping. You can even get discounts at a few local outlets when you present your key. I will definitely be staying here from now on.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_230664225~“Perfect Location”~Fantastic location. Opposite the steak house and a short walk to restaurants and shopping. Very short drive to movies, shopping and a fantastic aquatic center for the kids. Room was super clean and tidy and very quiet. Rooms were comfortable with free wifi.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_200986212~“Fair value for money”~We stayed there a few nights and have to admit it was close to where we needed to be and fairly priced when compared to other motels. But it ends there. The room was nothing special and the bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned. They forgot to clean the room the first morning and then blamed it on us. They further called us to yell , and I literally mean yell at us for not cleaning the room ! All we hadnt picked up was a tissue with makeup on it . Big deal these people are rude and grumpy and from what I can see very unprofessional. I would never stay there again and neither would the other 3 adults who experienced this.~3~3~4~nan~3~3~1~nan
review_140571412~“A comfy and clean suburban motel”~We stayed there for just one night.The motel owner was quite unpleasant -it was late night and the price was competitive with other motels we inquired- but the room we got was extremely large, comfortable, with a large choice of tables, coffe tables, bedside tables and shelves, and, most important thing, so clean. Each room is well equipped with a lot of different lamps, making the area so bright, a truly exception for a motel accomodation! Aspley Pioneer Motel is quiet, except for some birds that start singing at sunrise!~4~4~2~2~3~4~4~nan
review_132519454~“Cheap & Cheerful, Handy for City & Motorway Network”~Archetypal Aussie travel motel right at the end of the motorway convenient for north/central city and motorway, w/lots of shops nearby including Chermside shopping & entertainment centre. I was on a construction course for 5 days in June and stayed at Pioneer. Helpful staff Maureen & Lewis were lovely, if not a little subdued - could do with a bit more effort on the customer interactions but that's just me being friendly I guess lol! All told, this place is very convenient for a stopover or basic base whilst visiting the area. Door security could be improved. Clean & tidy.  Get the best rate at www.check-in.com.au - cheaper than booking direct.~3~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_123413556~“Small Friendly Motel”~Stayed Thursday Night, Motel situated just off the Bruce Highway South of Aspley on a Slip Road , made for a good nights sleep. rooms where fine ,staff very friendly, good food just down the road at the pub,about 7 min walk. Would stay here again.~4~4~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_118199696~“Good standard, good value”~I've stayed here before and was happy. Its a standard 3.5 star motel, clean & friendly. Food across the road or just round the corner.~5~5~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_57777586~“Clean, good value for money, close to bus”~Small, quiet family-run budget motel. On the outskirts of the city, but only 3 mins walk to the bus stop. The beds are comfortable and clean, the bathrooms are small but the showers are great. Jug with tea and coffee PLUS a toaster in every room. Would recommend for a quiet comfortable sleep if you don't mind the 30 minute drive into the city centre.~4~5~1~5~3~5~nan~nan
