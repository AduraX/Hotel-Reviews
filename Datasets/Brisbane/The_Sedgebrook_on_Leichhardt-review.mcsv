review_442804339~“Fantastic location ”~I had to book this accommodation in a rush as my husband had been flown to Brisbane after suffering a heart attack and other heart problems requiring surgery. From the moment I phoned to book and explain my situation, I was treated with such professionalism and kindness, so refreshing in today's society, and much appreciated at such a stressful time. The location of the apartment was 200m from the hospital so perfect for me, short walk to city, local shops and restaurants nearby (unfortunately I didn't have opportunity to try them but was grateful for iga express 200 m away!) When my husband's surgery and therefore discharge was delayed, Crystal bent over backwards to help me: the apartment I was in initially was now booked for another guest but she managed to find me another room, which had just finished being renovated. She didn't want me to have the stress of having to move to another hotel. I had to be at hospital early on the morning of checking out from original room and she told me not to worry, she would look after everything. She was amazing. My husband was so grateful, he had known how stressed I was, and said when we revisit Brisbane for checkups we will now endeavour to stay there as he wishes to thank Crystal personally. The accommodation was extremely comfy, very reasonably priced considering location, and had everything you would need and expect in an apartment, including a massive balcony which, under better circumstances, would have been lovely to sit out on with a cold beer:) Both ladies were lovely and friendly, I mention Crystal more as I dealt with her most of the time. Both ladies are a credit to the business. Thank you Crystal for your acts of kindness. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_270475840~“Very accommodating staff”~Booked Sedgebrook apartment to be near Brisbane Private Hospital where my husband was having a hip replacement. Unfortunately his operation had to be postponed due to illness, so had to postpone the accommodation at Sedgebrook. The staff, Suzhen and Crystal, could not have been more helpful.~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_257626609~“Great location, bad management”~I have a very mixed review, so I will explain.  Boyfriend and I stayed in a 1 bedroom appartment for 3 nights. Walked into room, the carpets were stained and filthy along with the lounge. I rang the management (Suhzen) immediately and asked would I need to take photos of this as I had heard of a cleaning fee and she said not to worry about it. Next I went to have a shower. Water didnt turn on, only bath worked. Rang Suhzen again was told "yes shower doesn't work, plumbers can't come out today, fully booked so you cant move to another apartment and no you cant have a refund because you booked with booking.com. but that we could have free parking". I was so angry and outraged! An hour later receptionist Crystal came knocking on the door and said she had found a free room (higher level with spa bath and working shower) carried all our stuff up and apologised numerous times. Thank god for crystal!!! The rest of our stay was pleasent. Great location with sushi at the base of the complex. No free wifi or parking and no off street parking. After our first day we enjoyed our stay thanks to Crystal!~2~4~5~nan~3~2~3~nan
review_256222873~“Excellent”~What a beautiful flat!. We stayed for four days, mostly on business and were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance every time we walked in.  The kitchen was very well fitted out, although the fire warnings were a bit nerve-wracking. The bedroom was delightful and the lounge was very comfortable, and all for only $99. Best value in Brisbane, I should think. It's extremely convenient, just outside the CBD but with a free bus to take you into town and, more importantly, bring you up the hill back. Highly recommended.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_244767462~“Great value, great location, great service”~This was my first trip to Brisbane - for a conference alone - so I booked this apartment 'blind'. The only important factors being price, location and air-conditioning (!) It was such a pleasant surprise to get such efficient service from Crystal - she works so hard to make sure that all her customers get the best possible experience - right from the moment of booking to the last parting wave onto the airport shuttle.  The apartment itself was much better equipped that I imagined. There really is everything you could need for a week's stay in the city - and more. The space and facilities were a real bonus. Yes, the disadvantage is the dated decor and the well-used bathroom. But remember the excellent price you are paying - it was a fair compromise for me to make - especially bearing in mind the excellent view of the city from the massive balcony! I loved Brisbane, and staying here was really convenient - the waterfront bars and restaurants 10 mins walk away (admittedly a bit of a steep hill in places on the way back)! And having the bus stop for the free 'Spring Hill Loop' right outside was also a bonus for when you were feeling a bit lazy. Overall, a wonderful place to stay and all gratitude to Crystal for all her efficient kindness and smiles.If only ALL hotel staff were as friendly as you ;) I'll return I hope ! :)~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_243426489~“Rude management who over-charged my card without my authorisation”~I have had an appalling experience staying here, because the manager, Suzhen, is an extremely rude, confrontational and argumentative woman. She upset me so much that I decided to open an account and leave my first ever review to warn potential visitors about her. Several things about the stay were less than ideal (e.g. management did not want to give us the keys to access the pool, asking what room we stayed in, as though we were trying to take something we were not allowed to by asking for pool access, or plates in our cupboard being dirty, or an attempt to charge $22 for a 2 day parking when the website stated $10 a day), but the worst part of the experience is that she accused us of having an extra person staying with us and charged us for an extra guest by taking a fee out of our security deposit. Surely this is illegal - I did not authorize her to charge us for an extra person as we did not have a third guest staying with us (we had a visitor come in a few times while we were there). I would not trust this business with my card details - if you really must, I suggest you double check the amount of the security deposit you get back as well as the itemized receipt for false charges. She not only accused us of having an extra guest, but she also took a photo of us leaving the building on the last day as ‘proof there were 3 people in there’, even after we explained to her that the third person was just a friend visiting us. According to other online reviews, she seems willing to offend and be very rude in order to get more money out of guests. As she is a manager with a truly an unpleasant personality, in my view she is not fit to be in the service industry.  I am currently in the process of complaining both to my bank and to VISA for being charged for a service I did not use, without my approval. It seems that according to reviews i am not the first person she is trying to overcharge either. Do not stay here and do not trust them with your card details – worst service I have ever received in my life.~1~1~nan~2~nan~nan~1~nan
review_243424136~“Do Not Stay Here!”~Where do I start. My girlfriend and I chose to stay at Sedgebrook on Leichhardt for the weekend. Unfortunately every other hotel was booked out for an event so we did not read the reviews. Had we known the management was so rude, we would not have stayed there. We had my brother come and hang out with us, go out for dinner and stayed up talking as we hadn't seen each other in months. Nothing was said until we went to check out and the manager Susan tells us we have to pay for the extra guest who stayed with us. we tried to explain the situation but Susan got very abusive, Yelling at us calling us liars, demanding we pay a fee of $60 for an extra guest! She said she will take it out of our security deposit.  Anything we said just seemed to anger her more so we said we will take this further. Susan just laughed in our faces standing there with her arms crossed saying to go ahead as she will just charge us anyway. We received the copy of our itemised bill via email and noticed Susan had put a "fold out bed" charge of $60 on our bill! In our room was one double bed and one couch. No "fold out bed" anywhere. Upon reading other reviews, we noticed Susan had done similar things to other guests, overcharging them without their approval. If that wasn't bad enough, when we booked our stay we did not know the only hours you can check in was Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm. Reception is unmanned outside of these hours. Since we were checking in on Saturday, they demanded full payment plus a security deposit a week before our check in date to get the code for keys from a safety deposit box.  We checked in to find a letter stating we had to wash up all our dishes and take all our rubbish down to the basement or we would be charged a "cleaning fee". They did not supply any cleaning products or sponges so we had to walk around to find a shop to buy dish washing liquid to wash the plates and cutlery both before use as they were filthy, and after we used them so we wouldn't be charged. We were excited to go for a swim but could not find the pool. Susan was around that day but did not want to give us access to the pool, asking which room we stayed at - as if access was restricted to only certain guests. She kept inventing issues where there were none. It turned out that the pool was across the road and was shallow and very tiny.  I have never been treated so poorly before and highly advise anyone to look elsewhere and read all the reviews before booking Sedgebrook on Leichardt! Dealing with the management there is not worth it.~1~nan~3~2~nan~nan~1~nan
