review_478353881~“Great weekend Break ”~Had a great stay over the weekend and loved the free cheese platter and wine, lovely way to start our stay. It was nice to use the free wifi and don't need a password either. Bed very comfy and apartment certainly big enough for two. We were there as had a birthday dinner to attend at Cloudland just a five minute walk away!!Customer service was good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475408538~“Amazing Service & Great Communication”~We recently hosted a movie screening at the Oakwood Hotels & Apartments in one of their function rooms.  The communication between ourselves and the organisers was constant and they helped us with every step of the process.  Not to mention the food. We organised catering for our guests, which were simply just burgers because they're a crowd favourite. They were absolutely delightful and many of our guests gave feedback as to how great they were.  The technical aspects of the room were set up for us and all we had to do was plug in and away we went.  Would 100% recommend to colleagues and utilise their great services again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474437119~“Great room, great veiws”~Stayed here for 1 night. Room was spacious and clean. Great views of the Story Bridge and Brisbane river. Close to Brisbane city nightlife and also close to Fortitude Valley so very easy to find somewhere to eat or drink or party~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_471456728~“Just not very good.”~The entire fifth floor did not have air conditioning and was about 26 degrees all night. Had to argue with the front desk person to switch rooms. The room itself was pretty clean. The beds were 2/10, with one lumpy pillow. The TV didn't work at all. The staff was rude except for the nighttime guy who did everything he could to accomadate me. The breakfast was good though!~2~1~4~1~1~3~1~nan
review_470431965~“Nice room, wonderful view. Tiny pool ”~We stayed in a river view studio for 2 nights. The views where exceptional even in the lower floors (4th floor) so higher up they must've been even better. The room was well equipped, with a small kitchenette. The pool was very small with only 2 sun loungers. Location is excellent with easy (and extremely pleasant) walking distance to the CBD, Eagle St, New Farm, Kangaroo point and Fortitude Valley (including the train station). Good wifi throughout. The staff were very friendly snd helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468973445~“OK stay. Front desk staff member appalling!”~We redeemed a Groupon voucher for a one night stay at Oakwood on March the 18th. We chose a 1 bedroom apartment, as we had our infant daughter with us.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by a 'glum' and 'unfriendly' lady named FIONA at the front desk. Sadly this lady is not an asset to your hotel. She was patronising and condescending as she asked us to produce our voucher. We pulled up the Voucher on our phone (When we booked we were told this would suffice), and Fiona was extremely rude harping on the fact that we should have printed the Voucher. Even going as far as rolling her eyes at us! Absolutely appalling service. I went on to enquire about a cot, and again was rudely spoken to as I 'should have pre booked one' . Understandably this is valid - but the manner in which Fiona spoke to us was so disappointing and rude. In fact my infant ended up sharing the bed with us! The cherry on the top was when I walked up to our room (Screaming infant baby in tow, who was due a feed), and the card keys she had given me weren't activated!! It was back down the lift for me (baby screaming), and Fiona continued to make me wait for a further 5 minutes before smugly apologising that 'Sometimes this happens with the keys'.  I couldn't help but quietly question to myself whether it was intentional, as there was no remorse when I went down!  On a positive note - the other Front desk personnel were friendly and professional.  The room was adequate and clean. The sheets soft and crisp. The pillows were worn, flat and uncomfortable. But this is only a small thing and didn't bother us.  Hotel restaurant was good. We enjoyed the Boston Baked Beans and Farm House Breakfast, and we were impressed by the lovely waitress.  Parking was easy underground and was included in our deal.  The location is very central to the Valley. We attended a wedding at Cloudland and easily walked there in 4 minutes! Do keep in mind though that the rooms can be noisy as you are right on the foot of the Story Bridge. This didn't bother us at all.  We were given room 407 - and it had 2 big rotating billboards outside it. If we ever visit again, I will be requesting a room on the other side of the hotel.  Overall a satisfactory stay, however if I was the owner of this hotel I most certainly would be addressing the front desk service! This is the first impression one has of there stay, and it certainly wasn't pleasant for us.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~2~nan
review_466397026~“? OK - Not rave worthy”~Not my cup of tea.... the apartment is split level, main bathroom on the bottom and 2nd bedroom up a steep set of stairs. The bathroom - adjoins the main bedroom, so the upstairs guests have to go thru the main bedroom to access it. It was a very hot day and the air conditioning struggled to cool the bedroom upstairs - it was hot and stuffy.  Location - awkward to find and not really any eateries or shops within walking distance.  Accommodation was clean, kitchen was a good size. but not somewhere I would stay again~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_466377003~“LIED TO AND RIPPED OFF”~Beware of this place - Beware of the hidden extras and being forced to pay by cash - incidentals that are charged after you have paid your account. Last time I stayed here I was impressed - after this stay I am nothing but totally disgusted about the blatant lies and deceit of the management. WARNING !!!!!! BEWARE I was forced to pay for parking TWICE> after being told it was complimentary when I called and enquired - not to mention all of the other hidden fees. I can not stress enough - beware especially of 'XXXX" who forces you to pay cash!! and no receipt!!~1~nan~3~nan~nan~2~1~nan
review_460823213~“Nothing positive to say”~Not only were the staff condescending and patronising to myself and the other members of my group, the room itself was appalling. The bedroom door was almost off its hinges and took two people to close it. On top of that, the chairs located on the balcony are that old and worn out, that I have spent the entire day in pain because I have fibreglass fragments stuck in the back of my legs from sitting on it. Will never return and will be telling my family and friends to steer clear.~2~1~3~2~2~3~1~nan
review_460782018~“Perfect location for Brisbane City ”~Spent two nights at the Oakwood. Small issue in actually locating the property. However check in was smooth and quick. Onsite secure parking for no extra fee and the location is one of the best things about it. So close to riverside dining (500m +/-) and the city and close to the valley and the view is spectacular. Definitely recommended for its price, location and service. Noise wasn't an issue for us being on the furthest edge of the hotel away from the bridge. So much potential here, will be good to see what changes the Oakwood chain will bring.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458828299~“Not too bad”~We rented two apartments for a hens weekend. Staff were friendly and helpful. As previously stated it is a bit out from the city. We found the air conditioning a bit ordinary but then we were suffering a heat wave. The only toilet in the apartment was through the main bedroom which was a bit of a pain as you disturbed those in there. Also the bath and shower were combined and the bathtub had a very high side which made it impossible for my elderly mother to access. The only other thing that we didn't know was that to gain access to the other two beds there was a steep staircase you had to navigate as it was a two story apt. Also, the rooms very very noisy. You could hear people outside in the corridors. Parking was underneath the building so was convenient. I am not sure that I would stay there again.~4~nan~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458752863~“Too noisy for me”~The hotel is tucked up hard against the Story Bridge. Traffic wraps around it on 3 sides. I couldn't get any sleep. In addition the bed was so hard. I have never ever slept on a bed so firm before. I stay in hotels 160 nights of the year. Ive slept on a few beds, and this wasn’t good. It's too far from any cafes etc to walk to. I went to go out one evening and it started pouring rain, so i gave it a miss. There’s lots of other hotels in Brisbane. I'm sorry but I’m going to go to one of them.~3~nan~2~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_457740943~“Awesome AGAIN!”~This is our third time to stay at this property. Ok, it's been under different brands each time. But, from check in to daily exchanges of pleasantries to the bar staff and restaurant staff, I cannot fault them. 15 minute walk to eagle st, great restaurants near by, central and clean and quiet. Will always return here when in Brissy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449099726~“Excellent Views”~We stayed at Oakwood Apartments over the New Year 2016 / 2017 for 2 nights. We had a 1 Bedroom apartment with River Views and what a VIEW! next door to the Story Bridge which lights up every night. Nice sitting on your balcony just watching plus the river view up to Eagle Street Pier and beyond. The 1 Bedroom apartments are a good size with full kitchen and lounge room bedroom looking out to the river and bathroom, some bathrooms have a spa bath which is a added plus. The outdoor pool and spa also has views. Check in was easy with nice staff and secured under cover car parking. There is an onsite restaurant and bar that serves breakfast and dinner. We had dinner there and breakfast and it was very reasonable price and we enjoyed it, the staff could not help us enough and are always on hand if needed. No need to drive just park your car as you can walk within a 10 min walk along the river boardwalk to Eagle St Pier and into the City also you can catch the Ferry up to Southbank. So all in all a very nice place to stay we will be back again. Thank you Oakwood.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_448756334~“Wonderful Stay!”~Sure the property could probably do with a facelift BUT the service was impeccable - from checking in to having to get someone to come to my room to sort out the lights for me (my fault) to the staff at the Alto restaurant. I've stayed in a few hotels and the level of service at Oakwood was beyond brilliant. The room itself was also really great - kitchette with dishwaher, washer/dryer in the bathroom. The bed was super comfy and the balcony was huge. I was there specifically for NYE and while there was a tree in the way for the fireworks at Eagle Street Pier, it was still an amazing view. The only negative I could find was that there were not a lot of tv channels - but that is really the only negative. I would definitely stay at Oakwood again and recommend it to anyone visiting Brisbane~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_448364837~“Nice and clean hotel near to Story Bridge”~30 mins walk to Southbank and 10 mins walk to Story bridge. Its a clean hotel, with amenities such swimming pool and restaurants. Appliances such as TV, washing machine and dryer, oven, induction cooker. friendly staff.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_447270122~“Beautiful View”~The staff were lovely. We enjoyed our stay here. We chose a bridge view room and wasnt disappointed. It is ideally located also. Would definately stay here again. The only negative is the pool area is too small, they have a large full size tennis court and only a small pool area, would have been better with a half court and larger pool area to take in the beautiful view. But all in all, well recommended~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_440724772~“That View!”~Stayed here for 3 nights and it was absolutely wonderful. We had a 1 bedroom apartment on the 8th floor. It had an enormous wrap around balcony which gave us stunning views of the Brisbane River and Storey Bridge and even behind us into Fortitude Valley. The room was a good size for 2 people, with a small sitting area with TV, a small dining table and a good size kitchette with all you would need. The room was beautifully clean. A small problem was had with the balcony chairs which was rectified immediately. There is a lovely clean pool and spa which have fantastic views over the river - wonderful to swim and watch the world go past. The staff at this Hotel are a standout. There was no one we met who did not have a genuine smile, a genuine want to help. All were lovely to deal with, and nothing was a bother. Any request was dealt with immediately, with a smile.  We were treated like royalty and had such a fantastic time and we can't wait to return. :)~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_438649761~“A wonderful night's stay”~Unfortunately, we only had one night here but it was just perfect. We had a river view one bedroom apartment which was exceptionally comfortable. For those staying longer, a washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, cooktop and a reasonable sized fridge were in the room. The location is between Fortitude Valley and Brisbane City, so everything is nearby.  Watching the activity on the river during the day, or the city and bridge lights at night was wonderful. The apartment had a very generous balcony. The river walk entrance is at the bottom of the Lane which will take you into the City. The staff were so very pleasant and friendly - kudos to them for their great attitude and assistance. Breakfast in the Alto restaturant is also recommended. Plenty of choices and good quality food. We didn't use the gymnasium or sauna, tennis court or pool - but would be beneficial for those staying longer. Would definitely recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_438170938~“Great value, excellent staff, terrific view almost in the heart of Brisbane”~Very competitive rates - comfortable apartment with all the facilities that are needed for a 4 day stay - serviced daily - free wifi - and $15 per night car parking (a factor in our decision). Very friendly staff who have obviously been trained to identify unfit ppl who don't take it easy walking up Ivory Lane (feels like Ivory Mountain on a 36 degree Brisbane day) - and hand out free water bottles to those who make it to the top. Thank you - a much appreciated gesture showing you really do care.~5~nan~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437982690~“Incredible view”~My partner and I have stayed there twice now and highly recommend. Oakwood has an awesome location in between the valley and city, walking distance to night clubs and restaurants. The beds are very comfortable, and the room has great ammenities. The view is incredible with the bridge so close! The tennis court is a great addition in the city, which, along with the pool have a great view! Will definitely be staying again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435943649~“Amazing time at Oakwood”~I have just spent 3 weeks staying at Oakwood apartments, it was terrific....GREAT staff, fantastic rooms......absolutely outstanding.....beautiful views to the city and storey bridge and just a hop skip and jump to the valley~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_435482449~“Great location with fantastic views”~My husband and I recently stayed here after a function in the City. The location was perfect, so handy to both City and Valley entertainment precincts. The staff were all so friendly and welcoming and we enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Alto Restaurant which was very satisfying. Our room was clean and tidy and the view from our room was spectacular. All in all a very pleasant experience. I would definitely recommend Oakwood to friends and family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434723481~“Pretty Good”~The wife and I booked a single night here so we could enjoy a night in Brisbane City (and Fortitude Valley) without having to get home afterwards. Initial impressions were nice, particularly from the well dressed and spoken staff. Complimentary parking was given due to a difficult customer in front of us, which was much appreciated. The room was nice enough, not specifically big or small. Bed dressings were acceptable, although pillows were a bit on the cheap side. The large openable windows were delightful! Shower and bathroom were a little tight, although not too bad considering the location. The shower was a shower / bath combination, which never feels particularly luxurious. The location is quite good, with only a few minutes walk to Fortitude Valley where we went for dinner and mini golf. After dinner, we went home, got changed, and went into Brisbane city, walking along the Brisbane River walkway (well lit, and direct to our destination). In summary, we would stay there again.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_434699863~“Great cost effective hotel”~I stayed here overnight this weekend and found the staff to be welcoming and friendly. My room was clean and the appearance was to an acceptable standard. My stay at this hotel was comfortable and enjoyable at such a cheap cost.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431977809~“Disappointing”~Appreciate you get what you pay for but the continuos running water from the air conditioning was unacceptable. Sadly made worse by the staff not seeing this as a problem.  Customer service - fix or relocate. Or at the very least apologise.  Also if you are booking a 2 bedroom apartment with the only bathroom on the main bedroom is a challenge~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427489470~“Central location between City & Valley”~My husband & I booked the city escapes package via the Oakwood website. We had stayed previously under the Adina banner & knew that the views & proximity to Brisbane & the Valley were excellent. This time we had a north facing room which was extremely hot & the air conditioning did not cope. We chose not to complain as we could open up the door & window in the evening & let in the breeze (& noise). The extras as part of the package were not received on our arrival & I had to personally ask for the car parking, cheese platter & drink vouchers. The positives were the friendly, welcoming staff in the restaurant in the evening & at breakfast. Alto's restaurant is a lovely setting & we enjoyed a pizza & wine overlooking the river, the breakfast buffet has great variety. When we did receive the cheese platter it was fresh & delicious & well presented. We especially loved relaxing in the spa enjoying the river & bridge views.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_426518828~“Excellent place to stay”~Nice, well appointed rooms, clean and tidy. Mine had a bit of a strange "sweet" smell near the bathroom, but that could have been the cleaning substances used. As other review have mentioned the bath/shower recess wall is quite tall so if you have trouble getting in and out then this is not for you. Near the Storey Bridge, but there was minimal noise once the balcony door was closed. Just a quiet drone, no worse than an air cond. Great, friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble. Food in the restaurant was superb. Fast wifi, unlimited. Would stay there again for sure.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_426048161~“Great view-except for the smell”~The view is incredible. Beautiful view of the Story Bridge and Brisbane River. Decor is a little dated but otherwise everything appeared clean. Except for the smell. Upon entering the studio it reeked of vomit. We asked to be shifted to another room due to the stomach-turning stench in the hallway and the room. Not the greatest start to a stay!  We were moved to another room 2 floors up, all seemed well until we could smell the horrible vomit smell coming from the kitchen sink. Perhaps someone was previously sick in there, or this place has serious plumbing issues. Terrible let down! Also an unusual sound coming from the ceiling that sounded like running water on tinfoil throughout the whole night. After shifting once, we took a chance and didn't ask to be moved again. Also airconditioning didn't work. Sorry but we will not be coming here again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425699515~“Romantic setting”~We had a lovely stay before we flew out to the airport the next morning. The room was lovely. We enjoyed the view right outside our window of the gorgeous bridge all lit up with the lights. We strolled down the riverside to the restaurants and bars. Highly recommend the Oakwood Apartments. We only wish we could have stayed longer!~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_422682353~“The View is unforgettable”~Hubby & I stayed in a river view studio for 1 night to escape the kids. I booked it purely for the view. The rooms are clean and perfectly adequate (bathroom needs updating). The pool are has an amazing view of the bridge too. Would be perfect to stay here over New Year's Eve or River Fire to see the fireworks, we were two nights too early.  Surprised at the $15 parking charge and the minibar is as usual, ridiculous. Also surprised that in modern times the bins offered are SO small and there's not a second bin for recycling. Perhaps Oakwood need an environmental lesson.  Overall it was well worth the $135 we paid for our 9th floor river view studio and we would stay again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422651773~“Beware they have private function's on riverfrie night's.”~Stayed for the river fire, great view for the fireworks. I was expecting noise from the fireworks up until 8pm.  Didn't know there was a private function on the tennis court below our room, when I booked. It was offensively loud and got louder as the evening went on. Having the doors closed didn't help. My grandchild kept saying the music was to loud and she couldn't go to sleep.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_422298383~“Riverfire 2016”~What a wonderful experience. Smooth effortless bookings with Jennifer and check in with John, (extremely helpful & smartly dressed.) Car Parking with Mitch, who's thoughtfulness in bringing the car down on checkout by very much appreciated.  Our room was well presented and the balcony view of the fireworks was simply stunning. The buffet breakfast had good variety and the meals were hot. I noticed some nice new touches to the decor and I don't think I've ever seen a pool so blue and inviting. Well done Oakwood.. Booking again for Christmas Eve!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_420410469~“Awesome View, Friendly Staff”~We stayed Friday and Saturday night. The room was quiet, the room service food was amazing, the buffet breakfast was one of the best I have had. Staff were exceptional - friendly and helpful and nothing was a hassle. The room was clean and the view was picture perfect. Was close to the Mall, either walk or $10 taxi fair. You could walk along the river or just sit on the balcony and watch the boats/ferries go by. Would book many times again and recommend the Oakwood to anyone.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_419374413~“Birthday weekend ”~We stayed here for two nights, Friday and Saturday. I booked this for my partners birthday, and decided to pay a bit more for a river view. We arrived at the hotel with no troubles, a. Great location and staff seemed friendly upon arrival. We arrived in the room Friday evening to a beautiful view and a nice big balcony, however as we stepped looking at the view my partner had a cigarette dropped on his head. The hotel was a no smoking hotel and there were maybe 5-6 cigarettes on the balcony. We went down and told a lady at reception whom said she would try and sort it. We went out early the next day early, came back at lunch time to find 30 cigarettes on the balcony, and could smell the smoke. I rung down to reception straight away and spoke to Mitch at reception, whom sorted the matter so quickly and professionally. We could not fault him, he moved us to another room and apologised profusely. Apart from that small issue, we had a pleasant stay, clean rooms with good facilities. In a great location and great views. Would stay here again. Only thanks to the way the issue was dealt by Mitch.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_416927265~“Friendly staff and handy location”~Having stayed once before (when it was the Adina) I thought I would stay again to see what, if any changes, had been made. I stayed in a studio room as it was only for one night. The room was large enough, clean and tidy. The bathroom was clean but still a bit tired looking. I was on a lower floor, but still had a nice view of both the river and bridge. All the standard facilities that you come to expect in a room were there, microwave, tea & coffee facilities. I was glad to see the friendly and helpful staff were still there as they do set the property apart from many others. The property is ideally located a 10-15 min walk from Fortitude Valley and the city Mall so you have a wide range of restaurants and bars nearby. If you are going to catch the train and plan walking to the hotel do it from Fortitude Valley as it is an easier walk than from Central Station.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
