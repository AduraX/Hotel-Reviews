review_466151381~“Hospital Accommodation”~My husband needed to spend a night in the PA Hospital. We flew from Central Queensland, so required somewhere close to the hospital. The staff were lovely and very obliging with information that we would not have known about. If in the future we need to visit the hospial again, we will definitely book in here. The rooms were clean. The bed was comfy, although the pillows were a bit flat, and so required a second one from the cupboard. All in all, we enjoyed our stay.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_464237259~“Close To Hospital”~Apartments are close to hospital.... That's the Good Point. Studio was outdated probably due for a bit of a reno. Everything is included in room, washing machine, Dryer, Microwave etc. Which is good for longer stays. Be wary of cooking as smoke detectors go off very easily. Bed was HARD and on wheels so if you try and sit up in bed, the bed rolls away from wall. But there was a Lounge on the opposite wall which we turned around and pushed up against end of bed. PROBLEM SOLVED. There was a few cracked and marked tiles in shower. We received a key for the secure underground parking upon arrival ( Sunday so no office staff) but there was no instructions or directions where car park was. Staff don't seem to communicate between morning & afternoon shifts, as one Staff member will tell you one thing and the next one says something else entirely different. They also seem to think guests should know everything and act a bit uppity if you question them. If you require close accommodation for a hospital visit its ok.~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan~2~nan
review_463110578~“Hospital Accommodation”~Situated close to The Princess Alexandra Hospital Brisbane, this dingy hovel is not some where to consider whilst visiting the hospital or convalescing. As you can see from the photos below these appartments are in need of some TLC of their own . To look beyond the dated decor is doable however to be greeted by cockroaches is difficult to ignore . To add insult to injury (pardon the pun) we were advised by a member of staff that it's not the big cockroaches you need to worry about it's this little ones ! As he arrived in our room carrying some insect spray ready to give our room the once over .  Needless to say we found fabulous accomodation very close by and Post Operative recuperation was successful.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430596375~“Budget accomodation, handy to hospital”~Very dated rooms, but reasonable sized with kitchen, washing machine etc. Shower is in a deep corner tub like spa bath which has high sides to be stepped over, slippery, and water runs onto floor and out into room. No good for infirm, disabled, knee/hips problems etc. Staff were courteous, helpful and prompt. Stayed three times now for about 8 days and would be back next time.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_429499669~“Perfect oasis for where you are”~You know, sometimes you have to stop at a place you would rather not be. But because of it's proximity to the hospital it was the place we ended up in. And we were grateful. These apartments are only only 2 floors high, are spotlessly clean, and have this ambient tropical resort feel about them. They may be a little dated but they are still modern and new looking. Fully self-contained, full fridge and freezer with stove and all the utensils you need, a washing machine and drier, a spacious bathroom and comfortable bed, small table for dining and a little porch you can enjoy your morning coffee on whilst basking in the early morning sunshine enjoying the hot pink potted bougainvillea on your porch and looking at the palms and petunias.  Being here was a welcome relief - you did not feel like you were in a hotel in Brisbane. The well maintained gardens added to that tropical feel so you actually felt you were away on a holiday instead of a hospital visit. Just a short walk is a small shopping centre with lots of eateries and supermarket, for everything you need. We used to dine at Sing Sing's which has changed hands and is now the "Memorable Restaurant", but about that in another review... Carpark is al fresco (no undercover car parking available) which is really the only drawback here. Go again? Yes definitely for any future hospital visits.~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_411229048~“Nice and central”~An overnight stay in Brisbane for work, quite small good equiped kitchen and a shopping centre at the end of the road. Balcony was good although the area quite noisy with lots of construction nearby. Bed was good, the shower is over a very deep round bath and if your not very adgile this could be an issue. Also no ice in the ice trays, always not good with a one night stay.~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_384816308~“Great customer service”~Stayed here while my mum was in icu at the hospital. After travelling up from Melbourne due to an emergency And having to find somewhere to stay last minute. Read the reviews but nobody seemed to say how wonderful and accommodating the staff here were. They went out of their way to help, at a time when I didn't need any stress. The rooms were just what we needed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_360268684~“Cheap and not luxury, but friendly, clean and neat.”~Stayed here with my parents as dad had minor surgery. Small for 3 people and no privacy for 3. But that's ok it was clean, neat and tidy. Really lovely, friendly service.  I give it 4 stars because it's worth 4 stars in its class. It didn't pretend to be more than it is. I respect that honesty. They care for your wellbeing which is nice too.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_234699494~“Best Value Apartments in Brisbane”~We were very impressed after our recent stay at Alexandra Serviced Apartments. The Staff were friendly, Room was clean and spacious and fully self contained. Fantastic value - close to the shopping centre and to the Brisbane CBD, and right opposite the PA hospital. Well done team. We will definitely stay there next time.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_205453391~“Adequate though a little dated”~We recently stayed for 4 nights in one of the newer rooms at the rear of the complex (thank you to a Trip Advisor contributor for this tip!). The location was perfect as we needed to be close to the Princess Alexandra Hospital & it was just across the road. The room was clean & had a kitchenette & laundry which we definitely needed. The shower was an odd combination of a sitz bath which made showering a little tricky. The twin beds had minds of their own & moved whenever we lent on the head boards or even just sat on them. However the prices were very reasonable & even though the complex had a bit of an air of a 1980's motel, it was comfortable enough for us initially.We did move to a more upmarket ( & more expensive!) option across the street eventually. It was worth the extra...~3~4~4~3~3~4~3~nan
review_198852619~“Excellent service, price and rooms”~After reading some of the reviews here i was a bit worried, but found the service, rooms and price all excellent. Very roomy and plenty of space with all that you could need for a very comfortable stay here. Bed was great and everything was very clean. I will be definitely staying there again. Just a tip for others, ask for one of the back newer apartments. I was very happy.~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_198257840~“Great Stay”~A younger sibling was in hospital for a kidney transplant in late last year/early this year. The hospital staff had recommended this accommodation to me. We stayed there for 2months and during that time we were looked after very well, We even had mail sent to us from family and friends from home. For anyone that doesn't have family or friends and don't have a great deal of money, I would recommend this place. We enjoyed our stay very much.( we stayed in the rear block.). Everything was located within walking distance. The apartment that I shared with my sibling was very comfortable. It served and suited our purposes and needs very well.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_192448788~“If you want to stay In this place, read this.”~This place is absolutely disgusting. My sick mother who had just gone through a kidney transplant was offered to stay here through government subsidy which we thought oh hell yeah! So we came to visit her and was horrified. The place smelt like they were trying to cover up the smell of death, it is as old as a dinosaur and hasn't been updating since Elvis was born. It is of such poor quality that jail would have been a better choice! The place is a horrible colour smell and feel. Exposed brick, felt like the elevator was going to break, car park was like a pedo basement, rooms tiny as, everything so so old it was just uncomfortable, depressing and horrible. Then when I had to move my mother to the pa apartments across the road which are lovely by the way, the owner was an absolute cock and was in no way being customer orientated, just disappointed that the money was no longer going into his greasy hands.  Hope the place burns to the ground. Just awful. Please don't ever burden yourself to stay there.~1~1~3~nan~1~3~1~nan
review_186586256~“great stay”~I stayed at the apartments (rear block) for 4 days, and I was surprised when I opened the door. After reading the reviews on here, I was hesitant of what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Room was clean, and crisp. white sheets, that smelt fresh, the kitchen was clean and fresh. When turning on the aircon, I thought it would be stinky, but it was fresh. It had a spacious clean bathroom, with washing machine and dryer. Efficient clothes storage, with spare pillows and blankets, which were also clean and fresh. There are many lights to choose from so you can set your own mood, and a table to eat at or to use the computer. there is a lounge, and tv which had all your free to air channels, plus 6 fox channels. The apartments are private, and quiet. It is off Ipswich road, and during the day you can hear the cars and trucks, and at night, the ambulences, but it is right across the road from the Princess Alexandra Hospital, so you would expect a certain level of noise. if inside, with the tv on and aircon, it soon blocks out. The best part about these apartments, is that its so close to the shops, including woolworths, burunda shopping village, cafes, newsagents, bakery, and lucky7. The Bus stop is right out the front of the PA hospital, and the buses come so often, it is extremely easy to get too and from the city. I rate this 5/5 and if had to stay down here again for health treatment, this is the place to be.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_181540858~“Great location for Hospital outpatients”~My wife and I have recently returned from a 6 week stay at the Apartments (rear block) as I was having treatment at the PA hospital. We found the apartments to be clean, modern and well positioned to the Hospital across the road, shopping centre with places to dine. The city is close by with a bus stop out the front and they have off street parking.The staff are friendly and happy to help you if needed.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_167904865~“Great value”~I'm surprised by some of the previous reviews, because my experience couldn't have been better. Dennis bent over backwards to help me get accommodation on short notice. The unit was fully self contained, clean and tidy, and extremely handy to the hospital. Excellent value for money, considering I was charged $200 per night at an apartment near by. They even let me leave my car there after I had checked out, so I could visit my husband in the hospital. Would gladly stay here again. Many thanks~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_164543290~“Cancelled My Room 2 Days Before Arriving!”~I ran to confirm room configuration and was asked the purpose of my visit. When I said that I was visiting for a sporting event I was told the room was no longer available. Even though the room had been previously confirmed room and taken credit card details. Unbelievably rude and unprofessional  After reading some of the reviews looks like i dodged a bullet... Makes Fawlty Towers look impressive. STAY AWAY.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_132815765~“Demolish front apartments”~Hospital booked my room, my husband planned to hang around and have dinner with me, but after seeing the standard of the room, he decided he would rather sit in peak hour traffic and headed back to the Gold Coast. He informed family that I was staying in 2 star accommodation and he hasn't seen accomodation that bad in Asia. I had 3 single beds in the room, one of which was pushed up against a small square dining table. The hallway inside the apartment looked like the outside of an old apartment block, no bed head, to watch tv or read you had to rest your head against a concrete wall, not even a bedside lamp, the tiled wall in the bathroom, was cracked from the door way round to the shower. The lift area is appalling, It is the oldest looking place I have ever stayed in, apartments at the back are not as old, but the front needs to be demolished.~1~1~4~nan~1~3~2~nan
review_130936692~“Never been treated so badly.”~My partner was admitted to the PA ICU in critical condition with a life threatening illness. I had thw misfortune of booking accomation at this hotel. I called to book another night on the second morning and booked another night and said I would be over later to pay. It was early afternoon When an employee approached the room where my mother in law had taken respite. The staff member was abusive and aggressive towards her telling her to get out that the room had not been paid for yet despite them taking a credit card swipe previously. As if we were not going through enough we were forced to deal with an aggressive uncompassionate staff member. I attended the office and was fired upon by the same staff member. I have never been spoken too like that before. If your still not convinced about studying her, it cost $124 a night and the room was not cleaned the fridge was broken as was the dryer. and the chairs in the ICU were more comfortable to sleep on than the beds which were rock hard. Absolutely disgusted~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_122167176~“Don't Stay - We have never Treated So Badly”~Relative was suddenly taken to PA and the young girl who answered the phone on the Tuesday right before Christmas was brilliant and very helpful BUT that is where is stopped. The two bedroom apartment was meant to be a cheaper rate if staying more than two nights. We stay 3 but were charged the full rate then moved to two one bedrooms from Christmas Eve to boxing Day, again chargedthe full rate. As they could not accommodate us again in a two bedder until the follwoing week and our realtive had come out of hospital for what was supposed to be two weeks we decided to find something else until the 9th of January and then planned to come back to Apexandra Apartments. That all turned pear shaped when our realitive was suddenly admitted back to hospital on boxing day and his wife spent the night by his side. She called Alexandra Apartments on the Tuesday morning at 8am and asked if her old room was available. It was and had not yet been cleaned and she was happy as she just wanted to sleep the day. Upon arriving she noted that needed toilet paper and saw the cleaners cupboard open, she grabbed a roll then went to find the cleaner to say what she had done. He went off and accused her of Stealing and said if she wanted 5 star service she should go down the road. A bit taken aback she left the paper, went to her room and called management to explain she just wanted some toilet paper and she had been up all night and needed sleep if they could please leave it at the door. The manager then called her back 30 mins later (just as she was about to get some sleep) to say someone was bringing it around. Again she said she would be sleeping please leave at the door. 30 mins later there was a knock on the door which she ignored. Someone then decided it would be a good idea to use the leave blower outsider her room. When she finally got up there was no toilet paper so her son left his dad's bedside at hospital to go to the shop to buy some. I agree with other comments that the rooms are very BEHIND THE TIMES and the TV's are teriible. Yes it is convenient but we found a much better room at Central dockside (2 bedroom with direct river views, undercover parking and much more modern facilities) for $40.00 a night cheaper. Also to top it all off the Manager at Alexandra charged the full rate for the room used Tuesday which had not been cleaned and when we questioned him the following day and advised that he missed out on 3 weeks accomodation at least all he wanted to do was argue. Wish I had read other reviews earlier but it defintalty served the purpose of being close to the hospital. 24 hr reception is a load of rubbishl I actually fell into a deep sleep after being up all the previous night at the PA and my family were worried about me and could not wake me. They went to reception to try and get a key but it was closed so called the number on the door, that was 24/12/11 we are still waiting for a call back. IF YOU HAVE TIME FIND SOMETHING ELSE!!!!~1~1~4~3~1~3~1~nan
review_119242508~“Too expensive not value for money”~The only good thing I can say about our stay there is it is close to the PA Hospital. We stayed there for 2.5 weeks in a 2 bedroom apartment. The apartment was not, in our opinion, a "serviced apartment" . The apartment was serviced once a week (bedding changed, shower curtin changed & floors cleaned) Having ran out of the 2 rolls of supplied toilet paper we were told they only supplied 2 rolls & if we wanted more it was up to us to supply it. The TV was out of date & very small (caravan size) and very poorly placed behind a light . It was usless. There is no secure parking & many times one couldn't get a park due to their shortage of car parks per units.  We shifted there because it looked like my husband was going to be hospitalised. We left an apartment which was within 2k's from the P A Hospital. it was larger, better set out & much cheaper. We had a 2 bedroom apartment, serviced weekly. The serviced included toilet paper & tissues when required & weekly clean (glass doors & mirrors included), general tidy up of the unit, dusting of all the table tops & decorations & bins were emptied every day. There was undercover parking. Would not stay again.~1~1~4~2~2~2~1~nan
review_116461956~“maybe was good place 20 years ago or more”~We stayed there 4 weeks in July. This apartment (had 2 bedrooms, lounge with kitchen) was dark, very humid, bad ventilation. Home electronics looks very old. If they say, that weekly cleaning is foe on Thursday from 9-11.00. Then just don’t be surprised, if change your clothes at 10.00 or you have important phone call, they definitely will enter, cleaning team with 3 or 4 people, and they start to change the bed and clean. And better don’t disturb with your visit or phone call reception, because they have so much work, that you are not welcome.  Probably you know that it is located in very noisy experience, opposite of the street is PA Hospital and helicopters are there very often and they really shake houses. I have travelled a lot, but never had so bad experience.~1~1~nan~1~nan~2~1~nan
review_114694381~“Ipswich Road robbery - beware of excessive telephone charges”~These apartments are located adjacent to the Princess Alexandra apartments and are clean and functional. If you need to be near the PA hospital then this is practical but BEWARE the phone charges they charge customers are in excess of $1.25 per minute and there is no notice advising customers of these high rates - we got slugged with a phone charge bill of close to $46 for 2 local and 5 STD phone calls. When I complained to Mgt they told me I'm the first to ever complain and that the phone rates will be increasing on 1st July 2011 to help absorb costs so beware if you stay here use your mobile it will be cheaper.~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_61637155~“Clean, affordable apartments close to city”~Firstly I will start my review by stating the purpose of my stay here was not for a relaxing holiday. The apartments are located directly across the road from the PA hospital in Brisbane on the Ipswich road. The apartments are not noisy and you can get a good nights sleep. We chose to stay here primarily to visit an ill relative at the hospital. We stayed for 3 nights and have to say that our stay was comfortable and we were happy. From the time I made my enquiry to the time we checked out the service from the helpful staff was excellent. We needed an immediate booking due to the fact a relative had been rushed to the PA and requested a 2 bedroom apartment but unfortunately these were all full but the lady on reception kindly offered to add an extra bed to the one bedroom apartment to accommodate us all. They did not charge for the extra bed for the youngest child. When we arrived the room was clean, and comfortable. The apartments have an older section facing the Ipswich road and newer apartments towards the back. The lower apartments have a small courtyard. Although our room was older and could have had a few items renewed the facilities provided were all adequate. Ie, a kitchen with full oven and fridge, cooking utensils, a shower, washing machine and clothes dryer, clean linen, air con, TV, table and chairs and a roomy balcony with clothesline. There is secured basement parking and also a number of parks on site near the newer block. There is also a common garden area with outdoor table and a BBQ. There is no pool. There seemed to be a number of people staying here that were on holidays, given the affordable price and the fact that it is located so close to the city. The new clem 7 tunnel (city bypass) is very close to the apartments so if you needed to get to northern brisbane it only takes a few minutes and avoids an awful lot of traffic. Public bus access is at your door and the apartments would make suitable accommodation for those not wishing to stay directly in the city. There are a number of good affordable takeaway restaurants within a couple of minutes walk, so too is a Burandah shopping centre. There is a woolworths, target and numerous specialty shops and ATM's here. Wifi is available for a fee. There are also business facilities, foxtel and breakfast is available at an adjoining cafe. There are also apartments for disabled guests.~4~4~3~4~3~4~5~nan
