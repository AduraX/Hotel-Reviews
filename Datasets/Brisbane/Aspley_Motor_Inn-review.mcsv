review_443176076~“Friendly and clean”~Stayed for 1-night and had a good experience. Well designed, clean, everything you need. No dramas, friendly service, nice aircon. Some noise from the road, but it was fine (and I'm a light sleeper). All good. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439615030~“short stay”~we only had an overnight stay we chose Aspley as it was close to the Brisbane Entertainment Center, the room was a good size for a double, clean with nice bathroom a fridge, microwave, tv and air con, the pool was good and the staff very helpful :)~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_404821217~“Basic Clean and Friendly Staff”~Aspley Motor Inn is a small single story, older, style motel. It can be a challenge to find until one realises that it's location is actual on what used to be Gympie Road which runs parallel with the main road now commonly referred to as Gympie Road. A good GPS will short you out. The rooms are well maintained, freshly redecorated and of a reasonable size. House keeping is a bit hit and miss but it appears that vacuuming the floors is now almost a once a week task in many places.  What really impressed us with this place was the friendly staff who did their very best to accommodate your every need. The empathised with their visitors. I would gladly stay here again~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_384173749~“Basic but adequate ”~Stayed for a couple of nights visiting family nearby. We were able to get 2 interconnected rooms, which was nice and helpful. Rooms are fairly basic, but clean and have what you need. Free wifi is always good.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380697210~“Basic, clean, adequate”~I stayed here for one night as part of a business trip. The room was basic with limited amenities but was clean and quite adequate for my short stay. The hot breakfast I ordered was a large serve but was satisfactory. The TV had access to Foxtel which I enjoyed watching. The main road was close but travel noise was minimal. I would stay here again if travelling on business.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_332576349~“Surprisingly very clean, fresh and tidy”~Not much to choose from on the north side of Brisbane but and thought it was a gamble getting an older style hotel. The bathroom was spotlessly white, clean and tidy and the room very clean and presented well.  The front curtain end loop was off and let a little light in from outside which was acceptable, that was it.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_321255621~“Very accommodating”~I stayed one night, very comfortably. The receptionist researched bus timetables for my forward trip and couldn't have been more helpful. I was very happy with this central location. Ten minutes walking to the FABULOUS Chermside Shopping Centre.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_310407708~“Any Port In A Storm”~The experience started with some pretty bad customer service, which was made bearable because the female staff members' behaviour bordered on comical. The room was adequate, bathroom very dated, the poor air conditioner took more than 2 hours to cool the room (summer). If you stayed in this place in the 90's then apart from the TV you would recognise the room. My advice would be to plan your trip better than I did, much better available for the price.~2~nan~2~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_301357563~“A good overnight place in Aspley”~A clean motel that has good rooms and a comfortable bed. If you want somewhere to stay around Aspley then this is a good place. They have a pool here buts more of a plunge pool and not a swimming pool. They also have an outdoor BBQ that you can use and free wifi.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_243906814~“Clean & Comfortable”~Hv stayed several times now as close to the Entertainment Centre. Always greeted by happy friendly staff Room was clean, spacious & comfortable Very quiet with no road noise from Gympie Road. Felt safe and secure staying here with my daughter. Only 5 mins to large shopping centre and convenience of take away food outlets down the road. Will be back~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_243397933~“Clean and Comfortable”~For a two night stay, while visiting our son and family, we found the unit to be both clean and comfortable. Owner was very friendly and most helpful in allowing our bags to kept safe after check out time. If you want a more modern unit/accomodation - look else where and pay more.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_230229346~“Clean and quiet motel”~We booked this motel as it was close to the Entertainment centre and we wanted a bed to sleep in rather than drive over 2hrs home at midnight. It was surprisingly comy. The room had a nice decor, the bed was comfy and just what we needed in a good location right near Gympie rd. It was also quieter than I expected being close to the main road. It also has a pool for the kids to splash around in. Wifi was expensive though at $7.50 an hr ~4~4~5~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_219669461~“Not impressed”~We knew it wasn't going to be flashy and wasn't expecting it to be we just needed somewhere to sleep. I was expecting the room to be cleaned each day especially after I asked for assistance to clean a mess my son made in the bathroom. I would have cleaned it myself but had no cleaning tools.  Beds and pillows not very comfortable.~2~nan~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_209335057~“New owner??”~I think this hotel must have changed hands. The man in reception denied being on Wotif, until I produced my receipt, then tried to put us into a room of lesser value.  We were here for 2 nights, bed was not made or the room cleaned whilst we were there. There are plenty of other motels in the area, we will choose somewhere else in future.~1~3~3~2~3~2~1~nan
review_203280777~“Perfect fit for purpose”~This place is perfect for an overnight stay when you've got an event at the Entertainment Centre or Eaton Hills Hotel - super close cab ride. Wouldn't stay for a holiday but perfect for an overnight stay to save the travel back to the GC for the night. Very friendly manager and breakfast was awesome! Highly recommend and will stay again for our next event.~5~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_184412588~“Just what we needed.”~A good little motel, reasonably priced and well located. Gail, the manager, was very helpful over the phone and as we are not well acquainted with Bris this proved invaluable. Yes it Is a little old & perhaps dated as another reviewer mentioned but it did the job and what was needed. Have no hesitation in recommending the Aspley. If you want flashy, go stay elsewhere, if you want a room that is quiet and a decent sleep well this is the spot. Kylie~4~4~4~4~3~3~4~nan
review_180840486~“Great little Motel”~Used this motel for the Andre Rieu concert saturday night. The motel is clean, quiet with friendly staff. The queen room was adequate, if not a little dated. Good value for the proximity to the Convention Centre and other attractions on the north side of Brisbane.~4~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_179169686~“Affordable, close to shops, great service”~Stayed here as its close to Brisbane Entertainment Centre & Chermside Shopping Centre. Affordable & clean, basic but comfortable. Staff were fantastic & went out of their way to assist with phoning taxi's etc. highly recommended & would stay definately here again.~4~4~4~nan~3~4~5~nan
review_173761018~“Disappointed”~We booked into the Aspley because of the reviews but I have to say we were disappointed. The drape to our room was off it tracks and couldn't be fixed, it was also quite grubby. The room was dated. On the plus side the staff were really helpful and let my son and his partner check in early. It is very noisy from the road. Wouldn't stay there again.~3~3~3~2~2~3~4~nan
review_164951225~“Perfect no fuss accom”~The motor inn is a little bit of a drive from the city centre so is perfect if you have a car. The staff were super friendly and the breakfast did the job. The pub down the road was a great option for dinner.~4~4~2~5~5~5~5~nan
review_151279287~“Comfortable, clean & friendly”~I have stayed twice & have no complaints at all. Air-con worked fine, great pressure in shower, bed comfortable & rooms very clean. Microwave, plates etc all that you need is provided. Just ask & the owners (sorry don't have their names) are a friendly & accommodating couple. Nothing was too much trouble. Late check out did not send them into a spin. It is close to the highway but on a service road & I had no problems with noise & I do sleep lightly. Reasonable distance for all shopping. Pool lovely and clean. I know they are in the process of upgrading the rooms & I think they are doing a great job & the decor is tasteful. Reasonably priced & I will definitely stay there again. I also liked the aspect of a ground floor unit so no need to carry heavy bags upstairs & the car bay is right in front of your room.~4~5~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_143395047~“Affordable and Close to Shops”~When we first arrived our Air conditioner was not working. Managed to get transferred into another room the next night. The cost of the room was acceptable but the cleanliness of the room could have been a bit better ( ie. found toys under bed, used condom wrappers under bed and also in bible...) Staff were friendly. one other thing only one washing machine and one dryer, had to wait along time to wash clothes.~2~4~4~3~3~2~3~nan
review_142153271~“Room for improvement”~Reasonably priced but the units are very small. Comfortable beds but the cleaner could do a better job - grunge round bathroom tap was definitely off putting, and kitchen area slightly grubby. Handy location but on very busy highway making barbecue and pool area virtually unusable because of the noise of cars and trucks. Most disappointing aspect was that after accidentally charging me twice for room, it took them two weeks to repay the money taken from credit card as they said could only transfer couple of hundred a day, and then said some money had been paid into someone else's account. If I had been travelling on somewhere else and relying on credit card, this would have been more than an inconvenience! As it was, having to write daily emails to sort out repayment somewhat took the shine off my holiday.~2~3~4~5~3~2~3~nan
review_141884819~“Selwyn and Pat C”~Very clean and comfortable Meals very good. The manages very freindly and accomadating.Close to the city.Shampoo and conditioner were an added bonus. Hair dryer very good.We wikk definately stay there again.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_141655957~“Fantastic stay.”~The Aspley Motor Inn is located in a handy position if you need a place to stay on your way to the Brisbane airport. The rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. We ordered breakfast for the first time and will again when we stay next. The soap/shampoo dispensers in the bathroom were an appreciated inclusion. Definitely recommended.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_136689618~“Comfortable and clean.”~Great place for a short stay. Very comfortable and clean. Met my needs. Location was handy to services. The Aspley Hotel served a really good meal. It is within walking distance of the motel.I enjoyed having a face washer provided and the body wash in the shower was great.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_133211518~“A Great comfy clean motel to stay in, Definately recommend...”~We have stayed here a few times the last few years twice for a week visit and once for a two night stay...the room had a kitchenette an ensuite and was very clean, we liked they provided tissues, soap for washing hands and a body wash dispenser in the shower...the room was serviced each day and they have reverse cycle air con here so we were warm on our winter visits...they do have an option to buy a hot Breaky if u r keen though we did not try this. The bed was comfy, and the location is great with not much road noise. The main thing I like is how clean the rooms are. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Definately recommend this as a comfy place to stay for budget accomodation.~4~4~5~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_127576135~“friendly”~my husband and I stayed at Aspley Motor Inn recently and we found the rooms to be clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We will definitely be back.~4~3~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_124176819~“Family Room with kitchenette”~Family room is inaccurate - it is the same size as all other units, except with more beds squeezed in. Kitchenette was disappointing, did not have enough room or equipment to be useful. Only 3 chairs to sit on, when 4 of us booked in. Very disappointing and would not recommend for a family. I believe the advertising is misleading.~1~2~3~3~2~3~3~nan
review_123281107~“Like Sleeping on the busy road”~this Motor Inn looks wonderful from the website. Photo shows units have 2 queen sized beds but its not true with all units! Also the Hotel is on a VERY busy highway which is the main road out of Brisbane to the north and has a large volume of heavy traffic all night! we were booked for 5 nights but left after one night with very little sleep. Double glazing may have helped but there was only single glazing which competed with the rattle from the Aircon unit. All together a bad experience.~1~2~1~1~2~2~2~nan
review_122393345~“Out of the way, clean, but tidy”~Aspley is NOT close to Brisebane activities. There are amenities like groceries that are close, but it is a drive to any of the tourist attractions. Service was okay.  Likes: clean, beds okay Dislikes: cooking facilities are tiny, its just a corner with a plug in cooktop or electric skillet, poor location They let us cancel out of the rest of our reservation without charging us, for which I am grateful, but its too small for our family.~3~3~1~3~2~4~3~nan
review_95276593~“Very good value for money”~Everything was a lot better than I expected for the price. Very nice room. The owners were extrememly friendly. Good central location with plenty around. Would definately stay again.~4~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_55041525~“clean, friendly, enjoyable experience”~Aspley Motor Inn is close to lots of things. Chermside shoppping center is just down the road as is the Hypermarket. We caught the bus into the city from outside the motel.  The rooms are clean and tidy, very comfortable and the staff are very friendly. We would definately here again.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
