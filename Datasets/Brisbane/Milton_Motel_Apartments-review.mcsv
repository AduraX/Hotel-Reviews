review_467345767~“Walking distance to suncorp ”~Stayed for an event at the stadium, very close by about 15 minute walk. Train station only 5 minutes walk away and only have to walk a street or two for food or drinks with restaurants just around the corner. They were fairly priced, the best part of the rooms was the washer and dryer inside the room, so convenient and I'm not taking dirty clothes home! But perfect location for anyone traveling to Brisbane for an event at suncorp or just being close to the city. Will be coming back again.  Only downside of unit was the kitchen didn't seem to have a proper splash back it was just some timber at the moment but I think they might be in middle of renos. It was a nice stay~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_428694183~“Fantastic value so close to CBD”~I've been a regular for a few years now. There's no better value for money anywhere near Brisbane CBD. It's more than just a motel room - Sara (reception manager) and her team really make you feel welcome.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_405083225~“Very close to suncorp”~Very pleasant stay with Milton motel apartments. Staff were excellent and helpful.

Great value rooms .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393058452~“Excellent Location and Staff”~I have stayed at this well managed facility on numerous occasions. The staff go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. The location is perfect with a short walk, 200m to Park Road Restaurants. Similar distance to the Milton Station.5 Min train ride and you are in the centre of town. 30 Minutes to the Airport.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389636330~“Great location for Suncorp!”~I booked this hotel for its close location to Suncorp and to go to a wedding at The Gap. Easy walk to Suncorp Stadium to watch a Broncos game on Friday night. Quicker than lining up with the thousands of others for trains. Plenty of restaurants and eateries just around the corner on Park Road. Free parking and good size apartment with everything you need.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_352010590~“Convenient”~The motel is actually three separate buildings. The building with the reception is motel style with small rooms and a very basic kitchenette, the building across the road has apartment style rooms (bigger with better kitchens), have not stayed at the third building, but it looks to be a converted house. Noise is a big issue with the motel and apartment buildings being within 50m of the rail line and 75m from the highway. Pick of the rooms for less noise are the lower floor motel rooms. Mosquitos are an issue at the motel rooms if you leave the bathroom or balcony windows open. There is a convenient IGA across the highway, and heaps of restaurants very close. However the buildings are walking distance to Milton train station, Park Road (restaurant strip) and Suncorp Stadium.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan

review_334081388~“Great value very close to the city!”~We rented a studio apartment for 5 nights. Sarah the new manager, was helpful and always smiling. The room was clean and comfortable. It is only one block from Milton railway station and about a 20 minute walk from the city. You have the use of a pool a short walk down the road as the apartments are actually in 3 different buildings. I would highly recommend this property.~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_328483194~“Conveniently located for Suncorp Stadium but poor, rude service & dirty”~Manager is rude. Instead of being welcoming kept telling us of what would get us kicked out. Apartment was dirty, manager didn't seemed concerned. Rats or some other wildlife crawling around in the ceiling void keeping us awake all night.~2~3~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan
review_322101068~“Convenient location and great value.”~From our first telephone contact with the new manager, Sara, our experience was a very positive one. Sara was very friendly and helpful. The location of the motel was very convenient. Easy access to the Brisbane CBD and other locations. The studio apartment was very clean with lovely crisp linen on the comfortable bed and fluffy soft towels. The kitchenette was adequately stocked. We only stayed overnight but you could easily stay for an extended time here. The free wifi connection was good. Even though the motel is near the railway line we did not hear the trains at all from inside the apartment. It was an short walk to a small supermarket and lots of restaurants. A really great place to stay. I would recommend it to family and friends.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_284095064~“Convenient to Suncorp stadium”~The room while a little dated, was very clean and well equipped. Does overlook the rail line however the noise of trains didn't bother me but maybe I was uber tired. Nice restaurants within walking distance.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_282176711~“Comfortable and well priced”~If you need self contained accommodation near the Brisbane CBD this place is very comfortable. Great food district too.

review_281722850~“BEYOND BAD!!!”~This place is beyond terrible, motel care takers are the most unfriendly people I have ever met and welcomed themselves into our room without asking on several occasions. After an amazing day out in Brisbane we came home to our appartment having been robbed and over $2000 worth of goods taken. The care takers admitted coming into the room after we had left that morning to check if it was clean ( never have I known of an accomdation place to check the cleanliness of a room during the stay of guests, massive invasion of privacy) and they were the last people to see our belongings, however there was no forced entry into the appartment (convenient) so there wasn't much police could do. We got a rude finger and some horrible language upon departure. By far the worst accomdation I have ever stayed at and I have been to several third world countries. DO NOT STAY HERE, even if you have no other option, your car would be better!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_279468123~“Rude, judgmental and unhelpful!”~Both staff members were surly and unfriendly. Neither had any customer service qualities and both were outright rude. Their presonalities overshadowed everything else. Don't stay here unless you have now other option.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_269888877~“Value for money + good location”~Very short walk from Milton train station, cafe and restaurants on Park road, and the Fishery Fish and Chips on Baroona Road (you have to try that).  Room standard goes along with the price ok. Don't expect anything fancy but do expect good space, kitchenette, washer and dryer, own balcony, and a welcoming dog as security guard. Not recommended for party animals, 5-Star travelers. Highly recommenced for long stay. Good price would be around $100 +/- 20~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_265654984~“I think we dodged a bullet on this one”~Upon arrival I was greeted by a dog in reception who did not look that happy. The dodgy looking gentleman who finally came to the desk looked about as happy as the dog. The apartments did not look good at first impression and were directly next to the railway line and looked nothing like what was on the website, however the gentleman advised us that it was very busy because of the football that was at Suncorp and directed us to an apartment block that was about 2 addresses up the road. Upon arrival it was on the top floor and was very spacious an was clean. Close to some great eateries along the main drag of Milton and a little bit of a hike to Suncorp. Our overall stay was not bad however I will not stay here again because my first impression was not a good one and I thought that this is going to be a disaster, and although I am a dog lover I don't think it is appropriate or hygienic to be greeted by mans best friend at the front desk~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan~3~nan
review_262200451~“Great Place to Stay in Brisbane”~Clean tidy accommodation. Rooms have separate bedroom with full kitchens and a nice comfy lounge to kick back and relax at night. Great if you want to cook your own meals or a 2 min walk and you have the choice of a dozen or so restaurants ranging from the best Thai around to Italian. ATM's and liquor shop also only 2min. David has a great sense of humour and will look after you. Really handy to motorways whether you are going North South or West. Very reasonable price with onsite free parking. I stay here every time I come to Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_257551112~“5 Weeks in Brisbane”~I was working in Brisbane for 5 weeks, in Milton. The apartments are a little tired and in need of a facelift. The apartments are a group of 3 buildings and are owned by a construction company, according to the onsite manager. They are used to house workers when they are on projects in Brisbane. The rooms are basic. They arent serviced. Could be cleaner but they are liveable. The manager doesnt come across as overly friendly but once you talk to him a bit he loosens up. Milton has the trendy eating strip of Park Road. There are numerous restaurants of various types and prices. Search around and you can find a decent meal. The apartments were walking distance, for me, to work. The train station is very handy as is buses and taxis. As a place to sleep while working it was okay. For a holiday, i wouldnt recommend it .~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan

review_242160082~“Not bad at all”~Last weekend I had to stay over night in Milton, Brisi. Finding the nearest motel to my destination I checked in the Milton motel apartments without consulting my trip adviser . Only after check in, in my room,I reviewed on trip adviser, the comments of many of my fellow travellers about this motel and it was not good, to say the list. So I looked to see the filth - and could not find any; old painting -and it freshly painted; smelly - not at all. The reception was not overly friendly but harmless. Over all it was a pleasant stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_239396748~“Nice apartment”~We recently stayed in the Milton apartments and for the price we were very pleased with it. It was clean, comfortable and had all we needed. The bathroom is a little on the tight side but that was because they also have a washer and dryer in. The only downside is the trains, you are next to the train line, that's the only reason for the average score. But that also makes you very close to the station to go into the city or Goldcoast, it's about a 5min walk away. Another plus is you are 2min walk away from a variety of restaurants. Just around the corner is a great little bar called Tuk Tuk and attached to it is a lovely Thai restaurant with good food and good prices, but then im from W.A so anywhere is cheaper than here~3~nan~nan~2~4~nan~3~nan
review_238362782~“Not as advertised - Dirty - And Poor Staff”~We booked into Avignon, large spacious room but Dirty floors and walls. Request for cleaning ignored even though they are advertised as serviced. Dodgy body corporate means car parking included is often filled by people not staying in apartment, calls to have sign up to reserve car park ignored. TV remote doesn't work and won't be replaced, The pool is out of order due to filter problem. Everything about this place is sub-par but the service is the worst I've seen in a long time - DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. At $200 per night you can do waaaaaaay better.

review_235438314~“Fantastic value for money”~I was on business for 8 days and stayed in the 1 bedroom apartment. I was very happy with the size and layout. I was originally concerned there was only 1 air conditioner in the living room but it was powerful enough to cool the whole apartment. The bed was a queen size and not those terrible twin singles jammed together. There were extra pillows and blankets in the cupboards. It also has near unlimited free WiFi (50GB/day) and open enough I could use VPN (a lot of Free WiFi's don't allow this!). My only issue was with the mini ironing board - it was very fiddly. All that aside, most importantly - this motel was half the price of the next nearest available motel! I definitely got my money's worth! I've read the other reviews and those who complained about the noise - you know how to use tripadvisor, perhaps you could spend a little more time on google maps? It's next to a train line, what were you expecting - the train to tip toe past your room? And it's easy walking distance from Suncorp Stadium and Park Rd with 3 excellent bars to drink at. You've got to expect some level of noise. If I'm back this way again, I will definitely stay again. Thank you Milton Motel!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_226443567~“Liked it”~I should have written this sooner, so sorry guys. We were there May 2013. The studio was spacious and clean, the laundry facilities were clean and worked fine. We traveled from the US, stayed for nearly three weeks, and booked Milton through Wotif based on their recommendation. The chance to wash our clothes rather than pack three weeks worth was priceless.  We were able to walk to just about anywhere we wanted, including Suncorp for the game. The owner/manager was helpful in describing public transport, and overall, I can't say a bad thing about our experience there.~4~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_220823315~“Terrible”~Booked through agoda, request for a quiet room since I can not sleep well with any noise. Reception is a total monster, never met any Australian people who is rude and unpolitical like him. He gave me a room face to the railway and main road, very loudly even closed the window. I went back to change room, he told me this is the only room available and need to add 40AUD for upgrade to another room. We requested to inspect the room first and allowed to pay more for a quiet one. The reception said no you can not see the room, if you won't like to stay, you can go find other place. Totally rude and without any respect. When I feedback and complaint to agoda, the reception refused to return my deposit and hang up the phone with agoda service.  Agoda refund me the money finally but this hotel is a real joke in Brisbane, how could it survive like this? Do not book it!~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_215869873~“Great Spot - disappointing Quality”~We were booked into this place by a third party for a few days whilst we attended a training course. Right from the minute we arrived, the guy at reception was sarcastic & made us feel that he was there doing us a favour. Having just come off the midnight horror flight from Perth all we wanted was our bed so let it ride. We were given the "penthouse" which you would have thought was the best room in the place. After climbing 3 flights of stairs with heavy suitcases, we opened the door & were greeted by a open planned 2 bedroom room which was dated, in need of a coat of paint & was to say very grubby. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly in a life time & as for the lounge, it was sticky & dirty & the curtains had big stains all over them. There was no tea or coffee supplied as you would normally expect from a self contained room so we had to walk down to the local supermarket to stock up. We were booked in for 4 nights & only heard room service once as they came into the room the morning we arrived. After that we were on our own - 1 towel per person was supplied so thankfully a washing machine & dryer were supplied for which we had to purchase our own detergent. We had to ask for more toilet rolls & washing up detergent. If you have a choice I would not recommend this place as I'm sure there are much nicer, cleaner places available &'they would have I'm sure a more polite & customer friendly receptionist. He is rude & suggestive & doesn't make anyone feel welcome. On a better note - the beds are comfortable & rooms are air conditioned / heated.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_215143733~“Rip Off”~Receptionist very rude, inappropriate and arrogant. Stayed 2 nights and got one towel per person (2 adults1 child) paid for parking and got locked out with no advice of access code and no refund on parking which is in another building across the road. The receptionist is unhelpful and dismissive. He needs a mint cause he has extremely bad breath. The hotel is noisy due to the train next door. Rooms don't get serviced and you get 2 soap that's it. Drab and dirty dated decor. Food crumbs in utensil drawer and mould in the bathroom. Stains on the bed comforter an pillows! Yuk. This motel is a health hazard. Their is also a lingering stench of sewage that permeates up the drains, bathroom and kitchen. He is rude to everyone except the dainty guy who was down the hall.~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_197665018~“Do not understand the bad reviews”~Read the reviews after I hurriedly booked this motel. I felt more than apprehensive but it was a rush trip. I rang the gentleman beforehand because we were going to be quite late arriving. No problem. He was very pleasant over the phone. He stayed up to wait as we arrived one hour after check in. No problem. Loved the position, so close to the city. Rooms were a bit dated but still very clean. We had a small kitchen and lounge, and a decent bed. The balcony was HUGE and we enjoyed sitting out there for a quiet cup of tea and the next morning for breakfast. As for the "dogs" in the foyer, they own one. A small chap called Larry. He is very shy and no problem to anyone. The gentleman running the place was very pleasant to us and we would definitely stay again.~4~4~5~4~3~4~4~nan
review_196097760~“DO NOT STAY HERE!!!”~this place is terrible. It is old, over priced and noisy as it right next to the train line - despite this constant noise we were very rudely told by the owner to stop scrapping our chairs on our balcony and the night just weirder after that!!! It's a long and strange story, he made us feel very uncomfortable! We stayed here as a family and my kids were scared after the owner came and knocked on our door demanding to know why we had put the indoor chairs out on the balcony - the fact that he lived down stairs (with his dog that growled at us on check in) was very intrusive!~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_194560348~“Falsely advertised. Overpriced. Very poor standards overall”~I booked a room here as it was falsely advertised as being a CBD location With a postcode of 4000. It was a $22 taxi fare from the CBD. The apartments are actually located in a suburb of Brisbane called Milton, the postcode is not 4000 it is 4064. The apartments also advertised free Wi-Fi and Foxtel, neither of these things were available in the rooms. When I arrived the management couple were disinterested and Unhelpful. Dogs were roaming the reception area and it was impossible to get from the reception desk to the rooms, the floor was covered in linen, etc. The manager simply told me I would have to wait a few minutes to access my room because he was busy folding the sheets in the middle of the corridor. He had his freshly laundered sheets scattered all over a filthy foyer floor. The apartment was very cramped and poorly set out. There was a strong smell of mould throughout the room. I travel through Brisbane twice every month with work. I booked these apartments through wotif.com. Almost everything listed in their advertisement was false and misleading. I paid approximately $130 for the room, as a regular Traveler I can tell you that these rooms should be priced at approximately $60 per night maximum. I highly recommend that you steer clear of this accommodation option, try the metro apartments or something similar for the same price To avoid disappointment. If you stay here I can almost guarantee that you will feel ripped off and unhappy with your experience in Brisbane. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_192416699~“Great place”~We stay here about 6 times a year for usually one night. This is a really nice quiet place, with everything you really need. We have had various rooms in different buildings and would like to say that the first room we had was one that could have slept 6 people, even though there were only 2 of us. We were not disappointed any of the times we stayed. Although the last one we had didn't have any kitchen area and we went out for a takeaway and had to wash our plates in the bathroom sink. This was not a problem for us at all. But if you are going for more than 1 night make sure you ask for a room with a kitchen area. I love it here and we are already booked for 3 nights in October, and of course we will be visiting throughout the year as well. All the staff are very friendly and helpful.~5~5~5~5~5~5~4~nan
review_188758659~“STAY AWAY - by far the worst hospitality I have ever come across”~Extremely rude when checking in, double charged to credit card and wasn't until checked bank balance that it was noticed, went into our room under false pretences saying there was a fire alarm issue when really he went in to count how many bags we had, switched off air conditioner at switch board so we couldn't turn it on again, rudely asked where we were going every night and what time we'd be back, charged 70 dollars for having extra person in room and didn't know until checked bank balance, called him up to ask what the charge related to and he hung up on me when I was trying to defend myself, rooms were dirty and dog in foyer was extremely unhygienic.

review_187028771~“NOT RELIABLE”~I had a confirmed reservation which stipulated the cancellation policy required 48 hours notice on my part. Imagine my surprise when I got a call on my way to Brisbane asking if I was still coming and when I replied yes, was told the room was no longer available. When questioned, the person on the phone said something about the room being flooded. He referred me to another hotel, further from where I wanted to be and said it was the same price. Imagine my disappointment when I found a small hotel room instead of the well appointed studio with balcony that I had reserved. When questioned, the person at the desk, replied 'alot of hotels are overbooked because the cricket's on this weekend'. The rate at the second hotel was less than the first and I paid it directly. Still waiting to see if a charge from the first hotel appears on my credit card bill.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan

Had issue with this property 4 years ago where he phoned the night before my group arrives to tell me that he is short by 1 2 bedroom apartment. One of the family ended staying in the worst apartment in the property with a bunkbed dumped in the middle of the kitchen!

review_161320565~“Awful Service”~This hotel is convenientantly located and moderately priced for what it is. I have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms can be quite dirty i.e. they need a good dust etc but it doesn't pretend to be anything its not in this regard so that doesn't bother me too much. What does bother me is the owners/proprieters. They are so awful its almost comical. They should not be dealing with the public on any level and are indeed so bad that they would deter people from staying there again.~2~2~4~3~2~2~1~nan
review_158734416~“I would never stay here again.”~We arrived to check in, we weren't greeted, instead we were just askied what name. Our booking wasn't able to be located, even though I had rung earlier in the week to confirm the book. The book was entered under the wrong date even though I had book the right date and asked about that date when confirming. We were asked why we were in Brisbane, we said we were going to see a band, which then prompted a response of "We have a no partying policy here", thinking he was joking I laughed it off saying I didn't know what that means and he replied "no noise after 10pm, I have security".  We finally got to our room, we were SO uncomfortable. I have never felt so unwelcome to stay somewhere. I would say the experience was similar to staying at a family members house who hated you and didn't want you to be staying with them. Except we had to pay to stay here. The room was okay, but not worth the price. I would never stay here again.~1~3~1~3~3~2~1~nan
review_153563107~“Don't even waste your time booking!!”~We booked this hotel for a weekend in Brisbane, we checked in at 7 at night, walked into the front area so called reception, to be greeted by a little dog looking like he was going to bite us. Then the manager dressed in casual clothes with no name badge came out to check us in, we didn't even get greeted with a hello how are you. Nothing. All he asked was for the last name. Handed over a piece of paper and said to sign in. We got to the room key and then he followed us out. He questioned us as to why there was 5 people, we said one was only having drinks for the night but asked what the cost was for an extra person he wouldn't even tell us, he demanded the key back and said he would refund our money, after a heavy argument, we gave the key back and he gave us a refund. I then said how to I get my money back and he said u have to call wot if(the booking site) I rang them, and no refund can be given for 5 working days. What were we meant to do with no money at 8pm in Brisbane. Luckily we had enough money to book a much nicer hotel. Don't even waste time looking at the site for bOoking it. They are very rude! The hotel smells as soon as u walk into reception!~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_151772839~“Avoid at all costs”~Rooms are run down and dirty. Curtains so badly eaten by moths they don't do anything to keep the sun out. Amenities and kitchen utensils are very minimal. Had our room cleaned once in a month stay. The walls are so thin you can hear conversations next door. But what really takes the cake is how rude and unprofessional the manager is. Asked for the simplist things such as toilet paper and he acts as if you are robbing or exploiting him. Is always demanding that you do not use the air con. There are never any carparks available and all the cars parked there are suspiciously all qld plates, never see a rental or interstate plate. When you are a paying guest you expect to be able to use amenities and facilities.~1~1~2~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_147709315~“Couldn't wait to get out of there”~Stayed at the apartments recently and was confronted by the problem of getting a car space and needing to park on the curb side. The motel wasn't fully booked, so I couldn't imagine why a car spot would be so difficult. Manager was rude and reception staff unhelpful. One night stay was enough. I have recommended to my friends that they stay well away from any apartments on Sheehan Street Milton.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_147349867~“Great place to stay”~I stayed here for around 6 weeks in Sept/Oct and was initially concerned because of the comments on Trip Advisor (nearly cancelled). However, I'm pleased I didnt. The place is in a brilliant location, close to the train station (and I didnt find the noise from the train excessive), close to Park Road and Suncorp Stadium. Add to that I had a fantastic city view which I didnt expect from a room at this price! I didnt find the Manager rude at all, he had a sense of humour and we got on really well.  The rooms were very clean and regularly serviced which was something I didnt expect as I was on a longer term stay (other places I've stayed for a number of weeks have been serviced once a week only). For the facilities, the view and the location I would have expected to pay a lot more than I did. One point to note, however, is that there are 3 different buildings in the complex and it appears that they are of different standards & different price ranges. I was staying in St Tropez and would have no problems in recommending this accommdation to anyone.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_146738207~“I had no problem with this motel”~I recently stayed at the Milton for 2 nights. I had no problem with the manager, my booking or my studio. The train noise is not noticable and did not keep me awake, (and I come from the country where there is NO noise at night). Again this looks like people who expect to get Hilton service and facilities without paying for them. The studio was slightly dated. However it was clean and had most things you need to self cater. Maybe some of the folk who found the manager rude or uncommunicative should try talking to him about something he is interested in - he can be quite animated. The Milton is 2 minutes walk from Milton station and 2 train stops from Toowong where there is a good supermarket, etc right at the station.~4~4~5~4~3~4~3~nan
review_146067969~“Attention travellers - do not stay in these appartments.”~We stayed at Milton appartments because it was close to the stadium. The room was not what we expected to say the least. Our air conditioner rattled so loud it kept us awake, the floors looked like they had about 4 years of mould built up, the matress springs dug into our backs and the rooms literally shook every 20 mins when the trains rolled past.  Not only was our stay there dreadful - we were also surprised and shocked to find out that our holding credit cars had been charged an additional $30 for the use of a single bed that was in our room?! (we were not alerted to the fact that this had even occurred until we checked our bank statement).  We found the management to be rude - accusing us of using 7 towels (whe there were only 4 in the room).  Make the choice to stay somewhere else - it will ruin a nice week away.~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_145930184~“Booked hotel 6 months in advance and they lost our reservation”~Terrible customer service.  We booked a room for one night after the Coldplay concert back in July 2012 or November 2012. Got a confirmation number and held our credit card details to secure booking. But alas they lost our reservation booking and couldn't offer us another room to stay. Had to drive 50 mins home that night..... But glad we didn't stay because the facilities and reception office looked like it needed restoration and a revamp because it was dirty and aged! Stay elsewhere not worth your time and money to stay there!!~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
