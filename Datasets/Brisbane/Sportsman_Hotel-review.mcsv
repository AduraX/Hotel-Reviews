review_424841836~“This place has gone to the pack!”~I cannot believe the management of this establishment has young bar stuff and duty managers letting the place go further to the pack. They don't even care about their poor patrons. Last night one patron was left in the toilet (elderly man) needing help and the duty manager walks off and disappears leaving my partner trying to help him. When telling him that he has a duty of care and there's a man in the bathroom needing help he could not give a shambles. Disgraceful and shameful. Considering it was a Monday night and quiet with 10 people in the bar how could you not show care and concern. How can management have such rude and arrogant staff running it. Then when I give the duty manager a good old honesty truth he runs away and calls the police on us his customers. I've been coming to this place for a few years but simply they don't care about their community.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380631232~“Bangers & Mash ... great food!”~I was looking for a quick pub meal and found this establishment. What a gem! $10 for two bangers, heaps of mash potato and well cooked veges to boot! The atmosphere in the sit down area (not the public bar) is good considering it's a hotel. Interesting surrounds and clients. I'll definitely be back ... maybe again tonight! I've given the rooms and sleep quality mid-range rating as I've no choice but didn't sleep here.~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan~4~nan
review_362906897~“Brisbane bar and restaurant servicing GLBT clientele”~The Sportsman Hotel is one of the few bars servicing GLBT clientele. The front bar features a few pool tables, video DJ where you can choose your own music 14 poker machines out the back; although the pokies are a bit dated. The restaurant bar serves dinner until 9PM that are very reasonably priced and have a reasonable range ; the schnitzels we had were great. On Saturday's they have drag shows at 10:30PM, midnight and 1/1:30AM. Downstairs is the mineshaft bar servicing those with leather and other fetishes and often host specialised parties, the Underbear party is on 15 April (undersea only party).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_329313189~“Great old spot”~Used to drink here regularly years ago. Have moved away - little has changed. BUT it's a good place for a drink & a nice bistro meal. It's a great old gay bar. Most clientele are between late twenties & death. If your not a twink & want a comfortable place for a drink I would recommend The Sporties - A Brisbane Gay Institution!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_321741737~“Spring Hill's Best”~We enjoy a drink at the Sporties and catching. up with our mates every time we visit Brisbane. Great pub to have a meal at for lunch and dinner and to catch a Floor Show. Plus they do have Overnight Budget Rooms.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_281517146~“A great pity they don't try at all.”~Conveniently located, but sadly a bit of noise from the surroundings both from downstairs (expected in a room over a pub) and outside the building from industry? Room fittings are reasonable. Overall impression: cheap but not especially cheerful.. But the devil is in the detail. The TV in the common room (none in rooms) seems to only receive Channel 9 & derivatives and then often poorly, so meaning I had to watch Today show this morning, which so far makes 7's Sunrise seem directed at intellectuals (it's not).. This is while eating dry toast since the claimed butter, vegemite and jam is not in evidence for the second day in a row (don't know about the first day since I was taken out for breakky). & only coffee, no tea bags. This is after being woken up by someone banging around in the next door bathroom/laundry.. turns out the bar mats from downstairs need washing at 7.30am (not normally a problem but with less sleep than I'd like for reasons that I won't go into but were not good news unfortunately let's say I didn't appreciate the noise).. Then there's the communal bathroom which has no working lights bar one shared between two toilets a few metres away. After sundown you need to shower by Braille. Except that the water coming out is minimal to start with (hint: set the nozzle to blast and at least you can then feel it). Maybe the sign telling you Brisbane is on Level 6 water restrictions has also meant they've restrict water flow (I don't think it is L6 anymore). A few minor fixes and it would be at least great location and value. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_198411195~“Dingey..”~This hotel has been serving its core clientele for donkey's years and it shows it! Atmosphere was pretty good, relaxed and friendly, but they need to spend money on the facilities fast! The place is a bit grubby, old and worn out. I'd hate to see what it's like with the lights on! Refurbishment required otherwise not a bad spot!~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~nan~nan
review_179010708~“Bed bugs”~Noisy rooms above pub after lock out idiots roaming around yelling out public urination rooms were small communal shower long walk down hallway for a pee at 3am lol bed bugs in most rooms go elsewhere if u wanna sleep or survive~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_176942028~“Good for ...”~Stayed here twice, nothing changed for the last couple of years. Room was average bit small, sharing showers was awful. NOT suitable for family. But great location, walk-able to train station. You paying for a beer don't expect taste like a champagne! Good for emergency stop over.~3~2~4~2~2~2~2~nan

review_156640053~“Stay away stay away from this DUMP”~The crust and grunge that covers this place will be for archeologists to figure out. I have never seen a more filthy, poorly maintained place being offered travellers in my life. Everybody there is so Indifferent to ..name the topic.. The kitchen is filthy. The showers spit water at you. And the critters have taken over. It is odd how nobody seems to know nor care about Pride. Was I meant to say gay before that. Save your money go elsewhere.~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_145364372~“Poor but somehow cool”~The hotel is very gloomy, infact it is not a hotel it is more like a prison/hostel/place to crash! However there is a porn film feel to it that if you have a bit of fantasy you can kind of enjoy it. All communal bathrooms here and be prepared to have Lady Gaga banging through the floor all night. If you can stand that and get to sleep after surviving gloom then the place is fine. Do not come here expecting a cozy gay place as this if far from it. No internet here and no breakfast. You do not get what you pay for and generally i would not recommend staying here. On my arrival i found a used condom in my bedside draw. Not for everyone but seriously some people like this kind of thing xxx~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan

review_52066562~“Grubby and rude staff”~I was looking forward to staying here as the location is so convenient to so much that Brisbane has to offer. I put my luggage in the room, and at the time was thinking that the place seemed a bit grubby but thought it would it do for my short stay in Brisbane. Getting back around midnight I was horrified to observe some very unwelcome insects crawling over the bed. Wondering what I should do I finally decided to go down to the local 24 hr store and buy insectide and dowse the bed with it (still got severely bitten), and put my luggage into garbage bags and gas those as well. In the morning I talked with the manager who seemed quite sympathetic, however, as he wasn't the owner he had doubts about whether the problem would be fixed, although he said I should get a refund. I cancelled my final nights stay and couldn't wait to get out of the place! On leaving I went to claim a refund but was met with a different and very rude staff member who not only refused to refund me but was also abusive. I would NEVER stay in this place again and urge others to stay well clear.~1~1~5~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_50597956~“Great for what it is.”~I agree with the previous review.  The Staff are great and I felt safe and comfortable.  The place is very basic but clean and is very real retro which I liked.  The rates are great.~4~5~5~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_3279685~“Cheap and Basic”~The Sportsman Hotel is a gay/lesbian hotel/pub in Spring Hill, conveniently located within walking distance to the CBD. The accommodation is VERY basic - all rooms are dark, small and with share facilities. The toilets/showers are reasonably well maintained, but are old and in desperate need of refurbishment. The only advantage I could see in staying here would be if you wanted to party at the pub (the Sportsman is a popular night-time venue, with drag shows, disco etc) you can stumble up the stairs to crash for the night. The hotel offers reasonably-priced pub meals for lunch and dinner, and you can help yourself to toast/cereal etc from the lounge room for breakfast. The staff are friendly and the tariff is cheap. Brisbane sadly lacks exclusively-gay accommodation options - so if you feel that you'd only be comfortable staying in a gay establishment, the 'Sporty' serves its purpose.~2~4~nan~nan~2~2~3~nan
