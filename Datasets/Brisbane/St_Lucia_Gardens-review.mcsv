review_427991783~“Simple and cheap”~Well priced apartments near enough to the university with around half an hour walk. Otherwise not that conveniently located other than a short distance to river cat stop.  Rooms were very basic, slightly dusty and musty so needs some airing. Showers a bit old but worked well enough with some adjustments. Toilet Cosy with knees banging into cabinet for those on the talk side. Equipped with enough amenities to make a good value long term stay - kitchenette laundry and balcony.  Good arrival and after hours instructions. There are hire bikes located just outside and close to good cycle routes.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362927764~“Value for money”~Location is close to river, Toowong shops, University of Qld and transport. A little dated and basic but clean, comfortable and staff were friendly. The pool is small but has an added feature of water dragons. Under cover carparking was an unexpected bonus. Definitely value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_272633452~“Clean and spacious accommodation”~This place offers a great value. The room is big and tidy. All furniture and utensils are in good condition. Beds are clean and comfy. Easy access to the precinct 24 hour. Lots of facilities including laundry and dryer. The location is near UQ, so it is suitable if you are attending an event in the university. But it is also close to the train station so basically you can go anywhere from this place easily, especially the city. The wifi is not free though. If you book from the web, the check in and check out procedure is extremely easy, it just takes seconds. Also if you are planning to check out late outside the service hour (7am/8am on holiday-6pm), make sure to notify the motel so a very easy late check in procedure could be arranged for you. Then, you can check in anytime you want event in the middle of the night.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_245588953~“convenient location and helpful host”~A conveniently located motel to university, rivercat, hotels, cafes, buses and shops. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Pool was small but well prepared, clean and refreshing. Helpful host able to advise on dining options, driving directions and facilitate the collection of a parcel. Not modern but neat, clean, welcoming. New appliances in rooms. Well priced in a capital city market.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_234850633~“Basic”~Little more dated than I expected. Very basic furnishings and kitchen equipment - unmatched china - the only table you could eat at was used as TV stand. OK for a short stay but would be impractical for a long one. Nicest touch was breakfast for our first morning - most unexpected and helpful with a late arrival. Close to Toowong Village for shopping and eating out. I was here for Uni conference so it was handy.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_196471045~“Good Value”~Stayed here while getting my daughter settled at Uni of QLD last month and it was worth it. The apartment was clean the room was comfortable and the owners were very helpful and accomodating. Linda even gave me a larger pot to hold the chili I was making for my daughter.  The location was good as it was close to a major plaza ehere we could find groceries and supplies. The bus went right by and the citycat ferry was about a 15min walk away as was the train station and plaza. Be warned that taxi's and buses are not cheap the buses and ferries charge by zones although you have a 2hr window to transfer and use your ticket once purchased.~4~4~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_174606866~“Amazing Service; Very convenient location!”~My family and I stayed at St. Lucia Gardens last weekend while we were up in Brisbane for our son's 21st.We arrived in town early and when I called to see if we could drop our bags in, Linda said to just come around and check-in. She and Tony were the best hosts we've had in Brisbane! We locked ourselves out on our first night and Tony really went out of his way to help us get back in. The room was very neat and clean with extra towels and a continental breakfast with a litre of real milk :-). There is a citylink bike rack right out front and we used them to get around Brissie all weekend. Honestly, one of the best overall family weekends!~5~5~5~4~4~5~5~nan
review_166493081~“Superfriendly management and nice apartments”~I have stayed in St Lucia Gardens several times now. This was my first stay since St Lucia Gardens has come under new management.  Well, the new management is possibly even friendlier than the previous ones. They are happy to help with anything (as long as you come during office hours ;-).  The apartments are tidy and well equipped. Perfect for one person or a couple.  The bathroom is rather small, but I don't need much bathroom place. I particularly like that they have doonas rather than blankets on the bed. Mattress and pillows are of good quality.  The living room is cosy and inviting enough to spend the evening.  The kitchen has everything one needs for a few days cooking - as long as you don't mind cooking on electricity. St Lucia Gardens is a 5 minute walk from Toowong Shopping centre, where you will find all you need. Toowong Station is a 5 minute walk as well, bus stops are next to the Apartments.  This is an ideal location for people working at UQ, as it is only 20min walk to UQ or a direct bus trip.  My favourite place to stay when working at UQ or CSIRO in Brisbane.~4~4~3~4~3~3~5~nan
review_153592020~“Relatively convenient”~I stayed at this apartment with my wife during Feb 2013. Although the unit is next to Gailey Road, it was not that noisy at night. The bed was comfortable, although the toilet could be better designed. Overall, the place is quite nice for a stay, and they have provided 2 bottles of orange juice, a packet of fresh milk and some cereals free of charge for breakfast for the first morning, a very kind gesture. Furthermore, the staff in charge Steve and a lady (pardon me for not getting her name) are very friendly, and willingly share their knowledge of the surrounding areas (shopping, what bus to take, etc.). If I were to visit Brisbane again, I would definitely consider this as one of my first choice.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_153015930~“Handy to University”~We have stayed at this venue on numerous times over the years. It is very handy to UQ and handy to Toowong shopping village and also public transport if you need it. Has everything you need for an extended stay, although the units are starting to look a bit tired and in need of a spruce, however the bed was excellent and shower nozzle great. Bathroom/toilet combined is very tiny. air conditioning is only in the separate bedroom and it did not appear to reach the other living space. Verandas front and back were nice. Can be noisy if you have doors and windows open, however hard to beat for good value for longer term accommodation close to UQ. Secure car park at night gives you peace of mind too. Managers friendly and complimentary first breakfast left in our fridge was appreciated. Cereal, fresh milk and orange juice.~4~5~5~4~3~5~5~nan
review_152936462~“Clean and tidy apartment with very good customer service”~Great location with bus stops on the doorstep. Walking distance to nearby Toowing Shopping Centre and the Regatta city cat pier. Very convenient for travellingl to UQ with my daughter. Very good customer service . Special thanks to Arthur, the reliefing manager and also Ann and Steive, of course. Room was spacious, clean, tidy and well furnished. The only thing that needs improvement is the dryer. It stops at 10 minutes intervals. I stayed here for three weeks. Will come again.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_144208706~“Good location to uni and Brisbane”~Not utra modern but very comfortable with full kitchen facilities. Good for longer term stay. Handy location. Friendly enough staff. Parking underneath. We stayed here to attend wedding at St Lucia gold course which is just down the road.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_143973024~“Hit and miss”~Good location, very easy to find. Clean and tidy although our apartment was looking a bit old and could do with some sprucing. A few negatives though - not enough towels were provided for number of people booked, bathroom is extremely tiny and the carpark is cramped and hard to manouver in a large car...just small things I know. The most annoying thing for us was a building flaw that nothing could be done about, when I rang and booked I specifically asked if the door between the bedroom and remainder of the apartment closed as there is an issue with snoring.....lol......it wasn't until much later in the evening that we discovered that the door did not fully close, sure the bottom met but there was a 20cm + gap at the top, some part of that door is not square....so this might be trivial to some or many but it was a huge negative affected our stay at this premises.~2~3~4~2~2~3~3~nan

review_121169113~“Superb location, excellent service, clean apartments”~I have stayed here several times when I have had to work at Universtiy of Queensland for several weeks at a time.The apartments are a very good size - bedroom, kitchen and living area and are very clean. Location is great - only a 20 minute walk to uni, or there is a bus stop literally at the front door that takes 5 minutes to UQ. Ten minute walk to the Brisbane ferry. The owners are very helpful and welcoming, even providing cereal and juice for my first few days because they knew I would not have time to go to the shop when I arrived. Also they were very helpful in providing alternate accommodation for me when my stay had to be extended but they were booked out. Highly recommended.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_120441751~“Excellent location and very friendly service”~I remember when St.Lucia Gardens was build, and we often had visitors stay there but this was my first stay there and I got exactly what I expected, great service and very comfortable place to stay. Arthur, the manager is very friendly and was very helpful, a short talk with him makes you feel better even on the worst day. The property is located very conveniently, 5 minute walk from Toowong village, where you find grocery stores (including the famous Fruity Capers with the best mangos when they are in season), post office, library, K-mart, bottle shops, restaurants, train station, bus stops. A bit longer walk for those wanting to take the City Cat ferry or a much shorter for those wanting to catch a bus to UQ, the bus stop to UQ is just outside the gate. If you are there on holidays, you can walk along the river to the city, bike along the river or go for a run. There is plenty to do around, Arthur can help you find your way around if you are a visitor to Brisbane.  The biggest surprise to me was a very good wireless internet connection, better than in Germany or Holland and sensibly priced. Rooms are spacious and kitchen well equipped to cook what you desire. I loved staying at St Lucia Gardens, the location and quality make it great value for money and I definitely understand now why all out visitors to UQ wanted to always stay there.~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_120399533~“Great value for those on business with UQ”~Twice now I have visited Brisbane on business with the University of Queensland - both times I have stayed at St Lucia Gardens, and I would definitely do so again. The property is very convenient to UQ with a bus stop just outside the gates and very frequent service to the university. Shops / cafes of Toowong - including a supermarket, kmart, a great deli (Fruity Capers), good curry (at Ceylon Inn), etc - are a 5min walk away. A 10 min walk will get you to a pedestrian/cycle path along the beautiful Brisbane River and the City Cat ferry stop (Regatta). Wireless internet is available for nominal fee and is high quality. The rooms are spacious and clean with kitchenettes (that are thoughtfully stocked with heathy breakfast supplies and fresh fruit!) The beds and pillows are very comforable and fresh thick white towels a plus. The manager Arthur is very friendly and extremely accomodating - I was allowed to check in early which was a lifesaver after a long-haul flight from London. The location, comfort and quality make St Lucia Gardens an outstanding value and it's my first choice for accomodation in Brisbane.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_119775101~“Excellent value and location”~Stayed here the night before my wedding as the location and cost were v good Rarely do you find such a lovely couple (Arthur & Pene) who were very accomodating, allowing a late checkout and the professional photographer access to the well trimmed garden areas. Thanks for the pleasant stay ! Best regards Robbie from London~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_119531083~“Spacious and comfortable”~Excellent spot when needing to attend UQ. I've stayed here a couple of times now and I'm very happy to know there's a place to go to when coming up for work to UQ.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_118778552~“Convenient and clean, but lacking in some areas”~Rooms are well equipped, but everything felt quite dated and old-fashioned. Nevertheless, the bed was very comfy and the air conditioning worked perfectly. The kitchen was also very well equipped, although I'm not so sure about the "continental breakfast"...! Sachets of cereal and milk wasn't quite what I expected. For a hotel which is often used by those visiting UQ, the wifi service was very poor. It is far too expensive for this day and age, although prices seem to be similar across Australia, so perhaps it's not the hotel's fault.~3~nan~3~5~4~4~4~nan
review_118683567~“Great place to stay”~Perfect place to stay for a few days or weeks. I stayed at St Lucia gardens during a time in which it was fully booked and was very impressed with the great, friendly, helpful service and the tidy rooms and gardens. There was little noise from other guests and the rooms were spacious, well equipped and reasonably priced. Would definitely stay again~4~4~4~4~5~4~4~nan
review_118140911~“Great value, close to UQ”~I stay at St Lucia Gardens every time I visit UQ, which is several times a year, sometimes for several weeks at a time. I never even bother looking for another place because I'm always happy with the room, the service, and the location. The proximity to UQ is a top selling point, along with the reasonable rates and great staff. In fact, the new management (as of early 2011) is top-notch: helpful, friendly, considerate, and accommodating.~4~5~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_117695436~“Very nice, very clean.”~A lovely self service apartment, very clean. Very nice kitchen area, close to the ferry and the bus and train station with Toowong mall not 10 minutes walk away. On the corner though, so a bit noisy. Nice accommodation at a very good price.~4~5~nan~4~nan~5~3~nan
review_117694472~“The Perfect Welcome to Brisbane”~My wife and I stayed here for two weeks at the beginning of August as we looked for an apartment in Brisbane. I had just accepted a job at UQ, and my employers put us in the St Lucia Gardens for two weeks. It was a perfect set-up. The place was clean, the bed comfortable, and the kitchen had everything you needed. Arthur and Pene made us feel welcome and accommodated our every request. For anyone with business at UQ or in Toowong, I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay, especially if you're looking to have a kitchenette in your place.~4~4~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan
review_117482525~“Very clean, flexible and friendly”~I have stayed here twice: the last time for four weeks so obviously I think it is excellent. My flat was 100%clean and Arthur was always helpful, flexible and friendly. The flat was cleaned twice a week and I got new fluffy towels and linens provided. The washer and drier always worked perfectly. AC for cooling and heating were fine. The water dragons are great fun. The balconies are lovely and the location is very handy for UQ and just 5-minutes on foot from the shops and train line at Toowong village. However, Brisbane is mostly suburbia so go to Sydney if you want wild nightlife.  Once I retuned the TV to get all the digital channels. Another time, my shower door was slightly knocked off tis runners when it had been cleaned and I had to hook it on again which took less than 10 seconds so obviously the showers are not perfect~4~4~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_117446072~“They were so kind!”~I stayed for a month because I had classes at UQ for a month. I stayed alone so there was a lot of space for me, manager was so kind. It was close to shopping mall and to the university, bus stop was right in front of the apartment. It was really a comfortable stay. Thanks!~4~3~4~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_116694086~“Great location and very affordable”~I found St Lucia Gardens to be a very convenient place to stay whilst attending my course at the University of Queensland, Brisbane campus. I was within walking distance to the shops and the University. The rooms were clean, the staff were very helpful whenever assistance was required, and I could not fault the service provided. I would definitely stay at St Lucia Gardens again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_116190212~“KISS - Keep it Simple”~I regually travel back and forth between Adelaide and Brisbane. in the last 8 months, I began staying at some of the 4 star hotels around South Brisbane and inner Brisbane. What I found was high rates and average service levels for the price paid. Carparking was also extra and always an issue to find one.  So I decided to look elsewhere, but with the requirement to be within 15 minutes of the city. I came upon St Lucia Gardens, which had a very competative price range for serviced apartment. While being rated as 3 star, the fully equipped kitchen, reasonably large layout and balconies at both ends of apartment is at this cost plus is great value. Also being within 15 min of the city, allowing for easy comuting gives my complete thumbs up. The manager in charge has ensured we are well looked after, storing items whilst absent for days at a time and also ensuring we have forward bookings available. My first stay several months ago, I was greeted at the BBQ area, handed a plate of cooked BBQ meat and salad, prepared by overseas University lectureres and sat down for a great meal and red wine... It is what it is, quite simple and effective, with the management making no bones about trying to be anything different.  Those looking for 4 star requirements at exporbanent prices and not wanting the simple things, can please themselves and stay elsewhere. No use complaining about these simple things...~4~5~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_116143484~“I'll be back”~After reading some earlier very critical reviews I still decided to take the risk...and booked for one night on 8th July 2011. I flew up from Sydney for business and to visit my son who is studying at UQ. St Lucia Gardens exceeded my expectations; it has everything necessary for a good night rest. Car parking and breakfast are included in the price. The place is clean, quiet and friendly and good value. I am a frequent traveller in and out of Australia and based on my experience, I am happy to recommend it to anyone. I asked my wife and her mum who will also be visiting soon to make sure she books at St Lucia Gardens. Thank you!~4~5~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_115997962~“Everything that you could need for your stay at great value!”~Myself and my partner booked in here for one week but ended up staying for two weeks while we were looking for somewhere to live. We found the owners to be most helpful and friendly - they could not do enough for us! The apartment was spotless and contained everything that you could need - a sort of home from home! It is in a great location with bus stops to city and UQ just outside the door, and the ferry terminal just a short walk away. Even when we were leaving the owner was most accommodating and allowed us to store our surf boards and over sized items while we arranged a van to transport the items. All in all I would highly recommend St Lucia Gardens.~5~5~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_114610205~“Don't trust them”~I stayed at this place as I had work at the University of Queensland for a month. On departure, the manager wasn't on duty, and was given the invoice by relief staff. The daily rate that was charged was not the rate that the manager has agreed to when I placed the reservation. On good faith I paid the bill and the manager said that he would follow up with the manager on his return. He never did. Phoned up and spoke to the manager. He declined to refund the overcharged amount.  If you do negotiate a better price make sure that you get it in writing from them, otherwise they will double cross you like they did me. Quality of service etc etc not relevant as they are hosts that you should not trust. Hot water unavailable for 24 hours when the hot water system blew up.~1~1~nan~1~nan~1~1~nan
review_109261102~“not worth the money”~no shampoo and conditioner, room was not serviced, "two bedroom" was just the one bedroom with another bed in the loungeroom, $40 charge applied if the dishes were not cleaned. the pool was tiny. overall i'd rather just stay somewhere else.~2~1~2~1~1~3~1~nan
review_103022263~“Welcoming and comfortable”~We stayed at St Lucia Gardens for three weeks in a one-bedroom apartment. We were comfortable and the facilities were fine. The owners - Arthur and Pene - are very friendly and welcoming. We had chosen St Lucia Gardens because it is 10 minutes walk away from my daughter and little granddaughter, who came by our apartment, and were also made welcome. We would definitely chose St Lucia Gardens again.~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
