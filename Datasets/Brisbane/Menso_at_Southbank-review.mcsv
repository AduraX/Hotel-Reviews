review_473270552~“I am staying again”~Roof top pool, basic gym, views and lounging. Room was very clean and comfortable. 2 block walk to Brisbane's South bank and all up it took me 10 minutes to walk to Queen Street Mall. Free wifi allowed me to work as well and to keep my teenager happy while I worked. Customer service was excellent. Very helpful, polite and accommodating front desk.~5~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_470457118~“Greath Location for South Bank Parklands”~Stayed at this hotel which is only a 5 minute walk to the South Bank parklands and little Stanley Street. Hotel and room were very clean and well set up for an extended stay. We had a one bedroom apartment on the 7th floor. The apartment was very private. Would stay there again. The only negatives are, no parking at the front of the hotel for drop off and the pool needs a good clean.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470211724~“A mixed bag”~Neat, if small apartment.  Well priced. Free wifi.  Our apartment was on the first floor, with a balcony that looks across to a pretty church. Clean, modern, nicely set out, newly furbished, lots of mirrors, small table and 2 chairs for meals. Nice size balcony, but there is a busy street below. Comfortable bed, kitchenette includes bar fridge, single drawer dishwasher, and small oven and 2-plate cooktop.  I couldn't get the fridge cupboard door open; it was stiff or stuck and I had to ask my husband to open it.  There are blackout curtains, which work fairly well and are a good feature. The TV standby light was so bright and awkwardly placed, we had to pull the plug out.  Most of the negative points would be an easy fix, such as ensuring service is completed between 'lets'. Upon arrival, our bathroom towels were clearly used. A better housekeeping checklist might address this.  However, the biggest problem was that there is nowhere to park when you arrive, before you can register you cannot access the underground parking. I'm not sure how best to handle the problem; we pulled in to the next door apartment parking (a tow-away area for non-residents' cars) and I waited in the car while my husband registered. There seemed no alternative we could see. The hotel is in a high traffic area, close to a busy corner and there is minimal street parking. The whole time we stayed, we didn't see a street parking space available. Also, you need to be ready to pull in as soon as you turn at the last set of traffic lights.    The bathroom may appeal to some people but we had several issues with it:  1. glass doors and side panel - there is some frosting with clear glass slots, but everything is visible, including the toilet  2. the mirrored cupboard above the sink is so deep we couldn't properly use the sink to do more than wash our hands. Washing my face wasn't possible, and spitting out toothpaste was like a lottery that I might win, if I was lucky.  3. water pooled during a short shower. A longer one would probably flow onto the main bathroom floor. There is an open air pool, BBQ area, and 3 piece gym on the top floor. This was a lovely spot with a great view over green park and a nearby school. Would like to have had more time to enjoy it. Water felt wonderful.  There is also a cafe beside the street entrance with inexpensive breakfast options which we tried. The hotel is within easy walking distance, pleasant on a cool fine day or night, to Southbank and QPAC.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_462544901~“Great base for Convention Centre”~Menso is a great base for attending functions at the Convention Centre and it also has easy access to Southbank and all the restaurants and entertainment options available there. The apartment is modern with a well equipped kitchen for longer stays. Breakfast at the newly opened cafe was excellent.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462374406~“Great customer service A+++”~I booked a studio room for my partner and older son (6) for the night whilst my youngest boy was in at lady cilento children's hospital for surgery and he was due to stay overnight. Late in the afternoon the drs gave us the all clear to go home. Thank you to Menso for helping us out. We paid a little extra for a roll away bed so that we could all be together. The room should only have 2 people in there. If it wasn't for the hotel I'm not sure what we would have done.  The hotel is clean and the pool/BBQ area on the roof are awesome. The room was very spacious for a studio and the spa bath with the TV meant I actually got to relax after a long day sitting in a hospital seat. The kitchen area was great. If you want to cook a meal everything is there to be able to do so.  The only con I have for the place is the bathroom door being glass. The frosted section needs to go further down so you can't be seen on the toilet.  We will definitely be visiting again and we recommend this hotel to anyone especially if you need to be close to the hospital.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458780148~“Convenient location but lacking amenities ”~Nice new rooms in a convenient location, short drive to Southbank and convention centre. Poor aircon and the in room spa is basically a bath/shower with jets. Expensive for what it is and not entirely cleaned from last occupants.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456100075~“New modern apartments in good location at awesome price”~I was attending Brisbane for a work conference and had this apartment booked on my behalf. I would normally stay at one of the larger chain hotels closer to Southbank if I was staying on this side of the river, and I had trepidations over this hotel. However, it was perfectly adequate. I did have a bit of trouble contacting the hotel prior to arrival to discuss parking...they seem to never answer their phone, although I'm not sure why...reception seems to be staffed for most of the day, and not overly busy. In any case, parking is easy and ample. The apartment was seemingly brand new, and everything in perfect working order. It wasn't overly spacious, but certainly good enough. Air conditioning worked well (it was super hot while we were there!), although as others have mentioned, the hallways and lifts are not ventilated well and are stifling. Sleep quality was good enough, with the bed being pretty standard and the noise level not terrible, despite the busy location.  The apartment was well fitted out with kitchen equipment and we were able to cook a fairly simple meal for a family. Wi-fi was easy to log on to, worked well, and was free (as it always should be these days!) I note there were four TV's in the two bedroom apartment, including one in the bathroom positioned for a relaxing bath. All in all, a modern and new apartment, perhaps lacking a little bit of character, but at a price that is much more pleasant than the larger hotels down the road. I'd come back here without hesitation.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_455030284~“Nice modern apartment near South Bank parks and west end”~My family booked a two bedroom apartment for a week. Modern well equipped with a great on roof pool and hang out area. Only downside is it close to other apartments. It has fully equipped kitchen, laundry and outdoor bar by even.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454829335~“Modern, smart Southbank apartments”~We needed to stay relatively close to Suncorp stadium after a Cold Play concert recently and we chose Menso Apartments. It is a envigorating walk from Suncorp so wear your comfy shoes, however you can always jump on a bus. The rooms were modern, clean and well equipped with everything we needed for our short stay. The next morning you can take a short walk to have a lovely breakfast at one of the many cafes on Southbank.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449736251~“Close to Southbank”~The room we had was a very small studio however we did gat an upgrade to a balcony which was much appreciated. The location was excellent just a few minutes walk to Southbank however for a brand new building there were a few issues. In the car park and hallways to the rooms there was a strange snell not a new smell but like something had gone off. As mentioned very small rooms and it had a very "clinical" feel about it as well. The last guests kindly left their dishes in the dishwasher (at least clean) and the room was very dusty as well. The balcony also needed a clean as well. It did have a rooftop pool but no cover at all from the sun such a shame.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448699617~“Great Staff!”~It's a very good location and the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. They gave me a lot of advice about where to eat and where to hang out. The location is very close to the river and hip west end. I recommend Blackstar coffee for their cold press!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_447055174~“Overpriced for what it is”~Probably wouldn’t stay again as it had small rooms, poor facilities & website makes it look larger. Also coughed up a little extra for a balcony only to find you are just looking at the verandah's of the apartment black across from the hotel.  Staff were great, so no fault on their part. Although when you pay as much as we did for the room you don’t expect a note asking you to tidy the room as much as possible. And the last guest had left a bowl outside which looked to be used as an ashtray. Possibly the best way to summarize the experience was felt like a fancy backpackers.~2~2~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_445127246~“Looked better on-line”~A newly-built place, this has the potential to be more than it is. Service at the desk seemed a chore for the staff member there and the passageways and lift are not air-conditioned. Only one room key was given to the two of us and facilities in the room should've been better for what we paid. Coffee, milk and sugar weren't replenished each day. We had a balcony room which had a nice view of the rooms and balconies of the people in the apartments opposite! The room was quite a bit smaller than it looked on-line but the bathroom was nice (although my wife didn't appreciate the glass bathroom door as mentioned in other reviews). Nice pool on the roof and a poor excuse for a gym.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~5~2~nan
review_432078534~“Nice place but need to iron out the kinks in the service”~The hotel is clean and modern and in a wonderful location. The basic necessities of a hotel for the business traveler must be attended to. For 3 days in a row the cleaning staff did not notice that I did not have any shower gel. When I went to the desk to let them know it got resolved for 1 day. Then the next day again after coming back from doing overtime at the office I noticed again no shower gel. Since the reception closes at 6:30 pm I am out of luck for any service until the morning. They need someone on staff 24 -7. Thank goodness I did not run out of toilet paper or have an issue with flooding with the toilet after hours.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_430184964~“Rude and inhospitable staff”~Got lost while driving to the hotel, so I called and spoke with Greg, who was extraordinarily impatient when I tried to get a description of how to access the hotel. On check in, the member of staff told me there would be a 1.5% surcharge on credit cards when I asked about MasterCard v AMEX. After returning home, I realised that I had been charged more than that. When I rang the hotel to clarify why, I again spoke with Greg who told me that the charge for AMEX is 3+% and I would never have been told the incorrect thing and that I should have read the website more clearly! The room itself was fine. However, I had to request soap for the bathroom on two separate occasions and this was not forthcoming, so I had to use the dishwashing detergent instead. The bathroom also has a non frosted/covered glass through to the room, so you can't have someone in the room while you use the bathroom. While the location is convenient, the lack of service, rudeness and poor attention to detail would not see me recommend nor return here.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~2~1~nan
review_428043376~“very average”~no more than a sleeping place. didn't feel welcome by the tenant, who struggles with basic welcoming skills. hotel is clean though. but not in line with what they advertise. location is good. wouldn't pay more than 60% of the 190aud/night I got charged.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427771763~“Nice and modern and convenient location ”~Recently stayed one night in a two bedroom apartment. The apartment was clean and modern. Fantastic wrap around balcony with lounge chairs and a separate outdoor dining suite, small bbq also. Kitchen well stocked with crockery etc and full sized fridge. All fantastic as we hosted a small hens party there. Bed very comfortable and great blockout blinds. Great location for getting into the city and South Brisbane. Didn't have much interaction with staff but what we did was fine. The only con was we only stayed 1 night. Overall a great facility with nice amenities.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426833785~“Convenient location but bizzare bathroom ”~Pros: Location convenient, parking included, price point  Cons: check in process  Room not 100% clean -rubbish left in room and carpet not cleaned Bizzare clear view glass looking directly from bed to toilet- so not sexy. Overall. Ok for overnight stay but would not stay again. Would pay slightly more for another hotel in same area.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425237977~“Your other guests can see you pee”~The Menso is a newish hotel, with stylish fittings and amenities. But, our rooms had some problems. The one that stands out most is that the glass bathroom doors are largely transparent, with only some opaque panels, so that other guests in your rooms can see you on the toilet. We had two sets of rooms, and in one, the bathroom door easily could be smashed against the toilet seat, and the bar fridge was leaking. Finally, and this worried me, the lights weren't on in the fire stairs, so coming down them we were in near darkness by the bottom floors. I alerted the staff to all these problems, and they were professional and constructive in response. And, despite the issues I've mentioned, the hotel was very clean and modern, and great location.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_422691065~“Great roof top BBQ”~We stayed here on Riverfire night and it was great. Speedy check in and very friendly staff. The rooftop is pretty good, it has a small gym, BBQ, fabulous pool and plenty of seating. We all just enjoyed the great views of Southbank while drinking our wine.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421916813~“Great Stay”~We Stayed and had a fantastic view of the fireworks for River fire. The room was beautiful and it was great to have a fully intergraded fridge and dishwasher in the room too. I liked the fact that we could cook the odd meal in the room if we didn't feel like going out for a meal, the rooftop BBQ near the pool was also a great place to sit and relax and look at the Brisbane sky line. The staff were very helpful and friendly and we will defiantly stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419011608~“No complaints! ”~Needed some affordable overnight accommodation in Brisvegas and Menso popped up. Brand new boutique hotel. Five minute walk to the restaurants of South Bank so handy location and parking for the two cars we had. Everything smelt so new! Can't complain about anything apart from the door to the bathroom. Frosted glazed door with clear rectangular areas so basically you could see who ever was in the bathroom! And a huge gap around the door so almost pointless there actually being a door! I personally prefer privacy when using the bathroom even if it's just myself and partner. Not sure what the interior designer was thinking!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
