review_336372116~“Avoid this pathetic excuse of accommodation!”~The place was dirty and disgusting. Dead bugs everywhere. I found a spider near my bed as well. The shower was moldy and the bathroom area really dirty. But the worst of all was the rudeness of the manager, Sue. What a character.~1~1~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_256501733~“Convenient location, satisfactory accommodation”~Good location, close to Indooroopilly shops and public transport into Brisbane Central Business District. Apartment was comfortably furnished and met our requirements , well maintained gardens with a pool for the kids.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_241222905~“Simple stay.”~I feel it is a simple apartment for simple people. A good place to stay or sleep during the night and put your belongings at. Location-wise is acceptable, about 10 minutes walk to the nearest shopping mall (Indooroopilly Shopping) and it is about 20 minutes away to the city by bus. A small swimming pool though to bring a group of friends along.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_238808553~“Disgusting and dirty”~Appartment was filthy, musty smell, Dirty mouldy shower, so many issues. Ended up getting a refund and a warning to future guests considering this place.DONT. I have photos to prove it , everyone I have shown have been disgusted. The owner was rude,aggressive and would be helped by learning proper customer service skills.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_234467385~“COMPLAINTS ON TRIP ADVISOR”~We have stayed at Taringa Gardens on several occasions. Yes the apartments are tired but on discussion with management, it is not their fault - it is the owners of the units who are at fault. Serviced, presentation, cleanliness are to standard. Still a very good friendly place to stay.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_185612743~“Not good”~If the cleaners would actually give the units a good clean, it would be a reasonable albeit low end place to stay, the gardens are maintained but the accommodation isn't, it just appears as if no one cares. I have never seen a more disgusting kitchen bin before, the hot water had an electrical fault, coffee table had peeling laminate, louvers were dusty and grubby. I run accommodation in Tasmania and was shocked that someone could think this was acceptable. Read the other reviews and decide for yourself.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_184403052~“Don't do it, you will regret it!”~Nothing like the pictures on their website, actually should be done for false advertising.  The unit for 4 had a dining table that seated 2, stuck in the hallway as there was no other space for it. The 'lounge room' was an small area off from the kitchenette (not a real kitchen), no space for a family of 4 to relax.  The unit had glass louvers in the children's bedroom which was at bed height and was not safety glass, an absolute disaster waiting to happen. As for the smell of urine that pervaded the unit, it was disgusting, a smell that, when we complained, the manager just sprayed some toilet spray to 'get rid of it'!!!??? The traffic noise from the main road was constant, and the unit was actually below road level which made it worse. When we asked for our money back, as there was no way we could put up with the noise and smell for the four days we had booked, we were refused. It was only after going through the Office of Fair Trading, who totally agreed with us that it was false advertising, and that what was advertised was NOT what we got, that they reluctantly gave us back half of what we had paid (we were made to pay in full at check in, before even seeing the room).  Don't do it, it is the worst place we have ever seen!!!~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_153827157~“Not worth the price.”~Myself, my fiance and our brother and sister stayed at Taringa Garden Apartments for two nights to attend Soundwave 2013. Unfortunately,we left finding accommodation too late and all that was left for under $600 was this place. I don't have many good things to say about it. When we first arrived, we waited about 10 minutes for someone to show up at reception to check us in (we were early, so that was our fault) and when they did arrive, all they did was ask our name and then send us on our way. We weren't asked for any sort of ID, we could have been anyone and they wouldn't have known any different. The fact that it had undercover, secure parking was a plus but we were told "You can park in any space, except the ones that had 'Private' signs, those spaces were for long term residents. When we got to the parking garage, all but three spaces had 'Private' signs on them and every single space had junk packed in them. The space we parked in had a printer and stereo boxes shoved against the wall so we weren't able to park fully into the space. The whole parking garage is like a dumping ground for the long term residents. I have to say, once we had hauled our luggage up to the top floor, I was thoroughly unimpressed. Usually I read Trip Advisor reviews before choosing a place to stay but as I said before, we had limited options and money. We stayed in a two bedroom (two double rooms, a queen and two singles) and it was definitely not worth $175 a night. It's not even worth half of that, in my opinion. The carpets looked like they had never been cleaned, there were stains everywhere. The walls were chipped and also filthy. The television was tiny! I mean, I haven't seen a TV that small since I was 10! The Foxtel was a plus but the fact that you could barely see it on the tiny TV was useless. The aircon wasn't working properly but it was still a blessing in such humid weather. The showers in both bathrooms were disgusting, I didn't want to shower in there but I didn't have a choice. The toilets were, thankfully, clean but the bathrooms were TINY. For someone with long legs, like me, it was impossible to sit on the toilet properly without banging either your knees or head on the wall in front of you. It was also impossible for me to dry myself in the bathroom after showering, there wasn't enough room to move for someone my height in that room so I had to move into the bedroom. The bathroom doors didn't lock at all and there was even gum plugging up holes in the top of the bathroom door frame! The bedrooms were a good size and the beds, while being dated, were relatively comfortable. The pillows on the other hand, were horribly uncomfortable. I usually take my own pillows to places like that but I forgot. The apartment was supposed to sleep four (max. six) people but there were only enough spare pillows and blankets for two. It took us almost the full first day to figure out how to turn on the ceiling fans in the bedrooms too. Who the hell puts fan switches inside cupboards!? If we hadn't went looking for spare pillows, we would never have found the switch. Also, I know we only stayed two nights but the notice in the pamphlet thing on the coffee table said the towels would be changed daily. We left once, for about half an hour on the first day and no one ever came to offer us fresh towels. The kitchen was a good size but the cutlery was filthy. I know it's the responsibility of the previous guests to clean them but surely someone checks these sorts of things? Also, the stove desperately needed replacing, the hot plates were completely rusted and when we tried to use on of them, it made terrible noises and the burnt smell was so horrible we had to open all of the windows and doors! The first night we stayed, the person in the apartment across from ours, who I'm guessing was a long term resident, had a VERY noisy party. They left their door open (which was less than a meter away from ours) as people were streaming in and out, noisily, all night. They had a BBQ out on their balcony and then sat out there all night being INCREDIBLY loud. They were still going when we went to bed and between them and the noise coming from Moggill Rd, it was impossible to sleep the first night. All in all, I would say just don't bother. It's not worth the price and you could definitely find something better closer to the city, provided you book well in advance and not around the time of something like Soundwave.~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_152927393~“Total Disaster”~Stayed here for two weeks, and the accommodations were provided by my work. This place was a total disaster for the following reasons: 1. Our apartment was completely filthy, with spiders and bugs everywhere. The sheets were dirty and there were stains on the pillow cases. The ceiling was actually falling down throughout the place, littering the unit with chunks of stucco. There was absolutely no management around so I had clean the place myself. 2. The apartments look NOTHING like they do on the website. 3. We asked in advance for a crib to be provided. We only received one after 3 days and it did not include a mattress of any sort for our child. 4. The kitchen was so poorly supplied that it did not even have ONE fork. 5. After moving in they began a construction project right outside the apartment. A trench was dug in front of our door, and we were provided with a small plank to walk across it. 6. We asked management for toilet paper and were told that we had to provide it ourselves. 7. The cleaning staff took our blankets and never returned them. We ended up having to ask management for our blankets back. Avoid this place!~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_134939072~“What is everyone complaining about?”~Yes the rooms are dated. But they were clean & contained everything we needed. Plus, we were able to check in 5 hrs early, got upgraded to a deluxe 2 bed apartment, and there was no charge for the extra guests who slept on the fold out couch (which the staff made up for us). Would stay here again.~4~4~4~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_122125975~“disappointment”~the apartment was nothing like the pictures on the web site, it was pokey and old and nowhere near enough room for 4 people. the lounge was small and the 2nd bedroom had a window off the lounge room which made it rather noisy for anyone sleeping in there. the road noise was enough to wake the dead, had to come home to get a decent nights sleep. was going to look after my granddaughter for a whole night but there was not enough room to put up a cot in the place(very disappointing). would not recommend this place and it was not cheap either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~1~1~4~1~1~1~1~nan
review_120514476~“Rediculus.”~Worst property ever visited. Only a fool will use them after reading the reviews. Wish I had read the reviews before visiting Brisbane. Stay with this guys ruined our entire trip. Hopeless customer service and environment very filthy. Sue Snashall (Manager) doesn't know what customer service is. HOPELESS PLACE AND HOPELESS SERVICE.~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_119699971~“Not a lot nice to say...”~The good - undercover parking and lovely pool that opened at 7am (great for those with early rising kids, terrible for other guests!) The bad - Everything else. There was a lot of mould and I felt it wasn't a "safe place" for a child. Plus the bedroom had a window into the lounge so not ideal when trying to get a kid to sleep! They only service the rooms weekly but towel change daily. My rubbish was only taken when I made a deal out of it and reception was always closed. The beds were AWFUL, completely lumpy and uncomfortable with the mattresses falling apart, and the "couch" was in a massive state of disrepair. The bathroom stunk of urine, the clock didn't work and the dryer only worked if you held the door shut! The fenced in area hadn't been raked of old leaves and contained a number of disgusting bathroom items from previous guests (ew!). For $175 a night I expected a lot more. This could be an awesome place but they simply HAVE to clean it and do some regular maintenance.~1~1~4~1~2~1~2~nan
review_119068002~“Good location with issues”~Firstly the apartments are well located with friendly staff. Unfortunately the location leads to one of its issue, noise! The apartments are on Moggill Rd which leads to lots of road noise, the bedrooms all face outwards and with no double glazing it gets noisy. The apartments themselves are adequate but dated, each room has its own small bathroom. The kitchen is unfortunately a letdown, kettle wouldn't switch off when boiling and only one of the four hotplates worked. Secure undercover parking and a pool, BBQ area rounds out the package. There is better available for the price.~3~3~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_117730186~“Extremely disappointing, dirty and smelly.”~I stayed with my 18mth old daughter and felt the room was too dirty for her to sleep or play. The tiles had muddy footprints, stains on the carpets and dust and mould on walls and furniture. The price is outrageous for the quality of the apartment and management rude and unhelpful, I would strongly discourage anyone thinking if booking a room at taringa gardens.~1~1~4~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_101872606~“DISGUSTINGLY FILTHY MOULDY AND UNHYGIENIC”~Cannot believe the condition of this place. Families travelled interstate for a wedding and all stayed there for conveniece. Very disappointing and embaressing. Very obvious no proper cleaning or maintenance is done. Dirt,filth, mould, overgrown gardens, smells and pokey rooms with dated furniture.~1~1~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_101078054~“Disgusting”~The rooms were very old, there was washing in the machine from other people that have stayed there, bathroom was so dirty didnt look like it had been cleaned for 2 months,dirty tissues under the beds,dishwasher had mould and powder in it hasnt been cleaned at all.All drawers had hair through them,floor hadnt been washed I would say 3 months there was so much more but I wouldnt let my dogs stay there and I would like to know how they get there stars maybe there should be a review to that .~1~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan
review_100928848~“Very poor bang for your bucks”~The rooms were very dated and dirty, looked like they had not been cleaned for a month. Showers were moldy and not very nice. The apartments were supposed to be 3&1/2 star. The rating may need to be reassessed~2~2~3~2~1~1~2~nan
review_98979076~“Never again”~Booked online. Room looked nothing like the photo on internet. 2 bedrrom apartment with seating at tabe (in corridor) only for 2. Unbearable "plumbing smell". Very very small and dark. We were made to pay for 4 night stay at check in (before seeing the room). Never never again!~1~3~3~1~1~1~1~nan
review_81520684~“Worked out extremely well”~I stayed at Taringa Gardens for most of the month of September working nearby. The managers were great. The Deluxe 2 bedroom was not available when I arrived, so they provided a regular 2 bedroom for 3 nights until the other unit was available. Both units were great - true the carpet was a bit worn, but the units were clean and well furnished. Grounds were beautifuk and the pool was lovely.~4~5~5~4~4~4~5~nan
review_42570198~“wasn't worth the money”~my 2 bridesmaids and i stayed there so we could get ready on my wedding day and we were very dissappointed. everything in the room was falling apart or stained. the pool had scaffolding around it and we weren't able to get any good photos there at all.~2~1~4~nan~1~3~3~nan
review_7989560~“only if you are on a budget”~Our 1 bedroom apt on the second floor had stained carpets, dirty kitchen utensils, and the noise from the highway made this place an alternative only if you are on a tight budget. The second night, I had to chase a cockroach that had crawled under the bed for about ten minutes. Tiny bathroom. Free covered parking was convenient. The grounds and the pool are nice and well maintained, so the owners need to put some TLC to the rooms, and then it can be rated as a 3 or even a 3 1/2 star property. ~2~2~2~nan~2~1~2~3
review_5482172~“Not too bad!!”~Clean!!  My room was very clean, it was serviced every other day, although the bed is made up only once a week.  I stayed in a one bedroom apartment, the bedroom is nice - ensuite, with a large walk in wardrobe. The lounge/kitchen is small but enough for two people. The apartment also has its own washing maching and dryer too. A couple of points to note, some bedrooms over look a busy main road, but the rooms do have double glazing so the noise isn't a problem. Also one or two dont have much of a view from the balcony as they are around the side of the complex. I'd would stay there again though. ~4~3~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
