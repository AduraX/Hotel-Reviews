review_477363227~“Roomy apartment and great location”~One bedroom apartment was very roomy. Loved the big bathroom and functional kitchen. Bed very comfy. Hotel is located across the road from Central Station, so easy access from the airport, via AirTrain. Staff were very accommodating. Great little coffee shop at the base of the Hotel, with a couple of pubs close by also. Only a short walk into Queen Street Mall. Would stay again and recommend to family and friends~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473964791~“Super Inner City Stay”~Fantastic Old time Hotel with lots of character. Room was lovely and spacious with everything that you need. Gorgeous little roof top spa and bbq area. The management were so lovely and accommodating and the front office staff member Katie was so helpful and made us feel very welcome. The only thing I will say is that there is limited parking at the hotel so across the road is parking for a fee.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_470573721~“Disappointing”~I was quite disappointed in my stay at this hotel. Despite the beautiful looking Art Deco exterior, the interiors looked dated and tired. A new coat of paint and replacing the lightbulbs in the common areas that give a 'fluoro glow', would go a long way for example. My room on the 3rd floor had old furniture (of the non-antique variety!) in it. The air conditioning was noisy and the internet did not work one of the nights. The worst part however, was a dirty toilet that really put me off the night I arrived. Admittedly, the rest of the room was clean. The room and bathroom were spacious though and the location convenient, close to Queen St Mall and King George Square. Staff were friendly and willing to help where they could. With more attention to detail, the experience could be greatly improved.~2~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_467180811~“Amazing”~Really old style hotel what gave it tons of character. Rooms are big and bed was really comfortable. Place was very quite and that was a big plus. Very close to everything in Brisbane and i will definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458797258~“Great service”~What a wonderful hotel! We loved the clean, spacious rooms, the beautiful marble foyer and the art deco style lifts. Continental breakfast basket was included in the price (bread, butter, condiments, juices, cereals and real milk). The hotel is very close to the train station and central for other city activities as well. I think what made our stay so great was Katie at reception. She is a real asset to the hotel and made us feel so welcome and she couldn't do enough for us.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_458009868~“Lovely homey period hotel. ”~I loved the period feel of this hotel. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. Our room was cleaner than many hotels we've stayed at and the one issue we had was dealt with immediately and professionally. Although the decor was "dated", the room felt homely, had everything we needed and was larger than expected. The only improvement we could suggest would be blockout blinds in the bedroom as we were there for a night concert and wanted to sleep in a little.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443070774~“Simple but quality inner city stay”~Awesome atmosphere generated by the staff! Feels like checking in with friends. Love the cheer and warmth. Room was lovely, quiet and peaceful with all needed amenities. Breakfast basked is simple, there is the restaurant right next door for who likes a full on brekky.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_442777388~“Self service budget traveller hotel”~- Simple breakfast included with sandwich and water provided in the restaurant on the ground floor - Mostly self service which is acceptable considering this is a budget hotel - Location: just ~10min walk to Queens street  - Room: spacious room, clean, confortable bed. Some rooms are not refurbished yet.  - not recommended for family traveller with kids.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440790538~“Beautiful and well equipt”~After making a last minute decision to stay nearer the airport before my morning flight, I booked a nights stay here. It was lovely. So spacious and a great kitchen. My room was quiet and the bed was extremely comfy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440265421~“Olde World Charm”~We visited for one night and had a two bedroom apartment on the top floor.  We were surprised in walking into the apartment to see that quite a large patch of leather was missing from the couch which made the room appear scruffy.  However the bedrooms and 2 bathrooms were well appointed and clean and for the want of a 'throw' or cover we would have given 100%.  Receptionist and the Manager were friendly and accommodating.  Would use this Hotel again but get a new lounge suite please! Even the one out in the hall by the lift was excellent.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_435739029~“Perfect location”~Lovely big room, well furnished, clean and comfortable. Comfortable bed, large ensuite with its own washer/dryer. Breakfast basket was perfectly adequate, although we did buy more milk for cereal. The only complaint we had was no wifi, couldn't connect, but to be honest we were out most of the time exploring beautiful Brisbane!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_433429554~“Sweet!”~I stayed in this Hotel with my boyfriend. From the start it was a lovely experience. The staff were very attentive and professional and friendly. I love the 1930s decor, I felt like I was in New York. Beautiful old world textiles marble floors. The bed was amazingly comfortable in the room is lovely and cosy with a great bath nice finishes and furnishings. Great location in the middle of town. Price on second of May cool I would go back there any time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_429003089~“A lot to like at very good value”~There's indeed a lot to like about these apartments, starting from the very friendly and hospitable welcome on check in, an attitude which continued throughout the four-day stay. The apartment itself, in a well-preserved art deco building, was delightful. Very large sitting room and bedroom and a huge bathroom. A well-equipped kitchen - fridge, microwave, stove top, toaster, etc - and a good continental breakfast provided to the room each day. The Reception can also provide very reasonably-priced frozen meals and a selection of beer and wine much cheaper than nearby bottle-shops. Only a couple of niggles, which could be fixed. Not enough coat hangers and no trouser hangers. The wifi (they get this from a third-party, apparently) is fast when it works but the metering is odd and I got cut off a long way short of the supposed 200MB daily allowance. Despite those niggles, though, positives far outweigh negatives and I certainly hope to be back!~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_428016044~“Quaint hotel in city”~Great location and clean very well presented hotel. Staff were very accommodating and could not fault them. Close to the train station and short walk to the city. Rooms were massive and had more everything that you need for a short or even long stay. Only one negative is that the Air-conditioner was very noisy all the time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421375327~“Rothbury on Ann Street”~A lovely, classic hotel with smallish, but clean and perfectly adequate rooms. Very conveniently located to CBD and Queen Street Mall. Self contained but also close to restaurants. Friendly and helpful staff. Would most certainly stay there next time. In fact I would like to invest in a unit within the complex.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_412658575~“Old but interesting and comfortable”~Old building, tastefully decorated. Quaint old lifts. Friendly staff. Very clean and comfortable rooms. Quiet despite proximity to busy traffic. All facilities provided in the room we had, including washing machine, kitchenette, lounge chairs, desk. Our only problem was that we could not get warm air from the air conditioner during a cold weather spell. Felt like 14 degrees in room. Otherwise a delightful stay, close to all transport and walking distance to Eagle Street Wharf.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_409793869~“Adequate place to stay for short visit.”~Convenient location. Friendly helpful staff though desk not manned at all times. Room very small but clean and comfortable. Microwave a bonus. Also crockery and cutlery provided. Great restaurant next door. Only one complaint....one aircon control for two rooms. This was located in small foyer between both rooms. Guests in other room turned it up to very warm which meant our room was too warm for us! Would only stay again if I was assured of being able to control aircon in my room for myself. This was a ridiculous arrangement.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397316299~“2 night stay in city”~The room was very good, the staff also provided a very good service. The location was in walking distance to the Queen street mall and other City activities. However the Hotel location suited the purpose of our stay in the city~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_388833327~“Expectations exceeded!”~ULTIQA Rothbury gave us an excellent place to stay at the exact epicentre of the various functions and venues we had to attend. The management preserved the old-world charm of the establishment without sacrificing the changing needs of current visitors. Our room was a beautifully refurbished apartment on the fifth floor and was very spacious and well-appointed. In addition, it was very quiet for its location - at the heart of the Brisbane CBD! The Rothbury will certainly be our choice for any future visits.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_383293139~“Great central location”~This hotel is heritage listed so is a beautifully restored building. You step back a few decades when you use the lifts. The location couldn,t be better- walking distance from the central train station, the river and other attractions. It doesn't have a restaurant but provides supplies for a continental breakfast ( except for RCI time sharers). Close to a number of quality restaurants and if you have an accor plus card then you are well catered for.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_379495970~“A home away from home”~This hotel was like a home away from home for me. My room was extremely cosy, and everything was so luxurious - the towels and sheets were so fresh and soft, the bed and pillows were so comfy and I felt right at home. I travelled alone and felt safe here, and the location is amazing. It's so close to everything including the mall and the train station. The staff are truly amazing and went above and beyond to make my stay as enjoyable as they could. Being a small family run business, I was so impressed by the level of detail in my room. I would definitely stay here again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_359954905~“Not what we expected”~The hotel was okey if you just want somewhere to sleep. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable, though they did not clean the room between the days. There was no bin so we could not throw trash away, we only had 1 roll of toilet paper and only 1 towel. There was only a small amount of knifes and forks, so if you are going to eat on the hotell room you should bring your own, we had to eat with our hands. The breakfast was really bad, we expected more for our money. We will not stay here again, and we do not recommend this hotell to others.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_350323401~“Am I really in the middle of Brisbane city?”~This hotel is right in the heart of the city, opposite central train station but once inside it is deathly quiet and so lovely. My "budget" room was more like a suite with a fully equipped kitchen, washing machine/drier, spacious bathroom, plenty of storage in the form of wardrobes etc. Staff were very friendly, parking was tight but I managed to get my 4WD in easily. It decorated in oldy worldy decor with old fashioned lifts and beautiful marble floors and stair cases. The rooms were modern with really comfy beds. The air conditioning worked well as did the wifi. I would love to stay here again. I loved it.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_347271940~“Enjoyable Stay”~Old world charm with a central location.  One bedroom refurbished apartment but with minimalist cooking facilities, cook top and microwave, but all we needed, plenty of bench space and storage. Washing m/c was not used. Air conditioning worked well, and needs to in Brisbane in the summer. Cafe next door for breakfast and lunch and open for dinner on a Friday. Plenty of eating places in city and around particularly on the South Bank of the River. Major supermarket only 10 mins walk or less. We walked everywhere except when we used a free hop on hop off ferry on the river, still quicker to walk to most places but made a relaxing change, used a bus once to go to dinner then a ferry back to the city,10 mins walk away, return ferry was included in the bus fare, perhaps we had a fairly quick dinner but I don't think so, more on the restaurant in another post. Only 2 minutes walk from central station with direct trains to airport, used taxi to get there and train for departure. Train is cheaper for 2 but not really that much difference. Only problem a front corner room with the building across the road undergoing major structural alteration so building noise started at 6.30am during the week but we just turned over and slept on. Looks as though should be finished soon. Should add was an RCI exchange but rooms seem to be available for all.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_335271610~“Perfect location and décor in the top grade.”~A very pleasant experience in a hotel apartment which was simply equipped with everything you could wish. There was even a washing machine and dryer in the apartment. In addition it is placed only 200 meters from the pedestrian precinct and train station. Only minus was the poor wi-fi.  Helpful and friendly staff.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_332407197~“Perfect location with helpful staff”~A very well placed hotel in the CBD only half a block up from the central station. The hotel is very nice and is a mix of people on holiday and longer leases of the apartments. The is a little cafe next door where you can get breakfast (inclusive, relatively simple, breakfasts are here as well). There is a car park on site but it is probably vital to book as space as it isn’t very big. The reception isn’t staffed 24/7 but there are staff nearby if you arrive late or need assistance.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_329623785~“old style charm and beauty”~The location is perfect for catching a trains (Milton station literally across the road) to events.. the rooms are well appointed with kitchen, bathroom (great shower pressure) and even a washer / dryer combo. The hotel has a lovely 1920s feel. I loved the style of the Old fashioned elevator carriages and the reception on each floor. The staff are lovely and helpful. Would not hesitate to come back. The cafe next door makes the best coffee and breakfast was delicious.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_326425869~“Lovely old world feel. ”~Had a wonderful weekend stay while attending a function in city. The staff were very helpful.

Breakfast at the cafe next door was lovely.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_316794576~“Not for women travelling alone”~Arrived a little after 6pm - reception shut and a sign instructing me to call "after hours" support. Got to my room which was very stuffy and felt like it had been closed for days - on a 30+ degree day was very hot. No restaurants nearby so 10 minute walk to find a meal which was fine but this part of town required a walk past a reasonably poorly lit park. Complimentary wifi was woeful - I lost access 5 minutes after logging on and when I tried to reconnect was blocked as only one login per day! When I rang the "after hours" support expecting them to help I was told: first, can't help as they were "after hours", second "this isn't a hotel" and nor do they have 24 hour reception to assist guests (perhaps management should change the name). I pointed out that there hadn't been anyone at reception since I arrived around 6pm, despite signs saying reception open until 8pm and it was disappointing that they couldn't assist with a simple thing like resetting access or providing another password! Rooms are dated but reasonably tidy, but no safety chain on doors nor a peep hole. This wasn't a cheap option at $200 per night and I expected more. I won't chose this "hotel" again.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_316174006~“What a surprise! ”~This unknown hotel to me turned into a fantastic 3 day stay. The decor took us back in time. The room was clean and the bed so comfortable. We got breakfast with our deal and small but enjoyable. I wil highly recommend and will be definitely staying again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_313882875~“ok place in good location”~We booked the Rothbury through hotels.com, including "free WiFi and free breakfast". The website stated that there is "limited parking on a first come first serve" basis. We arrived early so that we could get a car park, but were told that the (very few) parks are fully booked, and that you need to make a reservation in advance. The person at the check-in was nice though, asked us to park in a non-hotel park and promised to keep an eye on it, and move the car once another car park was available. She also booked one for our second night. The room was on the ground floor, and instead of a window had glass bricks. It made you feel like in a basement. The room was small, but very clean, with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was spotless, and had a roomy shower. The overall spotless cleanliness made me rate it 4, instead of 3 stars! Location is great - in easy walking distance to the main shopping area, and even to South Bank. The negatives: Apart from the parking (by the way, at extra cost of AUD 23/night), there was no free breakfast, and the "free WiFi" was 200MB per day. Tip: This is per device, so if you have a phone and a tablet you get 200 on each ;-) Also, our reservation clearly said "living room, dining area, and sitting area", and yet, we only got a very small room. When mentioning again at check-out, the lady was very nice, and said we should have told her right away, and she would have upgraded us, but the lady at check-in time just said there is no breakfast, and that is the room we booked. I think these problems are mainly with the link between the hotel and hotels.com, and thus I won't mak the hotel down for it. If you know what you get, it is really anice place in a convenient location.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~3~nan
review_306813281~“great location”~stayed here before our latest cruise and handy to central station and the queen street mall. Rooms are adequate but nothing flash. The old style building is quaint and love the old elevators. Tip. The washing machine is loud as hell and takes forever so dont put it on when trying to sleep.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~3~5~nan
review_305550418~“Long weekend break”~I felt as though I was walking into a Poirot mystery when I entered the foyer! Our self service suit was comfy and had plenty of windows but was still very quiet. The bed was comfy and the bathroom clean - a lovely larger than usual shower and a washer/dryer [although we did not require this]. Unfortunately the lift to the basement garage was out of order and although the young lady on reception offered to carry our two small bags up, it wasn't too much to go down the stairs. There is no eatery that we could find close to the hotel but a café is being put in next door so that could save the eating problem - the microwave and small cook top were handy but not for a holiday break! The breakfast basket was more than adequate. Would definitely stay again.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_296526052~“Delightful”~Reading previous reviews left me arriving with a few butterfies in my stomach. All sorts of mysterious phenomena were being reported. After staying a night the only mystery to me was why hadn't I heard of this hotel before? My room was spacious, clean and inviting. The hotel's location was right at the heart of the Brisbane CBD. I will be staying here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_293943930~“Girls night out was a succes!”~I stayed at Rothbury Hotel for a girlfriends birthday. The entire experience was fantastic from check in to check out. All of my friends met up in the room, we had a few pre night drinks on the rooftop where they have table and chairs set up. The staff were friendly and helpful – we were given a bottle of bubbly on arrival as we were celebrating a birthday that was a nice touch.  Bed was extremely comfortable and room was clean. I saw that there is a café being built at the front of the building – will definitely try that next visit. Thanks for a lovely stay~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_292823296~“Beautiful building, fabulous location, good sleep, a winner”~I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and visited once again last weekend. It was lovely as usual with only a few small complaints. The service was great, friendly and welcoming. However one girl was a little rude about us requesting an extra blanket. There were none in the room. As the aircon is preset between two rooms, it was quite chilly. Unfortunately, there was a guy that came around to install Foxtel who didn't ask if it was okay to come in and do it. My teenage daughter answered the door and he just said he was coming in to do it! Quite awkward to be lying in bed watching TV in the bedroom while he was in the other room!! I suggest they do this when people are not in the room. We stayed in an apartment room and it was very spacious and great for a few days and appreciated the washing machine and kitchen. The rooms were very clean except for some mould in the shower in the grout.  The bed and pillows were so comfortable and we had great sleep. We thought it might be a bit noisy as there were two big sporting events in the city. However we didn't really hear anyone.  It was priced a little higher due to the sporting events, but it's still good value and the location right near Central station and all the shops is really handy. No taxis needed. My only little gripe was that they had advertised as stay 2 nights get one free but did not honour this due to said sporting events being on. However there was no small print on the offer with black out dates. I could have pursued this, but could not be bothered. I think it's important for the chain to note that they SHOULD honour all advertised special OR start putting black out dates on the advertising.  The breakfast basket is a nice touch but as it's only packaged toast and cereal, not so great for gluten free people! Great if you want to save some money on brekky though. We will keep coming back because we love this hotel. It has great character and charm and much nicer than a sterile hotel room without any soul.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_279147596~“Dont count on getting any sleep...”~I stayed for one night on business. The room was a good size but everything in the room was quite old and dirty looking. To keep it short my main complaint would be I just didn't feel safe. There was loud banging ALL NIGHT... presumably from old pipes with other guests flushing toilets/showering etc. I could hear every single word the people in the room next to me said, not to mention the other guests snoring kept me awake. There was yelling all night that I'm still not sure if it was coming from outside or in other guest rooms.  There just seemed to be no soundproofing/insulation between the rooms whatsoever. I've asked my work to never....ever put me in this hotel again.~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~3~nan
review_274965646~“Quiet inner cbd gem”~We have stayed here at least 5 times, usually making a weekend out of end of week business trip. It has improved out of sight since new 'ultiqa' branding.

review_272882388~“Everything I needed right there in the heart of Brisbane”~Mike Wilby — As a project manager working on jobs internationally I spend a lot of time walking into new hotel rooms/apartments - its very rare to walk into one where everything I need to immediately settle in is right there but the Rothbury managed it perfectly ! :-), I live in Brisbane as much as anywhere and love the location - easy to drive to but a very short walk around the corner to the best of the CBD,it also has true Heritage style - especially the cool polished hardwood lifts!~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_272666167~“Started off short term”~I moved to Brisbane from Melbourne for an exciting new role in September 2014, not knowing a sole with the exception of my soon to be new work colleagues. I parked myself at the Rothbury on a short term basis and some 9 months later I find myself still there. The location is exceptional to everything, all the main tourist attractions, the CBD, River, Restaurants and for those travelling, the station is less than a 3 minute walk. The building has olde world charm, and I mean this in a positive sense. From the moment that you walk in the doors, you are transported back to an era of solidity, the art deco façade, the lifts, the marble all speak volumes to the building and its owners. The staff are wonderful, led by the ever capable Michelle. All of them, from the front desk through cleaning staff to the maintenance staff all go out of their way to assist and are always friendly. The rooms are clean and well appointed, the aircon works great and the place is always clean and well maintained. I would commend anyone thinking of coming Brisbane, for either a short visit or an extended stay such as I, to make the Ultiqa Rothbury your first port of call. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_263151928~“What a Haven”~I have stayed in the Rothbury on four separate occasions and on each time have experienced a different type of room. And on each time have absolutely loved what was on offer. This art deco former office bock has been tastefully fitted out sympathetically with the heritage building that houses them. If your needs are the sterile sameness of so many 4 - 5 star establishments, read no further - this one's not for you. However if comfort, charm, genuinely caring staff are part of your want list - look no further than this centrally located gem. This time I used the Airtrain from the airport t central station & an easy 200 metre walk found me speaking to the ever friendly & helpful Michelle. Our party consisted of 4 and all arrangements had been made with her over the phone - not a hiccup! Congratulations - you have something special here- will be back again!~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan

review_246918079~“Best hotel manager we have had ever!”~My wife and stayed at the rothbury for new yrs and we had an excellent stay, the rooms are nice and the rooftop terrace was the perfect place to enjoy the occasion with our friends with the convenience of the bbq and alfresco dining area. We have traveled quite a bit here in Australia and overseas and I must say that we have come across some good hotel managers before BUT Michelle at the rothbury is by FAR the very best we have dealt with. She ensured that our stay was comfortable not only for us but also for our 6mth old baby. If there was anything we needed it wasnt an issue for Michelle, she is a real asset to the place she went above and beyond to make us feel right at home and we will definitely be returning every year to enjoy what the rothbury hotel apartments has to offer. Thank you for a wonderful stay. See you next time.~5~5~5~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_244290147~“My late promise to Michelle !!”~I wanted to follow up with comments regarding my stay at the Rothbury back in June. I promised Michellle I would, then forgot !! I had been on extended travel duration for one month, my stay at the Rothbury was the conclusion of my work before travel back to Canada. Upon my arrival and access to apartment 602, I quickly realised that my stay was going to be very comfortable and pleasant. The apartment was spotless clean and well presented in all aspects. Everything was fully functional as expected, with no miscues. I truly appreciated the full kitchen facilities, big screen tv, wireless internet and of course the big walk in shower! Excellent! Most of all, which is something personal to many travelers, was a sumptuous comfortable bed with good linens and bulky fluffy pillows. After successively increasing time changes from my home base, as I worked in different country time zones, eventually 14 hours from my normal time, I slept very well in this great bed!  The character and warm charm of the building was endearing to say the least, it showed what can be done to maintain the old world charm coupled with modern functionality and comfort. The staff at the front desk were always warm and pleasant in my chats with them, and also the cleaning lady from Brazil who shared her great humor with me.  Just before departing I asked about long term rates and was warmly surprised to know that there are clients who had resided there for some years. This in particular was of interest to me, as I expect to retire in two years and potentially relocate to a warmer climate, such as Brisbane. I liked the convenience of the Rothbury's location to Central Station, Queen Street mall, also easy access to the Riverside restaurant choices.  I highly recommend the Rothbury for great value, comfort, cleanliness, super friendly staff, all in a fabulous location. Better late than never with my comments. Very Merry Xmas and Happy New Year to all the kind wonderful folks at the Rothbury. Cheers to all !!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

My husband and I marvelled at the old lifts and beautiful decore......beautiful. Our two bedroom apartment was great, very clean, super quiet, comfortable with great beds. Handy breakfast basket in our fridge each day. Loved the rooftop spa and sauna at the end of our busy sightseeing day.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
