review_479254426~“Visiting Brisbane ”~We booked this hotel by mistake, we were supposed to book the Ibis styles. We arrived at 7pm, checked in. There was a nasty smell in the room, 2 double beds when we didn't need them. The room had very few plug points. The pictures on website are very deceiving, the rooms are dated, very gloomy where the room corridors are and the carpets are very dirty. In the morning I made a coffee but there was no milk, so I walked out and saw the room cleaner and asked her for some, I also asked if there is shower gel she said we don't do shower gel here!  The next day I asked if we could move to the Ibis styles, but was told they are both different hotels, found it weird as they are both Ibis. They said they couldn't do that, so I requested a balcony room, and advised them of smell in the room. We moved to a supposed to be balcony room, walked in lugging our heavy suitcases to find they have given us wrong room. Then my husband went down to let them know that the room given isn't correct. The man at reception came to get our bags and bought them to the correct room. It was same kind of room, but with one double bed which was fine, and a balcony. Carpets were still very dirty. We found shower gel in the room, so obviously the cleaner lied to us. We had a early start the next morning 4am, so I made coffees, again no milk. Called reception and was told you have to come down to get it! I said leave it as I'm not coming up and down this should have been in the room. The day before the man at the reception told us when you leave we will come and get your bags, as we were on 16 floor and the lift only went till floor 15. I called reception and asked them and they told me they can't do that, by this time I lost it, I told them we were told this by your colleague now your telling me you can't, so much for customer service! Then he said ok he'll come and get them. We checked out, waited for our transport for airport, as we left not even a goodbye. Location is good as it's right opposite Southbank, close to shop, malls, bars, restaurants. But we will never stay there again or recommend anyone to stay there. Loved Brisbane, pity about the hotel experience. ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478688565~“No Complaints”~Service great, beds really comfortable, rooms clean and very close to city centre. Family holiday including a toddler and we where able to have two adjoining rooms that allowed the toddler more space to run through.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_478441505~“Comfy bed friendly check in thats the positives.”~This is a budget hotel. Check in was friendly and quick. Room smelt very musty, but room and bed clean, bed was really good. Bathroom wall did have a lot of black mould on the tile grout, which was a bit yuk. Positives are the room was large, clean and comfortable and hotel is a short walk to city centre. Price was $129 which include Breakfast(Autumn special). Breakfast was nothing great, probably the worst I've had in a while, bacon swimming in an inch of fat in the bain marie, yellow hardened scrambled egg well past its throw out time, dirty plates, some chipped. They have a pancake machine which made two tiny little plastic pancakes and I selected some fresh fruit which we both left as it was hard and completely tasteless. Would not stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~3~3~nan
review_476737852~“basic accommodation at a good price”~We stayed for one night over the Easter weekend to meet up with friends. The Ibis offered a good rate for basic accommodation. We had a room with two queen sized beds to fit two adults and two kids, the rooms were clean and a good size. Good location, about 7 min walk to Queen Street or the bridge to cross towards Southbank. Several cheap eatieries in the vicinity. Check in fast friendly and quick.~3~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_476242069~“Cheap and reasonable”~The best part about this hotel its merely its location. A short walk to Brisbane city centre it really is a good spot to stay in. It took me and my wife 10minutes and we were in Brisbane's southbank.  As for the hotel, parking was not included and we had to park around the corner in the next street at 40 tank street where there is secure parking for the cost of $17 a day. So if you stay for one night like we did its $34 and in hindsight it was probably worth splashing out on a nicer hotel with parking for the $193 we paid all up ($159 for a queen bed room, $34 parking). They also take $50 security deposit along with your payment but this is refunded after your stay.  It was reasonably modern but this is a basic, middle of the road accommodation for those looking to save some money whilst staying in the heart of Brisbane.  There's no minibar, the restaurant is on level one and has some reasonably good food on offer for an okay price. There's also a bar but we never tried it. It has wifi at $15 per day, a TV with basic channels, room service if you need it. The shower was okay, not very powerful. The curtains blacked out exterior light really well although if you get a room close to the lifts like we did you hear a lot of conversation outside your room.  The most tedious part was parking the car around the corner and walking back and forth between the hotel and car. It is cheap for a reason though, so you get exactly what you pay for.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474445841~“Musty smelling hotel and rooms, also ants in my bedroom”~Extremely disappointed with Ibis Brisbane. The first room I was given was so musty/damp smelling so I asked for a new room. Unfortunately it was no better. Third room better however it has ants. The hotel is very old and tired, in desperate need or total refurbishment, I won't be staying here again.~2~nan~4~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_473439816~“Great hotel”~Great hotel. Inexpensive, modern. Central. Can walk anywhere from here. Beside the casino. Good view of The Wheel. Lots of restaurants close by. Restaurant in hotel, also Irish pub right beside it. Shopping centre half a block.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473275860~“Excellent ”~Stayed here for 6 nights, really good location 5 minute walk from loads of shops, food such as pubs, subway, McDonalds, Starbucks. 10 minute walk from the man made beach.

review_472872396~“Cheap night, poor room facilities”~I have stayed at this hotel once before, some years ago and had a great stay. I chose to stay here again based on my previous experience. This stay however, was not as good. Unfortunately I was placed in room #219 which has a rather loud water pipe running right next to it, next to the bed to be precise. It sounds awful. Together with the usual sound of running water, there were clunks and other noises that made it sound like someone else was in the room. There are actually 2 access panels on the wall, so I assume the hotel are aware of this pipe, but have chosen to ignore the noise issue.  The fridge is also in close proximity to the bed and once again, unfortunately is very loud when it wurres to life. Perhaps newer fridges will be quieter.  #219 is also right next to the elevator. After being woken 3 times by the running water pipe and squeaky elevator cables, I called reception at 0130 and requested a room change. Initially, there was no answer. I googled the hotel and read that there was 24 hour hotel reception, so I called back a couple of minutes later and spoke to a kind gentleman who moved me to room #226. This room was a vast improvement on the last. Granted, it was a twin room with 2 queen sized beds and I had come from a room with only 1 queen sized bed, but I was a lot more comfortable with more space, no water pipe next to my head as I slept and a lack of squeaky elevator cables made for a less broken nights sleep. I say less broken simply as the pillows in each room I slept in were absolutely dreadful.  Perhaps a little money should be spent on the rooms, but I guess when I pay $107, that's what I deserve. Next time I'm in Brisbane, I'll expand my google search. If you wanna spend $100 a night, want a clean room and a comfy mattress, this is the place for you. If, however, you'd like to sleep through the night on a comfy pillow, without water pipe, elevator or fridge noise, look elsewhere. I will.  An upgrade to the rooms by way of pillows, carpet and fridge can't be too far away if Ibis Brisbane wish to continue in the fine vein of the Accor Hotel Group.~2~3~5~1~2~5~5~nan

review_469752204~“Location and informal surroundings”~An economical stay including a great restaurant. Hardworking reception staff maintain a very calm attitude among the throng of people at the desk. It was so reassuring to witness someone dealing with many questions and confused travellers changing their minds back and forth while the receptionist never wavered in her helpful and friendly manner. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The restaurant meal was excellent and the staff worked very well together.~4~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_469530611~“What a fantastic spot”~We were in Brisbane to see My Fair Lady at Qpac. We chose the ibis as we are Accor members, what a great fun location. Only 12 months old the decor and colourings are outstanding adding an element of fun and interest to our stay. The breakfasts were very good, we even had lunch there due to the rain. Comfy bed well appointed, all bet it, on the smaller size, but very functional. We will go back when next in Brisbane~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469363165~“If you can Don't bother”~Firstly, my company paid for the hotel but very disappointed. Firstly no onsite parking and the cost is $36 per day (special rate!!!). Now about the service One person on the front desk a=so expect a delay. Rooms are nice but pretty stock standard Then you find that a person has parked in what really is a non parking area in the drive way but naturally a stupid excuse is given. Also remember one person on the front desk in peak times - expect delays if your not the only person checking in.~2~nan~nan~3~3~nan~2~nan
review_468711205~“Good location but....”~If you arrive by car, stay somewhere else. Parking is in a multi storey in the next street at $26 per day. They don't mention the cost until you arrive. Plus, WiFi is advertised as available but it is another extra. In this day and age, WiFi is an expected included facility. I've toured up the east coast of Australia and in every hotel parking and WiFi were available except this one. Would I stay here again? Absolutely not.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468387740~“Breakfast Rubbish”~The buffet breakfast at this place is terrible. The eggs hard, fruit old and a very small choice of options. The restaurant is also very hard to access, especially for anyone with a problem walking and down stairs (the lift back up would't work for one of our group which made it very hard as they were recovering from surgery).~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468005989~“Good accommodation, but if you need parking ? Forget it.... ”~This hotel is easy to get to by car, making it ideal if you arrive that way, but the parking facility is located a block away and managed by a different entity.  This is something that is not made clear when you book, and if you are a business customer who needs a car to travel around town, this hotel stay becomes a major inconvenience.  Having to walk so far to get to your car is just not practical, not to mention the $36 per day they sting you with, something else that is not mentioned during the booking process.  Brisbanes weather makes it all that more difficult, if it's raining, you will get your new business suit and shoes wet, and if it's a typical hot Brisbane day, you will sweat so much that your business meeting may well be cut short by the client. There are plenty of other hotels in Brisbane that are cheaper, include parking under and also do not charge a ridiculous price for the convenience..  If you don't need access to a car, then this hotel is reasonable, however it's location is still a bit far from all the action of the main CBD, you will have ride a hire bike, get an uber, a taxi or walk in the fickle Brisbane weather.. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467120973~“Close to everything”~We came for a concert that was at Suncorp Stadium. Rooms are basic but comfortable. Bed comfy and provided a good nights sleep. Tea and coffee supplied as well as a small fridge. Just up the street from Roma Street Train Station. Short walk to Queen Street and Suncorp Stadium. Great location and we enjoyed our stay.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_465957577~“Great location”~Stayed here for 3 nights. Great location as it is right next to the city and everything is just a walking distance. My room was spacious and comfy. I also enjoyed the food in the restaurant. The front desk was also very helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465422452~“Home from home”~We love the Ibis. Love the location. Easy walk to trains, bus, city mall and Southbank. We also love the size of the rooms. We have never found an hotel that provides two queen size beds in the room. The meals are great too and the staff friendly.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465207321~“Good stay”~I stayed at the Ibis Hotel on Sunday the 5th of March 2017. As we were only staying for one night, three adults shared a standard room with two queen beds. The room was neat and tidy and a comfortable size. The bathroom was large which was great.  The Ibis on Turbot is centrally located, less than 10 minute walk to Brisbane City, Central station and Roma Street Station. We even walked back to the Ibis from the Gabba which took approximately 40 minutes however was a comfortable walk.  The staff were friendly and attentive and were happy for us to leave our bags at reception while we explored Brisbane on check out day. Would recommend and would stay here again for a short trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_465167779~“Nice Place”~Good clean room excellent staff basic hotel. Better for 1 night only, a stopover. Pity no restaurant at the weekends. Advised to go next door which was the Mercure hotel not next door but around the corner. Poor food and not good value. Hotel not close to the shopping centre.~4~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464946566~“Excellent hotel, close to Brisbane centre”~Couldn't fault the hotel and my room which had ample space and a view over surrounding buildings on one of the high floors. Very good bed and bathroom and attentive staff. They do have a spacious bar area and restaurant which is not used during quiet times, but guests can also choose to use these facilities in the next door Mercure Hotel which is also part of the Accor group. I enjoyed a very good meal in that restauarant during my stay. It is only a 5 minute walk to reach the city centre of Brisbane and maybe 10 minutes to reach the Central railway station~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_464067432~“Great Value!”~This ibis hotel is very well located!  It is a very good and affordable option and offers very large and comfortable rooms. At the exception of apartment hotels, this mid-range hotel offers the largest rooms at a very competitive rate!~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_463400294~“A Must”~This is the second time we have stayed in an Ibis hotel. The rooms are immaculate, comfy, and very private. This hotel also had the benefit of having soundproof walls. Over our 4 night stay we only briefly heard our neighbours in the hall, very quiet indeed! Staff including house keeping are friendly without being pushy, which I find very important. The hotel is close to transport and food options, as well as being close to a bridge to cross Brisbane River over to South Bank.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463316807~“Lovely welcome”~We stayed here for just one night, but would've been happy to stay for more. The receptionist was very welcoming and helpful, which was a good change from the grumpy bus driver en route! The room we had was fine, with a very comfortable bed, and was clean throughout. The hotel is right in the centre of Brisbane, just three minutes walk from the Greyhound Bus Station.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_461569090~“Terrible car parking”~Stay elsewhere if you're driving in and want access to your car. The car parking ($27 per 24 hours) is not connected to the hotel. It's in a public parking station that's a full block away.  There are no reserved spaces for the hotel. And there's no after hours access to the car park by lift or stairs, so you have to WALK DOWN THE VEHICLE RAMP.  The hotel website does not make the car parking situation clear.~3~nan~4~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_460536420~“it does what it says it does”~Excellent mid range hotel just a short walk from Queen street Mall and the river. Rooms spacious and clean. My sister was celebrating her 50th birthday and we were surprised in our room with a card and champagne on ice and balloons! she was very happy! Thanks to Cassie from housekeeping and Olga guest relations you made our stay memorable.I would definitely recommend this hotel for value and location. We will be back again.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_459956264~“Cozy little hotel”~Stayed three nights here on a business trip. Small hotel but with adequate amenities. Good for trips wherein you are outside the hotel for the whole day. Restaurant is simple. Location is pretty good as most iconic spots including the Brisbane Museum, Brisbane River, Southbank, and Kurilpa Bridge. Just two people manning the front desk and they cant handle a lot of guests at a time. Over-all, had a good experience here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459952504~“Hidden gem”~If I say too many nice things about this hotel they will raise their rates! Great location, easy walk to the mall after breakfast, or to the city cat, 5 minutes away. Biggest rooms in Brisbane with hot showers. So clean and comfortable. Breakfast is very well presented and so healthy, fresh fruit and poached eggs, serve yourself coffee and lots of hot food. Go over to the Mercure for a swim and the restaurant there is fabulous. Very interesting menu and great bar, so you can eat and drink at both hotels and charge your room. Great concept. Will definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459921523~“A super stay”~It was one of the best hotels I ever visited! A large room with incredible services. Staff help a lot! This is the best place to be in Brisbane on a holiday.

review_459837352~“Won't stay here again”~I will most definitely not stay here again, aircon not working for two days after reporting on the first day.

Annoying!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_459061480~“Clean and comfortable”~Stayed here for 2 nights on the weekend 2 adults 2 children. We had a room with two queen beds and there was plenty of room for us. Yes the bathroom was dated but it was clean and did the job. We didn't really have a view just a construction site but that was ok with us. We didn't have food there so can't comment on that. The hotel is a little hard to find, tucked up in a quiet part of street, unless your standing almost in front of it there is no large sign proclaiming the ibis. It's well within walking distance to queen st mall, casino (about 10 min walk) and about 20 min walk to Southbank and convention centre, QPAC etc. yes there is no parking and expensive if you take the ibis offer of $36 for 24 hours. HOT TIP!! Pre book your parking needs with secure parking online. They will give you a quote for the hours you require. Way cheaper!!!! The parking station is about a 3 min walk from hotel, literally around the corner, it was absolutely no big deal for us wheeling our luggage with kids in tow to the car park. Would definitely stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458985915~“convenient and well priced”~A comfortable hotel close to CBD and train station. Beds are wonderful, very quiet rooms. Air con cold.  Don't go for the view as there is only walls of office buildings, and don't go for the pool, it's a long trek next door to Mercure for a swim. Breakfast is great, although not for those with dietary needs. There never seems to be enough people on checkin/checkout, and a couple of staff there really need to learn to crack a smile. Most are lovely though. If you are looking for a comfortable and quiet place, close to CBD, at a good price, then this is the hotel for you. TIP: take a power board if you have a few electricals to plug in, there's not a lot of power points.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan

review_457965599~“Not impressed at all - stay at IBIS styles Elizabeth st instead”~I am a gold ACCOR member so was thrilled to be given a upgrade to a balcony room since I had earned with stays and points. Room was beautiful however, was not equipped with the requested twin beds instead 1 queen/king bed which wasn't suitable. Requested a move and was received by a lady who appeared to wish she was elsewhere. Was attending a concert so after discussion and told the hotel was sold out they found a room to relocate to. Perfect - no not all!!!! after going from top room to the worst room ever, smelt like mould, mould and moisture on roof. the duty manager had no other rooms so we basically made him as he wasn't really helpful initially to call around and put us in another hotel as we would not be staying in this room that should have been out of commission. We had to leave our bags at reception and hope a call came thru. Promptly a reply was received and we had a room at novotel ready upon our 1130pm return to collect our bags, they would comp a taxi ride for us. The novotel was so much nicer however our room wasn't ready and we had a wait while it was sorted (they were expecting us though as the booking had been arranged by IBIS, it was just novotel disorganisation)~1~2~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan
review_457782127~“Great rooms and food”~The rooms in the Ibis is bigger than most Ibis brand hotels.

review_457763188~“Good location”~My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights as part of our Ruby wedding anniversary celebrations. The hotel was well situated and easy to reach by rail from the airport. We were upgraded to a lovely room on the 16th floor but unfortunately the view was marred by building work. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was massive but unfortunately there wasn't a separate shower. Breakfast was super.

review_457501623~“Cheap and cheerful ”~This hotel is centrally located in the heart of Brissie. I was able to walk to most locations from here. It is definitely your average hotel, tea and coffee making facilities and a comfy bed. I was in town for a course and this was the perfect place to stay. The staff on the reception were friendly and helpful. I included breakfast in my staff which was probably not the best range of food, the coffee was from a very average Nescafé machine and the selection was pretty average. There are many coffee shops around the hotel that would have been a better option...~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456816575~“Reasonable stay”~Reading through other reviews I think there must be a big difference between rooms.Our room was very small and the view from the window of tower blocks. The bathroom was very dated with the shower over the bath and old fashioned tiles.There was a free wi.fi if you sign up to accept marketing material from the hotel although this was not worth doing as we never managed to get online as the signal was so poor.On the positive side the bed was very comfortable,the room was clean,reception staff polite and the location perfect for amenities.If you are happy with the price you are paying then it is the hotel for you.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
