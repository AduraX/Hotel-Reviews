review_476949139~“Great stay and awesome team”~Nice to see IHG returning to Brisbane, format of the new property is perfect for Holiday Inn Express. Well worth a visit! Close to the CBD and an easy stroll to the Mall and most attractions. The team are fantastic!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476061316~“Very pleasantly surprised”~Wasn't sure what to expect. Have stayed at many IHG hotels but not a Holiday Inn Express before. This is also a newly opened hotel. Nothing fancy, just nice rooms, good beds, decent breakfast and very friendly service. We would go back. Just one suggestion - the blue night lights are annoyingly bright, would be good to dim them or, even better, turn them off completely.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472596370~“Welcome Back Holiday Inn, even if it's Express.”~This hotel is a fantastic addition to the Brisbane scene. Being a new build, you get all the mod cons, latest TV, very nice beds etc. If you have stayed at a Holiday Inn Express before you will know what you are in for, functional room, free breakfast and a quiet comfortable stay. The hotel is a little out of the normal locale, so shopping and most dining options are a walk, but that also means it's very quiet, making for a restful nights sleep. I will be back, great value, friendly staff and everything nice and new!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
