review_473555093~“OK for one night”~Stayed for one night prior to an early flight the next morning. Hotel is 15 mins to the airport by car once you have worked out the route. On a main road into Brisbane but a little way out of the centre so might not be ideal for a longer stay. Room was OK - clean and bright. Had TV, air con, tea/coffee making stuff, comfortable bed. Bathroom was a bit scruffy and small but was fine for one night. My room was at the front on the busy main road but noise wasn't an issue with the window closed. Only problem was Wifi. I stayed at several hotels on this trip and researched dozens more and this was the only one that charged for Wifi. Even the smallest family run places give free Wifi but Ibis seem to think it is a chargeable extra. You get 30 mins free but this only works in reception, not in the rooms. After that, you have to pay and it is quite expensive. I think that this is something they need to review urgently as it would put people off staying here.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_461073110~“Fine for a few days”~What else can you ask for in budget accommodation? A comfy little room which was cleaned everyday. Clean shower, TV and free wifi. A fridge and a space to park our rental car. A bit far out of the city and on a main road but all in all pleasant. Self service laundry was a bonus. Also 'the low road' cafe and the vegan cafe just down the road were sooo nice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459487133~“Good budget accomodation”~Small room but has everything you need, air-con, TV, room is clean and tidy and big comfy bed. It is quiet and in a central location. All the Ibis Budgets are the same so not need to worry about what a cheap room is going to be like.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_456275377~“Quick stopover”~The room was adequate for a quick stop as we had an early flight the next morning. It's like a backpacker room with an ensuite. The bathroom is tiny, & I mean tiny! There is no lift, so I would suggest if you're just staying for a quick stop just pack what you need in a backpack. There is vending machines & things available & car parking. The trip to the airport was quite confusing though, so glad we had a gps!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455822896~“Clean, Disappointing.”~Arrived and got the shock of my life to find the room on the third floor "up three stair cases". ?a lift perhaps - no! So up we go suitcases and all and get the next shock.  My daughter and I decided we would choose the budget option and choose this hotel. Only room available when we booked was to share a queen room/ bed - that's cool.  But when we walked in we were horrified. No chairs to sit on, no microwave, paper cups for our coffee - and only two - so we had to recycle them for a tea tonight and for our morning coffee, a towel each but no washer, foot mat or little shampoo bottles. There is also only one pillow each.  They seem to be mistaking budget for nasty. Not a great start to our holiday.  The room faced the sun and no one had had the courtesy to close the blind so on a day at 35degrees the room was like an oven. There was no water in the fridge.  The positives- there is onsite parking, it is easy to find.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453960865~“Free Wifi is a LIE”~I am laying here in my TINY room and so unbelievably disappointed. The "free wifi" is an absolute joke. You get free wifi for 30 minutes, which mine cut out after 15 minutes and then you have to PAY a ridiculous amount!  $5 for 30 minutes (1000mb)  $12.50 for 2 hours (1000mb)  $22.50 for 24 hours (1000mb)  You can also only access the 'free 30 minutes' from the lobby and not your room. I rang the reception and asked why do they advertise free if it's only for 15 minutes to which she hesitated and then said because you are still getting a little bit for free. This is so wrongly advertised!! This was one of the contributing reasons I stayed here was the free wifi. Majority of your guests are backpackers so charging this amount for wifi access is an absolute ripoff. Especially when your advertise FREE. This needs to be put in the fine print. The staff are rude, the bathroom is dirty and small, the rooms are noisy as the place is ON one of the main roads in Brisbane and there are more then the wifi for hidden costs. The only reason I am giving the extra star is because the bed is relatively comfortable and the room has a tv.  If you are looking at staying here, go somewhere else where you feel welcomed and there are no hidden extras. You can find so many better places for the same price. So disappointed and not the way a business in Australia should be run. So dodgy!!!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439625354~“Choice of place to stay when I come to Brisbane”~I've stayed here for about 5 times this year. Always had great service. I arrived here 2 days ago at 10.15pm to find that i didn't have my name to collect from the safe. The lady i spoke to took my details and found that i had booked for the day after... but she was kind enough to accommodate me and my family for that night.. saving us a lot of stress. A big thank you to that lady (didn't catch her name) and the management team.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_439121480~“hospital visit”~the facilities are good the problem is with the accessible rooms which do not cater for persons in a wheel chair with the exception of the bathroom which is excellent. the in house breakfast leaves a lot to be desired our first breakfast was Thursday morning the bread had been frozen and was stale it smelt stale and tasted stale Friday was somewhat better still frozen bread but at least somewhat fresher. You would wonder why they need to use frozen $1 per loaf bread when they are in the center of a major city.~4~5~5~4~3~4~5~nan
review_433538727~“Was okay”~Was annoyed to find out a hotel didnt have a portable cot. Also had people in the car park drinking half the night being loud and keeping us awake. Over all was a good location but felt like room was over priced~4~2~3~2~3~3~3~nan
review_432812876~“Clean and close to city”~The hotel was an easy trip from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland by car as it is straight off Lutwyche Road. The room was small but clean and had milk, tea, coffee and soap supplied. The room had a double bed and a single bunk on top of it. I only had a small bag so I didn't have to deal with lugging the luggage up stairs.  I would use this accommodation again as for me it's easy to find, it is clean and not far from the city. I caught Yellow Cabs taxis to a night club called Leftys Old Time Music Hall in the city in Caxton Street. That is a great venue for live music, the cabs were just under $20 a trip and had nice taxi drivers. I was on my own. The cabs can pull up right out the front of reception.~4~nan~nan~3~nan~5~4~nan
review_432270982~“Cheap and very nasty ”~Very tiny rooms were ok. But getting up all the stairs with no lift and heavy luggage not ok. Location was ok. The bathrooms were filthy, with grime and dust in all corners. The unhelpful, rude, and downright obnoxious staff had us checking out a few days early and moving to another hotel. Don't be lured here by the cheap price.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431961232~“Clean, comfortable but small with no lift ”~We only stayed 1 night after landing at 11pm so for a short stop it was great. Not the closest to the airport and they don't have an airport shuttle so we had to taxi given the time of day. Something I'd bare in mind next time.  There wasn't a lift so with 5 pieces of luggage, a toddler and a baby it was tough getting to the room. But once we were in the rooms they were great for the night. Air conditioned, clean and comfortable beds. We didn't try the breakfast so I couldn't comment on that.  And few negatives but it was a great budget hotel that I'd consider using again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431413807~“Not bad for a budget hotel!”~The hotel is in a convenient location - handy to the city but lacking in nearby restaurants, bars etc. The service is excellent and rooms are immaculately clean and modern. The bathroom is minimalistic and is a very small space with nowhere to store your toiletries. My room faced the main road and so was subject to traffic noise. Overall it was value for money.~3~4~4~3~4~5~5~nan
review_423657996~“Tiny functional room”~Stayed one night in transit from brisbane airport to Byron Bay the next day. Late night check in available with key in locked box. There are stairs only, so have to lug your bags up. Tiny room but clean comfortable beds, which is all we wanted. Straight out onto the road to Byron Bay which was good.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_420377849~“pleasant surprise”~Very pleasant (one night) stopover. Good bed, clean room. Our room was on the 3rd floor which would not be ideal for carrying too much (and rooms are small anyway), but for overnight no problem. We stayed on the weekend so not much traffic noise even though we faced the main road. If staying during the week would recommend getting a room toward the back of the building. 24 hour MacDonalds across the road and pedestrian crossing 50 metres from building.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_419968471~“Great stop over for hospital visit”~This was a great stop over for my visit to RBWH. Just a quick walk down the road to the hospital saved on parking fees. Comfy bed and good service. Room was clean and tidy. Staff was friendly and helpful.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_415511893~“Great Value”~Small clean rooms, ideal for overnight stay when waiting for a flight. Good location not too far from the airport. Walking distance to take away and restaurants. Would recommend for overnight stay. Great value.~4~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_414958231~“Small and cheap”~Has what is necessary, nothing fancy but nice little room for the price asked and is situated in the area closest to the city. Bus stops are right outside, also has nice parking for those who hire a car. Is in front of Mcdonalds for a quick bite if needed. Pleased!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414101712~“Small but affordable”~The rooms are tiny, yet larger than what I have experienced at other Ibis Budget hotels. It is still expensive for what you get compared to the rest of the world, but cheap in Australian standards. The room was clean. It is a good place to sleep if you just want a bed and a shower for a quick overnight stay. Our room's view was that of another building's brick wall 2 metres away, which was a bit of a negative. I prefer this Ibis Budget over the Ibis Budget Brisbane Airport. It is less expensive and not that much further from the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413438973~“very tiny room”~compare to other budget hotel there is not much to complaint with IBIS Windsor as you get what you paid for. The good side is the room was clean and bed wasn't so bad, provide free parking which is a bonus in city. Downside however, is the toilet/shower room is way too tiny, Ive wondered what will happened if they have a big size customer? Also the front desk was quite rude and not welcoming.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_412736181~“Do not stay here unless you're desperate”~So it's 1am. I've stuffed the second towel I was given against the door to block out the light from the hallway in my cold echoey basement room with a wondrous view of the car park. There's been a ridiculously loud noise for 2hours like a broken fridge or air con from another room? I've turned off everything in my room, it hasn't stopped. The hot chocolate machine in the lobby is a winner. I'm scared to shower without thongs on because it's so mouldy and gross. I'm lying in the bed and am significantly longer than the bed. The bed itself is fairly comfortable, except my feet are dangling off the end. My entire feet. And I'm not a giant. I'm like 5'7", if you're taller don't even bother. I guess I'll sleep on a diagonal? The location is convenient, that's the only reason I stayed here.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410621128~“Clean Rooms”~The room itself is what you would expect from a budget hotel and the room was clean. The location to a bit to far to the centre to walk so we got a bus from just down the road. There is a Mcdonalds across the road.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_409798893~“Good value, clean hotel”~We really enjoyed this hotel. The staff are lovely, and he room furnishings were clean and modern.

review_406860251~“Windsor on a budget”~Pleasant receptionist greeted me. Remember reception closed 10am till noon. Room very clean, tea and making facilities, Fridge, TV and window for natural air. Road side can be traffic noisy, ask for room at back of Hotel which is very quiet. There is a McDonalds and service station over road otherwise not many eating places nearby. Plenty of parking onsite. This Hotel was refurbished about 2 years ago, and is modern. Compared to city prices, this is good value. Ill be back.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_405455984~“Epic disappointment”~I recently moved away from Brisbane but had to come back for business. The Ibis budget Windsor was located exactly where I needed to be for my meetings so I stayed there for the first time ever. I was shocked at the dismal state of the rooms and general low level of cleanliness and care of the facilities. The initial room that I was assigned has stains in the bathroom and on the bedside table. When I brought up the issue the staff was receptive and responsive. However, we inspected two other rooms before we could find one that was clean enough (and even then I found coffee stains on the wall). The room faced a very busy main road and I could hear traffic all night. I have stayed at Ibis hotels overseas and have always been satisfied. I shall no longer be staying at Ibis hotels in Australia.~1~1~4~1~1~1~4~nan
review_405262575~“Budget Accomodation”~The staff are lovely and the hotel has good parking facilities located close to the Hospital. The rooms however are rather small but adequate enough for somewhere to sleep. Unfortunately I found the level of cleaning especially in the bathrooms to be rather lacking and covered in a lot of dust and grime on the walls and toilet area.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400627588~“Good value and friendly staff”~The hotel is okay, good value and the staff is VERY FRIENDLY. It has a few downsides as well. Even though the hotel room is fine, the bathroom could be much better: the sink is way too small and it was hard to simply brush my teeth and when you take a shower it is difficult not to flood the whole bathroom.~3~5~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_395656498~“Great Value”~We regularly stay at Ibis it convenient, clean and well priced. Also the staff are friendly and helpful. Located 15 mins from Brisbanes CBD with ample parking something which other Brisbane motels don't always offer.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389601996~“Budget hotel: what you see is what you get.”~A one-night stop before traveling further. It is a clean, budget hotel, confortable bed, but dont go in with high expectations: no food available in the hotel except for a vending machine with very few choices. The bathroom was surely the tiniest I ever set foot in, and the water from the "shower" leaked into the room. Overall ok for one night but would not stay longer.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_387284006~“Good value, clean, good location, but too NOISY for me!”~Great location, close to the CBD, with a bus stop out the front which was very convenient. Clean rooms, great beds, pleasant staff and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, I was given a room overlooking the main road and noise from passing vehicles was quite loud, especially as there was no way of blocking the noise coming straight through the big ventilation hole located above the window. Noise from other guests was also an issue as the sound insulation between the rooms is not up to the standard of other hotels I have stayed in. If I could get a room away from the stairwells and overlooking the car park rather than the main road then I'd stay here again, otherwise I will look elsewhere.~3~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_385107739~“Cheap and cheerful - get what you pay for!”~A short two-night mini break with my boyfriend. Found a lot of other hotels very expensive so thought we would try this as was cheap and looked modern.  We picked up a hire car from Brisbane airport which made finding the Ibis really easy and plenty of free car parking on site.  The hotel is newly refurbished with a hostel feel to it. Reception staff were polite and friendly. Stayed in room 116, which was very quiet considering being on a main highway!  The bedroom was so clean and modern, great TV and the bed was SO comfortable which was a real treat for a budget hotel. Wet-room style bathroom was nothing exciting, floor gets drenched and very small so just ask for a spare towel at reception to mop up the floor with. All clean and no mould, just very basic.  Breakfast was included in our winter special room deal but I wouldn't suggest anyone pay $9pp as again, very basic and nothing special. Cheap sliced bread for toast, "fresh fruit" was just peaches from a tin, runny yogurt and UHT milk for cereal. Also the coffee machine and hot drink selection was very disappointing.  There is a Macdonalds McCafe across the road which would have been to a higher standard.  Cheap and cheerful, a good base for somewhere to stop after a long day, great location for city, airport and for adventuring further afield.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_381776182~“Don't go past it ”~Always stay here and think it's great. Ask for 3rd floor facing car park and it's a restful peaceful sleep. ( no lift though so be aware)  Occasional trouble with other guests but these have been dealt with swiftly and professionally - just people smoking in rooms which was a bummer.  Bathroom small but does the job Bedding Superb.  Tv,aircon, and tea coffee/baby fridge. Last year even watched the fireworks at the Ekka. On a bus route too with fast food across the road.  It's your choice but this does me just fine Great managers and staff.  More value than what you pay for.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_373216675~“Worth the price”~Considering all other hotels in brisbane are $150+ a night as well as parking costs, this hotel is fantastic value for money! The room is decent size with coffee making facilities, fridge, tv and AC! The only negative was that the bathroom needed sink bench space or a bench underneath it to store toiletries. The shower need a proper screen as the water goes everywhere or provide a few floor towls. Great customer service from reception.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_370267888~“Cheap & Cheerful outside CBD”~If you are looking foe cheap and cheerful accommodation and don't need to stay in Brisbane CBD, then the ibis budget in Windsor is well worth considering. Some ibis budget properties may need some refurbishing, but this one is crisp and new-feeling, while maintaining the budget theme. It's on the very busy Lutwyche Road just north of the General Hospital, but there was no noise intrusion in my room nor in reception and the breakfast area Staff was knowledgable, efficient and helpful - especially when I locked myself out of my room after hours in search of some late-night munchies! This property fits well into the budget end of the Accor portfolio, and I WILL be back~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
