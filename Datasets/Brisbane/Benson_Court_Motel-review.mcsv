review_467430401~“Clean, basic accomodation.”~While a bit dated, the room and common areas were clean and tidy. Our room was a good size with everything we needed for an over night stay. Being close to a railway line, the trains were noticeable at night - but we are used to total silence at our place so probably not a big deal if you are used to the city. The lady at reception was friendly and helpful. WiFi worked well but is unsecured.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_463083152~“Clean, Efficient, Professional”~This is a well equipped, clean motel with no fuss prompt help given by the owners. Washing machine, dryer, outdoor laundry drying area on site, microwave, toaster, fridge, plates, bowls, cutlery, small kitchen in room, Free strong wifi. It is next to the Toowong train station (can purchase, top up GoCard transport card). Shopping mall with major supermarkets, shops and eating outlets is next door. Bus stop right outside with 10 min frequency buses to city and University of Queensland. Buses to Koala Sanctuary just behind Motel. 10 min walk to ferry terminal which will bring you to city in 10 mins (3-4 stops). Ideal place for tourists and parents/students setting up for/visiting University of Queensland. Dedicated taxi call phone at reception. 25 mins to airport. Very clear instructions for late night checkin key retrieval from safety box outside. We found this place convenient, clean and efficient.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_237664198~“Cheap and Clean”~Benson Court Motel is old, cheap, spacious and clean motel, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located near Toowong train station and Toowong shopping mall, which is helpful for traveller and short time business visit. Not to mention its very close to the bus stop and makes it easier to travel around Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~5~nan
review_235068354~“Clean, convenient, and suited to a small family”~We booked in last minute, and were able to get a room to accomodate four. Very clean, with quite good instant coffee and tea provided. The kitchenette met our needs exactly, and the room was well-aired by staff each day when We went out.  Very close to public transportation to travel into the CBD or out to the western suburbs. Loads of restaurants, supermarkets and shops easy to access as well at Toowong Village.  Had to pay for wifi each day, and price a little steep for the style of property. However, the cleanliness, safe location, and excellent service made it worthwhile.~4~4~5~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_222796653~“Dated but clean”~I have stayed here several times and through 3 diffent owners. The rooms are clean but in dire need of modernising and freshening up. Rooms suffer a lot of road, train and pub noise depnding on which room you stay in. Cheap soap and no shampoo in bathrooms. I think this place is going downhill- attitudes are not great with the latest owners and things are not being repaired or replaced as they should be. I have started using a different hotel in Brisbane because of this and whilst this is not a terrible motel it is time to freshen up both the rooms and the attitudes of the staff. Good location for the Uni and dining.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_187817435~“Wonderful stay”~The frendly and efficient hosts, along with the spacious rooms make this a great place to stay in suburban Brisbane. Sofas in the rooms, motel-style bathrooms but still OK. Short walk to Toowong shops, and the railway station. Would definately stay here again.~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_159863944~“We Recommend This Motel”~This is in a great location if you are looking for accommodation in the Toowong or Indooroopilly Areas. It is also just a few train stops from the city or an easy trip along Coronation Drive. The rooms are air-conditioned, clean, spacious and come with a sink, microwave, toaster as well as a table and couple of chairs. There is off-street parking and a barbeque area. Our queen sized bed was comfortable. Toowong shopping centre is a short walk away, as are several restaurants and the well-known R.E. hotel. Benson Court Motel recently changed hands and the young family who now run it could not have been more helpful. We take pleasure in recommending this motel.~4~5~5~4~5~5~5~nan
review_143006091~“Recent stay in Brisbane”~Great location for access to university. Excellent value for money, short walking distance to many good eateries. Excellent sized room, plenty of room to spread out. Would recommend to those who want value and convenience.~4~4~4~4~3~4~5~nan
review_132579356~“Good location nice Motel”~I stay here often when I`m in Brisbane on business, rooms are very clean, spacious and have a sink and microwave as well as a fridge. There is aircon, a fan and small outdoor area for each room. Toowong for cheap eateries is nearby. There is a bit of road noise for the rooms in the front and a bit of noise from the trains for the back facing rooms, however it`s not excessive and to be expected especially if you like the windows open for fresh air. Staff are very helpful and there is a laundry and off street parking available.~4~4~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_120411338~“Handy location”~We were looking for reasonably priced accommodation as my husband was undergoing treatment at the wesley hospital. We got a ground floor unit at the back of the complex which was quite quiet. Off street undercover parking. Room was pretty clean although tiny bit of moulf in shower. Terrific water pressure and hand held shower with shower curtain. Bathroom is tiny but freshly painted. Queen bed was comfortable enough. Block out curtains so we could rest after treatment. Room had microwave and toaster so we made our own breakfast as shops were in easy walking distance.plenty of good quality restaurants and cafes too. Has great bbq area to cook your own. Staff very friendly and helpful. Tiny private courtyard. Sofa is nearing its used by date and not comfortable. Mini bar soft drinks. Unusually no shampoo offered. Air con and ceiling fan made it very comfortable. We definately would stay again as it suited our budget of $125 pn. Close to buses into city. Has internet available but too pricey. No cable tv just regular channels. Our fire alarm went off three times although we werent cooking anything?~4~4~4~3~4~3~4~nan
review_109840206~“Good motel in a convenient location”~The room and in fact the whole motel was spotlessly clean and the staff friendly and professional. The bed was comfortable. The motel is in a great location close to restaurants, shops and transport. We enjoyed our stay there. I'd stay there again.~4~4~4~4~4~4~3~nan
