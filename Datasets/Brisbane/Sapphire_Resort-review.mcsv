review_466243710~“Love the convenience of this place.”~If you are looking for an aged but budget place to stop over when visiting West End this is it.  The pool is great, Rooms are clean, staff helpful, parking some undercover.  just a short 300-meter walk to Coles and other shopping.  Sit at a bar (most face the street, have a soda water and people watch. Visit the Opp shops and other interesting novelty outlets for a souvenir, jewellery or books.  Then stroll back up for dinner at the restaurant, or stay in the main street and dine there in one of the many international style eateries, you will not go hungry.  Relax in the courtyard or take a dip, or if you have one, as we always have, sit on your balcony. We have taken in rain storms, see rainbows and watched workers coming home walking up the street...all very relaxing.  Airconditioned, t.v. and your own bathroom.  I have stayed there when my husband was unable to travel with me and felt very safe and comfortable.  I caught public transport that was about 15 mins walk from the Saphire Resort, near the Cultural Centre. All in all a great place to stay if travelling on a budget. when we have lots of outings to make near the city we choose to stay here.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_464595307~“Overnight stay ”~This Sapphire looks like it has just been dug out of the ground, it needs a lot of attention to make it sparkle again, but you get what you pay for. I think they might have ties with a chiropractic clinic as after spending a night on their beds I need one. The place is quite that is until you turn the A/C on. I think next time we might spend a bit more and get a better place.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_446220430~“One night only....ever.”~I understand that this is budget accommodation but hygiene standards still need to be adhered to. The bed coverlet smelled musty and unwashed. The curtains had dirty hand marks on them. The wall sconce had been broken and not replaced...bare bulb. The whole room smelled like stale urine.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443224598~“Cleaners not working today?”~Stayed for one night for a xmas party in west end, great location for this. However we got there and the room stunk like bleach, toilet seat was yellow from urine stains and pubes on the seat. Someone's old wine bottle in the fridge and a half drank lemonade. One towel had dirty hand marks all over it and a brown substance... I got reception up and he said sorry no cleaners today... Good spot but they need to hand the reigns over to someone who can do something with this place.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439837170~“Great value”~I've stayed at the Sapphire Resort quite a bit over the years, but this is the first time in a while. The good things are great - staff are friendly and eager to make things easy. I had to change the booking and it took 2 minutes. Location is wonderful - right by West End with loads of restaurant choices, and the cultural centre is a 15 minute walk, 5 minute bus ride. At the price ( under $100) it's great value.  The only glitches are the name (" resort" is a bit misleading, it's a nice motel with a pool) , the way too soft pillows and the lack of lifts. If you have any kind of mobility issues this is not a good place to stay.  I'll definitely be back.~4~5~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_431662722~“You get what you pay for”~We've stayed here twice now. The consensus is that this motel is in need of a makeover and it has no lifts, and i agree. The trick is to request a ground floor room. Saves lugging your luggage up more stairs fron the underneath car park. Security is good. Cafe Briz, on the corner and forming part of the establishment, offers a choice of meals at most reasonable prices. As for reopened "Twainese Kitchen", I prefer genuine China mainland tucker, but then again we like it spicy. The decor was good, with staff polite. Yes, we would recommend a stay at this motel for the budget wise.~3~nan~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_430767645~“Cleanliness needs attention”~We stayed for one night and paid $89.00. Phoned to book and was told that no rooms were available, however went to Booking.com and secured a booking. The location was great, the rooms were dated but to be expected for the price. The cleanliness of the room was poor especially the bathroom which had dirt in the corners of the floor and hair and spills on the door. If they sorted out the cleaning it would be perfect budget accommodation.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_430520881~“Guests NOT Welcome!”~This hotel is very basic, truly run down. This I could tolerate if the staff were accommodating and offer assistance to guests but everything we asked for was met with a "NO". You get 2 teabags in a twin room per day! If you ask for more, guess what it's a "NO". Late check out "NO" WIFI - "NO", towel for around the pool - "NO" Miss this place off your list it may be cheap but for what you get it should be free!~1~nan~nan~nan~1~2~1~nan
review_423390139~“Cheap, Clean and good location for QPAC”~We booked well in advance and got a double room for just $86, so we were certainly not expecting a lot from this resort. It did live up to our expectations for a cheap room. It was clean but definitely in need of maintenance and the resort overall needs a good update and clean. Staff were friendly and efficient. Had to pay a key deposit of $150, which we were aware of before hand (advised by email). This was refunded when we checked out the next morning. Secure parking provided at no additional cost. 10 minute easy walk to QPAC for us to attend a concert. Good location and we would stay again only overnight for convenience to attend QPAC. Not recommended for a longer stay.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_397174608~“Great short stay”~Rooms clean, staff very helpful and pleasant. Book in advance and direct with motel to get a good price. Short walk to supermarket and West End restaurants. Twenty minute walk to South Bank. No micro in room, but one on ground floor for guest use.~3~5~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_386778967~“Cheap accommodation, great location”~This place is old and a bit rundown but a great price for a great location. Book direct and save. All we needed was a bed for the night and the bed was comfy and the room was clean. The filling of the toilet made a dreadful noise and bathroom cupboards were water damaged but not a big deal. So close to all West and has to offer and Southbank.The attached Taiwanese Restaurant was really cheap and nice with an unusual menu. Really good wine for very reasonable price. The breakfast cafe beside it was also good value. Really nice staff in all three places. We would stay there again~3~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_386277390~“short stay”~stayed for 2 nights before moving down the Coast, clean and tidy, under cover car park, close to all amenities, but they did not offer the rate that was advertised on their site but proximity to 'downtown' made up for this.~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_356323266~“Only if necessary”~I stayed only one night and was pretty glad to check out the day early.  The amenities were pretty basic which was ok to me, but unfortunately the room was musty and the shower tap did not provide adequate running water for a comfortable shower. The bed was reasonably comfortable but I have to say the worst part of the room was the air-con that started emitting hot air after 3 hours of use. In fact, it was cooler with the air-con switched off.  Saving grace - the staff was pretty friendly and able to give good advice for my travels.~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~nan
review_352075395~“Pretty Average”~It might not live up to it's pretty name but it is an okay hotel. The TV is small and so are the rooms and I avoided touching the dunna without a sheet but otherwise good aircon and situated in a really convenient place. So that's a plus~3~3~nan~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_350646006~“Short stay”~Room was a bit musty when we first entered, it appeared to have been unused for a while. Patio area outside the room was great for a quiet drink with tables but no chairs. Asked at reception but none appeared in the three days we were there~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_345522424~“Resort ??”~Far from being a "resort" this notel is dingy and dark Only thing going for it is access to Boundary Rd and Brisbane R waterfront Rickety bed...dank bedroom Kitchen consists of bar fridge Building needs powerwash and fresh coat of paint top to bottom~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_341055764~“Again great place”~This is my second time staying at the Sapphire Resort. It is a great location, walking distance to everything in Southbank.

review_339297172~“Needs work ”~You pay for what u get the rooms were cheap - my air con didn't work that best . A certain limit on wi fi untill the next day . Bed was hard as a rock . Close to south bank that's what it's got going for it . A plus is the Chinese restaurant attached to it does amazing food .  I would stay again in a hurry .~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_333115982~“Basic, but clean and close to Southbank.”~In easy walking distance to Southbank, The Convention Centre, Qld Museum & Brisbane City Mall, and rail and bus transport, this resort is great for those who need a comfy bed & not a lot of luxuries. Clean & tidy room, no outside noise and a comfy bed. Tea and coffee making facilities and a little fridge. We had a second floor room, which was only accessible by stairs, so if you can't walk upstairs, ask for a ground floor room. The key deposit was a bit much - $150, but the staff are very friendly and helpful. We will stay here again in the future.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_332368280~“Very basic, but value for money”~We stayed for one night for a work function in west end. Location is great, it's walking distance to everything. Coles is 100 metres away, restaurants and bars line boundary street.  Car parking was free, but there is a sign in reception to say that as of the 1st Jan 2016 parking will be $15 per night. When we arrived to check in, the reception smelt so bad that we could t wait to get out of there. It smelt like off fish or something similar. I was worried that our room would smell the same. We were given a room on the third floor. There are no lifts, just stairs so only suitable for those who are able bodied. Luckily our room didn't smell like dead fish, but it did smell heavily of dirty bleach. Not even the fragrant kind. It was very strong, we had no other option but to leave the air conditioning on when we left for dinner. On the up side, the bed and sheets were clean. The air conditioning was cold. The fridge kept water really cold. The to was in working order. We stayed for one night and it was just a place to sleep. I would give it 2.5 stars for location and clean bed sheets. They need to do something about all the bad odours, it doesn't do their reputation any favours~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_332145302~“Close to south bank”~The place needs maintanace and needs to be renovated but the located wasn't bad and it was only for one night so we thought it was okay. It was in a great location to walk down to south bank though this may have been one of the best points. Price was reasonable.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_331140113~“Poo sign as you approached reception ?? Not exactly confidence building in what lays ahead.”~Roof falling apart just above the mentioned poo sign ? This place needs some serious TLC and maintenance, pool has missing concrete under the tiles , I even helped out doing some weeding around the pool edge while having a swim .( Qlds only piggy life guard is on duty full-time , look for the water tank in corner, sorry that was a running joke while having our swim hey PLUVI :-) . Bathroom was OK , fairly outdated and needed new taps etc , door knob was pretty loose and needed attention before someone was stuck in there. Bed was fine , room was clean but swollen wood work around fridge looks terrible . Staff were excellent, friendly and helpful .They need to make a effort to put a lick of paint from top to bottom , do the weeding and get rid of the 1981 satellite dish by the pool and all would be warm n fuzzy .End of the day , you get what you pay for .~2~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_331094005~“What rock bottom looks like”~We had to come to Brisbane for a gig - Booked the room well in advance and although it was cheap.. I didn't realise they would take cheap that seriously. Paid $150 for the room, arrived to be told they would need to take a further $150 out of our account for a 'deposit'. When I questioned this the guy pointed to a sign stating this would occur. We considered getting our money back for a moment, but then just lumped it. When we arrived in our room it appeared someone had vomited on the curtains and while laughing at the shame of it all - Decided to have a shower.. BAD MOVE. The shower was nothing more than a lukewarm dribble to which only made the rest of the experience so much more hilarious... Bed was bad, pillows BAD and overall the experience was well......BAD. One plus was we got our $150 they stole from us straight back into our account - So we could race home and have a proper wash.  Would not recommend - not for a second. Unless you want to be ripped, feel unclean and hate life.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_330771251~“Basic accommodation in a good location”~4 of us stayed here overnight for a concert at Suncorp Stadium which was about a 15 -20 minute walk away, very handy. Room was basic and did the job, nothing flash, but we slept well and appreciated the air-conditioning at this time of the year. Staff on arrival were friendly, although I do question the need for all the ID and credit card details even though I had pre-paid for the rooms, and swiped my card for the key deposit.... Guess I am overly suspicious as I now have a fraudulent transaction on my credit card being investigated.... It served its purpose, under cover secure parking was a bonus, associated cafe looked dodgy but local nearby eateries were great. Good price for location, you get what you pay for.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_327007301~“Good for price”~Great location with free parking ,nice clean room although ours was far from reception & pool with too many groups of stairs , only 2 problems in room - no milk in fridge & no water pressure in shower , friendly staff although we couldn't acquire a reasonable late check-out , overall good for what we paid~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_326800635~“excellent location on South Bank very short walk to the city”~Although an older property it is very clean and within walking distance to the city. should change name to sapphire motel would attract more business, resort is old school and not appropriate. The staff are very polite and very very honest my wife lost her engagement ring and it was found by the staff and left at the reception for us to pick up. Definitely the best valued accommodation within a short walk to the city with free secure parking. Excellent breakfast, restaurant attached to the resort (motel). Located in South Brisbane it is close to all the attractions of South Bank. Highly recommend especially for the budget conscious who just need clean and comfortable.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_326773616~“Avoid at all costs!”~Looking for budget accommodation well this place sounded perfect untill we arrived! Absolutely disgusting! The room smelt like strong cat pee the pool was so dirty you wouldn't dare let your kids in it and over all the whole complex was dirty! We booked in for 3 nights but left after 1! Very disappointed....the whole place is just a run down dump!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_324492262~“A bit dodgy.”~This place is definitely budget accommodation. Reception was very nice however a bit hard to understand because the mans accent was very thick. Car park is tight but safe with the gated entrance. A lot of stairs but not that terrible of a walk. The room is quite big and the bed is quite comfortable. However, the bathroom is really dirty wit the rusted taps and shower floor. The bedside tables are full of marks and stains, the bathroom cabinet is tearing off and the ac unit is really dusty with paint chipping off. Its an alright place though.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_324027235~“Has some nice extras, but is let down by lack of lift.”~Stayed four nights recently as our house was having the floors and verandas polished. The rooms are an adequate size, the linen was clean, the bathroom bigger than many other hotels. There is a swimming pool and excellent secure car parking -access with an electronic token-. The "extras" were coffee and tea making facilities and a refrigerator. The room is air conditioned. I note a previous comment mentioned there was no toaster; the reason for that is explained on the fire notice; toasters will set off the fire alarm if you like your toast cremated.  The hotel is located within a minute's walk of bars and restaurants, as well as a major supermarket and a number of specialty stores. The West End main restaurant precinct is less than 5 minutes walk away. Location par excellence! Unfortunately there is no lift and the hotel is built over a number of levels due to the sloping terrain. Our room was on the third floor, or the fourth floor if coming in via the car garage. We didn't have large bags -just 4 days of clothing-, but it would be a hassle with big luggage. One thing that will need to be addressed is the cleanliness of the stairwells , especially the handrails. Our room could have done with a new rubber door mat as it was totally devoid of the top layer.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_321738468~“Get together with friends”~It is a very basic room no toaster but there is a kettle the down side for me Was there was no disability rooms or assistance available for the bathroom with shower over bath.It is only a short walk to Coles/shopping centre short drive to Southbank~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_320783278~“A great budget hotel/motel close to South Bank.”~This hotel was a bit of a surprise, as I booked solely on price alone and it was close to Brisbane River.

review_311783400~“Budget for short stay”~It's in a great location to West End. Reasonably clean, a bit too noisy. Other accommodation places nearby would be dearer but probably better value. I recommend this place if you in Brisbane for a short stay.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_311129263~“Avoid unless you want to stay in Fawlty Towers - I will never return”~For some strange reason this hotel requires photo ID to check in and I just misplaced my licence at the airport earlier that day. Despite the fact I had already prepaid my accommodation and could supply a scanned image of my licence on my laptop but because it had expired it wasn't acceptable. I offered to show photos of my Facebook page. I had a colleague that could vouch for me. I offered to pay my deposit in cash but I still couldn't check in. My wife texted me a photo of my current passport, but this is still not acceptable.The idiot behind the counter had to call the manager and despite 2 hours later when he couldn't get a hold of him, and after I started yelling at this imbecile he threaten to call the police which I said please do as they would be able to ID me! After two and half hours he reluctantly accepted the passport ID. Tried to talk to the manager the next morning and he still hadn't turned up. I am a commercial traveller and I have never come across such extreme stupidity and obviously the guy behind the desk is either promoted beyond his abilities or the manager is such a tyrant that he is scare to deviate from the standard rules. It is a 3 star hotel, which I knew when booking, but the maintenance is lacking with skirting boards off the wall, handles missing, dodgy quick repairs jobs in the bathroom. Great location but I regretted my stay.~1~nan~nan~2~2~nan~1~nan
review_310351605~“ok for an overnight say”~This place is very run down - lacking TLC, which I guess reflects in the price you pay. Certainly within walking distance to the CBD and Southbank. A great location for us, as we went to the State of Origin and places in the CBD where charging $400 + per night. We couldn't get the sliding door open to the balcony, the air-conditioner is an old and noisy. Café on the corner serves a great breakfast. We had 3 rooms booked - overnight only.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_309459625~“Basic Accomodation”~If you are looking for 3 star near the city or Southbank then this is in the area. Staff, polite enough but no enthusiasm or assistance. No elevator, ok for our group but if you are older then this could be a problem. I still cannot believe that WiFi is not included a big disappointment~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_306122986~“Stayed here during G20”~Very close to the convention centre about a 10 min walk, a bit of a hill but nothing too strenuous.  Lots of nice cafes and restaurants about 5 min away.  The rooms are a bit dated but do the job & for what you pay its reasonable.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_300935124~“Sapphire is a cheap place to sleep; it is not a resort.”~In addition to having no lift, putting two people who are 70+ old onto the top floor seemed rather stupid. Then, we had to schlep our own luggage up the three flights. We were given a room with a broken television, a broken clock, and only one towel. When we advised them of the problems, we were given a different room, to which we had to go downstairs to collect the keys, move our own luggage to the new room, and overall spent our time there waiting to leave. It is really a lousy place to stay.~2~3~3~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_294900352~“$85 in Brisbane clean and basic”~Top west end position walking distance from the south bank and west end. they are open that it doesn't,t have disability access and you need to be able to carry your things up stairs but for the price compared to other motel rooms in the area it was fine. The restaurant is under renovation. You have a balcony if you are a smoker, the wifi scheme is expensive but the rooms are basic and adequate and good value for the price we paid with parking included it's just about the price of parking alone.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
