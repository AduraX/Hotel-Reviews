review_478084592~“Very helpful staff and great location”~A lot better than expected, very clean and new. A very good size unit with a lovely view of the night lights. Lots of good restaurants within a short walk. Parking was $25 extra. I would stay here again.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_477543284~“EXCELLENT”~First time stay and wasn't sure what to expect, upon arrival greeted by the friendly staff. Without asking the nice lady upgraded my family and I to an executive suite on the top floor, score:) Had a two bedroom apartment and it was beautiful, great views from balcony. stove was a little tricky to operate but we got there in the end. overall this property was neat, tidy, clean and had enough shops, restaurants and amenities near by. would of been five out of five but $25/night for parking was a let down, i think if you are staying at a property it should include free parking.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_475449900~“Wish we stayed longer..loved it here!”~My husband, mum and I booked a 2 bed 2 bath apartment for a couple of days, (initially), as we were coming to the city for my mums birthday and decided to make a weekend of it, although after a TripAdvisor search of hotels in the CDB area, this hotel seemed to tick all the boxes in regards to we were looking for. Well my instincts proved me right, in fact the hotel exceeded our expectations, so what you see in the photos you certainly get and more. On arrival we found the check in easy and the staff warm, friendly and accomodating. When we entered our apartment on the 28th floor..we were not disappointed at all, as we were greeted with an ultra modern, spacious and light interior with wall to ceiling windows and magnificent views of the Brisbane surrounds. We were on the Milton brewery side however with the Milton train station directly below our balcony, which was also quite noisy, but the balcony sliding door (closed) and windows are thick enough to shut out most of the noise thankfully. Everything in the apartment from the layout, decor, size, furnishing etc were very clean and super modern, although when we arrived, some of the appliances were not switched on or not that simple to operate including the fridge, TV, Dryer and aircon. All the technical features in the apartment including the ducted aircon are in my opinion "high tech" and take time to learn how to operate. So we called reception, who sent someone up to sort this all out for us. We had to call them on 2 occasions, but once it was sorted and everything in working order all was fine after that. Otherwise we enjoyed all other aspects of this perfectly located hotel, which included the modern and spacious spa pool, the gym, sauna and modern BBQ facilities, on level 6. Although too cold for a swim in the pool, we almost fell asleep on the super comfortable circular sofa. Finally one of the best features of this hotel is its location, being smack bang in the middle of some amazing resturants and cafes, located at the entry to the hotel or just a 3 minuite walk up and down park road. The Milton train station is also just a 2 minuite walk from the hotel entry and only a 7minuite min trip to Central City. We enjoyed it so much we stayed an extra night, and wished it was a week long stay. We were sad to leave, but we will be looking forward to staying again in the future.Well done Milton hotel!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474410498~“Great Staff, Great Location & Great Accomodation”~My sixth stay and absolutely nothing is to much trouble for the team at The Milton. 24th Floor this time with a view of Suncorp Stadium and the XXXX Brewery. As a Queenslander the location made the blood pump. Park Rd, Savior Fare and good restaurants all within a stroll. One bedroom apartment was very comfortable with all the mod cons.~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_473944125~“Excellent accommodation, great location and good value.”~We stayed here for 2 nights in a 1 bedroom apartment. The apartment was excellent on the 17 th floor with district views, spacious, modern decor and extremely well set up with a fully equipped kitchen & laundry. On the 6 th floor is large recreation area: outdoor swimming pool ,spa, 2 saunas and an outdoor eating area. The location was very close to many restaurants and transport modes. The staff were very friendly , helpful and housekeeping excellent. We would certainly recommend this accommodation which is excellent value and return again without any hesitation. Well done!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_473510727~“Great stay, location is good”~Rooms are good, little noisy when the windows are open. Internet is not all free, only 30min per day. (very poor) Swimming pool is small for for laps. Generally this is a good place to stay, much much better than the place i stayed in Melbourne (EXPERIENCE BELLA HOTEL APARTMENTS 250 City Road, Southbank)~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_471004294~“10/10 Hotel - Incredible Views! Amazing Staff!”~Had an incredible stay at the Milton Hotel, We were upgraded on arrival and given a suit with amazing views! The staff were incredibly helpful and offered to let us use the pool area while we waited for our room to be made up - Only to be told that our room was ready two hours early! Amazing service! The pool area was great! had heaps of room for relaxing outdoors and taking in the sun, also really appreciated the gym amenities. The room was spotless, and the bed was super comfy bed and the kitchenette was very handy. I would highly recommend the Milton!  10/10 Accommodation.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_469769962~“Best place I've stayed in Brisbane”~Stayed here for the weekend with my partner and was lucky enough to get the river view. Room was clean and spacious. Receptionist was friendly and lovely. Couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465981286~“Terrible”~DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP. Booked on line, requested a quiet room. Telephoned 2 weeks before arrival and confirmed that I wanted a quiet room, booked in and again requested a quiet room. Went to room which overlooked the railway station and busy road, returned to reception requesting a quiet room and was told the trains stopped after 11 pm and no I could not have another room. Next day after a sleepless night I returned from being out all day to find still wet towels in bathroom, rang reception and requested clean towels, 3 hours later went to reception and again requested clean towels. No sleep for 2 nights and no service, finally left and went elsewhere.~1~1~nan~1~nan~nan~1~nan
review_463861836~“Nice executive suites”~Stayed here on a trip recently for the Brisbane 10's. Had a single bedroom apartment. the apartment is quite spacious with an open living/Dining/Kitchen area. All modern equipment and a nice tucked away laundry as well. Towards the bathroom there is a little desk where you can sit an work. The bedroom was not large. Good closet space but not much room on either side of the beds. Bed was very comfy however and has view out onto the small deck outside. Bathroom was also well maintained however again not large. This type of apartment would be great for a single person on business or a couple who will spend most of their time out and about in the city. Proximity to the stadium means it was good for this access, however travel into town would likely require a taxi. The river is nearby and there are a number of good places to walk and exercise along there. Downstairs form the apartment is a couple of restaurants and bars, there is also a little craft brewery just along the road which is worth a visit.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_463345201~“Travel for work”~Have stayed at The Milton a number of times - it is truly a beautiful property and very modern. Rooms are exceptional. Staff outstanding - nothing is too much trouble. Great restaurants near by. Overall highly recommend.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460541750~“Average”~Nice modern apartment, close to restaurants.  Noisy being above Milton station, with views of the station and XXXX brewer sign (flashing on all night). Only lightweight blinds so no block on noise or light through gaps. There are probably many more of the same standard close by. Might be a different experience on apartments facing Brisbane River so ask before booking.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459119481~“Awesome accommodation ”~Had an amazing stay, service was great. One of the receptionist named Lyndsay was very helpful, polite and gave me some great information about some local restaurants. Would definitely stay again. :) thank you heaps, you guys rock!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458194775~“awesone”~room was great exception service apartment was one bedroom with all facilities. balcony austar, gym which was well set up and all equipment needed. I would definitely stay there again. well worth it the money even though not that expensive.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_455130985~“A great stay”~We recently stayed at the Milton with our 2 children (aged 1 and 3) for 2 nights and it was a lovely place to stay.  The rooms are spotless and still feel like new. We had a 2 bedroom apartment that overlooked the city and river and had spectacular views of the Australia Day fireworks. The apartment was spacious and extremely comfortable. The car park was safe and easy to access ($25 a night) and there were numerous choices for breakfast, lunch or dinner within walking distance.  Although we didn't use it we could see how easily accessible public transport was with the train station a stones throw away and the city ferry service at the end of the street.  Terrific value for money and if we were coming back to Brisbane would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454821412~“The Milton”~We had a two bedroom apartment overlooking the Brisbane River which was comfortable and spacious with the bonus of a balcony which was perfect for late night city gazing! There was a well equipped kitchen and separate bathrooms for each bedroom. Within walking distance were numerous restaurants catering for all cuisines, Access was easy by car and public transport and only minutes to the city centre. An excellent location for a very reasonable price.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_453125477~“High Quality Accommodation. Great Location”~Title says it all. One bedroom apartment top specification - outstanding. Station located immediately next to apartment block makes it easy for travelling. Also minutes walk to ferries. Lovely pool area. I can't recommend highly enough. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452217173~“Very very nice”~I stayed here for the night on the weekend and was very impressed with the hotel. Room was cleaned to a high standard (my type of standard), lovely modern and near new. Walking distance to restaurants. I ended up parking on the street for free a few hundred metres down from the hotel and there were plenty of free bays with no weekend restrictions. A river view would have been nicer but hey can't have everything. Good sized balcony and considering my room over looked the railway below there was no noise with the doors shut. Lovely hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447905581~“Xmas Stay”~The property is excellent quality and in a superb location. Close to the city and convenient for public transport, the food strip and Suncorp stadium . Our family enjoyed the stay as it had something for everyone .~4~nan~nan~4~5~nan~4~nan
review_447658338~“Watch the Brisbane Roar play at Suncorp”~My husband and I and another couple travelled to the city to watch the Brisbane Roar at Suncorp Stadium one Friday night. Instead of driving there and back as we normal do, we booked a 2 bedroom apartment at The Milton and walked to the game. The apartment was very well priced + huge, very new + modern. And wow what a view of the city from our balcony. Fully equipped kitchen, large lounge area, 2 bathrooms + large bedrooms plus secure parking underneath. The car parking costs extra. The pool and BBQ area was amazing. Very clean, well maintained + modern. The pool + BBQ area is the best I have seen at any hotel so far. We checked in at 3pm Friday + enjoyed pre game drinks + snacks in our room, then it was an easy walk to the Stadium. Watched a great game then walked back stopping at the bars + a brewery on the way. There are the famous Milton cafes + restaurants just up the road, also some cafes + restaurants at the street level in The Milton Hotel building. We did hear some noise from nearby restaurants + bars from our room late at night but it wasn't that bad. The Milton train station is right next door so you hear the trains as well. In the morning we used the pool + BBQ area for a swim + to cook our breakfast on the BBQ. It was a great night + we plan to come back + watch the Roar again + will definitely stay at this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445108600~“Recovery after surgery”~My favourite place to stay in Brisbane. Beautifully quiet, friendly staff and an perfect location, The Milton was the perfect place to stay after my recent surgery. The farmers market at the end of the street on Sunday was a nice addition to the already spot on location. Walk everywhere, a well stocked IGA a stones throw away, quality restaurants and coffee on the door step. My view from level 24 was like a postcard. I can highly recommend this location. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_444911587~“Overnight stay”~Great staff, great rooms, fair price. Only advice, find extra pillows in the cupboard :) Pool facilities were great and well looked after. Would recommend to friends and family, as well as stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443830076~“Excellent location, views and rooms!”~We stayed at the milton from the 5th to the 12th of December for the Coldplay concert. The location was fantastic as suncorp was a 10 minute walk away, we were on the 25th floor so we had lovely views of the city surrounds and the room was modern, stylish and very impressive for the price we paid. Very happy would stay again for sure!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_443507774~“Amazing modern apartments”~Amazing, beautiful modern apartments! Stayed in the one bedroom room, and the view is breathtaking! However, be quite mindful when paying the bond on credit, as it does take a long and tiring process to get back. Despite that, the location is really convenient, as it is located right next to the station. Impressed with how modern and clean their rooms are, will definitely be coming back, but will be paying cash for the bond next time!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442511367~“Concert ”~Awesome area to stay so close to suncorp and a lovely lady called Tara helped us extremely well. Just be careful these are owned privately and they can take your booking unexpectedly which i was unaware of. Check everything is on track before you go.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442280908~“Great location, clean and well maintained ”~These serviced apartments are brand new and are extremely clean and comfortable. Very close to the train station, lots of restaurants and an IGA around the corner too. I didn't take advantage of the pool, gym, spa, etc. so cannot comment on those facilities. Opposite the XXXX brewery too and their lights stay on so be warned that they're fairly bright.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439848393~“Fantastic Location”~This hotel is situated right above Milton station which makes it very convenient to all of Brisbane. Bonus is you can't hear the trains! The rooms are very clean and well appointed and the staff welcoming.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_439604261~“Staying for work but great location for after work too”~I have been staying at the Milton Brisbane now for 6mths fortnightly. The rooms are always clean, amenities great to use, location is amazing, but by far the team on the front desk are the best !! Lara, Jessie and the guys always greet me with a smile, they know me and they have all me info and room details ready to go when I arrive no matter what time of the afternoon it may be.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_439167075~“Was visiting for business”~The rooms are great - new and modern. The bedroom and leaving space are separate which makes it feel spacious. Annoying though that the spa wasn't heating and the pool in the shade by early afternoon. Well located to a number of good restaurants.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_438939795~“Extremely comfortable 3 night stay”~I stayed the The Milton for business in November and from when I walked in I was charmed. Really fresh and new. The room was nice and spacious and so comfortable! And I can't really complain about the view!  The only thing I would point out is the gym and pool are smaller then the photos shown online, but no real biggie! The hotel isn't far from the walkway along Brisbane river.  There is lots of restaurants nearby too.  An extremely comfortable stay, I would definitely visit again for leisure or business.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_438870997~“Staff that always go the extra mile”~I stay at the Milton regularly for work, the rooms are great and the staff there are fantastic. A big shout out to Lyndsay who always goes the extra mile from giving my boss from the UK tourist tips to making sure my bags get up to my room!~5~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_438179988~“Book the extra options”~We have stayed at this hotel a couple of times and are looking forward to staying again at Christmas. I just spoke to the Sharee(sp?) at the hotel and found that there are some great options available for a reasonable fee. 5pm checkout is a great option as you get to enjoy the whole day poolside. The assistance I have received is fantastic as I was worried about not having cooking facilities but everything is there to cook Christmas dinner. Extra parking was also available for my family so this Hotel is a definite winner.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_437723584~“Visit”~I was very pleased with the service the company had to offer. The Milton was a great experience for my partner and I. Rooms were cleaner than a dogs bowl after dinner! The view was amazing and i got my special request which means the staff goes that extra mile if your polite to them! We will be back soon.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_437600858~“Clean, new, with the great fittings”~Clean, new, with the great fittings - it was terrific to have a veranda and the location was perfect to walk to dinner and the office - great views. It was a shame the destruction was going on across the road, but that will only be for a short time.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_427506125~“Modern complex close to everything”~Lived here for close to a year. The complex is ultra modern with everything you need - rooftop, pool, gym, sauna, guests lounge rooms. Close to restaurants, public transport and entertainment. The rooms are fantastic and everything is brand new. Lifts sometimes take a while and the car park can be frustrating to find your designated car park as well as deal with people in a hurry who make it dangerous on occasions.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_426023569~“Meh”~Very shiny and new looking. Good location. But for the price, not worth it. Super noisy with the trains rumbling below, staff were civil but unable to either smile or make eye contact instead pained expressions ruled the day, happy to prioritise a handyman wandering round reception over obviously waiting for 10 minute plus guests ( not even a small nod to indicate welcome or that we had even been seen). Parking is complicated, with relevant car spaces scattered over multiple levels with unclear labelling. I had to laugh at the proclamations of being environmentally friendly (towels,soaps etc) yet the insistence is that the dishwasher be turned on to wash the three cups we'd used or we'd be penalised $150 for being excessively untidy. Oh and the advertised "Free Wi-Fi" is only for half an hour. That is not free Wi-fi. That's a bit of Wi-Fi free. So overall okay, but probably not for us next time.~3~2~nan~2~nan~nan~2~nan
review_425702233~“Excellent room!”~The rooms are really new and nice with everything you might need in there. The service is also very good, the people are great to deal with. I love the charge back options for the local restaurants, makes the stay easy.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_424578895~“Great location”~Great location within walking distance of Suncorp stadium, ferry and train at your door. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment very modern and clean. Ribs and Rump just down stairs and just around the corner are a variety of restaurants. Close to the city centre. BASIC kitchen utensils and cookware. No instructions on how to use the stove and no information on where to go or how to get there or what is around. Parking is additional. AUD $25 per night.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_423000702~“Fantastic rooms in a great location”~The staff have always been friendly over the 3 times I've stayed here in the past couple of months. The rooms are lovely and modern, with a spacious layout. Some other guests once heckled myself and my friends as we were leaving for the evening, and I was pleasantly surprised when they offered to waive my parking expenses to make it up to me after I brought the problem to their attention.~5~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_422222581~“Lovely new apartments”~The location was great, we stayed here for a Reds game at Suncorp, this was the perfect place to stay for easy access. So easy to get to the train station. The apartments were spacious and very new. Kitchenette as well as laundry facilities. Great views of the city. The staff were very accomodating. Ribs and Rumps are situated in the same block, so really convenient for a great feed.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_422203197~“Mostly a hit but a few misses”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment on a high floor. Views were incredible. The pool and gym facilities are excellent. The apartment was clean and comfortable with the basics in kitchen utensils and cookware. To be clear, The Milton is not a hotel, it's a serviced apartment. There is little information provided to guests on check in about the 'hotel' or about the surrounds. An amenities book would be handy to explain things to guests. The lack of free wifi is really not on. These days I just can't really see any excuse as to why you can't provide this service for your customers.  Location is great and proximity to train and ferry a plus. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_421863461~“Mostly great”~The positives: - great location, close to everything  - very new building - clean and tidy and well appointed units  - friendly staff  - 2.2m parking  The drawbacks: - your room card (key) only let's you get to the floor you are staying on, which is very annoying if you have other family staying and they are on a different level - the staff are very uptight with their policies. By this I mean, when I checked in and asked what room my sister was staying in they would not tell me. And when my sister checked in, she tried to also check my father in so he didn't have to come and do it later and they said no. Even though she was the one that made all of our bookings and the one paying for all the rooms. I understand why they have these policies, but it's helpful to others to know how rigid they are. - the car parks are pretty tight Overall, I would stay here again. But not as a big group with a couple of rooms on different floors.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414423079~“Wonderful luxurious stay!”~Stayed here for 2 nights. Was welcomed by polite reception staff who made checking in quick and simple. The room was perfect..clean AMAZING view of the Brisbane river. All the amenities were great Pool,Gym,Spa. This place is in a convenient location and definitely a 5 star experience. Will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_413843894~“Amazing city views”~The Milton Brisbane was by far one of the most comfortable and relaxing 4 day breaks I've had in a long time! We had a gorgeous 1 bedroom suite on the 28th floor. The views from this room were spectacular, the bedroom and bathroom space very spacious and the convenience of having the train, bus and ferry all within walking distance was an absolute bonus. The location suited us as we were close enough to the city to enjoy the nightlife without being in the centre of all the hustle and bustle. A special mention to Chari and her team at the front desk is warranted. We truely appreciated the special attention and care taken with our reservation and definately made our stay in Brisbane a very memorable one.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
