review_478486049~“Getting there...”~Hi Really nice hotel, staff, food. BUT...some signage on Kingsford Smith Drive as to how to get there would help! We could see you, but not obvious how to get there! Even on your website when booking in, at least give some hints. Also , how to get to the Airport from your place (dark at 5.00 am and not at all obvious which road to take...). Best wishes~5~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_477837216~“Good option for airport stopover”~Stopped here for one night perfect as was flying in and out so no need to go outside hotel. Clean newish rooms, quiet. I think transfer to terminal was aud 15 which is steep considering the short distance. Breakfast buffet was basic but fine, great omelette~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_476244180~“A mixed bag!”~We were using the hotel as a close stopover after a very long journey from Swansea, Wales for my ill husband. We ere greeted by a charming Kayla at Reception....she not only brought our cases to the room but as she had empathy with my husband, she sent us up two milkshakes! What a kind gesture!  The bed was very comfortable, superior bedding and we both slept well. The room itself looked fine..large and comfortable but had quite a musty odour. We would have asked to change but my husband was too exhausted. Breakfast was in the large dining room with a lovely bright outlook. I thought the Continental Breakfast was tasty but overpriced after comparing it to the 2 dozen hotels we have just stayed in overseas. Shuttle service was prompt and reasonably pricesd. In conclusion, Kayla is a gem...hotel okay!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475651882~“Not at the Airport”~We stayed one night as we had an early flight the next morning. We had paid in advance but when checking in were asked for a credit card. We said we had paid in advance for our room but would pay cash for anything else we needed. The receptionist quite aggressively said in that case we wouldn't be able to use the wi-fi or TV. If we had given her a credit card these charges would have been added without us knowing. We decided not to use the internet or TV. We also decided that everything else was likely to be a rip off so we would not to bother eating there.The next morning we discovered the shuttle cost 6 dollars to get to the airport, a ten minute journey.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~4~2~nan
review_475448074~“Should Have Stayed Here Sooner!”~Had a one night stop over in Brisbane before turning home from interstate. My wife and I decided to stay at the Novotel as we had an early start the next day and wanted to be close to the airport. We usually stay in various motels in the Hamilton area as we thought the Novotel brand to be more expensive than what we usually spend. Taking into account the taxi fees to and from these motels made staying at the Novotel nearly the same price. Great friendly service on arrival, a good sized room, immaculately clean and a more than adequate restaurant on site. We both said that we wished we'd done the maths years ago - will definitely be returning.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_475106589~“Amazing service!!”~Absolutely blown away by the service here! Arrived at the hotel at 6am from an overnight flight totally expecting to have to wait HOURS to be able to check in. Jim at reception, made a few phone calls as he went off shift at 7am, and advised the new shift we had arrived and the reception/housekeeping teams had us in our room before 8am!! (Which meant we could FINALLY lie down). Super friendly service also from Jeff the porter :) Rooms are meticulously clean. Modern and well appointed. DFO right across the road (poor credit card...) AND possibly THE BEST cheesecake I have ever eaten from the restaurant downstairs! (I eat a lot of cheesecake - the choc tart is pretty damn good too!) All in all, a fabulous stay and would absolutely recommend to anyone passing through Brisbane~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474855003~“A great way to start your holiday”~When ever we go on holiday we love to stay at the Novotel at Brisbane airport, its a great way to start our holidays. Its always clean, tidy and comfortable. We just love the fact that we don't have to worry about traffic and getting to the airport on-time for our flight.

review_473791859~“Top Notch...and great with the kids!!”~We were recently stuck in Brisbane due to flooding in Rockhampton. We booked online easily and got a $15 taxi from the International Airport to this motel. It was very quick and convenient. There is a 24 hour Woolworths across the road for any emergency purchases, and a lovely restaurant downstairs. When we arrived we were greeted by a lovely young concierge who whipped our bags up to our rooms before we could blink along with little gift packs for the kids (aged 6 & nearly 8) to keep them entertained. They spoke to the kids as well as us - most motel staff dont acknowledge children...so that was nice. Our room was new and modern. The bathroom was massive (almost too big). I should have reviewed the pillow menu earlier as the pillows were all like custard and were terrible to sleep on...which was a shame because the beds were actually pretty comfortable. The restaurant was lovely. I had the mushroom risotto - which was delicious. Again the kids were given a menu they could draw on...with crayons. We all enjoyed our meals. The next day we were again greeted by a lovely concierge who tracked down a taxi for us, made jokes with the kids and ensured everyone was taken care of. Overall...we will definitely be back  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472258247~“Good stop over”~It was the first time we have stayed here, there is something about all Airport hotels THE PRICE maybe because they have you over a barrow, Like all airport accommodation if you won't to stay close to the airport you pay through the nose.

review_472042742~“Great airport hotel ”~I was caught here waiting for a flight to Mackay during the cyclone and I was very impressed with the service and the great quality room service. Room was clean and spacious and bathroom of a good size. The hotel is next to a shopping centre. The staff were very helpful the only issues I had was with the internet which I got sorted and they kept on calling to me to ask when I was checking out as I had extended due to the flight situation so separate bookings but different staff called to keep checking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471763403~“Good way to start a holiday”~Arriving in Brisbane and being unable to stay overnight with family as they had been affected by the Cyclone Debbie floods, we called the Novotel for a room prior to departing on a cruise. Reservation staff were excellent and were able to find us a room we could check into at 1030am. Much appreciated with a toddler in tow. Room was lovely, clean and quiet and we made use of the cool roof top pool. Great location next to restaurants, Woolworths and DFO. Lovely dinner in the hotel restaurant with staff taking extra care to look after our daughter with crayons and paper to draw. All in all, a pretty good way to spend a day.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471196596~“Overpriced for poor quality service”~We used this hotel whilst attending a concert at the entertainment centre - thinking that this would reduce travel time and the cost of taxi'ing home. Sadly, we were extremely disappointment with this overpriced room. The location is highly convenient when considering access to grocery and retail outlets. However, the services at the hotel are extremely limited. Most significantly we were extremely disappointed with the facilities. The gym is smaller than a small bedroom and contains only 2 pieces of equipment and some free weights. The breakfast (which was not included in the price of the room) was average, and again expensive, increasing the overall cost of a disappointing venture.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~4~2~nan
review_470187747~“Stayed overnight - so convenient to the Airport”~Located at the Brisbane Airport was very convenient for us - but it's a little tricky if you are driving to it (they could do with more sign posts as we turned off at the incorrect street but still managed to find our way). We arrived in the wee hours of the morning and left 6 hours later - bit of a shame they still charged $20 for the parking.  Nevertheless, the room was good - bed was comfy - nice-sized bathroom with amenities.  Good service at reception. Fine for an overnight stay and would do it again.~3~nan~5~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_469898314~“Last minute booking surprise”~After a flight cancellation, we arrived at the hotel late at night, tired and "frazzelled". A couple of complimentary drinks & the fact that the kitchen stayed open an extra 30 minutes to cook us a proper meal instead of a midnight snack made a world of difference.  The room was comfortable and spacious, however the pillows were too small and made for an uncomfortable sleep. The $5 shuttle bus had us back to the airport promptly in the morning. Very impressed with their service and it made the best of a poor situation for us.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468732273~“Great overnight stay”~The hotel bus transfer is good to and from the airport or rental car depot and it is great for overnight stays or more.

review_467406287~“Overnight stay”~We booked this hotel as it is close to Brisbane International airport. When I drove up and parked out the front there was a gentleman at my car door before I put the brake on. He helped my husband out of the car and helped with our bags. Check in was a breeze. I must admit the elevator was slow but once in our very large room we could relax. Just across the road is a small shopping center. We met with friends and had a meal in the restaurant which I thought was expensive but the food was nice and the service was very good. If you are flying out early this is a very convenient place to stay.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_466666266~“Very annoying”~Hotels encourage booking with them directly online which is what I did yesterday ... two rooms quoted $250 each. Requested rooms interconnecting or beside each other and this was confirmed as being booked. How annoying is it then to arrive to be given two rooms not together - no advice either beforehand or at reception - I looked at the room numbers and asked if they were beside each other as was confirmed during booking, only to be told no but that there is only a couple of rooms in between ... (3 actually) . When I advised that the booking had confirmed rooms beside each other I was then advised there was a "maintenance" issue ... what a coincidence that a sudden major maintenance issue should arise within 24 hrs (which was about the time I booked) that couldn't be fixed ... must have also had an issue with the phones that they couldn't ring and advise me ... oh and the price of rooms today ...$199! Not advised of any adjustment to my room price ... seriously tired of poor service, poor management . It's the Stamford or Marriott for us in future irrespective of early flight departures .

review_466538639~“Definitely one of the better airport hotels..”~This isn't a large hotel; the Reception staff were genuinely friendly and very helpful.  Rooms were of a decent size, very clean with all the usual facilities. For an additional fee they offer a late check out (5pm) which, for myself, proved very useful as I had a late evening flight.  I ate in the restaurant on two occasions..there is a varied menu and the food was of good quality and the portion sizes reasonably generous. There is a shuttle bus that runs between 5am and 9am in the morning and 5pm and 9pm in the evening to both the Domestic and International terminals...the cost is $5. Reception will reserve your place. If you have time to kill, you can walk over to the Mall (3 minute walk)...plenty of shops, cafes etc.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_466430408~“Our stay”~Stayed here as a quick stopover before an early flight over seas. The room is great, the block out curtains are fantastic for a quick snooze after a early flight. Had an evening meal at the restaurant the food was very nice and lovely. Only downside was the fire alarm at 11.30pm at night just as we got to sleep as we had another early flight next day (which they can't help), the one thing that we are aggreaved with was that it was announced over the fire PA was "please hold until further notice"....no further noticed was received whether or not it was a false alarm... Which is evidently was... Other than that nice hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466177341~“Staff make the difference again”~Recently stayed at the Novotel near Brisbane airport - typically Novotel -efficient and functional - nothing over the top. However if you decide to eat in the inhouse Resturant - reach out to Wei. I met Wei a couple of years ago when she was a student. Since then she has graduated in hotel management and she is just really lovely. I dont think she is the resturant manager per se but she leaves others for dead. She is engaging, knowledge, interest and interesting and certainly make having dinner in a busy restaurant after a challenging day a delight. She makes Novotel stand out~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~5~nan
review_466153996~“Consistent high quality hotel close to airport”~I have stayed at the hotel on a number of occasions as it represents a good interface with early morning flight departures. Consistent high quality service in all areas. Also within walking distance of DFO, coffee shops, restaurants and a tavern. While it is a bit more expensive than other hotels in the vicinity, it is good value for money. However, would like to see free parking included - currently $20 per night.~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_464380646~“Not the most welcoming of welcomes.”~The first time when driving into their site; very unclear instructions and parking. Website is deceptive and misleading; no mention on the ph website that there is a charge for overnight parking. By the time you get there (especially if you're not a local) it would be too late to cancel your reservation without a penalty. How many people get stung by this? I did receive a comp for my parking; not immediately offered (when they had even checked their own site and confirmed my claims) & I asked for it as specifically chose this hotel for its location being central AND that I wouldn't have to waste money on parking. If you're just visiting their restaurant for dinner; free parking but not if you're paying them significantly more $ to stay!! (Recently checked the mobile site and still haven't updated their info on parking; shoddy and deceptive conduct! It shouldn't take weeks to update a website.) Staff are courteous. Rooms were on first inspection clean, tidy and as you would expect for a $200 a night hotel. Location as mentioned above is convenient. 24 hr Woolies across the street. Close to the airport and all motorway links. Approximately 10ks from the city. Little touches let them down; no mention by reception staff if there's free wifi and if so; password etc. Their brochure in the room has grammatical errors etc.. Overall it was a nice enough hotel. Impersonal as expected with a big chain but the parking experience set the whole weekend off with a negative "bang."~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464346420~“Yes and no, some aspects may need review”~We rarely stay at airport hotels as we rarely take early morning flights. But this time we had to. With only 12 hours in Brisbane, the logical stop-over place was the airport hotel. We were very impressed with the staff - first impressions, a young uni graduate who was door side and who then took our luggage to the room for us. He made us feel very welcome. The room was very spacious, nice bathroom, great bed, quiet. Especially important as we were to be having an early morning departure. The food downstairs was really not up to par. We barely touched the Caesar salad and the steak. Disappointing. In the morning we found out that the terminal shuttle does not start until 5am but as we had to be at the terminal by 5am we reluctantly took a taxi.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_464155362~“OK hotel but some annoying business decisions”~The Novotel Brisbane airport served it's purpose competently ... quick ride to the airport, clean reasonable place to say. The restaurant had acceptable food for dinner. The staff were professional and efficient.  I would say the hotel was priced toward the higher end of what I expected for a place like this, but that's what happens when you need convenience for a business trip.  What bothered me about this hotel was a sense that I was being nickel and dimed. Most airport hotels in North America have free shuttles from the airport. This shuttle was $5. Not breaking the bank, but out of place by North American practices. WiFi was free for the first 100 mb, but relatively expensive after that. Again, it felt like a money grab. The final straw for me came at breakfast. The hot buffet included croissants and Danishes, but the cold buffet did not. Why? Because croissants are baked in the oven! Where do they bake the bread in the cold buffet? In the sun on the hood of the car? Dumb decision. I skipped breakfast and went to the airport earlier to have my breakfast in the Air New Zealand lounge instead.  By trying to milk me for small money, Novotel lost me as a future customer.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463964861~“always comfortable and convenient”~The Novotel has started an airport shuttle service! Yay, it cost $5 per head to get the shuttle to and from the domestic and international terminals and they run on a fixed schedule all day. This now makes it economic to stay here because the money you save on taxi fares to Ascot hotels can be used to pay for a room here! Brilliant!~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463928313~“Just the Job”~Their shuttle bus runs half-hourly for $5 each ; cheaper and more convenient than a taxi from the airport. Reception was welcoming. The Novotel is only 7 years old, so everything was relatively new and in good working order. The large shower area was attractive. Great for airport. Very comfortable. Restaurant also good; one of the best lamb curries we have had. The drinks were overpriced, of course, but the place, as a whole, is ideal for tired travellers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

It is very quiet with no noise from the airport or surrounding area. Right next door the a 24 hours Woolworths and DFO shopping outlet. Shuttle bus is great but we were unaware that we had to pay as staff had never highlighted this fact on arrival and booking. I think that $250 a night is a little overpriced.

review_461314743~“Only stayed overnight”~Clean, tidy hotel. Staff were friendly. There is a shuttle to and from the airport which is timetabled - make sure you get the information before you fly in, or you'd never find it! You also need to have Australian dollars, as you have to pay the driver in cash $5 each. However it only runs in the morning and evening periods. There is a rooftop pool. However it is long and narrow, about the size of one lane of a large swimming pool. There is also a sauna and a small gym. If you don't want to eat in the hotel, there is only limited other choices without driving. Although there are a few places in the shopping centre across the road, they were all closed when we visited early in the evening about 7pm. The only place open was a bar called the Transit Tavern. The food was ok and there was a good choice of 'real beer'!~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

Really good location for shopping as you can walk across the parking lot to DFO.

We didn't hear any planes while we were at the hotel - which was surprising and pleasant for us.~4~2~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_457546303~“A good place for an overnight stay”~Hotel Brisbane Airport would be perfect for an overnight stay as it is very close to the airport It is also close to DFO for shopping It is not close to Brisbane city so if you were staying longer in Brisbane the Novotel at Creek Street would be more suitable There are screens in the foyer showing flight times It was quite and comfortable but the bathroom did not have a bath which would be preferable after a long flight The staff were helpful and friendly especially the restaurant staff at the Catalina restaurant The food was wonderful but the breakfast was a little expensive  Perfect place for a stopover ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457521891~“Expensive !!”~The only good thing about this place is that it is near the airport. It's unfortunate that there is no hotel in the airport and this place is about 5-10 min drive. The room is basic, check in process takes long. It looks and feels like a Budget hotel but charges a premium. Rooms are clean but the toilet had a stink ( the ones you get from drains of old buildings). No toiletries provided ( only soaps and shampoo). Not enough and convenient ports for charging phones - wish they made it mandatory to have phone chargers in convenient locations.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457255509~“Average”~Rooms are clean modern but with little character which goes for pretty much the whole hotel. Close to DFO shopping center which hosted a pub and liquor store. Wouldn't be my first choice but hey......my company was picking up the tab.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457127400~“Brief visit”~We only stayed the one night en-route to Tasmania. We found the hotel to be very clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The bedroom was big as was the bathroom with a lovely walk in shower. The bathroom had plenty of assorted toiletries. The hotel is situated about ten minutes drive from Brisbane airport, it could be seen in the distance on the road but actually getting to it was slightly difficult not knowing the road layout. Immediately behind the hotel is a big shopping mall with various restaurants on site. We thought the hotel restaurant was a bit pricey so had dinner at a lovely fish shop in the mall. The bed was comfortable and we did not have any complaints. Would we recommend this hotel - yes.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_456657848~“Great Location”~Stayed here prior to an early international business flight the next day. Rooms are modern tidy and very comfortable. Found the rates to be quite high, however you do pay for the convenience of being close to the airport. One think of note is getting transport to the hotel after the shuttle buses finish can be troublesome. Taxis don't appreciate the short $20 fare. Would recommend for the ease of airport access.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456568234~“Efficient”~Great for a airport hotel. Efficient, friendly service, clean and 10 minutes for airport terminals. Next door to large shopping centre with 24 hour large supermarket. Sleep interrupted by rattling air conditioner.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_455535344~“Great hotel for an overnight stay”~Stayed overnight while transiting from overseas. Great Hotel, friendly staff, rooms were clean and spacious, great shower (just what is needed after a long haul flight), comfortable beds with reasonable room service food with an awesome pool. Close to supermarket and liquor shop and a number of variety shops. They operate a shuttle to both terminals for just $5 per person (Taxi from international is around $28). Will stay again when in Brisy.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_455263399~“Overnight stay”~For the ratting, Novotel Brisbane airport is very disappointing. Firstly, they charge $5.00 per person for the shuttle bus per trip. We have stayed in smaller and simpler hotels that offered free shuttle. Secondly, you only get some free internet. After using the amount of data (which was about half hour with only 1 person just accessing emails on an Ipad, without downloading anything). The rooms were clean and comfortable, but there were no robes available. After 2 long flights, the only thing we wanted was to have a nice shower and get cosy in a soft robe. The only advantage of the hotel is the location, very close to the airport.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~2~nan
review_455081922~“Good location”~Good location - rooms were lovely, clean, neat and tidy. Close to airport  Complex next door is Woolworths and a DFO - good shopping if that's what you like !  We used the pool as it was very hot - pool is on the roof top - pool area was clean and towels were provided and located right next to the pool is a gym and a sauna  Transport to the hotel was only about 10 minutes in a taxi and we were going on a cruise - close to cruise terminal as well  Staff were also very helpful and friendly - we also had coffee in the restaurant after we had been out for dinner - very prompt and courteous service !~4~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_454913199~“Everything you need in an airport hotel”~far exceeded my expectations for an airport hotel; absolutely loved it! having had the horrible experience of staying at the novotel in the gold coast, i was a bit nervous, but this spot managed to restore my confidence in the brand. i usually fly out of brisbane quite early, so this may be my new favourite spot!~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_454441292~“Underwhelmed and Disappointed”~We accessed the Novotel via the free terminal transfer bus. Look for a bus heading to Skygate, the stop is a 3 minute walk to the hotel. There is also a hotel shuttle, $5 per person but the operating hours are limited to morning and afternoon. I really wanted to like this hotel. The location next to the Skygate precinct is excellent. The DFO shopping area, supermarket, bottle shop and a large choice of restaurants are all on the hotels door step. Our check-in experience was pretty poor. No hotel information was given. We chose to upgrade to an executive suite with a separate lounge area but were given the room keys to a standard room. Another trip down to reception and this was eventually rectified with the correct room key. At just about every hotel I have ever stayed at there is some sort of acknowledgement when you stay in the best room the hotel has to offer. There was nothing here, not even a fruit plate or welcome drink. Check-out was just as bad, we waited at the desk for 10 minutes while the staff member took a phone reservation, maybe just pop them on hold for 15 seconds next time. We ended up leaving our key on the counter and walking out. The room itself was pretty much as you can see in the pictures. The lounge area is ok with a small dining setting and very basic amenities such as a coffee machine. The glasses in our room where filthy, I requested new ones, even the lady who swapped them over thought they were terrible! The artwork throughout the hotel is strange and doesn't match the style or location of the hotel. The framed pictures are rural farming images. I would think that an aviation or travel theme would work better here. The bedroom was ok and had a view towards the railway line. The windows are double glazed so noise isn't a problem. The separate bathroom had a bath but the height adjustment for the shower head was broken. The whole room felt a little tired with lots of chips and marks on the walls and doorways. We were excited to use the roof top pool that has a nice view of the surrounding area. To our disappointment the pool was freezing, even our 2 year old refused to go in and she'll normally swim anywhere. My question to the hotel, why is a swimming pool in Brisbane unusable in summer? I hate to imagine what it's like in winter. The area surrounding the pool is useless with uncomfortable stools, no relaxing on a nice comfortable chair. The gym is tiny by comparison to other hotels and would feel very uncomfortable with more than 2 people. As I mentioned I really wanted to like this hotel but to be honest I wouldn't stay again. The best part is the location at Skygate.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454390959~“Novotel Brisbane Airport”~Accommodation was excellent .. Meals in the Catlina are outstanding and consistent high quality. Table service is always of high standard and punctual. Rooms are comfortable and my usual pillow menu from my Accor preference registration was remembered. Front of office staff are always welcoming and polite. Great place to stay.. Increased options with DFO next door and expanded eating options in the precinct.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_454193153~“Transitting”~Great location, right next to dfo, so good for some shopping. About a $30 uber ride to Brisbane city. Nice buffet breakfast with decent selections. Room was well spaced and functional. Underground car parking is available as well. I'd recommend if flying in or out!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453671823~“Excellent layover ”~Quick and convenient to the airport with friendly staff and a resturant will cold beer and good food. A refreshing swim is also great to clear the cobwebs. Definitely great if you need a stopover between flights.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453265232~“Used Novotel Airport Hotel once again after return from overseas trip, great recovery spot”~The rooms are excellent, staff helpful and pleasant, access to DFO for last minute shopping and a place to walk around pre an post a long flight. Access to pool is great for relaxation and relaxing muscles after a long flight is great. We use this hotel each time prior and after trips as a break from our drive from the country. Quality of the services continues to improve.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan

review_452023316~“Didnt work for us....”~OK, IF you are looking for a hotel that is fairly near the airport and nothing else, then I guess this might be ok, but its isolated. We wanted to get into the city, and there are NO local public transport options other than a 2 bus journey. We took a taxi in; and CityCat and taxi back. Information given by the hotel was inaccurate and more costly. Bed was uncomfortable, and the shuttle only goes every 30 minutes for part of the morning and evening, costing 5$ per person each way. New hotels being built right next to the Terminals will make this hotel redundant in the future if it doesnt really improve~2~nan~2~2~nan~nan~3~nan
review_451629504~“Great place for an early morning flight”~I stay here a lot. It is easy for those early morning flights out of Brisbane airport. The restaurant is very good. Good value and good quality food. I can recommend it. The only problem is that it can get busy in peak periods. It is an airport hotel, so you can expect that~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451146405~“A fine airport hotel”~My wife and I stayed at this hotel prior to a 6 AM check-in at Brisbane Airport. Hotel is well soundproofed and we experienced no problems with noise from aircraft, trains or traffic. Although the bar and restaurant look a bit basic in fact they provide a high standard of service. Room had walk-in shower which I liked.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450928310~“Convenient and comfortable but a bit overpriced.”~Stayed one night. Rooms very modern and clinical but everything very comfortable, great bed and pillows. Staff were efficient and friendly at reception. Did not dine onsite but close to plenty of eateries. Great location for our purpose but overall felt that the nightly rate was a little pricey.~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_450808407~“Great transfer hotel”~We stayed here between flights. There is a shuttle service from both domestic & international airports that runs every half hour for $5 or you can catch the free shuttle to Skygate shopping centre. The Novotel is right next to Skygate so it is a quick 1-minute walk. This is convenient for some shopping, places to eat plus there is a 24 hour Woolworths supermarket. The hotel rooms were very spacious and well appointed. There is a lovely roof top pool, sauna & gym plus a restaurant onsite (and 24 hour room service). Service was quick and friendly. All in all, a very convenient place for a transit stop over! Would happily be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450776314~“Fresh and modern”~This is like most Novotel. Fresh and quite business like. This hotel feels very new. And everything is flawless. Only the pool had a very cold water. Other than that is good value. It is also very close to good restaurants and a mall.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan

review_450317899~“Family dinner”~Brisbane airport is only around half and hour from our home, and not the typical destination we would choose for dinner, but my brother-in-law was on a stop over between a remote mine site and home, so with the wife and four year old son in tow, and the prospect of also meeting up with my other brother-in-law (who, technically, is an 'international racing driver' so always has some great stories to tell, some are even close to being true!) we met up for dinner at the Novotel.  But, having worked in hotels during my career, I must confess I am not generally impressed by hotel restaurant food, and don't even enjoy the prospect of an hotel restaurant meal, but like I said, between an international race driver and a mining guru, the food would play second fiddle anyway.  Well, did I have a great surprise at the Novotel!  There is a good selection of menu items, or a set price banquet option where you can choose two or three courses from a list of starters, mains, and deserts, with several (apparently popular) items in each course to select from. Three of us had the banquet, while the miner had oysters and a steak, maybe preparing for home after a long stint away?? While our son dug into the habitual chips and a bowl of sweet corn; from the banquet we had calamari, which was oh so soft and tender and came 'with legs' too, as my wife described them! Mains were a mix of duck, for the wife, blue cheese risotto for the race driver, and the barramundi for me. The meals were plentiful, well balanced and delicious!  The venue was clean and tidy, a recently constructed hotel, with several small but obvious, still to be actioned, defects - the joys of working in property where you become tuned to look for problems.... also, the toilet stalls have single role dispensers, not a problem when you are at home and finish off a roll but not a great prospect when you are in a public venue!  The wait staff were well presented, courteous and helpful, meals were delivered in a good time, without being too quick. In all, a great dining out evening, convenient location, easy to get to, good near-by parking, and no aircraft noise to disturb you!  Another venue I can thoroughly recommend!  We didn't stay the night, so can only tell you my brother-in-laws said it was good, mind you they had a good fill of beer, so not sure they minded too much either way!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450307496~“a great place to unwind and stay awhile”~this is a first class hotel, probably the best in the Brisbane area, very close to the Domestic and International airports, the Entertainment Centre and currently for the Cirque du Soleil. We've stayed several times and have always been remembered by Alex and the gang with due respect and courtesy. We even have a favorite room on the 3rd floor in the corner. Breakfast is a breeze and Dinner divine, though it's close enough to the DFO centre for shopping and alternative eating tastes, if one prefers. It's the sort of place where all the staff make you feel so welcome. Looking forward to our next trip.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_449778714~“Great value for money! ”~I stayed here for one night before going on a cruise and it was perfect! It is in close proximity to the airport and also the port of Brisbane so it is easy to get to where you need to be! There are shops across the road which we found to be very handy and the restaurant staff as well as check in staff were fantastic and very attentive! The room itself was kept very well, clean and tidy and perfect for a one night stay!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_449718867~“Novatel Brisbane Airport”~Would have expected less being near an Airport but hands down 5 star hotel. Quiet, super classy, excellent staff. Hospitality and facilities superior to anywhere I have stayed. Next door to DFO shopping outlet. Didn't have time to enjoy the awesome pool. I only ended up this hotel after being transferred at 2 am in morning from another ACCOR hotel where the air con had broken down in building. I would not have considered staying at this hotel otherwise. I actually will come back to this gorgeous hotel for a family holiday. Great pool and restaurant plus foxtel for the kids and shopping next door and within 30 mins drive to them parks. Yes, do stay there for more than just a stop over. Lovely non-judgemental staff who know how to give good service.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_446176839~“Below standard”~I chose this hotel because it was the most pricey (and I assumed, best quality) airport hotel on offer - my flight arrived in the early hours of the morning). As other reviews have mentioned, it was quiet and clean - always a good thing. But there was nothing relaxing or welcoming about the place. No lobby to lounge in, no low-lit lamps in the room (it was all bright fluorescent lighting, no complimentary water (have to pay $4.50 per 500ml plastic bottle!), and despite advertising the opposite - no high speed internet access. After 4-5 of free-but-barely-working wifi access, visitors are required to pay for access. To be honest, I've never been anywhere that still charges for water and internet. Get your act together Novotel! Water and internet are basics, not luxuries. I can't see any difference between this hotel and the budget/basic ones nearby - not a great brand-experience, Novotel.~2~nan~nan~5~2~nan~2~nan
review_445997630~“Good standard of airport hotel.”~Chose to stay in this hotel after a 22 hour flight from London. We arrived jet-lagged in the early evening. The hotel itself is a ten minute taxi ride from the airport, which cost about $17AUD. The hotel has its own shuttle bus, but this is a half hourly affair which charges $5 per person and we'd just missed it, so we took a taxi. Check-in was nice and easy and the staff were efficient, polite and helpful. Our room was contemporary and clean and well laid out. Everything worked. We visited the bar/restaurant and had a bottle of wine and a couple of tapas dishes from the menu. These were really nice, though the food and wine (as you might expect from an airport hotel) were very expensive. A middle of the road Sauvignon Blanc and two tapas dishes came to $75. Check-out was similarly easy. We used two 500ml bottles of still water from the fridge, which cost us $9. Yes - that's not a typo, nine Australian dollars. That's four dollars fifty each. Novotel, you should hang your heads in shame with regard to this - water is a necessity, not a luxury. Shame on me to, for as a seasoned traveller, I should have noticed there was a Woolworths just a hundred metres away from the hotel, where nine dollars worth of bottled water would have been enough to fill the hotel's modest swimming pool. This aside, little to complain about this well managed and pleasant hotel.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_445978681~“Great restaurant with lovely customer service! ”~After hopping of a flight and checking into Novotel with some friends we decided to have dinner at the Novotel restaurant. We had a lovely waitress (Molly) who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and satisfied with every part of our dinning experience!  Can't wait for me next stop over in Brisbane, I will definitely be dinning at Novotel again and would happily recommend to friends and family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445948713~“Decent airport hotel”~The hotel is fine nothing over the top felt very Ikea in terms of fit and finish.  The staff were great, the airport shuttle was free to the hotel and sadly they charge to get me back to the airport, thankfully I had 5 bucks in change, found this to be quite unfair.  The bar staff were friendly but everyone in OZ is friendly, its Canada with a better climate.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_445856984~“Very modern, comfortable hotel”~My wife and I stayed here overnight in anticipation of catching a flight the next day. The hotel is very modern and quite stark, employing lots of white, grey and black in its décor--not my wife's favorite. However, our room was very well appointed and comfortable. The breakfast was superb with lots of variety.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_444642303~“One night stay”~Hotel very easy to find from International airport at midnight. Had a problem with the key but the duty manager came up to help us. Had the same problem in the morning too. Room very quiet and was able to sleep for some 5 hours. Woken at 5.00, the Woolworths in the shopping centre is open 24/7!! Breakfast was good with a good choice of hot and cold food but was not included in the hotel price. Cost 29.50$aus each.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
