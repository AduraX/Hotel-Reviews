review_477557113~“Larry and Julie ”~We had a very comfortable stay at the Airport Clayfield Motel. Steve, the owner, couldn't be more helpful and the bed was very comfortable. The property is situated close to some very good restaurants and is a short walk to Toombul shopping centre and a bottle shop.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475937299~“Easter Suprise”~What a great stay we had here! Such a convenient location and a great swim in the pool. Met another lovely family who invited our daughter in on their Easter egg hunt. There is a quaint little Italian coffee shop around the corner - a little hidden gem. Sometimes you find the delights in life in the most unlikely of places - this was one of those places~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473501774~“Excellent accommodation near airport”~Stress free place to stay near airport and train. Friendly and helpful owner. Good restaurants and bar a few minutes walk. Shuttle to airport or to DFO. Clean. On busy road but not noisy at night and I had a very good nights sleep. Good price. Free continental breakfast if you book directly with motel. Very good coffee. Definitely a place to consider.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471036992~“Close to Brisbane Airport”~Spent one night at Clayfield Motel prior to flying to Singapore. The rooms are very dated but clean & convenient for Brisbane Airport with a shuttle bus service. The staff were very friendly & helpful. There is a small shopping area only 5 minutes walk away with a small market & takeaway restaurants. I would certainly book this motel in the future.~3~4~nan~nan~3~nan~4~nan
review_469179734~“Overnight airport accommodation ”~This hotel is located close to the airport link and Sandgate Rd and only 5 minutes from the terminal and a couple of minutes from various long term parking.  The rooms are very well maintained, the beds comfortable and the staff are friendly and helpful.  The location is right on Sandgate road which does mean there is some road noise. Try to avoid room No.1 as this exposes you to the worst of it and also has smoking tables behind the room so you get to listen to people talking during the night. I think rooms 6 and 7 would be best. There is very good under cover parking with enough clearance for 4wds and a luggage lift to the levels above.  There is a lot of good food options only minutes walking from the hotel from cheap takeaway to restaurants.  This is the better of the hotels in this area in this price range.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468698520~“Convenient Airport Motel”~I had an overnight stop in Brisbane and stayed here for the night. It's conveniently located not far from the airport with free parking. The room was a good size and very clean. A free Continental breakfast- with excellent coffee machine- was well enjoyed as I had booked directly with the motel. I needn't have hired a car for the stopover as the motel was so close to the airport and restaurants a short walk away. I found the manager very helpful. Have stayed at this motel before and would do so again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459889902~“Great Little Hotel”~Stayed here for the close proximity for The Entertainment centre, Lovely staff, well organised, booked via them directly and received a free breakfast. Room was very clean, large and comfortable, milk and biscuits available. Staff very kind and obliging with directions. They offer short and long term parking if you are going away. Only downside is no lift and quite steep stairs, but there is a luggage lift and it was not a problem. Good to know about this place as it's very convenient for Boondall  L~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_444755866~“Convenient for airport”~This motel is fine for an overnight stay as it's convenient to the airport. The train station is very close but I didn't get offered any airport shuttle although I did enquire beforehand. There is a breakfast room which offers continental self serve breakfast. It's free if you book directly with the motel. The big drawback is that the motel is on the main road so there's some noise. However I wasn't disturbed by it. There was a cleanliness issue with the bathroom which I mentioned to the owner/manager who promised to take it up with the cleaner. She was very apologetic about it and you can't ask for more than that. I'd probably stay here again when I have a plane to catch. It's certainly cheaper than the airport hotels and just as convenient with some great eating places nearby. Try the fish shop!! Outside the motel you can get a bus to Chermside shopping centre or Toombul centre, and even into the city~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_443693127~“Great overnight accommodation ”~Very very nice clean large size rooms and fits 6 adults comfortably. Lots of different places to eat within walking distance. Friendly service. would stay again if need accommodation close to the Airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440788420~“Great little hidden gem”~I did stay with my wife one night before going back home. The room was clean and comfortable, they offer shuttle to the airport for a good price, if not there is the train station at 100 meters away as alternative option. Great staff and very friendly~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436048544~“Early flight meant a short stay - fortuneately”~I had an early flight so was able to check my car in before I checked into the motel and then use the shuttle, which I was charged for, in the morning. The room was old, scruffy and noisy making sleep difficult.~2~2~nan~2~nan~nan~3~nan

Convenient location close to airport~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_431088652~“Close to everything ”~It's nice to be close to airport and across the street from Clayfield Markets. Down the street is the Ohio Cafe for a great breakfast. We're going to have the free breakfast provided with their special offer by booking directly with them. I've enjoyed the baggage lift so I don't have to drag the suitcases up the stairs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431048231~“Short stay - early flight ”~My family (6 adults) stayed here overnight as we had to be at Brisbane airport very early for a flight. Well for starters the motel was clean and I couldn't fault it that way. But the bed was soooo hard - It was just old and absolutely warn out. I wouldn't recommend staying if you have an early flight - as street is also noisy~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427770469~“Neat, close to airport”~We used this hotel for a short stopover after landing in Brisbane because it is close to the airport. The room was a good size, it was clean and it had everything you needed (except coffee!). The biggest negative was the road noise. The biggest plus was free wifi.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427113705~“Nice & Handy to the Airport”~I actually stayed here twice this year once in September & once in October [ after a trip oversea's] I found the staff very friendly & most helpful. Units are getting a little tired but nice & clean & enough room for 2 people on a 1 night stay. There is a lift just for luggage, which is great as you have stairs to walk up to the units. Also they are very obliging with their Airport Shuttle, which costs $15 [ taxi is $27 from the same spot.]Walls are a bit thin & you can hear the people in the next units, so hopefully you don't get a large family group next door.There was a continental breakfast offered for $5 but we didn't avail of it.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan

review_424807797~“Our time there was too short.”~We chose this motel because we required a bed for the night betweenen an incoming international flight and a departing domestic one. Had informed Steve we would be arriving late so were given code to night safe where keys were left. Luggage lift adjacent which was super efficient. Room spotless with every feature we could require. Bed comfortable and just sorry our time was limited. Breakfast room efficiently operated and later learned it would have been free if we had booked directly with the motel. Shuttle driver was a most friendly and helpful lady who put our cases into the luggage lift on departure.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_421473936~“A very dirty room”~When we checked in the man behind the desk was very nice. When we saw the room it was DISGUSTING! The bed was clean, but the bathroom wasn't cleaned at all and there was hair everywhere. It was that the bed was clean, otherwise i wouldn't stay there at all! Because we checked in late i send an email and the response was that the cleaner is colour blind.....so that means that they only clean the dirty bits and not everything.... I could not believe this! I would not stay here again that's for sure!~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~2~nan
review_419655345~“Convenient, well serviced motel.”~A structurally solid building (i.e. no paper-thin walls) lacking nothing in terms of room amenities. Only a 10 minute easy walk from Eagle Junction Railway Station on the airport link line and just across the road from Clayfield Railway Station. There is also a bus stop right outside the motel. Within easy walking distance of shops and cafes, but not pubs or clubs. Staff were friendly and helpful (even the cleaning lady smiled). Prices are comparable to similar standard motels around Brisbane. The only criticism I could offer would be the motel's location on busy Sandgate Road. Traffic noise starts early and builds through the morning peak. Notwithstanding that, I would stay there again (for short stays) if the occasion arose. Note that all rooms require the climbing of at least one flight of stairs to access.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_417828517~“Service-oriented”~We stayed here overnight between a flight into Brisbane and another flight out. We have had bad experiences with taxis in Brisbane, but this motel runs a private shuttle. It was great. Our bags were even carried to the room in the evening and back down again in the morning. The rooms are upstairs, but the manager used a luggage lift to take our bags up. The motel itself is rather old but very clean and well-maintained. The beds were comfortable and we felt safe. There are many restaurants nearby, and the motel has a breakfast room that is complimentary if you book direct with them. The service was friendly. We had a good experience.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_407898543~“A great place to stay near the airport.”~A simple motel but everything was just right. Close to the airport, economical, with a manager who seems to be customer focused. Nice breakfast room that allows you to serve yourself if there is an early departure. Room comfortable, bathroom workable - so few are in motels. Had all the things you want for a quick stop-over, electric clock so you can see the time, tea and coffee in the room, big enough to store luggage. Although on a busy road, there was no traffic noise in the room. They have a shuttle to the airport which is economical and arrived on time. After many irritations and disappointments at other places it was very nice to have nothing to complain about - to the management, well done, and thank you.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_406399221~“Like an Old Friend”~This Motel has a number of things going for it. Firstly it is clean and tidy and well managed. It's about 10 minutes from the airport and nestled in amongst great restaurants and takeaways . Its on a busy road but to be honest we heard nothing. We paid the extra and got a spa bath room, not that we wanted a spa but the room was just that much bigger and only cost about $20 extra. we were on the second floor and it had its own balcony. This motel obviously thinks of its customers as they have a self service continental breakfast room that is open for early departing guests and i think it is complimentary if you book direct with the Motel. A nice touch. I imagine the motel is around the 1970's or 1980's but the owners have kept it up to standard. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_403910070~“Surprisingly very good!”~Our flight to Sydney got cancelled but since we were in transit to the airport already we thought we'd get a hotel room instead of heading all the way back home. Check in was easy and good customer service. We booked the large room with the spa bath and had access to the balcony from our room. Very clean room, aircon, good bed size and comfortable. We used the pool in the morning too. We would definitely stay again even being locals here in Brisbane. They also offer shuttle to the airport which cost us $15 between the both of us which was a deal!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402265672~“Close to airport and restaurants ”~Convenient to the airport for overnight stay with a short taxi ride from the airport and a courtesy bus to get back to the airport on checkout. Takes the stress away from arriving in time for check-in. Super friendly and helpful staff. Great range of restaurants within walking distance. Will definitely stay again for longer next time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401930283~“Recommend ”~Clean and comfortable, suited during transit both ways. Shuttle to airport was great unfortunately it wasn't available coming in. Ten minute walk to train station. Comfortable couch and bath in room 6 was much enjoyed after a week traveling. Room just needs cutlery for takeaways, people don't always want to eat out.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_395266279~“Clean, close, great for a flying family!”~We stayed here for a layover before an international flight, with our toddler. Very impressed - clean, neat room, air conditioner worked well. Free wifi that worked well. Close to takeaway outlets for dinner, close to airport - the shuttle bus from the motel (affordable) took us 10 minutes. Very accommodating with our young son - portable cot provided was clean and easy to set up, and we appreciated the room with a bath as well! Very happy - exactly what we needed in an affordable airport motel. Will stay again, and encourage others to do the same.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_394528141~“Airport Stay”~Hotel was adequate for our requirements. We had an early morning connection which was only a 6 minute drive to Brisbane Airport. Room was small..no plates or cutlery just a kettle and 2 mugs. One negative was the traffic noise due to the hotel being situated on an extremely busy road. Can recommend the Thai restaurant just up the road..superb food.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_391619829~“A pretty good choice near airport”~In order to catch an early flight back to home we selected to stay a night at this hotel. Overall it was pretty good - just 10 minutes drive to airport, room was clean and tidy, comfortable bedding, free car park and though the breakfast is simple (continental), it;s free if you book with the hotel directly. Some points to note: 1. No reception after 8pm for check-in, has to make arrangement in prior; & 2. Several restaurants near the hotel within 10-15 minutes walk.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_383871404~“Definitely stay there again”~Had to stop over in Brisbane before and after our holiday overseas and found this little gem. Close to the airport and they will pick up and drop you off for $15 each way, much cheaper and easier than a taxi. The rooms are a reasonable Price and are clean with plenty of room. They supply eco-friendly body wash, shampoo and conditioner and moisturiser. There is a whole range of different food options all within walking distance (500m). All in all very happy and if we ever have to stop over in Brisbane again, we will staying there again for sure.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_378116817~“Clean, steep stairs but has a luggage lift”~I stayed here twice a week apart, once before a flight and once after. The staff are very nice and the rooms were clean and comfortable. I love that they give you a teapot as well as cups. However, there are stairs: parking is on the ground level and the rooms are on two levels above that and there is no lift. The stairs are also quite steep. However, there is a luggage lift, so at least you don't have to drag your bags up the stairs with you.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_370691773~“Great stay for 18 nights”~We stayed here for 18nights over the Christmas and New Year - the staff were so helpful and friendly, we couldn't have asked for more.  We had a spacious family room, it had a fridge, kettle and toaster so could keep food cool and prepare pack ups for our days out.  The pool is small, but was still great to cool off in after a busy day.  There were shops local which was an added bonus & busses and train station near by as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_369470393~“PERFECT FOR A CLOSE STAY TO BRISBANE AIRPORT”~We chose to stay at the Airport Clayfield for one night because we were arriving late at night and did not want to have to drive too far. We were well instructed on how to access the keys after hours and were shocked to find a three bedroom suite for the two of us by default. The room was clean warm and had everything we needed. It was a little noisy at night but still had no trouble sleeping. The staff were helpful. The price was right and all in all a great place to stay so close to the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_366189127~“Pros and cons.”~Pros: Clean rooms, great location, food and amenities nearby, airport delivery, clean, good value breakfast, luggage lift, free taxi phone, helpful manager, ideal for our situation recovering from jet lag before continuing on. Would certainly use again' Cons: Nothing springs to mind.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_364301336~“Too Noisy”~Great location for airport, trains into Brisbane, local takeaway, bottle shop and restaurants are OK. Rooms what you'd expect and beds comfortable. Friendly reception. So why only a 2 rating? Well we had a dreadful nights sleep caused predominately by some alarm or phone constantly ringing and doing this intermittently throughout the night. This Motel also sits on a major junction for traffic going in and out of the city. Early and late traffic noise is therefore expected.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_358156714~“A really nice stay”~We spent one night at the motel before our morning flight out of Brisbane airport. The staff was really nice! When we went to check in, the guy at the desk told us the best places to go eat in the neighbourhood and was so helpful. The room was clean and had a nice little fridge in it too. A few blocks from the motel there is a convenience store and many restaurant. We went to dinner at Sakana, a japanese restaurant 2 minute walk from the hotel, excellent sushi recommended by motel staff. The shuttle took us to the airport early in the morning and cost only 15 dollars for the both of us.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_357178679~“Great stay”~Back again for a second stay. Really pleased that it is just as good as the last time I was here - great position, great price and a good night's sleep.

review_357164102~“Great hospitality”~We booked this Motel for an overnight stay before a flight the next morning to Norfolk Island. There were 11 in our party so we had 6 rooms. All the rooms were spotless. Plenty of space. We were on the first floor at the front, and there was a bit of traffic noise, but once the peak hour rush was over, it was fairly quiet. Certainly didn't keep us awake. There are plenty of eateries within a 2 minute walk, also a supermarket & bottle shop. The shuttle pick up service was fantastic, and the breakfast the next morning just topped it off. Staff were welcoming & happy to help. There is a luggage lift to take your heavy items up to the next floor. There is also free wifi in the rooms. I would happily recommend this Motel and will definitely be staying there again if we need a stopover before a flight from Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_354232708~“One night stay close to International Airport.”~Greatful for being so accomodating. We disembarked from a cruise quite early in the morning. I had already booked online for a room, I rang to see if we could leave our bags before actual check in time, only to find they were more then accomodating and offered a room immediately, I'm thankful for that, but, not sure why we had to pay an extra $40 if it was already empty? Reception was lovely and able to give some good advice about what the ammenties were close to the hotel, thank you, she arranged our drop off to the airport ... yaye. The rooms we had was nice and quiet, though without looking to far you could easily see extra cleaning is required in the bathroom, thats not a negative the stay still served it's purpose. If I wanted 5star I would have paid for it. Thanks for the stay.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~2~4~nan
review_353675574~“Budget”~Rates are cheaper on the net (bokings.com, agoda etc.) than asking directly at motel. clean room with ensuite, shower etc. on noise Busy road, near small shopping centre. be careful when booking - check rates elsewhere.~3~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_346650537~“Mixed thoughts”~After reading through everyone else's reviews while staying here, I feel as though I have coped a bad run. I'm not usually one for a bad review but there are a few things that have worried me  I have stayed 3 nights in a row and when I first got here I found the receptionist quite rude, they have since become nicer but this isn't a very good first impression for anyone. The door handle on my room is almost broken so it takes some time to get the door open, the key won't simply slide and twist. Once in, although clean on the surface, there was grime and hair in the bathroom, not a welcoming look at all. I order cooked breakfast on day 1 and it was delivered to my room, cook to perfection, but the glass from my breakfast has been sitting on the bathroom sink for two days now.  You couldn't find any better location for a hotel but I believe that the experience could be made better .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_344847500~“Nice little hotel close to the airport and mall. Great service!”~This is a pleasant hotel quite close to the airport and a short walk from Toombul shopping mall and a host of restaurants. The room had everything I needed and was reasonable value.  But what made this hotel stand out was the service. I was collected from the airport by Steve. The shuttle service is only $15 (covers 2 people). It was smooth and quick and Steve made me feel very welcome from the outset.  The hotel also offers free Wi-Fi and a basic breakfast for $5 - something from which many other hotels should learn.  The only downsides are the room is a little small and Sandgate Road is very busy. But traffic noise was not a problem at all.  I would definitely return.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_340572515~“Convenient & comfortable.”~My son & I stayed here for one night because of the location so close to the airport & the shuttle provided for our very early flight. The rooms were comfortable & air conditioning appreciated as it was very warm. (Milk in fridge a nice touch.)The Thai restaurant a few doors along was excellent. Bus & train access to Brisbane from across the road.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_338163937~“Good value for money for early flights”~We stayed here with my wife one night before an early flight. For that purpose we found this quite good value for money. It is located close to airport and there was coach bus service organized whic took you to the airport in ~10 minutes. Staff is helpful and friedly. Rooms clean and basic. Eventhough there is quite big road next to the hotel at least we had good night sleep. Overall served the purpose we had well.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_337471372~“Return visit, very comfortable”~We've stayed here on several occasions and obviously thought it was worthwhile coming back as we stayed here again in Dec 2015. I said it in my previous review and I'll say it again here, top marks for this motel for providing family rooms and not expecting travelling families to rent two or more rooms. The Airport Clayfield family room is not just a standard room with extra beds squeezed in but actual large rooms with multiple beds. From memory there were 3 singles and one queen and a foldout option as well. A new addition since we last stayed was the breakfast room, which, at the time of writing is free of charge if you book direct with the motel (there is a small charge if you don't). The room has basic breakfast needs - juice, cereal, bread, toaster, spreads, tea and a real coffee machine. It is a great idea, especially if you are heading off early and just need a quick bite (and a coffee) to keep you going. And they also provide a shuttle bus service to the international and domestic airports, and a small fee.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_334243855~“Lovely”~Only stayed the night during a layover in Brisbane. Room was lovely with fan and air con available. Had all the amenities you could want in the room and plenty of restaurants near by. Free wifi (although wasn't very effective on my phone and cut out a lot) and a shuttle service available ($15 one way, taxi cost me nearly $25).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
