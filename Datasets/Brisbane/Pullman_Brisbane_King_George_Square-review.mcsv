review_478396347~“Great Stay with the family”~Great location for families visiting Brisbane. We spend the day visiting museums, Public library and had a walk and swim at South Bank, all walking distance from the hotel.  Breakfast was delicious, and rooms clean and spacious.  I would stay again any time!!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_478104694~“Requesting for specific room”~Staff members most were friendly. First visit was very comfortable in room 1052. A day before my second visiting emailed the hotel for the specific room 1052. Upon checked in after a long over night trip, I was given the 1056 near the streets. I informed the lady staff the email I sent, she had no clue & replied to check. After more than an hour I had breakfast, the staff didn't get back to me, went in room 1056, I was not comfortable with the room.  Another staff said 1052 was vacant, after 20mins still refused to give me the room due to cleaning needed in 1056 (where I didn't even touch anything except the phone, I didn't even dare to sit on the chair), then a manager Eimily lied that 1052 was dirty & unable to give to me, I had to wait for 1hr. I was not convinced I spoke to the housekeepers outside 1052, they told me 1052 was vacant & it was cleaned. There was when I got my requested room after hours of speaking to different staff.  1052 & 1056 both same size, same bed, same design. The way the handled request was just very not professional.~1~3~nan~nan~nan~5~1~nan

review_472032514~“Excellent stay and location, great service”~My partner and I decided to stay here as we were getting married in Brisbane. We selected this hotel due to its central location which would be easy for us to get around from and also for our visitors travelling from interstate and overseas. From arrival it was an excellent experience with a high level of customer service offered from everyone ranging from reception staff to concierge and housekeeping. Stuart, the chief concierge was especially attentive assisting us with all the minute details associated with such a big day. We received complimentary chocolates and wine both on arrival and on the big day which was a nice touch from Alex, the guest relations and services manager. It was a great few days at the Pullman Brisbane King George Square and a big thank you to everyone and those behind the scenes involved for making it a special day for us, our friends and family.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_471764621~“Average”~Gym is too small and closes rather early. Nothing else really stands out all that much. Staff were accommodating and friendly enough. I was a little disappointed that they weren't able to allow my laptop to hook up to the room television (my screen was broken just prior to travel so through all of my other hotels I was simply projecting my screen through via HDMI cable). Pullman advised however that their in-house entertainment system (God how I hate those) wouldn't allow any external inputs. They had no spare monitors to lend me for use on my work emails throughout the trip. I know it would be unreasonable to expect them to bend over backwards for a fairly uncommon request like that, but it's just little things that don't allow for flexibility or adaptability (the TV screen thing) that bug me. Shouldn't the experience be about convenience and meeting varied needs?~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471224747~“Vlasta from Sandwich n coffee outlet in Lobby”~I was served by the nicest service staff I have seen in a Long time. I am in the service industry for 31 yrs. Her name is Vlasta. Even if there were 7 people in line and she was a one man operation she was so polite and apologetic to every one for her "slow" service which was Super fast. She served with so much pride. She had a bright beautiful smile which could brighten any gloomy morning. What a gem and Pullman is so blessed to have a staff like her. Keep it up Vlasta~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471050331~“A little unsure ”~Great location and good service.  Lacking in facilities after a long day.  Bar does not open until late afternoon  Club lounge very sparse in food service and beverages.  Rooms not at a Pullman standard.  Tried to book another night but unfortunately staff could not get back to us.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470803496~“Great location, comfortable and value for money”~This hotel is very central, close to CBD and very comfortable. Great value for money with a good bar and restaurant. An easy walk to public transport, the river precinct and shops and restaurants. The bath gave a nice opportunity for relaxing.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470794395~“Good Locations ”~1. Hotel located about half an hour by charterd van from the airport. Transportation is easy to anywhere in town. 2. Room is decent in size, modern & full of amenities. My room facing the park across. Nice view. 3. Hotel staff are friendly & approachable. Lobby full of sofa, business centre & cafe. 4. Hotel restaurant, have decent selection of breakfast & Chef on duty for any kind of eggs. Wow love it.  5. Food price reasonable & have room service until 10pm. 6. Enjoy my stay even only for a night.  Looking forward again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470740012~“Old hotel in a good position”~I stayed here due to a good price, but as this Pullman is usually more expensive than the 2 other Accor group hotels I have stayed in Brisbane, I expected a better standard. The Mecure & Pullman King George share the building & all facilities. The staff were all very nice and helpful and I cannot fault their service, my disappointment was with the facility itself. The rooms are very tired and outdated, I have not seen a TV as old as one in the room for a very long time. The beds are also in dire need of a refresh as is the bathroom. The cleanliness and presentation was as good as could be achieved in the aged rooms so the housekeeping is doing a good job.  The bar & restaurant on the ground floor are like a flashback to the 90s & the breakfast was a sore disappointment for $35, with 50% of the hot food stations empty at 9am and no one staffing the omelette pans it was a very small meal for the money. I also ordered a latte (at an additional cost) which was undrinkable, as I left the restaurant I went to mention this but I was informed the charges were already sent through to my account and it didnt seem worth the time to argue over $5. I have previously been to the rooftop bar on the 16th floor of the Mecure and it is much more pleasant with a more upmarket wine selection and as per the ground floor, friendly service.~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_469207632~“luxury stay”~Spent a wonderful 24 hours at the Pullman. Opted for the executive package which gave us 2 hours in the executive lounge with drinks and canapes...well worth it. Great hotel with good staff. A few minor issues that could be addressed. $40 is a bit steep for parking on a Friday night. Our room key was cancelled despite assurances it would not be due to the late check out. The problem was I had to queue for 15 minutes to get the key reactivated. The roof top bar was closed due to bed weather???? Otherwise a great time was had.~4~4~5~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_468748949~“Great hotel”~Stayed here for 2 nights on business. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms were well appointed. Location is pretty central and easy to get access to different parts of the city. The gym is shared with the Mercure and was decent for a hotel gym. Will stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467495560~“Terrible Service.”~Not what you would expect from accor/pullman. First - the front office doesnt have full details of the booking. Second - after providing details to them, the system doesnt update the rest of the staff (eg. executive lounge). Third - Try reaching in room dining 10 mins before their cut off time. (Also, not v good options on the menu)~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467392864~“Convenient & Central City Location”~Pleasant hotel in the centre of Brisbane City. Near major public transport hubs. Next door to a Mecure Hotel. All part of the Accor Group of Hotels.  Concierge service was excellent. Very helpful, friendly & informative. Reception, perhaps a bit vague, as in I asked receptionist on arrival which way is it to Ann Street & King George Square as I wanted to catch a bus on Ann Street. She just looked at me blankly & said she didn't know & suggested I look up the website or go to a bus stop out on the street & look at the signs. It may have been a silly question, as the stop I was looking for was almost directly across the road from the hotel & a short walk up the street., which I was unaware of at the time, arriving from the opposite direction. However, I do think given the quality of the hotel, reception could have been more helpful. In hindsight, should have asked the concierge. Room was pleasant. Whilst the reception area appears more up to date than the room we stayed in, it served its purpose. Bed was comfortable. Didn't hear any noise. Shower, in a bath was ok too.  Would stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_465276442~“This place is a joke”~If you look at it objectively, this place is a shambles. Rooms feel like a crack den with their washed out fluouro lights.

review_465238321~“Comfortable, friendly”~Warmly welcomed by reception staff. A very comfortable room, with lots of space. Love the fact the curtains were able to be fully closed allowing no light to enter: meaning a good sleep! Comfortable beds, pillows not so - but no light compensated.  Great location with easy access to city centre and freeways.  Will stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465194029~“Central quality property”~As a Pullman you expect a great experience on the upper end of the scale and this property didn't disappoint. Centrally located an easy 5min walk from Central or Roma St stations if using the train from the airport. Large lobby was welcoming and staff polite and efficient. Room was large and we'll appointed with quality furnishings. Bathroom large however note the shower is over the bath not stand alone.  Overall the Pullman represents value for money for business or leisure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464636179~“Week-End In Brisbane.”~We stay in the City about 4 times a year to enjoy the many cultural & great dining & bars. I haven't stayed at this hotel in many years which is now the Pullman. Looking on their web site I saw the rooms were decorated beautifully & still had the tradional yet modern bath rooms. The price was right for a Saturday & Sunday night so I booked online. Walking into the lobby I was impressed with the space & layout. On checking in I asked if a room upgrade was possible & the lovely girl was able to give us a corner room which was elegant & spacious with a extra lounge. I loved the room & the view was overlooking the Roma St gardens & the Ann Street Church.... We did learn to go down stairs to get a bucket of ice for our cold drinks as they do charge a $5 delivery fee! There is a little cafe near the lobby where you can get a ham & cheese croissant for breakfast & coffee of course. The location is perfect..walking distance to everything. Go check out the new roof bar as well, it's nice in the evening for a cocktail. Also I must add the bed is devine & large. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_464404495~“Loved it!”~Excellent location. Beautiful, spacious and clean room. Service was great. Cool rooftop bar. Only complaint would be with reservations - differing information about prices (over the phone) but in the end it all worked out fine. This was probably because we were using gift cards to pay.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464349976~“Another lovely stay.”~All of the Staff are pleasant and helpful. It can get quite busy at check-out time so you may want to do the self-check out. If you have priority check-in and check-out, the VIP check in and out is clearly marked and the Staff are very attentive.  Your free drinks voucher can also be used in their coffee shop. If you have access to the VIP Lounge, at breakfast you can order two additional hot dishes (I order two poached eggs or an omelette.) I also request Lactose free milk (I don't like soy). The Staff are more than willing to meet any of your needs.~5~5~5~5~5~4~5~nan
review_464182350~“Great hotel for a good night sleep!”~I stayed here on a business trip, and did not really have to venture to out into the city, but this hotel is smack bang in the middle of the cbd, so great location for those who want to explore Brisbane! The rooms I think need a little overhaul as it does look a bit tired, but the comforts make up for it! The bed were super comfy, and my room had thick blinds which is good! Soundwise: you can't near noises from outside, but you can hear some noises made from other guests in the hallway. The bathroom is very large but with a small squishy space for the showers (just behind the door) and there was a spacious bench with 2 sinks. Most of the amenities are made available for you. Overall, I enjoyed staying here.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan

review_463979929~“comfortable rooms”~This hotel has comfortable rooms, the rooms overlooking the church can be a little noisy in the early evening. what lets the hotel down is the room service which can only be described as awful, waiting one and a half hours for dinner on a night in which the hotel wasn't busy and then to be told that your order was 'lost' is not what you expect from a Pullman brand hotel.~3~3~nan~4~nan~nan~2~nan
review_463370105~“Great Stay”~I had a short but lovely stay at the Pullman KGS while holding an at City Hall on a Friday night. The staff were all excellent and the location is fantastic. The main area of the room are modern and very nicely furnished, the bed was really comfortable. While a bit older, the bathroom was completely functional and the double basins and the ample bench space was very appreciated given the trend towards smaller bathrooms these days with hotels. I would 100% stay again, and highly recommend.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
