review_478054646~“Ok but needs a little love”~Arrived at 5 but a lovely receptionist did ring me the day before and advise me of the procedure as their reception shuts at 4!!! . I had to provide a $150 bond (surprise to me but understand why) . This had to be given via an outdoor intercom which I felt was unacceptable given it's your credit card.  Floor was musty and needed a serious freshen up , room nice, photos on last min .com reflect room.  I would not recommend coming here alone, there are hints of shops that are close but no specifics and the hotel has quite dark surroundings. I could not visually see any food restaurants or Iga to get some (any) food. There was no milk in the fridge even for a cup of tea. We used the gourmet deliveries food option and when I rand the lady said they were busy and there would be a 75 min wait - over 2 hours later I rang to cancel and their twiceboard said they were closed (5 mins before they were due to close) and the automated message said if you have delivered food it's on its way ! It arrived in 2hours and 20! Not impressed !~2~2~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan
review_475392762~“OK for a quick business overnighter”~The location is great - walking distance to the Gabba, and to the Mater hospitals etc. The room was pretty basic, and it was a hot day. The housekeeping staff didn't make the extra effort to put on the air conditioning for me, even as a Gold accor member (I did request this), so the room was like an oven and it never really cooled down. I rang a couple of times to report the inefficiency of the air conditioning, to no avail. OK for a business over nighter, but most likely would not return.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan

review_465485721~“Interesting”~Arrived at the hotel and there were no reception staff available. A sign was placed on the counter inviting guests checking in to take a seat until reception staff arrived., so I assumed the hotel is operated on a minimum number of staff e.g. day manager type arrangement. We were then asked to provide a driver's licence and credit card for copying. I understand this is necessary because we had not previously stayed at this hotel. The staff member then advised check-out was at 10 a.m. the following morning (platinum members are entitled to a late checkout). Although we are quite capable of taking our luggage to our room, no offer was made to assist. The signage from the underground carpark to the hotel proper was confusing and after ascending the concrete staircase for several levels, we discovered obscure signage to a door leading us out of the carport to the lift. The website for this particular venue advertised newly refurbished rooms. Certainly, the room had been refurbished. However, on entering the room there was a distinct musty odour This prompted us to retreat to the balcony until the air con cooled things down, the odour remained.. The view of the city was fabulous. Venues for dining were not in close proximity so we ordered from the in-room gourmet delivery menu. Fabulous food from a local Japanese restaurant was delivered and highly recommended. Checkout was easy. The stay was very ordinary and we won't stay at this venue again.~2~4~5~5~1~5~1~nan
review_465250875~“The convenience of apartments close to the city”~We enjoy staying at the Sebel in South Brisbane as they are well appointed apartments with a kitchen and laundry facilities.

review_464870032~“Good location, let down by quality of room”~Not the normal Sebel experience! Booked into Sebel Wooloongabba to be close to The Gabba for a concert. The rooms are small but appeared to be OK value for Money. The rooms are in need of basic maintenance. Could not open window, Shower head support cheap & broken, Bathroom fittings cheap & Loose. Couch worn Frayed & uncomfortable as all fold out couches are. Kitchenette poorly equipped, very basic & skmped on everything. Basically not up to Sebel standard.~2~nan~nan~nan~2~3~3~nan
review_459930843~“Great location, comfortable stay”~This is usually my choice of apartment stay when I travel for work as I awlays know I'll get a good deal plus a good night's sleep. Bed and linen are very comfortable. Rooms are modern but pretty basic, no real style however its just somewhere to sleep that is very clean with all facilities you need. Free wifi and movies. Great location, can go for a walk around south bank or a swim in the lap pool to get in some exercise if you are travelling for work. There's a coles nearby, parking is a reasonable price. About $10-15 p/n depending on how long you stay. I recommend this hotel/apartments for business travellers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459403988~“Definately not a 4 star property”~A very disappointing experience right from the outset.  I booked this property for a business trip and during the booking I requested that the a/c be left on as I was arriving in the evening and I knew it would be hot. When I got to my room and opened the door, I was hit with a blast of heat and the temp in the room was 32 degrees. I couldn't even cool off in the pool as it closed at 6pm! You need to leave your room access key in the slot by the door so the power would work.  The furniture in the room was very cheap and basic. The couch provided was broken and so dirty that I was not game to sit on it. The pillows for the bed were as thin as 2 sheets of paper and very uncomfortable. I had to set the fridge to the coldest setting and even by the next morning the drinks I put in there were only cool and not cold. Upon waking the next morning, the bathroom stank of stale water that was sitting in the floor drain. The shower leaked more water onto the wall than what came out of the shower head and the lack of seals on the shower door meant that there was a huge puddle of water on the bathroom floor by the time you had finished.  No onsite restaurant meant you had to walk very steep hills to get a mediocre feed from one of the pubs close by and no breakfast option. Room service was a dinky take out menu that was only available from 5pm -9pm. Hint....if you are in any way mobility impaired and want to leave the hotel, make sure you have transport as you cannot walk anywhere due to the steepness of the road outside the hotel. Definitely not to the usual standard of the Sebel brand.~2~3~3~1~1~3~3~nan
review_458823916~“Currently trying to leave this hotel!”~Shocked at the state of the (tiny) bathroom - pubic hair in the corners. Rooms are cleaned ONCE A WEEK! No daily service. Only has day time reception. I think it's just used for residents - as they seem unused to hotel guests. No cafe or food in the hotel or nearby You have to order take-away or walk quite a few blocks to SouthBank. I needed a taxi to access the closest supermarket. It's just very, very old.~1~nan~nan~2~1~nan~2~nan
review_458370168~“ACCOR have lost their way”~I am an ACCOR membership rewards member for which I get charged each year to be a member but it is time to ask is it worth it.!!! It seems that Accor have lost their way in there drive to cut costs, have multiples of brands or get their name into every hotel one way or another.... Here's why; This trip I have stayed at 2 Accor hotels, the staff were brilliant, their service in both locations was excellent each time, helpful and knowledgeable. It was when it came to the room the problems always seem to start. In my normal rush to get to my first business meeting I failed to check the bottom of the iron and for the 4th time ruined a $80 business shirt. The bottom of the iron was rusty and it leaked every time you went up and down ironing the shirt. Will Accor replace the shirt ?..No And then their was the; The desk lamp failed to work ( Bris)  The air conditioning spits at you from the opposite all directly onto the bed ( and it is hot and balmy in Brisbane this week ( Bris) The shower tiles are cracked and silicon full of mould ( Syd & Bris) the Syd bathroom was particularly bad... Then shower tap cover was hanging by a thread (Syd) The shower door knob had lost all its chrome long ago (Bris) The TV in Brisbane was big enough for the toilet Leitrim own the 30 square studio I was in ( Bris) The smell in the hallway and room went from down right offensive to palatable (Bris) The drain in the basin took 10 minutes to empty (Syd) The toilet seat swivelled faster than a merry go round (Bris) Now this is not a uncommon occurrence, they send an email from Simon Mc Grath the head of Accor in this neck of the world asking for your feedback. The purpose of this is not to hear your complaints it would seem as nothing seems to ever happen with it, but once you have complained you feel satisfied you have done something and you naturally feel disinclined to state your complaint publically on trip advisor - they are tricky these Accor people . Your complaint to them does not see the light of day. In Syd I saw the maintenance guy with his scrap of paper looking harried and stressed, I wonder why. Sydney nightly cost $189 Brisbane $148 Given the consistency of the issues we find when travelling in Australia I am sure that I am not the only person having this problem....? So why do we continue to use such hotels? 1. They buy loyalty with loyalty programs and 2. In some cases their is just no other option.  Despite being conscious on what I spend on businesss travel Will I stay in another Accor property in Australia NO but I will continue to use their Asian properties where the quality of the cleanliness and maintenance is very high. And to give a comparison, I stayed at a Wyndham property this trip on the GC. The room was very clean and well maintained, the staff exceptional they even advised that the maintenance man was heading to the room I was checking in as housekeeping had advised of a blown lightbulb. While in there he advised me about a few things when I asked for assistance. All with a smile and wave good bye.~2~1~nan~nan~1~nan~4~nan
review_457256535~“Suprising that this property is called 'The Sebel'”~I booked this property as a member of the Accor Club. When I finally arrived at The Sebel South Brisbane after my Google maps took me around the block and back again (on foot), I was then met by a junior male receptionist (at 6.30pm which closes at 7pm). I was surprised when checking in that he did not want my Accor card but instead my credit card where he proceeded to take a $150 bond, which I questioned as this is a self contained apartment with no mini bar, restaurant, room service etc. He then asked for my drivers licence and proceeded to take a copy which I have never had in my whole time of being a frequent member. I was also not offered a welcome kit or any of the little perks that you get for being a loyal member of the Accor club. Once in my room, I was extremely surprised that it did not live up to their star rating.They had mould in the bathroom, the standard of the linen was average, curtains are not block out but faulty which lets in light at around 5am... this place also comes under a different name and it felt like staying in a dodgy Mantra or an Airbnb having to share the premises with long term tenants which was pointed out with a note that was cemented next to the bed with the comment that the room only get's serviced weekly and you have to keep the noise down as it is also a residential building.  Once checking out I did ask for the photo copy of my licence back as it is a bit dodgy to keep such things on file that is accessible to junior staff, the receptionist at the time was surprised and said she needed to keep it on file in which I asked her why with the reason being that they need it in case of an emergency to identify me (insert mouth dropping here). I did finally get it and tore it up but still surprised on such a request since the group has all my details on file. For $150 a night (which is not their peak rate), I am very shocked that such a property can be apart of the Accor brand. NB: Views of the balcony are of the arterial roads with peak hour happening between 6-9am and 4-7pm, no close supermarkets but a nice vending machine at the bus terminal which is a five minute walk away for any decent snacks at high prices.  Now on a good note.... the following night I stayed at The Sebel in Noosa and can not describe what an opposite experience that I had. 2 welcome drinks upon arrival in my mini bar along with a really nice cheese platter and members upgrade to one of the best suites on the property - so thanks for stepping it up Noosa....~2~nan~1~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_457249946~“Clean and comfortable”~My husband and I attended an event at the Convention Centre, and stayed at the Sebel for a Saturday night. We parked onsite, for an extra charge. The unit block is close to the famous 'Gabba cricket ground, the Mater and Lady Cilento hospitals, and a 20-minute walk to Southbank Parklands and restaurants. There was no bar or restaurant in-house, and the service desk was open only between certain hours. The single room was spacious, but the combined shower, toilet and laundry were tiny. The decor, paintwork etc needed an update. Having said that, it ticked the all-important boxes of *comfy bed, *good air-con, and * strong shower. Would we return? Probably not, but it served our purpose. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453895130~“Clean, Convienient and Comfortbable”~I stayed here for a night recently when on Business in Brisbane. The property is close to "The Gabba" cricket ground and a 10min cab ride to the city. The hotel is very easy to check in/out after hours with easy access off street parking (I particularly like hotels that have check in parking areas like this one). The room was super clean and comfortable and there's a rooftop pool with city views. New hotel with good facilities and very good value for money. Staff were super helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend this place.~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_450835482~“Good location”~Had to switch rooms mid-way through our stay due to aircon breaking.Was not offered any assistance to cart all our luggage over to the new room.This was quite an inconvenience with 5+ suitcases along with a baby and toddler equipment. Upon arriving at the new unit discovered some of the cooking utensils were put back dirty and also frypan had just been put back in the cupboard clearly unwashed with bits of food and grease etc.Clean equipment is a basic requirement and obviously the cleaning staff are not thorough.Apart from that was a good location easy to access public transport.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447850320~“Adequate”~The service was friendly and personable, which is always appreciated. However, the rooms themselves are a bit dated and definitely show signs of needing a refresh.

review_433796248~“Excellent Apartment Property... but not for all”~I had a two night stay in a one bedroom apartment. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable and with great facilities including stovetop, dishwasher, washing machine. It's a great place for those seeking to self-cater. The rooms was quiet - even being just above the lap pool and adjacent to the lift. Some have described the Sebel as "dated" and I'll admit, there are SOME dated elements. The only elements I would call dated are the carpet (which is a dated style but in good condition) and the lounge - which unfortunately was both damaged and possibly the most stained lounge I've seen in a Hotel (room 407). Even just changing the lounge chairs would update the feel of the rooms dramatically. At this point I should say, the lounge was still comfortable to sit on and everything else in the room was fantastic. It certainly did not take away from an otherwise excellent experience. Also it should be noted that for a one bedroom apartment, the Sebel South Brisbane is very reasonably priced and this should be taken into consideration when comparing with other hotels. Also for a city hotel, secure undercover parking is very reasonable at $15 per night. The location is right next to the Mater Hospital (very convenient if visiting people in Hospital) but also has cafes and restaurants within a short walk. Southbank also is not that far by foot either. I have said that this isn't a property for all. If you're looking for a full service Hotel, this isn't for you. This is primarily a self-catering apartment Hotel. There is no daily room service, no restaurant on-site and reception hours are only 7am - 7pm. Arrivals after 7pm can be accommodated but need to be pre-arranged. I did this and it was no hassle at all. While there is no restaurant on-site, there are many within a short walking distance including the famous Morrison Hotel that claims the best steaks in Brisbane. There are coupons at reception providing 20% off at the Morrison Hotel also for people staying at the Sebel. Above that, there is also dinnerware and cooking facilities in the room. Overall, other than the disappointment with the appearance of the lounge, I was very happy with the room, facilities, lack of noise and service. The rooftop terrace was also a great place to sit and relax with 360 degree views. I would have loved to sit up there at night but it is only open during reception hours (7am-7pm). If you're not requiring all of the services of a full service Hotel, I can highly recommend it!~4~5~4~5~4~4~4~nan
review_432803929~“Poor location and lacking style”~As with others, I was expecting more from a Sebel site - other than for the nearby hospitals, there is nothing of interest to bring you here. And although I had an upgrade to an "apartment", it was quite ordinary and lacking in taste and style. For what it is and location, don't think it offers value. A very ordinary pool that is both small and shallow - couldn't take too many people. Best part was probably front desk service - they were very helpful.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_432644168~“Confused identity and what was that smell?”~Business trip. Staff were very nice. But the room I was given had an odour that I found sickening - it was on the sunward side. I went back to the check-in and asked for the smell to be reviewed. Instead, the attendant immediately moved me to an upgraded deluxe room which was not necessary but appreciated. However, the "deluxe" room wasn't much if any different as far as I could see, and it still had a hint of that smell that I found disagreeable. I guess I just don't like the cleaning product and/or air freshener they use, at all. Hotel is at the junction, roughly, of 6 major roads with lots of traffic. Even on the 8th floor, the traffic noise was noticeable and woke me very early each morning. It's surprising because the balcony doors appeared to be multiple layers of glass. I dropped my towels in the shower in the first morning when I left - and on return found out that not only were they still there, but my bed was un-made! I later found a small notice under the glass on the telephone desk (see picture) explaining that they didn't do upkeep unless you asked *before check-in*. Well, nobody told me that! So I went the second day with wet towels, as my timing meant I was not in when the reception was open and thus unable to get dry towels. The room was generally clean EXCEPT for the rather worrying stain on the brown pillow on the bed that I took to be from the previous occupant. Internet was free but in my opinion relatively slow and only really good for basic browsing. I booked my room through an online site and honestly thought this was a genuine "hotel" that operated like any other I have been to - but that is not so. Without room cleaning (even if you pay for it, not available on Wednesdays and weekends) and with the objectionable (to me) odour and the stain on the pillow - well, I can't rate this hotel very highly and won't be returning. The staff were, as I said, efficient and friendly though.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~2~5~nan
review_432563429~“Lacking the Sebel style”~Stayed for one night on a business trip in October, 2016. I chose The Sebel because of its location, but also reputation for the brand. It's surrounded by hospitals and medical clinics which says to me that the majority of their visitors do not stay for fun. It seems this particular site is a recent acquisition/partnership as the branding was quite confusing. Some signs indicated it was the Sudima Suites, others the Sebel. This also confused Apple Maps when finding the place, but Google Maps worked fine. Upon arrival I was greeted by a very friendly receptionist who had everything ready for me to go, except the room. I had arrived early, so this is no big issue - however it seemed their IT system was down and they had no way of actually confirming if my room was ready. I asked if there was a bar or cafe nearby, and was told that they didn't have one in the hotel but they could recommend The Coffee Club nearby. I left my backpack there and as well as my number and was told I'd receive a phonecall when my room was ready. I returned two hours later just as I was being called, and checked in. The room was spacious and lit from a very high window, which I could barely see through thanks to its height. Another thing that stood out to me straight away was the lack of power points in the room. There was a power board velcro'ed to the carpet under the desk, and a few more behind the bed - but they took some finding. The bed itself was comfortable, albeit on the soft side. The biggest disappointment of the room though was the pillows - four were provided with no extras in the room. All were medium profile and soft, which made it difficult to get a good head position. The combined bathroom/laundry is quite small, but definitely not uncomfortable and it is compensated by a large bench space. The shower head is excellent, with good spray, nice pressure and very comfortable temperature adjustments. The other significant issue I had with the room was cleanliness. The lower aspects of the main wall with the TV has not been cleaned for a while. Scuff marks from people's suitcases were around waist-height, with brown liquid drip stains featuring as you looked lower. There was also a significant collection of dust around the skirting boards and on the TV.  Overall, the room lacked the attention to detail that you would expect from a Sebel. Other than the sign on the door and the stationary in the room, it is difficult to identify this as an Accor affiliated Sebel. It is apparent that the main clientele are there for the hospital stays, and the usual perks of staying in a Sebel are absent. What is left is a hotel that lacks the features that makes you truly enjoy your stay. ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_431146356~“Close to Lady Cilento”~I made a mistake with my booking date with booking.com. Called the hotel who quickly made the change, but cost an extra $140 to have adjoining rooms for three adults, baby and 4 year old.  Well placed for a dash to children's hospital, three minutes if you leg it.the only reason we booked for location. Rooms pretty clean. Poor selection of cutlery and plates, as we all ate together had to pool these for the stay. Fridge freezer broke down and we lost all of our fresh food, were not compensated for this, $80. Reported fridge and within 10 mins had another installed. Balcony filthy had baby and four year old grubby in minutes. Terrible design in both bathrooms, we had studio room and one bedroom apartment. Neither shower doors could open fully and both glass doors opened onto loo. Had to fill baby bath in shower, was really tricky as shower door opened about half way. No hope of getting in shower if you are bigger. Washing machines ok, but drier feature pathetic. Had to dry clothes on balcony chairs as no line supplied. Good quality DVD/ stereo, iron and ironing board. No space in kitchen for dry goods store so felt pretty cluttered, felt really cramped. No fruit bowl and no spare bowls to use We paid $2400 for 7 nights in the two rooms with car parking, had no alternate with our timeframe, would not stay again due to cost. Lifts were quick, sky deck bland but good views. Pool teeny.felt secure here. Th didn't clean or change towels whilst we were here at all, cooked some. Sausages and smoke alarm went off, normal cooking.  Lovely staff. When people use this place, little touches can make all the difference. Clean all the windows, supply clothes airer and pegs, more than one bin bag, spray oil, air freshener as we experienced Asian cooking smells from another apartment for many days, soap powder, clean balcony floor and table, remove cigarette butts from balcony drain.  It is placed well location wise, but if you like fresh air and don't want noise, This is not the place for you as it sits just off one of the busiest road networks in Brisbane. Great for plane spotting and great view of helicopter action on mater and Cilento. Walking distance to south bank. Just needs some more thought to what's in it and design. No microwave dishes supplied. Trolley to help move from car park with luggage when unpacking single handedly would be good. Rate as three stars, a way to go, but some positive signs.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428003119~“Good to avoid for business !! ”~Was a bit surprised when I checked in at Sebel South as I imagined it to be a business hotel / apartment like the Sebel in downtown Brisbane.  This place I guess mainly caters to the Mater hospital nearby and could be frequented for longer stays.  The staff were very friendly though. However the lady at the reception informed me that there is no housekeeping everyday and one has to inform if the room needs cleaning. Although I hung a "clean my room" notice outside my door, the room was not cleaned on all 3 nights that I stayed there.  They do not have a restaurant for breakfast for any snack. There's a takeaway menu available for dinner in the room. However one can access restaurants within a 10 minute walk. The reception and main door are closed by 7pm and so if you do not have your key card to open the main door, it could be a bit of trouble.  The room was however very spacious and comfortable.  Walking distance to Gabba !!!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_421969804~“Beautiful apartment, great value.”~We stayed in a one bedroom apartment for Riverfire. The apartment is a great size and beautifully appointed. The décor is fresh and very modern. The kitchenette was very handy with a fridge, convec/microwave, toaster & jug, dishwasher, washing machine and all those things you need to be self sufficient. There is also an iron and hair dryer (not one of those ineffective wall types). Toiletries provided. The pillow and beds were comfortable and the apartment was quiet once the heavy balcony door was closed.  Very short walk to Mater Private Hospital, Mater Public Adults, Mater Mothers and Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. The train and bus stops are a few minutes walk with Southbank a little further (about 10 minute walk). The pool is just a little lap pool but adequate and there is gym equipment. There is also a snack vending and coffee vending if you need it. Secure parking is available at $15 per night. The carpark was very accessible for our big 4WD with plenty of height and turning room. Most city carparks we have difficulty fitting our car in. All the staff we encountered were wonderful. It was great to experience helpful, professional service which is sadly lacking in a lot of establishments these days. There were a couple of very minor housekeeping/maintenance issues but did not distract from the stay at all (e.g. just a few marks on paintwork etc) and would not prevent me from staying again. We had free Wi-Fi too, not sure if that's standard but it was appreciated. We stay in Brisbane quite regularly and I think we've found our new 'regular'. Very good value for money. Great location as there is a lot of cafes/restaurants and services within close proximity.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan

The lock on the door to the balcony did not securely close. It was a high floor so security should have been ok but it was another small detail that was not correct.

Suite was a good size and price was about right for it (a bit tired in areas, but, good). Bed comfortable, air con good, had all the mod cons you would want in the room - washing machine/dryer combo, microwave/toaster/convection oven, stove top and a small dish washer. All was clean and tidy. Only negative was that we had to have a few hours extra after check out time - we were told in our first day that due to not being too busy and as it was only for a few hours, it would be free, the day before we left we got told by another member that it was now going to be $90 for the couple of hours, when we checked out the next day we were charged $99! - So, get in writing any other information. We were there due to a conference and due to our daughter and her child needing to be at the kids hospital. We also got her to stay at the sebel south and not the normal hotel she usually stays at - it was definitely a better choice. only negative about that was that they couldn't get us on the same floor (which was okay), but, really didn't want us to have access to each others floors to go to each others room. So if you are going with family members, make sure you are on the same floor or if it is okayed about allowing each to each floor - get in writing before hand. Would definitely stay again :) Wifi connection was good, but, due to comments I had read from others, I made sure I wrote it as a requirement before I booked the room, I suggest that if anyone really needs the wifi, they make sure they ask for it in writing, just in case.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_387283119~“Helpful staff but simple hotel”~Had to stay here for one night on a business trip. Would normally stay in the city, but this was closer to my meeting place. The receptionist in the evening was really nice and helped after I was a bit nervous ( had a scare with a taxi driver). She was really lovely and calmed down, then explained all about the hotel. It is an old one, but good spacious rooms. The bathroom is a bit small though. What really got me was the fact there was no restaurant, and to order some dinner I had to rely on a take away menu that was very old and with not many variety. If it is only for one night, pretty much just to sleep and have a shower, it is ok. More than that would be a stretch.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_385395633~“Recent Stay”~We have stayed at The Sebel South Brisbane many time over the last 4 years, the location is excellent. However this stay we noticed the cleanliness was average, bed linen i.e.. donna and pillows getting old, the lounge in the suite was 'saggy'. The cost has increased and had to pay for parking. This hotel is rated at 4 star.... It may be time for a change.~3~2~5~3~2~2~4~nan
review_383914536~“Never agai”~Not what is written in thed Escription. I travel with a colleague who uses a wheelchair. Definitely not suitable. No facilities on site. Unhelpful staff when addressed, we moved to a known hotel, the extra costs in taxi's was worth it for food on site and suitable facilities.~1~1~1~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_383298400~“4th visit never again”~Previously satisfied, but last trip very poor  Room smelly, no operating instructions for air con, no blankets. Told at check out "if you wanted blankets, you should have requested them" In the middle of winter , really ?~2~nan~4~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_381867168~“This is not a 4 star hotel”~If you want to sleep surrounded by very noisy room and with Internet work when it want, then you will enjoy that hotel. Their is no possibility to have breakfast or diner in the room, you need to walk outside more than 5 min. In spite of that room is clean~2~2~1~2~3~3~2~nan
review_379811372~“Unserviced Apartments”~When it is sold as a serviced apartment any customer would expect daily housekeeping including change of towels and making up the beds by hotel staff. Strangely this place does it just once a week unless you pay extra. If you need fresh towels then you have to pick them up yourself at the reception. My wife was a guest booked here to stay for nearly 3 weeks because the Mater hospital which is close by was where I was having treatment. But it turned out to be a bad experience after paying $135 per night. And to top it all the property is a franchise of Accor.....a joke....~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~1~nan
review_376331812~“Visit regularly”~This property remains one of the best value for money properties in the Brisbane market. The staff have remained the same for over five years and are very professional and accommodating, the location is right near shops, food and nightlife of south bank and it's a short walk into town or the cbd for other activities. The bed was the most comfortable I've had in many trips away. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, new toiletries under the Sebel brand are quite fancy and the balconies are huge.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_375242546~“Not bad but no hot water”~Actually this apartment style complex is pretty good but when you're only there for 1 night and you've on a schedule in the morning and you've got no hot water, it's really the one thing (apart from a bed) that you want guaranteed. The lady on reception was very helpful but seemed unable to determine an empty room without the assistance of the Housekeeping Manager who seemed incapable of smiling or making light of the situation. So all in all, it took about 40 mins to get into another shower which really made a mess of my morning. The studio itself was very big and had all the amenities (except the hot water) but the desk to work from was tucked away in a tiny alcove which seemed like poor design (unusual for the Accor group). The location is also just a little out of the way. I deliberately picked it because it was close to a customer but it felt like quite a hike to get to Southbank restaurants.~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~4~nan
