review_478491653~“So close to Prince Charles and Holy Spirit Hospitals”~Had to stay again whilst my Mum was in Holy Spirit Hospital. The Managers are truly wonderful, could not do enough for me. They even drove me to the hospital one morning!! This Motel is close enough to walk to Chermside shopping centre and close to restaurants. I even discovered that the sell some meals at reception which is really handy. A very friendly, exceptionally clean and well run family Motel.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_474811202~“Great location - close to Hospital”~Lovely staff and great access to hospitals and Westfield Shopping Centre. Offers everything that you would expect from this price point. This is more a boutique motel and the rooms are clean and well appointed.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_447935512~“Great location”~Great location to Chermside Westfield's (can walk), beds are comfy-good night sleep.

review_441264178~“Back again”~I came back to bring my mum to the hospital across the road . We walked across the road through the hospital car park a little escalated but so close and handy . beds great and downstairs room handy for her , service still impeccable . The motel is always extremely clean and well located to Chermside Westfield . It has such a homely feeling as most of the guests are hospital . Quite as !!!! You won't be disappointed .~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_435762344~“Great place of comfort....”~CONVIENENT PLACE TO STAY I stayed three nights to be near hospitals. Wonderful service with Jessica  over phone when making booking. Warm welcome on arrival. Room was ready early, it was available at 10.30 am, amazing service .   Parking limited but ample street parking. Walking distance to Prince Charles and Holy Spirit as well as Westfield Shopping Centre, restaurants and buses into the City.   This motel is boutique, extremely quiet, the best location,  (off the busy highway )  freshly decorated clean rooms,  very comfortable.  Staff helpful and very approachable.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_434689483~“Motel and street parking impossible on arrival”~Visiting at Holy Spirit most of the time.Very noisy traffic at night. No where to park to unload car on arrival told to come back after 5pm. Finding somewhere to have evening meal was difficult. "Walk to hospital" only applies to the young and fit. Room clean and tidy, noisy plumbing, bed excellent. Get what you pay for.................never again!!~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_433783611~“Clean, Quiet & Friendly”~I came to Brisbane to visit friends and the staff were so friendly, polite and more than accommodating. The room was clean and I felt very happy to be staying there. The beds were so comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being in a busy suburb. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383897063~“You get what you pay for”~This is a budget motel and provided everything a budget motel should. Beds were comfy, kitchenette was fully equipped and room was clean. Staff weren't the friendliest, they seemed to be bothered by having to serve their customers... the motel says free parking but there's only 6 spaces so if they are full you need to park on the street. No elevator so need to carry your bags up the stairs. Bathroom is VERY old, dirty shower curtain and the worlds smallest sink. We used the guest laundry and someone removed our clothes from the dryer and put them in a basket even though we had paid for 2 hours of drying, and our clothes were not dry yet! Found this very intrusive and rude to touch someone else's laundry...  Overall for the price it was reasonable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_371990968~“Family reunion”~On making my reservation the receptionist was very explanatory and helpful . The room was tidy , clean and very suitable for my mid range stay .

review_366277614~“Basic.”~I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I have to be honest.  My husband and I stayed here for seven nights whilst I was visiting for an operation (hubby continued to stay whilst I was in hospital and we stayed on for a few extra days after I was discharged). I will start with the positives: Wifi was free; very handy for whilst we were down there.  Was a walk to and from the hospital, so hubby didn't need to catch any taxis to and from visits Was also a walk to Chermside Westfield, which was great for shopping and getting out and about Had a kitchenette with a microwave There was an airconditioner Now the not so good points: When we first went into the room and checked the bathroom out, there was a yellow, sticky drop on the toilet seat, which we can only assume was urine, despite the paper 'this toilet has been hygienically cleaned for your use' sash on it.  The room was quite small, which meant the bathroom was at the foot of the bed The bathroom was about 1m by 2.5m. Not much space to put anything, and hopefully you don't mind your room mate hearing all normal bodily functions.  The pipes were old, which meant you could hear other guests showering. The guests upstairs would shower between 2-3am and were very loud. The pipes would screech like banshees which would wake us up, and you could hear upstairs walking (which sounded like stomping) around, and even their talking sounded loud.  There is construction going on in the area, and the workers like to start early and shout to each other, so forget sleeping in.  A couple of mornings, there were some issues with plumbing which meant water leaked through the roof in multiple places near the bathroom, through the roof and dripping on the carpet.  Price was average for what you got; I think it might be worth springing the extra dollars and staying at one of the other nearby accommodations, but if you only stay a night, then I would say it was okay. The bedding (including pillows) seemed very thin and worn; they had pilling on them. The above complications did not make recovery after surgery very restful, but at least we had somewhere to stay.  The people running the motel were very friendly and helpful, so I could not fault the service, but overall, I think the motel could use a bit of a freshen up, especially the plumbing. I would still suggest this place to someone who needs a budget friendly place to stay if going to hospital, but I will probably not return.~3~2~nan~nan~2~nan~5~nan
review_364315535~“Worth it”~We decided to stay here to get our heads around the time difference before setting off on our travels and we're glad we did! The receptionist was extremely helpful - sorry we didn't get her name - she gave us advice on how to get places and was just generally really friendly! It's so close to the Westfield shopping centre and chermside bus station. Hotel was clean. Bed was big and comfy. And coming into the room after a 26 hour journey to a jug of ice cold water was lovely!! 100% would be happy to go back there!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_338614609~“Overnight stay”~Basic motel very nice for an overnight stay,only 800 metres from Chermside shopping centre. Very quiet at night,manager was very friendly limited parking on site but street parking is plentiful. Good size room and comfortable bed.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_328934443~“Be warned”~I booked 3 nights at this motel through their website. However due to health reasons I cancelled the booking 10 DAYS BEFORE MY STAY. And my credit card was still charged $118 - one nights accomodation. I've called the motel 3 times and left messages for the owner to call back so I could explain the reasons I cancelled. My calls were not returned. BAD form Chermside Court Motel. Never been charged for cancelling so far out from my stay.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_324920818~“Good position”~This Motel is in a good position if you are needing to be near Hospitals, and close to the Westfield Chermside Shopping Centre . The room was clean, and had a microwave and you can get frozen meals from reception , which is handy. Staff are very pleasant. On the down side, there are only 6 car parking spaces and we had to park on the side of the road, so vehicle safety is poor.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_320298072~“Very good”~Doner kebab very good. Excellent service . Quick & friendly. Hot. Lots of chairs to sit & eat in peace. Convenient long trading hrs . Clean. Good value at only $8.60 for a small kebab.. loads of shaved lamb. Baklava & Turkish delight for sale . Looked yummy but I didn't try this time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_314889716~“Microwave in room.”~A very comfortable 2 night stay and we would definitely stay again. Microwave in room and frozen meals can be purchased from Reception. Excellent location for Prince Charles and Holy Spirit hospitals.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

review_284105658~“Tiny rooms”~Although the rooms was clean and tidy and had all we needed, space was missing. Little to know off street parking, 6 parks for 18 units. We had 2 queen beds in one room, only 1 bedside table for 4 people, bathroom was only big enough to turn in, no space to put clothes do they don't get wet. No space to put toiletries while in the shower, towel rail only enough space for 1 towel. Would I stay here again no~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_270008010~“Awful night of noise! ”~Currently staying in Room 6 ... Or as I have dubbed it, "The room from hell"! I made a last minute booking based on location ... Paid $130 and I wish I had gone elsewhere. You are greeted with a tiny car park and incredibly skinny streets around the motel to park on when no room in it. The streets have four hour parking from 11am - 6pm weekdays which can make it difficult for longer stayers.  The room itself is clean. One double and two twin beds. Tiny kitchenette with microwave, kettle and toaster. Tiny bathroom ... Smallest shower I have ever seen - and I have stayed in an Ibis Budget and Tune hotel!  But this gets two dots because if you pay for a bed, you want to be able to sleep in it ... I know ... Strange concept!  The noise here does not allow that! I'm on the lower floor ... Sounds like an army of elephants above me ... Who don't sleep! They shower at 1am ... Use the toilet all night ... Go in and out of balcony door ... Talk and yell ... And you can hear every single thing below! This room has the garbage bins near it in the back courtyard ... At about 1am someone started rummaging around in them! There was some sort of strange animal in the house next door that sounded like a pig making noises all night. For a quiet, suburban area which is used in advertising the hotel, I have not seen it.  The manager was lovely and very accommodating ... But I would not recommend staying here if you want sleep ... It really is a one dot facility with a bonus for the nice manager!  I am not a light sleeper, but I struggled. If you have to stay - avoid Room 6,get an upper floor room, and be considerate of those trying to sleep below you!  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_262338830~“Excellent rooms + great location”~My wife and I were up to see a concert in Brisbane and stayed at Chermside court motel. The motel was so close to transport/shops and a short trip to the Entertainment Centre. The rooms were very clean and spacious, and the staff were courteous and attentive. They made the stay very homely and helped us with anything we needed. I would definitely recommend the motel - really enjoyed our stay!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_262328737~“Perfect place to stay for our hospital visit”~We stayed at this motel due to dad being hospital. Its so close and handy to the hospital yet so close to all the other pubs, clubs and restaurants. Mum loved Westfield to collect all the gear that dad needed at times and to do what woman love to do. (Shop) The managers were wonderful, explaining so much to us with regards to the PTS. So helpful nothing was a issue we wanted. The place is spotless and super quiet.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_257948973~“Somewhat overpriced”~This property is located close to the Prince Charles Hospital which was the reason we booked. The room was clean with a double bed and a single bed. There is free wifi but not in the rooms and ours also didn't work in the common area. The air con worked well and we had a comfortable sleep. For our second night we stayed at Essence Serviced Apartments and for a cheaper rate we got a 1 bedroom apartment with a full kitchen and easy access wifi. Also closer to the hospital. Plenty of parking and the offer of leaving our car all day the following day. I regretted paying more at the Chermside Court Motel. Staff were very helpful at both locations.~3~nan~3~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_240942082~“Clean comfortable quiet with friendly staff”~Comfortable beds, quiet location we could not fault this good value motel type accommodation. Centrally located next to the Chermside hospital, a short walk to Chermside shopping centre. Though there are only a few parking spots in the car park there was plenty of parking on the street. Recommended~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~4~nan
review_238839135~“Update on my earlier review on Chermside Court Motel”~Have now stayed here twice since Christmas and both times have asked for rooms with the updated Aircon.

review_228973811~“Great place to stay”~We stayed in an upstairs room in the corner facing north east wonderful room, we were upgraded to a king bed which was an awesome surprise since we were staying three nights and very quiet location, the other benefit was the free Wi-Fi. We loved the shopping centre near by very handy.  Chris and Rob are amazing people and the motel is very clean.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_224788655~“Excellent Northside Motel”~My partner and I recently stayed at Chermside Court Motel from North Rockhampton. We found the location to be central to the hospital, airport and Chermside Shopping Centre. We experienced friendly knowledgeable service from a variety of staff members and found the Manager to be a wonderful help for any queries we had. The rooms were clean and well presented. It was wonderful to be able to walk to all appointments at the hospital as we are an elderly couple and rely on public transport. Great find.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_223299740~“Great spot if heading to the airport . Clean and tidy”~A nice boutique motel, in a peaceful , quiet area of north Brisbane . Great stop over for the airport, the rooms were of high standard, and great service from managers to cleaners were so helpful and courtesy to show me were the nearest shops and restaurants. The location was perfect a home away from home. 5 out of 5 Chermside Court Motel~5~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_222055001~“A good find”~Stayed here for five days and it was good. Booked because price was good and all I needed was a bed. It was fine with a good quality bed. Bathroom was very small and room lacked a comfortable chair but the facilities were perfectly adequate. I would stay again but it may not suit everyone, it is basic and if that's all that is needed you will enjoy your stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_190915269~“Location excellent but Air Conditioner from the Ark”~The location for us was excellent as Family live not far away and the shopping centre is close by. We stayed for a week over Christmas and although we changed rooms because of the Aircon. Noise it was just as bad if not worse. The Managers were most apologetic and as helpful as they could be, supplying us with a standing fan to try and help us alleviate the humidity and heat in our room at night, but even it made a bit of noise so sleep was limited. The airconditioning units are ancient and VERY noisy. I was glad to return home to our reverse cycle Aircon.  The only other place I have come across these type of ancient units is Fiji and it was replaced with a new Aircon. Unit while we were there. Unfortunately, I don't think the Owners are willing to update the airconditioning which is amazing when you think how much more energy efficient the newer models are. Would love to recommend the place but lack of sleep is not a recommendation although the beds were very comfortable and the other facilities adequate and the Managers lovely.~3~4~5~1~3~4~4~nan
review_170544944~“Excellent home away from home”~Excellent home away from home in difficult circumstances for our family.

review_170264260~“Perfect accommodation for a great price”~I stayed here by myself back in July. I was given a free upgrade to a king room which was fantastic. Great price , great location .

review_164955494~“Comfortable night”~Stayed here one night in June 2013, the room was nice and comfortable, bathroom a bit squeezy but it was clean, the motel seems to be a converted house, with 3 or 4 rooms on the ground floor, and a couple more above, it is in a side street so no traffic noise. convenient to Chermside shopping centre, and next door to Prince Charles hospital. for cheap clean accom this did it for me.~3~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_160327248~“Good average hotel”~Clean and comfortable 3 1/2 star. Manager okay, a bit negative  Served it's purpose for a no frills overnight stay Great coffee shop/ deli just down on Gympie Road Westfield shopping centre nearby Good location for Prince Charlses hospital~3~3~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_155852775~“wish I stayed somewhere else - not recommended”~The room was not cleaned ONCE in the 5 night stay.  The shower had hair in the plug hole. Had to ask for fresh towels every day - they just kept recycling and on my first day they left me with only one towel. I had to ask for the second one for my hair!!! The room started with 2 towels and a bath mat. There was no block soap, just a dispenser on the wall which would have been ok if they had given me a face washer or some other usable item. No hand towels. Air conditioner was noisy, bathroom squeezy.  Fridge was noisy and road noise was noticeable. Crockery and cutlery were dirty. Could hear the people partying upstairs and only 6 parking spaces for 12 rooms. Manager was always smoking outside and within 4m of the front access - illegal. Stingy and unhelpful.~1~1~4~3~1~1~1~nan
review_128214862~“Average accommodation, not 3 1/2 stars and not clean, but comfy beds”~Our first impression of the room was fairly disappointing and we really didn't wish to stay there, the room was very dated but we did recognize that for the price the room wasn't going to be flashy! The bathroom was the worst part of the stay, not only was it tiny, the shower was small and dirty. The tiles were covered in mould which scraped off when rubbed with a finger so certainly could have been removed easily with bleach, which made us question just how well the facilities had been cleaned. There were only 2 towels provided, no facewashers or hand towels and the soap was a liquid dispenser that smelt like aftershave. The dining chairs were dirty and one was ripped. The positive was a great bed, very comfortable but overall we found the room dirty and in need of a good clean, particularly the bathroom. We felt this wasn't a 3 1/2 star establishment and that the rate would be better priced at $90 per night. Ok for a 1 night stay but we didn't wish to stay any longer.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_121345533~“Not bad, but I'm not eager to go back ...”~For me the highlight of my stay here was the fantastic bed - I had a great night's sleep. Also, it isn't too far from the airport (15 minute drive?), and close to a Westfield so the location is pretty good depending on what you need to do in Brisbane. However, while the bed and TV were quite modern, the mint green 70's decor in the rest of the room certainly did not appeal me. And though the staff were friendly and reliable, the sign in the room indicating there was a $35 charge for any dirty cutlery in the room detracted from the hospitality. Overall not a bad little motel, but I am not eager to go back there either.~3~3~4~5~3~3~3~nan
review_109068024~“Lacking the special touches. Needs to drop the price to around $90 to recommend it.”~This place was in a lovely quiet street with a nice leafy outlook. Can't say that I hated this place, it's decorated with a modern (budget) look and spacious with a balcony. Everything was clean ... on the first day... but daily cleaning was a bit lacking. Floors stayed unvaccumed for the entire stay and when they made the bed it was literally just pulling up the cover... not even the sheets were pulled back up .. leaving the bed a lumpy mess. They have a microwave and crockery, but you have to pay $35 if you fail to wash them up when you leave. The website highlights in red that it has wireless internet. It connects, but the signal is too weak. The owner had no idea about operating the internet and I don't think he really cared too much if customers got it or not. Phone calls are charged at 77c for a local call. There are none of those little touches you enjoy at a motel. No pool, no dining room (though you can order a TV dinner for $10 to microwave in your room) and no shampoo/conditioner. The shower gel is one of those dispenser types. Smelt nice enough, but no lather. You get plenty of UH milks and biscuits. There are no "do not disturb" signs either.. so just a litlte hint. Put the latch on the door when you're there. You never know when the owner decides to walk in (without knocking!!). There are a couple of car spaces, but if you miss out you may find yourself packed a long way down a narrow street. As I said, I didn't hate the place, it was close enough to Chermside Shops to not take the car, and very convenient to Prince Charles Hospital. The price ($120 per night) for what you get (or don't get) is over inflated. For an extra $10 you can get a hotel room in the city with glorious river views, proper kitchen, seperate bedroom.~3~2~5~4~4~4~2~nan
