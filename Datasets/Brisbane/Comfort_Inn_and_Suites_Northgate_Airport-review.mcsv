review_477273190~“Fine for an overnight stay close to airport”~We stayed here one night while waiting for an onward flight. Check-in and check-out was painless and friendly. Our room was on the ground floor. It was one of the cheapest units so we weren't surprised to find that it was relatively small (some head room is lost because a staircase to the rooms above reduces the area we could walk around in, but we used the lower area to store our luggage). The bed was OK, the AC and everything else worked so we were comfortable enough. We requested a breakfast of cereals & juice to be delivered the night before - this meant taking a fair bit of stuff out of the mini-bar overnight to fit milk etc in. There was complimentary wifi available, but when we tried to use it, it was so slow that it was effectively unusable. We ate dinner at the motel's restaurant - we thought it was quite good and the prices were reasonable. The airport shuttle ($10 ea) to get us out to the airport was a nice touch - saved the hassle of arranging a taxi.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_476647219~“Quite old, not very close to airport”~Chose this hotel, for early morning flight and airport transfers included. Room was quite old and dated. Tiny and average bathroom. Ordered room service for dinner, was acceptionally good food.  Not happy when we phoned for transfer from airport to hotel at 5pm only to be told only runs in the morning. Cost $28 for a taxi from the airport. On arrival tried to book a 6am airport transfer only to be told they start from 7am! So another $28 for our transfer back to the airport. $56 in total for taxis on top of room.  Free in termed was so slow we couldn't use it.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474570663~“Great Motel, well positioned, highly recommended!”~My husband and I visited Brisbane recently (for unpleasant reasons) and stayed in this motel again in one of the apartments. The room we were given was fantastic, it was spacious, clean, modern and very quiet given the location. The staff are always very pleasant and accommodating. We ate at the restaurant one night, the food was great and again staff were friendly but not overbearing. There's ample parking and the motel is located close to service stations, shopping centers, small convenience stores and the airport. Thank you so much to Adam, the manager, I cant thank you enough, you've helped make our trip much easier and more pleasant. Highly recommended.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_474517725~“Rooms are decent. Overall shabby. ”~It's a $20 taxi from the airport to Comfort Inn. The lobby is dingy, and the general appearance is not much better. The pool is dirty, and I wouldn't swim in it! I was pleasant surprised by the clean, comfortable room and had a decent stay. Maybe for a single traveler, but great for a family.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474391704~“Value for money”~Stayed for 4 night while training in the area, had dinner at the restaurant every night and the meals were great with the light meals very filling. Didn't try the breakfast though as I had to leave early each day. Room was clean and tidy, mini-bar well stocked. Room was also made up every day which wasn't expecting.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473993539~“Ok”~I stayed here on a recent business trip to Brisbane. Lucky I had a hire car as the restaurant was shut due to an accident, I could have ordered takeaway but last think I wanted to do after a long day at work. Room was ok, clean, bed comfortable however it had a very strong chemical smell. Service reasonable. Good location to airport but fair way from city.~3~3~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_473016205~“after a long flight”~it is a long flight from Canada to Australia, and it was very nice to check into a room that was clean, comfortable and had a very good bed to sleep. The Inn is very close to the International Airport which was very handy for traveling again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_472505323~“Comfortable, but......”~We stopped for 1 night following our arrival in Brisbane late in the evening. The room was very well thought out, the bed very comfortable, a great shower, and a well stocked mini bar.  But there were 2 downsides. The WiFi was unusable in our room (222), the SSID was visible but signal was so low we could do nothing with it.  We were also caught off guard by the cost for the breakfast. All Choice hotels we have stayed in before have included a complimentary continental breakfast, so when this hotel listed their restaurant breakfast hours and description prominently we assumed it was included. Wrong! Since both WiFi and breakfast are important to us when booking, this rating came down. But the room itself was too nice to drop it to a 3.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471514328~“Very comfortable ”~We had a very comfortable night staying with our children when flooding caused us to change plans. It was a happy discovery as we will definitely stay here again. We had a 2 bedroom suite that was very well appointed. Very well priced.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471238486~“Great location near airport”~Stayed here to be close to airport. Free parking, ac, wifi, and small refrigerator in the room. Room was clean and comfortable. They warn you that the property does not have an elevator and some of the rooms are on the second floor. They offer a limited shuttle service in the morning for a fee. If you have a time outside their hours, they will call a taxi for you. Checking in and out was very easy. The front desk staff was very helpful with any questions I had.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469986017~“Convenient and comfortable motel”~This motel is situated conveniently to the airport, freeway, CBD and Gold Coast. Excellent restaurant meals and breakfast, clean comfortable rooms. We have stayed here frequently and it is consistently good.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_468071990~“great place near airport”~very helpful staff at reception made our stay a very good experience; some nice restaurants in the area, shuttle to the airport; air cond. device needs some introduction, but then it works very well, pool needs some work;~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462375666~“Would stay here again”~The room was very quiet considering there being a busy road outside and it was right next to a stairwell. The room itself was clean but the bed covers were stained which was a bit off putting. The restaurant food was great and well priced. The shuttle bus service to the airport was excellent.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_461607325~“One of the better Comfort Inns”~Have stayed here a few times when catching early flights and always ticks the boxes. Clean and well appointed. Rooms can be hot in summer and the A/c takes a while to kick in but had worse. Good water pressure in shower. Staff efficient and friendly and a good restaurant/bar for meals if you don't want to go out~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_439796976~“Don't stay there. Terrible.”~We booked a two bedroom apartment and called this establishment before leaving Perth to make sure we could get in as we were arriving late at night. Upon arrival we needed to use the night phone to be given the code for the key box. We were given the code but there was only one key in there and it wasn't ours. We were left waiting outside at midnight for an hour in the dark while they tried to sort it out. We were eventually told that they had mistakenly given our apartment to someone else and we would have to settle for a bedsit! They said they would sort it out in the morning. We were only staying for one night!  The next morning the manager seemed to think it was a joke and was quite rude. A very bad experience. I would advise against staying at this hotel.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_436935785~“Close to the airport”~This property’s key attraction is being only five minutes from Brisbane Airport. This is a massive convenience factor.  The rooms are small and the downstairs ones loose space to an intrusive staircase. There is effectively a galley coffee station and fridge in the narrow entryway / corridor. but for transit that’s not a problem The bathroom is also very small. There was a great shower head and good water pressure but no fan in the bathroom.  There is also no alarm clock which is odd as far from all travellers have smartphones. One of the interior lights didn’t work and the power points are in difficult to reach spots either side of bed. The rooms are (mine was) double glazed with thick curtains but there was still some road noise.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_435676575~“average at best”~Arrived at 1:30 a.m. and had to call a number in order to get into a lockbox to retrieve our keys. It took awhile for someone to answer, but our taxi cab driver assisted by letting us use his phone. Once in the apartment (two floors), discovered that the air conditioning upstairs in the bedrooms does not work--just a fan. It was not exactly cool at night. Only the downstairs aircon worked and we weren't planning to sleep on the couch, so it was a hot night. One thing that really irritated me: the preponderance of little bottles of alcohol and snacks and water and soft drinks on the counter and in the fridge. None of this stuff is included and you can be sure the cleaning staff will carefully count what's left. I just find these little add-ons annoying--not that I want any of them, mind you. That's the point. If I want alcohol and candy bars, I'll bring my own, thank you very much. That, in addition to the sign that says to leave the kitchen the way you found it or there will be an additional fee added to your bill. So, now I have to check my credit card bill in a couple days to make sure they didn't charge me for the glass I left on the counter.  This place is clean and tidy and somewhat close to the airport, but it's still a $30 cab ride to the airport. Two other airport hotels are much closer. No luggage storage. This was a major problem for us, as we were planning to return here for another night after a trip to the South Pacific (traveling light and leaving unneeded items behind). We went to another hotel instead to store our luggage, and where we will stay in the future.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434738359~“Excellent accommodation”~I only stayed one night but this was a great place for a transit visit. Room was comfortable and clean and the restaurant meal was very nice. The hotel is directly across the road from a service station if you need anything and the room has a well stocked mini-bar. The staff were very pleasant.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_430682884~“Good accommodation near Brisbane Airport”~We stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites Northgate Airport for one night after we had arrived from Alice Springs. It is about 1,5 km to the airport, so I would recommend to go by taxi. The distance to the next train station Northgate is about 700m from there, so you can go to Brisbane CBD easily within 15 minutes ( 5$ one way). The employees at the reception were very nice and helpful, hence they gave us information about things to do in Brisbane. Our rooms were well-equipped, spacious, clean and comfortable. Free Wi-Fi is also available. There is nothing to complain about it but there is not anything special at all. It serves just the purpose. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_428037877~“Perfect for over night airport transfer”~We wanted a hotel to stay for the night near to the airport, arriving domestic and transferring to international early morning. This was perfect for our requirements. The staff were very helpful although the reception staff a little grumpy! We had a lovely meal in the restaurant, great value & the waitress was very friendly.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_424565909~“You saved my bacon”~Gosh imagine arriving at the hotel and I had booked the wrong night! I was so lucky and they found me a room for the night and nothing was too much trouble. The room was excellent, very clean and quiet which is what I needed as I was pooped. I had a lovely cooked breakfast in the morning and I was not rushed away as I had to hang around for a while for my lift. Thanks for looking after me, a great start to my holiday.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_420345175~“Comfortable ”~Stayed overnight only. Beds were good and sturdy as my husband has a bad back. Loved the fact that the shower was modified to accommodate people with a disability. Located in Northgate suburb and only 10 minutes from the Brisbane airport and motorway back to the Sunshine coast. Meals were reasonably priced and filling. Will definitely return here if passing through.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_416956514~“Location”~Two floors which is very suitable for family with four. And the location is very close to Airport and the Inn can offer you a shuttle with only 25 AUD for four which I think it is acceptable and more convenient to take train to the airport.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_413337942~“excellent restaurant”~Close to Brisbane airport, maybe 10 minutes drive away. The room was comfortable and clean and whilst situated on a busy road there was surprisingly little traffic noise..We had breakfast each day in the restaurant, with a choice of continental or hot food. The continental breakfast at $15 pp was very good, with freshly brewed coffee, juice, toast with spreads, fresh fruit, danish pastries, and cereals. For $19.50 pp the hot breakfast was very good value with the usual sausages, bacon, eggs, tomatoes etc. We had dinner there on two occasions and both meals were excellent, but the Confit Duck was superb. Top marks to chef, Kim. and waitress Alexandra for her pleasant and professional attention.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_412628958~“Great overnighter near Brisbane Airport.”~Had an overnight stay on my way through Brisbane. This Motel has all the characteristics of an airport motel. There is no shuttle from the airport so this can lead to Taxi abuse as the hotel is just outside of the airport area. A shuttle to the airport can be organised. The room was clean and tidy and had all the expected amenities. I had an upstairs room and found it difficult lugging my bad up and down the narrow staircase but other than that the room was quiet and comfortable. I had an enjoyable dinner in the restaurant which is opened from 7am to 9pm. The menu is good for a small restaurant. I had a the sea food platter and found it to be tasty and good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_406508269~“Friendly helpfull staff and comfortable rooms.”~We originally booked for three nights in a studio apartment but decided to stay an extra night. It was no problem for us or the staff but we had to change rooms. Our first room was upstairs and very spacious with a kitchenette. It would have been perfect for us if there had been a couch instead of a single bed in this room. The small but functional bathroom had a good shower with hot water almost instant. Traffic noise from outside was also very minimal. Our second room was also upstairs and slightly smaller but the bathroom was a bit bigger. This room faced Toombul Rd but there was very little traffic noise. The only negative for this room was the rediculously small fridge that was so jam packed with mini bar stuff, which we definitely don't use, there was nowhere to put any milk or anything else. A big plus is the free washing machine and dryer, although you may have to clean the lint filters yourself. There is a BP service station across the road that has bread,milk and other small ltems. Northgate train station is also a short walk from the property. There is plenty of free car parking here too. Clean, comfortable value for money.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_401473778~“Convenient, comfortable and close to airport”~I had to overnight in Brisbane due to a late arrival. I called ahead and as I would be arriving after reception closed, they organised a remote checkin via phone. This worked perfectly. The property is well lit late at night and I felt quite safe taking care of myself at the late hour. The room was very comfortable, had everything I needed and I had a good night sleep. I didn't find it noisy (the road outside is very busy). Only issue for me was the room was up one flight of stairs and I had a heavy suitcase.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_393683491~“Comfort inn Northgate”~We had one night at this motel,when we arrived, we were welcomed with open arms couldn't do enough to help.The room was lovely and clean an very comfortable special after a plane journey.I highly recommend this motel as it's also very close to the airport.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_393015317~“overnight stay”~My wife and I tour all over Australia each year for about 2/3 months and we booked this motel as an overnight stay before picking up our Apollo motor home from just down the road within walking distance. We had seen the location of the motel in previous visits to Apollo and after checking it out on their website all seemed OK for us. Unfortunately although the staff were very pleasant and the room was clean and tidy, and very quiet overnight for a main road location, we both found the bed so uncomfortable that we could not sleep very much, It had one of those mattresses that tossed the fellow sleeper around every time any minor movement was made so we were fairly tired before starting our travels.~2~nan~nan~1~4~nan~4~nan
review_392699823~“Overnighter”~Last minute booking to collect family from airport and found the rooms lovely well presented lots of room. Breakfast the next morning was delicious plenty to keep us going. Only downfall from the room itself behind the table and curtains was mould. Obviously the moisture in the room created this, it is a problem that needs to be fixed.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_391999096~“Clean and convenient”~Older design motel with outside doors. The room was clean and comfortable at a good price. Hoever, It was noisy.

Great food and drinks at a great price.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan

Chef served me with a very nice breakfast(special thanks to Chef for the same)... Rooms are well furnished and maintained.. Its near to Airport equal cost if we travel in train or taxi..Value for money... Little noisy as it in Roadside..

review_388761202~“Nice suite, but.....”~The suite we were in was a great size for a family and convenient to the airport ($40 taxi ride). The 2 bedrooms are nicely sized and the bathroom clean. There is even a pull out sofa in the living room. The only thing I found a little off putting was that all the outside lights were out around our room. Finding our room at 9pm with 2 kids in the dark was a chore, and honestly, a little scary for small kids- we had to use our cellphone in order to see the path and find our room numbers. Other than the exterior lighting issue, the room was clean and the staff friendly. I'd stay again if looking for accommodation near the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386837422~“Great Stay & Great Staff”~Great place to stay. Close to everything you need. 10 minutes from the airport & city. Close to Gateway Freeway north & south. The staff are lovely, so helpful & friendly & the food in the restaurant is excellent.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_385162983~“All night traffic noise! ”~To me a hotel is all about the quality of the sleep you get. How clean it is, modern it is, etc means nothing if it's that noisy you can hear road traffic all night and your neighbors TV until after 1am even through your ear plugs! To be be fair the lovely lady on reception did tell me she would have moved us to a quieter room but most were against the busy arterial road intersection and the complex was full the night we stayed! Thank goodness we needed to get up early so torture ended around 5.30am. Next time we need an airport hotel we'll be off to something on a quieter spot.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384158001~“One night stand”~We arrived after an international flight for a quick one night sleep over. Check in was easy and quick. The room was comfortable and clean. Carrying the bags up the stairs was a slight challenge, but otherwise it suited our needs perfectly.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_382638873~“Good bed, nice shower, really good food”~After staying for two weeks in super hot and humid Port Moresby, PNG it felt awesome to be in the cool of Brisbane. The Comfort Inn staff was friendly and helpful, but the shower and bed were the real stars of our stay! Hot water, warm and soft bed made my night! A real plus was the creative menu choices in the hotel's restaurant. And the deserts were good, especially given the "average" class of hotel. Stay there, and sleep well!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382385259~“Comfortable and basic”~Comfortable and clean accomodation with a very happy and friendly gent at the desk. We got in late and nothing was a problem I even got a couple of ciders from the restaurant to sip on before bed and the room had a nice mini bar as well. I would stay again as the service was great. The only problem is the road noise but we do live miles from anywhere but.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~5~nan
review_382066098~“Good accom close to airport”~Recently stayed at Comfort Inn for business and found it to be very clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms facing Toombul Road are noisey in the morning due to the road traffic so if you want a sleep in you should ask for rooms not facing the road. Internet is free and fast. The restaurant is good for breakfast or dinner and is reasonably priced with a good selection of food and drinks available. Would definitely stay here again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_382047138~“Comfortable.....”~We initially chose to stay at the Comfort Inn for 1 night as it was close to the airport and we had an early flight the next day. However, due to unforseen circumstances, we were unable to make our flight the next day. The staff were so accommodating in allowing us to stay an extra night in the same room. The room itself was extremely clean and well maintained with its own courtyard. The onsite restaurant is well priced and the food is adequate. The restaurant staff should be commended for their polite, friendly and welcoming nature. We found that nothing at all was too hard for any of the staff from reception to housekeeping.  Only downside ( and only because we no longer had a hire car) was that there was no other dining or entertainment options within walking distance. Otherwise, the train station is just around the corner and the bus service is close.  If you are after a hotel that is close to the airport then I couldnt recommend this hotel anymore.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_379867089~“Road noise but otherwise good.”~A brief stay in Brisbane meant an airport hotel and this is an adequate choice. No Brisbane airport hotels are on-site and there is no shuttle to the hotels, so a taxi ride is required. There are closer hotels, but if looking for affordable, clean accommodation consider this hotel.  Check ins after 2230h are via a phone at reception and the process was smooth. We did not try the cafe.  On-site parking is free. Our room was quite noisy as it was upstairs at a fairly busy intersection, so consider asking for a quiet room.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_375765046~“Quick stop ”~Easy check in process, found my room was noisy because of the road being right outside the room. The room was very clean and the shower pressure was phenomenal!
