review_478682505~“Mantra”~This hotel's location is great. It is an easy walk to the ferries, shopping and restaurants. The staff were please tell enough, rooms fine but the noise from the garbage Shute and next door coming and going through the night made sleeping impossible.~3~3~4~1~3~4~3~nan
review_478443971~“Good location for city hoppers”~The location is good, a few minutes walk to Queen Street (the heart of the city); similar distance to famous Brisbane riverside. The premises is good maintained. Room is clean and comfortable. Our room has a bedroom with queen bed and another (without any window) with single bed. Overall room condition is fine.  It misses a fry pan in the kitchen. We think the exhaust hood could be a bit cleaner. A bit noisy in the balcony (mostly at evening hours), may be due to air conditioners / chillers from other low building (our room faces the junction of Mary Street and Albert Street). Smoking and loud chatting from other flats are felt. All gone when balcony doors were closed. Paid Wi Fi and carpark (basement A$32 per night).  The reception staff are helpful and nice. We are happy to stay here.~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_477841891~“Average service”~Housekeeping forgot to put the the mattress toppers on our 2x single beds in our rooms. When we called reception we were told too late for them to fix. Slept on a hard base/springs all night! Worse sleep ever. Also no compensation or apology the next day. Staff didn't care to correct the error made.~5~3~5~1~1~3~1~nan
review_477560524~“Great place to stay for business or pleasure.”~Centrally situated to shopping and other activities that would benefit visitors to Brisbane. Apartments are well appointed and comfortable. Some apartments need walk in showers for the less mobile in the community. Staff friendly and helpful. Daily newspaper is a great idea!~4~5~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_476728716~“a bit concerned”~Good location, room was roomy and clean.. Bit of a concern with that there was a power switch hanging off the wall and it did not get fixed for the whole three day stay. Staff was friendly on check in but did not address the power switch with safety concern. Very close to the casino and south bank~3~5~5~3~2~4~2~nan
review_476608545~“Good location, average accommodation”~The hotel itself is situated in an ideal location close to everything, however we were a bit disappointed with the cleanliness of the room. It was a comfortable, average stay. The breakfast was also a bit disappointing as it is not in this hotel but another chain around the corner, you also have to pay extra for a few items, so not a fully inclusive breakfast..~3~3~4~4~3~2~3~nan
review_476218969~“Central”~Handy to everything. Self contained . Shower no good for me because couldn't climb into the bath. If Mantra member book through them or not allowed late checkout. Car parking charge should be advertised.~3~3~5~4~3~5~3~nan
review_475712045~“One of the best in the city centre”~Mantra on Mary is one of the best hotels in the city centre - it's one of the few with a decent shower, meaning a shower with a door that stops water spraying all over the floor. People on holidays do not want to mop water off the floor after having a shower!~4~4~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_475419688~“Great location .. ”~Actually enjoyed our stay here , the location is amazing . The only let down was ..we had an expressed check out because of our early flight ..as we locked the key away I remembered leaving my baby boys birth certificate in the table drawer, my own fault !! We needed this to fly with , luckily they said he could fly with his Medicare card. I called up as soon as we got home to be told someone has already checked into that room and they would have to call house keeping but would get back to me .. This was on Monday,for the rest of Monday I heard nothing back. I called up again on Tuesday and then Wednesday it was the same girl and she told me to bare with her as she hasn't heard back from house keeping .. I waited.. by Thursday I wasn't to please and I called again this time it was a man who answered he was very helpful .. he called me back three times , First was to tell me that the girl was told on Monday that they hadn't found anything.. Second was to tell me that they had checked everything over again and still hadn't found it!! Last call ( because I wasn't to happy that a baby's birth certificate had just disappeared ) he got the drawer checked for me. Still nothing ! The certificate was put in the drawer so it did not get bent or ripped!! Opening the drawer it would have been very clear what the document was. Not sure why anyone would throw that in the bin. It would have been easy to trace who it belonged to. I was also told that it was the head of house keeping that cleaned that room!! Very angry with myself for not making sure I had it before leaving but also very angry for it just going missing!!.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475419144~“Mantra on Mary”~This was my 4 th visit to Mantra on Mary and this time booked 3 bed accom also had 3 other rooms for family and friends her for a wedding. Great quality and sensible price. Have used other Mantra hotels as well and always been very happy.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_474875400~“Spacious, clean and wonderful location.”~This serviced apartment is centrally located and rooms are large. It is clean, well maintained and ideal for a central Brisbane stay. Cooking facilities, washing machine and dryer all in good order. Parking charge was a bit steep but ti is in the centre of the city.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_474841799~“Clean and cosy”~The only negative I had was with reception got in after 12 am with a child asleep in the car. Couldn't get access to the safe manager had to come out and retrieve key (she was lovely) however the reception in the morning was rude/abrupt when I asked for a half hour late check out (10:30am). They couldn't accommodate half he even though I was stuck outside for 15 mins trying to get into my apartment.....the irony....~4~5~5~5~5~5~2~nan
review_474803592~“Quick getaway”~Would recommend to anyone as centrally located and very comfortable with access to all sorts of entertainment. On site parking took the worry out of inner city driving. Breakfast was at Charlotte Street Mantra and that too was excellent as was the service there. The walk from Mary Street peaked our appetite.~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_474797835~“My stay”~Found this hotel to be very good and would recommend it to anyone room are clean and very comfortable  Found staff to be very helpful  Convenient to all facilities in the city  Pleasant surrounds and very clean~5~4~4~4~5~4~4~nan
review_474453796~“Great value”~Well situated in the city, Very comfortable and walking distance to Eagle Street Pier, Casino, restaurants, Myer Centre. Bed was really comfortable, and it was lovely and quiet to sleep, Great for a weekend away.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474437922~“Great central location.”~Mantra on Mary is in a great central location close to many food outlets and also to Queen Street Mall. The unit was ordinary but very clean and comfortable. We were made to feel very welcome by the receptionist and who was also very helpful.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474031382~“Mantra on Mary”~A great place to stay in Brisbane, close to public transport, restaurants and shopping. But for an older couple trying to step over the high side of a bath into the shower was tough. Our hips do not move like they used to. We will need to reconsider staying again just due to this. I would not be able to do this solo.~4~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_474015235~“Training Trip”~All a plus except for noisy building operations in the CBD running most of the night... The price of expansion I guess... Very close to the mall and a great early morning walk along the esplanade and through the beautiful QUT gardens..~5~4~4~3~5~4~4~nan
review_473981219~“Buyer be aware.. bad service..”~Arranged through booking.com this website advised free wifi, parking. Not the case. When questioned staff and showed them a screen shot on my phone. Was pretty much called a liar and told 3rd party webpages do not offer these services. Felt seriously embarrassed. We were on a holiday and just paid the extra $30 for parking because we didnt want the hassle. Didnt bother with wifi which was min $15.. Could easily have booked another hotel which included these things for same price. We did not get what was advertised on the website.~3~1~4~3~3~4~1~nan
review_473979303~“Amazing!”~It was a last minute decision but I'm so glad I chose here! The room was amazing, the staff were incredibly helpful and was an overall amazing stay. The hotel is so close to everything and was perfect for my friends and I to stay in.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473977447~“Great accommodation right in the city.”~Highly recommend Mantra on Mary. Room facilities exceeded our expectations and staff were friendly and helpful. Right in the city with easy walking distance to a multitude of eating venues, Queen Street mall and South Bank.~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473965198~“Great quality for inner city stay”~Really enjoyed our stay in the executive suite. Very clean and the rooms were spacious enough for the two of us.  Only walking distance to Eagle Street Pier and other restaurants. Good quality for price!~4~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_473964962~“Great location”~Overall well maintained room central location staff helpful on arrival. Room was clean and Accommodation is central and within walking distance to mall. Staff were helpful in pointing out nearest car parking.~4~5~5~4~3~3~4~nan
review_473947268~“Mantra on Mary”~30 dollars for parking on top of room fee is really disappointing and then payed wifi you get free parking and wifi and any cheap motel around the country but not here a nice hotel in our states capital.~3~1~5~5~3~4~5~nan
review_473946939~“Just needs a little more attention to detail”~Fantastic location... however for some reason the hotel parking was full so we had to park a couple streets away and carry our luggage. When we checked in and went up to our room we found that it hadn't been cleaned. So we went downstairs again with our luggage to sort it out. The front desk man was very lovely and apologetic and gave us breakfast vouchers to compensate for the inconvenience. It was a great room, very clean, very happy with our stay and would definitely stay again. Very good price for the area!~4~5~5~4~4~3~3~nan
review_473945977~“Great Apartment!”~We stayed in the three bedroom apartment which was beautiful, had great city views and was so close to everything! Would definitely stay here again. My only faults were that the room was not serviced and the parking was at an extra cost.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473913273~“Functional and comfortable”~A kitchen and laundry gives the Mantra a practical edge over a hotel room. The beds are comfortable, and the apartment functional. The location is handy, close to restaurants and shops. A heated lap pool is a big plus for me. I would stay here again.~4~3~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_473788504~“Mantra on Mary”~Overall I was extremely pleased with the apartment. My only issue was that I found it rather awkward to get into the shower which was located over the bath & with a screened area. It was awkward as I have some movement restriction & needed to be very careful stepping over the side of the bath to get in & out of the shower.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473743812~“Mantra Review”~A great apartment for managing your short stay. Everything we needed was there including laundry equipment. Staff helpful, and daily paper provided. We liked being able to do for ourselves, and not have to go out to eat. ~5~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473725450~“Will stay again :)”~My wife rang and booked directly. We arrived an hour before check inn and were able to go to our room straight away, the staff were very friendly. The location was spot on, everything within walking distance. The room was very tidy and clean. We will certainly best staying again, thank you.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473722301~“Room large enough to chill out in.”~My wife and I stayed for business in the city. Hotel was walking distance to trains stations, queen street mall, restaurants, Southbank, museum and QPAC, Suncorp stadium and anything else we wanted to do.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473687436~“comfortable home away from home”~I use this to overnight close to work occasionally and find it perfectly relaxing and close to a good range of eating options My wife joins me so we make a stay of it walk the park in the morning and have a great range of eating options. It's my sanity break during the week to help limit travel time.~5~5~5~5~5~4~4~nan
review_473687370~“Great stay with some minor annoyances...”~Staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was really nice and clean with great views. Was a little more expensive than I've paid at other hotels for similar room & view but admittedly I booked last minute. The room had a little study which was interesting to have but also quite pointless for my stay. The power points in the room were difficult to find and access due to furniture being in the way so it became a real task to be able to plug things in. There was also no phone in my room. I had free wifi during my stay but the login page would never load on my phone or laptop so couldn't use it anyway. I also had a late checkout but my card stopped working at normal checkout time so had to get it renewed. Would still recommend the hotel though!~4~4~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473251510~“Brisbane holiday”~Stayed with husband and baby! Was an excellent location only downside was the carpets were pretty dirty looking! Walking distance from queen street mall and lots of restaurants just outside the foyer. Would stay again!~4~4~5~5~4~3~4~nan
review_473129189~“Thank you”~We had to cancel our rooms as we did not know if we would be able to make it due to the weather. We were able to. Originally we made our booking through booking.com for a really good deal, we did not know if we would get the same deal, we did which we were very greatful for. Thankyou.~4~5~5~3~4~4~4~nan
review_473050688~“3 star outdated terrible facilities”~Bath tap doesn't work and doesn't have access for any child under 10 so you will need to lift child in bath it's ridiculous work jug in fridge was broken leaked all over carpet from fridge and there's no Austar or Foxtel~1~1~3~3~1~3~3~nan
review_473035968~“My Fair Lady trip”~Staff were very friendly, particularly Nichole, who was very helpful. The location puts it close to everything! Just a 20 minute walk to Southbank, QPAC and water park. While the mall was just around the corner - so ease of access to great shopping and eating!~4~3~4~3~3~3~4~nan
review_472784533~“A great place to stay”~Very convenient location and rooms are a good size.Air con doesn't work well in the bedroom so can get quite hot while it is cold in the living space. Would recommend that you check that you have a balcony.~4~4~5~5~4~4~4~nan
review_472764621~“Good Location. Service was lacking.”~I was there for 18 days. Was told rim would be serviced about 4 days in and then once weekly. Asked on day 8&9 and finally got service on day 10. No more service while I was there. Needs deeper clean.~4~4~4~4~4~3~3~nan
review_472554540~“Would not stay again”~When we arrived and got up to our room it had not been made up. There were dirty towels on the floor, the bed wasn't made and dirty dishes in the sink. We phoned down to reception who quickly fixed the situation and put us in a new room. The girls we spoke to were lovely. However the main issue was that the breakfast was not in the hotel. When I book accommodation I also book breakfast to be included and I pay extra for this convenience as I did on this occasion. However it wasn't until we checked in that we were told that the breakfast wasn't in the hotel but around the block in another restaurant (of which you walk past 3 breakfast places on the way). What is the point of booking breakfast with your room if you have to leave the hotel anyway to get it.  Also, when we went to check out at 10.10am I asked the gentleman at reception if I could use the bathroom. His response was "it is past ten, your time is up". If this wasn't rude enough the only reason we were late (we had been out of the room since 9am) was because we had had to go around the block for breakfast and it took a long time to get served. If breakfast had been in the hotel I could of popped out while we were waiting for the meal to come to check out. Not a great experience and very inconvenient.~2~3~5~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_472543095~“Room review”~Great view, rooms were clean, staff were friendly and helpful prior to and during the stay. The furniture was wobbly/worn and the A/C was played up a couple times but overall great stay. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.~5~5~5~3~4~5~5~nan
review_472518979~“Great location”~Good clean apartment on the 22nd floor with great facilities. We had everything we needed.The staff were friendly and it was in a great location close to shops, theatres and restaurants. We would definately stay there again~5~5~5~4~5~5~4~nan
review_472280012~“Poop/stool outside toilet - not happy with my stay - No response on e-mail from the reception afterwards”~I stayed at the hotel some days ago. The floor on the rom was for some reason completely wet and it didn't really dry up before we left. The main problem was the stool/poop outside, but on the toilet. This was really disgusting and kind of ruined our stay.  They also charged me 100 dollars extra than what I was told on bookings.com. Also the reception was not very service minded. They told me I didn't have funds on my credit card (which was not the case) when there was some problems due to my credit card being International. On the other hand, the location is good.~1~1~3~2~1~1~2~nan
review_472269896~“No sleep due to very hard bed”~Very good except the bed was so hard my husband and I were unable to sleep. No extra bedding/blankets so couldn't even sleep on the couch. The very deep bath/shower would have been a problem for anyone short or elderly.~3~4~4~1~4~4~4~nan
review_471510768~“Lovely Room”~Check in was easy. Our 3 bedroom was big and spacious. The bed was comfy along with the pillows. The couch was also comfy to lie on and chill out as we had to wait for the tail end of the cyclone to pass. The room was clean and staff were lovely~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471347346~“Somewhere to stay”~Needed a place to stay as had a SES fundraising ball to attend it was great from start to finish. The staff were great and helpful offer a late checkout and assistant when needed. I am going to stay here again as I have a function at least once a year in the city~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471329380~“Exactly what I expected”~Cleaning and maintenance could be improved but the friendly reception staff responded promptly and made up for it. Location and everything else was perfect and what I expected. Will certainly stay again.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_471271285~“Weekend away”~Very clean & tidy. Very central to everything in the city and had great breakfast before we left the next morning which was included with our room. Close to the Casino, Southbank and Botanical Gardens.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_471223376~“Mantra on Mary”~Attention to detail was not obvious. there was a curtain the was off the track and difficult to close and the leg of the coffee table was broken and would move every time you put something on the table. The should have been addressed through regular maintenance. I also felt it quite ridiculous to send guests to the other Mantra to have breakfast.~4~4~5~5~4~5~4~nan
review_470986040~“Business”~Clean, tidy, had way more facilities than I needed (laundry for a one night stay?) but this would be a bonus for longer stays. Just a couple of blocks to the river and botanical gardens for running. Just a little cool in the room, found out the next day this can be turned off but I couldn't find it that night. TV not allowed to come on until 7:40am. But a lovely, clean space to stay.~5~4~5~4~5~5~5~nan
