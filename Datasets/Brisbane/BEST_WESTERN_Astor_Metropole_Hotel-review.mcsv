review_473048431~“Nice rooms at a good price”~Lucky enough to get an upper floor room. Nice rooms, even have a washing machine. Decent view of the CBD, central location within walking distance of the park and the river and the metro. Lots of dining nearby. Parking was an issue.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_470771061~“disappointing”~This is not what I expect from a Best Western. Foyer and dinning area are not air-conditioned. After check in and arriving at the room we found the fridge leaked and the bathroom/toilet door did not close. The fridge was fixed, not the bathroom door. I traveled with a friend, well we just turned the TV louder when we used the bathroom. We arrived on Friday, on Sunday morning, the sower was cold, no warm water. Breakfast was interesting, I believe this hotel caters for Chinese people, don't expect the normal breakfast, I don't even know what some of the food was, there was no labels, they did asked if you wanted bacon and what I got was some lukewarm salty bacon, I think it was microwaved. I didn't bother the next day and coffee was extra cost unless you were happy to mix your powdered coffee with lukewarm water. It was very disappointing. The floors weren't mopped as the repair man's footprint from the first day were still there when we checked out. No way I would stay there again.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~2~nan
review_470190193~“Big and dated apartment rooms”~This Best Western has a hotel component and an apartment component to it. I stayed in an apartment room. The room was big with a balcony, however it was a bit dated (as stated in some of the tripadvisor reviews I read before making a booking). When I made the booking, the hotel rooms were the same price as the apartment rooms, so I chose the apartment rooms, as it was more reasonably priced. The hotel had no free wifi. The room had a kitchenette fully equipped with cooking and kitchenware – great for people that want to prepare meals. It also had a washing machine in the bathroom, which I made good use of. The toiletries were in dispensers, and the toilet seat seriously needs replacing. At first I thought the toilet seat was extremely dirty, however with a closer look, the plastic was peeling off. This alone made me deduct one star off the overall rating. Apart from this, the cleaners replaced some towels and not all on some days; then on another day, they did not take the dirty towels away, which reception had to arrange for this to happen. Also, on the first day, I found hair on the bed runner. Despite this, there is a 24-hour reception, which was good, as I needed to check out really early in the morning. The location is good and the place was quiet. It is located in Spring Hill, just next to Brisbane CBD. As it name suggests, it is up on a hill. I didn’t know this at first, so I had to push my luggage up the hill on the first night after getting off the bus at King George Square. You can also go there from Central Station (where you can catch the AirTrain to and from the Brisbane Airport). However, you will still need to walk up that steep hill. On the last day I stayed here, I worked out that there was a free Spring Hill loop bus (Bus route 30) that you can catch on Queens Street, then get off at corner Upper Edward Street and Wickham Terrace. It is two minute walk to the hotel/apartment.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_469007865~“Clean and good location”~I would highly recommend this property. Room was clean and spacious with balcony overlooking Wickham Terrace. Excellent amenities provided for ,in our case a one night stay but would be ideal for a longer stay,with kitchen facilities provided and well laid out. Ensuite was excellent.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_456777776~“Overnight stay”~Check in was slow and the car park a little difficult to find but Reception proved a Map. Car Park inconvenient and we had to wait for at least 10 minutes to get assistance to get in. It is difficult to Park as they are tight spaces and are double level lift stacking. Our Airconditioner was not very effective and very noisy so not possible to leave on despite the heat. We opened the door which made it noisy due to Building Airconditioners.~3~2~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_453896796~“Luggage stolen, staff not concerned”~I arrived around 8.30pm and because of their car parking arrangements the attendant had to direct me. I had several items of luggage which he suggested I unload first and leave on the trolley. I was hesitant about this as the luggage was actually out of sight. After taking about 5 minutes to park the car the attendant took my luggage up to the room, I immediately went downstairs to have a meal. On my return I when looking for my laptop, I realised 2 of my smaller bags were missing. I made enquiries at the desk to see if they had been found elsewhere. A sceptical receptionist suggested we look at CCTV footage of my arrival in the car park. We clearly saw a fellow walk past their car park entrance looking around and then grabbed my two small bags that were on top of my other luggage. I called the Police who visited the hotel and they took all the details, including what was stolen. The hotel receptionist told the Police this had never happened before at their establishment. It was around 11pm when the Police left, apart from my lap top, all my cosmetics, personal toiletries, leather belts and several items of clothing I didn't even have a toothbrush. The next day I requested could I stay a further night at a discount rate, all things being considered, I had to visit the police with serial numbers etc. The receptionists reply was that I was already in the budget accommodation!!! I requested to speak with the manager and was told she only came in twice a week and they could not phone her when she was not in attendance. This happened over 5 months ago. Despite many phone calls to the Hotel asking to speak with the Manager I am always told they are not there that day. My calls have never been returned. I have written to the Manager weeks after the event to no avail. I have contacted Best Western on three occasions and have been told they have no control over such matters. They did however send the Manager an email asking her to contact me. I have heard nothing, that was last year. I have a police incident number and to date nothing has been recovered. I asked the Police where do I stand legally and they said because it did happen on their property, also their is clear evidence the event took place the establishment have a duty of care. To enforce this will cost me legal fees. I am already out of pocket several hundred dollars, apart from precious photos and information I had stored on my laptop. The money and possessions are one thing but the principle is what I find astounding. Fact being The Astor appears to have no principles. I was visiting Brisbane due to a family tragedy at the time, this experience caused more distress.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_442096944~“Brilliant hotel for a weekend in Brisbane ”~Stayed here for two nights in December whilst visiting Brisbane as part of a whistle stop tour of Australia. It was really excellent value as I only booked a few days in advance. The location is great. You are just a short walk from the CBD but far enough away to avoid any noise. We had a Queen Suite which had a very large double bed. The ensuite was nice enough and there was also a tiny kitchenette area. We were on the ninth floor and had a balcony which was a nice place to sit and enjoy the sunset. The staff were absolutely lovely and more than happy to assist us by printing off tickets and storing our luggage post check out before we headed back to the airport. If I'm ever back in Brisbane I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_442015643~“AC broke down during the night”~AC broke down during the night. Phoned reception to ask for a pedestal fan or anything they could do. I was told they didn't have any fans but the AC would be looked at in the morning. We would be checking out then anyway. It was a hot and sweaty night with no sleep. To make matters worse, the next morning we didn't even receive an apology. I was asked to fill in a form for a manager to look over the case. Have been calling every day since then to ask for a resolution, really expecting them to refund at least one night of the stay. Each time I call, I am told my details are being taken down and someone will call me straight back... still waiting. TV remote also did not work.  AC in the hallway was out of action as well, otherwise we'd have taken a blanket and pillow out there.~1~nan~nan~nan~2~5~1~nan
review_440042902~“overnight stay”~great location. Room very large and clean. could not have asked for better and staff a lot friendlier than more expensive hotels. The fellow at reception was exceptional with his assistance. A great stay~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_440022566~“Good Value for a good hotel”~First things first and the location is definitely the main feature of this hotel. The room is spacious and has everything you need. However the Air conditioner just seemed to blow air and not cool the room at all which made for a hot nights stay. The pillows are clearly dual use as i assume they can be also be used for sandbags in case of flash flooding. Which was almost the case as the shower head seemed possessed and changed its pattern and/or flow at will.  We also parked our car there for the night for a measly $9, and the carpark is a batman style elevator which puts your car in a vertical column and is stored underground and will pops back up when you need it (via the nice hotel staff, not batman). My wife's hatchback only just fit in their though (height wise) so if you have a car much higher then the bat-mobile you may have issues. All in all though i paid under just $100 for the night and made it out alive. So would recommend it for someone looking for a cheap hotel in a handy location.~3~5~nan~nan~nan~3~4~nan

review_438583487~“Mwah”~A few minutes away from the hart of Brisbane and a 15 minutes walk to the Southbank with lots of restaurants. A taxi will take you in 20/30 minutes from the airport and will cost around 50AUD. The hotel is not special, and avarage 3 star hotel. Low water pressure and whem you take a shower the whole bathroom floor becomes wet and slippery. In 2016 it should not be so difficult to figure out a solution. Overall okay stay for our first night in Australia after flying in from Europe.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_431465173~“Didn't hate it, didn't love it”~very spacious room and bathroom. Shower looked like it had been updated, but rest of the room was quite outdated, it could do with some new paint, maybe carpet instead of cold tiles. The bed was 2 single beds pushed together with a double bed fitted sheet over it to form a double bed, so was a little uncomfortable if you rolled toward the middle. Did have to go down to reception to let them know we were not provided with any towels, face washers etc. and there were foreign hairs all over the room which I found a little disgusting. Could work on cleanliness. And the whole corridor smelt strongly of vomit for abiut 24 hours (we had to hold our breath running from the elevator to the door) Over all though, was a good stay, good location, decently priced, good view, polite staff, spacious room, large balcony, kitchenette. Dependant on what you are looking for, I would recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere not too expensive but still somewhat decent.~3~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan

review_426318060~“No Integrity to deal with a serious health issues”~Got itchy on second night of my stay on my left leg; did not think much of it until the third night when it got worse all over my body!! Showed three lice I found under the bed sheets to staff to investigate the matter at 2am; think they tried to hide the evidence on hindsight as BOTH Alistair and another guy at the front desk were very blasé about the situation. Took more than a week and 3 further failed phone call attempts to Astor Metropole BEFORE the manager Ritana Sultani bothered to contact me ONLY via email with NO indication as what steps if any they are taking to resolve the situation!! Missed three days of work (I work as a contractor so get no sick pay). Ritana promised of compensation in her first email and then reneged it in her second email a few days later. The staff and Ritana just bury their head in the sand; blame the lice were on my clothes; obviously their conclusions were impartially made themselves and their cleaners being the judge; jury and the executioner. The management have no integrity and just like to hide behind a serious health issue. Worst "Hotel" experience ever.~1~nan~3~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_415915476~“Rooms need renovation”~Stayed for one night. My room was old in need of renovation. Shower glass door was broken and splashing water all over bathroom.

I can't recommend this hotel.~2~1~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_415196193~“Great Central City Accommodation”~Stayed here for 3 nights and I consider it very good value for the price. Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was comfortable .We were on the 10th floor and it was very quiet with a good view over the city and plenty of natural light. Reception staff were helpful and courteous We required vehicle parking for one night and the arrangement is slightly unconventional but nevertheless good value considering the central city location. Continental breakfast is good value and the restaurant was well patronised. Superb location - just a short walk to town, and if you don't want to tackle the stairs there is a lift further along Wickham Terrace which delivers you to Central Station. A couple of minor housekeeping matters - had to ask each day for towels, either left none or one each and no bathmat etc. Also our room on the 10th floor had only a partial screen on the shower- so we always ended up with water all over the bathroom floor. Would stay here again~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_414966976~“Bad room service!”~The position of the hotel is very good as it is only five minutes from Downtown and Queen street. Unfortunately we had some problem with the room service. The second day of stay the room service was not done: in the evening, when we came back at the room we found the bed not made, and towels not replaced. For all our stay ( 3 nights) there was no cleaning activity in the bathroom and on the room ground.~2~4~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan
review_412686588~“Meh”~Stayed here for one night on the 5th floor and from reading other recent reviews it sounds like we had one of the better renovated rooms.  The lobby looks great but definitely agree they should of spent more money in the rooms than on the lobby as that's where you spend most of your time! The bed is pretty old and squeaky and the whole room felt cold with tiles on the floors. The room is quite spacious with a sofa which looks like it's older than my grandma (who is 80+) and the kitchenette and furniture is also dated and can only rally make a microwave meal. Looks like it had a new bathroom with a shower so that was fine. If you are going to park your car it's $9 which is fine for one night but can definitely add up if staying longer. You have to park your car in stack parking which I have never seen before, you phone for a parking attend who helps direct you to squeeze into a tight spot for someone driving a hire car much bigger than my normal car it was pretty terrifying and not sure what I would have done if there had been been a car in the spot next to me! Pretty inconvenient to get the parking attendant every time you want to drive somewhere.  We went to pop our head round and see what the pool looked like and that floor looked like a completely different world to the rooms we were staying in! Or completely different hotel! Half the rooms locks and key card things to the door looked like they were broken the laundry room was next to hotel rooms so I imagine would have been noisy if you were staying there. Looks like they are only half way through their renovation and it might just be luck which room you get!  However if they didn't manage to do it all up its in a brilliant location right next to central station and so close to the CBD hopefully the hotel management can sort out all the issues everyone had raised on here and eventually it might be a great hotel. But at the moment I wouldn't stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_410926209~“Convenient to the CBD”~I stayed here for a long weekend to attend an AFL game at the Gabba. Check in was welcoming and very friendly! The room was cleanish - fridge needed defrosting and room smelt of curry but as soon as I opened the door the room aired out. I had a 10th floor room, nice and quiet. The bed was comfortable, amenities were all working and handy.  I only needed to walk a couple of blocks to get to the cbd - so the location was excellent for shopping and dining.  I ordered room service from the restaurant - great food reasonably priced.  I enjoyed my stay and would stay again - if for location alone!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_410482101~“Small room, partially refurbished but good service and good breakfast”~Small room on 11th Floor with views over the city. Bed was harder than expected; recently renovated bathroom was small and the fittings were cheap reflecting the balance of the renovations. Good proximity to park and city.

review_409048241~“Price was great. Room quality left a bit to be desired”~We were attracted by the price ($120 per night) and its 4 star rating. In reality the rooms are really 2.5 to 3 star. Vinyl floor coverings, older furniture (uncomfortable couch) Queens size bed was reasonably comfortable but old and squeaky; the bathroom was tired with moldy grout in the tiles. It would not be suited to persons with mobility issues because the shower was over the bath and the step up was high without grab rails to help.~3~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_406982879~“Filthy!”~The front of the hotel looks great but once you get in the lift and then in your room it is a very different story. The couch I wouldn't even sit on, the curtains were filthy and stained, brown thread bare blanket on the oldest stained bed I have slept on in a very long time. Needs a bloody good clean. I will never stay there again!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
