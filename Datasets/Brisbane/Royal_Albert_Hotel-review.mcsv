review_478098202~“Perfect Location!”~2 nights stay here was great. Hotel is in the heart of city, easy to access everywhere. Only one front desk staff is on duty everyday, but it's 7/24 and super helpful&friendly! Got everything we need during our stay, will come back for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_476950474~“Business Trip”~Check in staff were very friendly, efficient and went the extra mile to print off my return airline boarding pass. Rooms were spacious and well maintained exceeding my expectations for my short stay. Bed was comfortable and furnishings of a high standard. Centrally located within short walk of city centre.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475120940~“A wonderful unexpected surprise discovered in the heart of Brisbane's CBD.”~My wife and I visit Brisbane frequently, often to attend theatre events. For years we have stayed at a particular hotel, but by chance noticed The Royal Albert Hotel while we were having lunch upstairs in a restaurant overlooking the Queen St. Mall. We were first attracted by the beautiful old architecture. The hotel is just off the Queen St. Mall, so after lunch my wife and I went to investigate. The hotel is situated in the heart of the most interesting 'cafe' area in the CBD and first impression of the location was very favourable. The beautifully modernised 'art deco' lobby was the next surprise and then the reception by the staff confirmed that this hotel could definitely be for us. One of the very friendly staff took us on a tour of inspection. One of the guest rooms was vacant at the time and we were able to inspect it. The room was enormous and beautifully appointed.  On the strength of our finding this gem in the heart of the CBD and at a very moderate room rate, we cancelled our next two nights at the hotel we were already booked at and booked into the Royal Albert, which is now our hotel of choice in Brisbane.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_474850128~“Perfect Place to stay while exploring Brisbane”~Located right in the centre of Brisbane with lots of restaurants nearby and easy access to activities including South Bank. Parking is available on site (with the three car high stacker - $22 per night). Our apartment on the third floor was huge with cooking facilities consisting of two hotplates, microwave and bar fridge. The decor was very fresh and in keeping with the style of the hotel. The staff were very helpful. The rooms were very quiet with no intruding noises. You can get free WiFi if you sign up to the hotel before booking or if you book through the hotel (It cost us $40 for 3GB for a week for one device at a time).~4~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472757475~“Great Location”~We have stayed at the Royal Albert previously and really enjoyed the whole experience .This time was no exception,the location is second to none being right in middle of many shops and places to eat and just an easy stroll to Southbank. Definitely our place of choice when staying in Brisbane~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472380798~“Great location. Large rooms and good for a family. Reasonable rates. WiFi let's it down”~This hotel is one block from the Queen street pedestrian Mall and right in the heart of Brisbane. It is also a very easy walk to Southbank. Great location.  The hotel is a little dated but in reasonable condition. We had a "sub apartment", which was huge. It would be perfect for a family (it accommodated 5 people comfortably). We found the room rates much more reasonable than the nearby branded competitors. Particularly when considering a family of 5 would require two rooms in a normal hotel and we were able to fit in one room at the Royal Albert. We had 1GB of WiFi included in our room rate but the WiFi did not work properly. The hotel charges $20 AUD per GB thereafter. There is no swimming pool. There is parking but it could be tight if the vehicle is large (we parked a full size commodore, which just fit).  The staff were excellent and very friendly.  This hotel is perfect if you want to wander around Brisbane and see the city.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472225583~“Royal Albert Hotel - Central to everything”~We always stay at the Royal Albert Hotel in Brisbane. It is central to the Brisbane CBD, well priced and the rooms are clean and spacious. It is much easier to get a one or two bedroom room which suits our family than any other hotel in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472015156~“False advertising!! ”~The advertisement says recently renovated apartments in the heart of Brisbane .... if recently renovated means stained carpet (filthy) and chipped tiles then I would hate to have seen the room pre-renovation!!! The receptionist was more interested in answering the phone to assisting paying customers check in. What a joke ... if you book directly with them you get free WiFi if you book through Wotif it's a $20 charge .... really?! In this day and age?!!! If you don't want people booking on websites then take the motel off them!! $7 for a bottle of water - is it liquid gold?! Good location is the only positive this motel has going for it .... although it's bloody noisy from street noise!!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471961081~“Hardly a think to fault ”~There is not a better city location than this. It is right in the middle of all the activity. The staff were very friendly and accomodating. We had a one bedroom suite that had all the amenities including a washer and dryer. I am not sure what the reviewer on March 31st was talking about as we parked 2 cars with the hotel. One was parked onsite and one was parked across the street at queen street mall. I have a pretty good "sniffer" and did not notice anything the smelled bad.  The only thing I could slightly fault are the thin walls. They are not so thin that you can hear movement or voices, but you can hear the shower running. This is an older hotel and it is very quaint and charming. If you are a light sleeper, you might want to bring some earplugs.  We will definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471734290~“Best customer service in fantastic hotel”~I stay at the Royal Albert regularly for business. It is perfectly located in the heart of the city. The apartments are beautifully decorated and very very comfortable. The best part of the stay however is the great customer service. The staff are so helpful and friendly. Cannot recommend this place more highly. So much better than some of the impersonal larger properties in every way.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471573498~“Awful hotel”~Odd smell, outdated, non existent parking, not clean not a four and a half star hotel by any measure and a completely unpleasant experience! We checked out within an hour an forfeited our night's accommodation charge to go and stay in a decent hotel!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469528212~“Great service”~This hotel provides large fully self contaIned rooms. It is right in the middle of the city and very handy to all attractions. Rooms and clean and well maintained. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I would recommend to anyone who wants to be in the middle of the city and wants a hotel with a family feel.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_469464559~“Nice hotel with good in-room facilities; shame about the WiFi”~Very good central location, close to the botanic gardens and riverfront. Room was spacious and clean, with good facilities (cooking and especially laundry; desk etc).  A few minor quibbles, but the main fault was the extremely slow and very expensive WiFi - $20/day with only one device at a time. Numerous typos in the log-in and information screens suggest an ameteurish operation, confirmed by the dodgy usage monitoring (it's impossible that I used >300Mb in the space of five minutes reading a few e-mails and checking a news site). No excuse for this in a modern city in 2017.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_469031424~“Not clean!!!”~We stayed there in the 2 bedroom suite. When we arrived we were told we needed to park in a parking garage 10 minutes away. If you have a large vehicle be prepared they cannot accommodate.  Arriving in our room we were greeted with something orange on the tile in the entry. The carpets had spent many stains that none of us took our shoes off. This is no exaggeration when I say stains everywhere.  The bedspreads had stains on them one looked like blood. I went done and told the girl at the front desk. She came up and saw them and said that the dry cleaners must have missed them. Then she took both spreads and asked if we wanted another one. Umm no I will pass. One bathroom still had trash in the bag and something spilled on the counter. Luckily ours was very clean but I was so grossed out by this place. It is extremely noisy but that is not the hotels fault as it is in a very busy area.  Also you are greater by a note from the manager that using sites like this to book causes everyone else to pay more because they have to pay 15 percent. I do not recommend this hotel!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466170848~“Perfect location”~We really liked the Royal Albert apartments. Very little to fault other than the very slow internet. Decor a bit old fashioned, but overall wonderful. Would thoroughly recommend it. Dont pay for the internet either book directly with the hotel and get a slow service, or visit a Telstrs shop , we got a very good deal.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~5~nan
review_465994428~“Great place ”~I love this hotel. Its right in the heart of Brisbane City. The pent house is lovely, so much space and great value for money. I loved the food in the restaurant ( had the best lasagne). I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. I will definitely come back when I have the chance. The only thing is to plan your travel dates on dates when there are good rates because during peak times the rates change and are much higher.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465969428~“Top spot”~All round great place to stay. Highly recommend it! Room service breakfast was delicious. Very friendly staff. Right in the heart of Brisbane CBD Would definitely stay there again next time im in town.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460773357~“A Gem of a Place”~After reading other reviews of this hotel, I decided to spend three nights there-and was not disappointed! We had arrived on an early morning flight and thought we'd try our luck with a (very) early check in...no problems they said, which was much appreciated. In fact, all our interactions with reception staff throughout our stay were outstanding, nothing was ever too much trouble. Friendly faces at a front desk really do make a difference. The rooms are absolutely massive and very clean. The kitchenette is also a great size and has all the necessities needed if you wanted to prepare your own meals. However, with the location being right on the mall, there are limitless options literally minutes away. My partner and I really loved our stay here and would definitely stay again. Also a good tip is to book directly through the hotel as we found they had a much much better rate...and free internet!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457716008~“Awsome”~Perfect for a single or family, great staff, very comfortable and very clean. So handy to shopping and food. Would highly recommend to any one traveling for business or pleasure. I will most definatly be rebooking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_457013303~“Character and Location”~The Royal Albert Hotel was perfectly located for inner Brisbane business, shopping and transit. The rooms are clean, very spacious and nicely decorated.

review_456807385~“Great service”~Hadn't stayed here for awhile and heard they had done some renovating. The bathrooms look new but overall some rooms are still bit tired.

review_452029218~“Large, comfortable, reliable”~This is a regular place for us to stay because the room sizes are comparatively large to cater for our two small children, the service is exceptional and the overall experience matches the price. It is also useful to be in the centre of town (and if parking is required the rates are acceptable).~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_448639188~“R.A Xmas stay 2016”~My wife and I enjoy this hotel very much.[ our second stay ] the rooms are spacious and well appointed, beds are good. The location is excellent - perfect for inner city activities, shopping, dining, casino, Southbank markets, botanical gardens - all at any easy stroll to and from the hotel.  It's surrounded by street cafes and bars, for early breakfast to late suppers.  My only negative is the entrance hall from the street, this could be cleaned up with a bit fresh paint, mainly around the restaurant area. .... which is why I only gave a 9 out of 10 score.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448384234~“Not quite perfect.”~We arrived for a two nught stay on a baking hot New years eve. Check in was smooth and straightforward. Our one bed apartment (512A)  was located on the fifth floor and on opening the front door we were met with a blast of hot air. On a scorching hot day it would have been reasonable and appreciated had the air conditioning been turned on in advance of our arrival. The apartment itself was fabulous.  Very spacious, beautifully decorated, high ceilings, ornate coving and ceiling roses, period furniture and pictures, fully equipped kitchen plus laundry and a superb bathroom. To cap it all a most comfortable bed. The biggest drawback was that the ducted air conditioning clearly couldn't cope with the heat although of course, it should!. Even after several hours the apartment was still 'warm' and this was very disappointing. In Brisbane, in summer it's essential that hotels have effective a/c. A call was put into reception and it transpired that the a/c would simply not work under the preset 20deg which is ridiculous. 2deg cooler would have made a big difference.! A fan was offered, accepted and quickly delivered. Apart from the a/c everything else was great. A quiet, comfortable and very homely apartment within a few minutes walk of Queen St Mall. We'd definitely return but only in cooler climes.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448374973~“Always a delight”~This Hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of the city, opposite the Myer Center and a short stroll to either Riverside or the Casino/South Bank. The rooms are very large and well appointed including a mini kitchenette and laundry which is so appreciated. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I always stay in this hotel when I need to stay in Brisbane. I can't recommend it highly enough.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448165607~“Christmas”~I have now stayed a number of times at the Royal Albert. The thing that most strikes me is how help, considerate, and accommodating the staff are. Having to arrive early for meetings there has never been any difficulty in being permitted to leave my car before check in times. On one visit I had trouble with wifi connection and a member of staff came to my room and fixed the problem for me as soon as I indicated I hade a problem~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

QPAC is only 10 minutes away on foot. The hotel is beautifully decorated and I loved my huge room.

review_443415873~“Central location, spacious rooms & great service”~My wife and I had a few days in Brisbane to combine a business visit with a few days off. We had chosen this hotel from a location perspective being able to walk to all central spots i.e. the mall, the riverside terminal, restaurants etc. On top we experienced to stay in rooms that were spacious with all amenities, and above all clean. We had some extraordinary needs in terms of changing reservations that the reception team handled very well, communicating directly with our booking portal to get it all fixed. We had a great experience in Brisbane, and not least due to our stay at this wonderful boutique hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_440782655~“Boutique, central and very homely - great accom in the heart of the Brisbane CBD”~If you are looking for somewhere central and private - which is quiet, spacious and homely them you can't beat the Royal Albert Hotel. The sub penthouse apartments are very well appointed and stylishly designed with plenty of room. The staff are courteous and helpful, and all guests are made to feel valued and welcome. We don't stay anywhere else in Brisbane since discovering this jewel in Brisbane's crown!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_440753775~“Full of history! ”~I absolutely love staying at the Royal Albert! I can't get enough of its rich history and beautiful interior. The location is incredible and the renovated bathrooms are amazing. The only thing that could make this place better is renovations within the rooms to match the bathrooms, including new furniture and carpet upholstery. The fold out beds are also a little uncomfortable. Will continue to stay here time and time again!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_440481839~“So much space & No city noise”~Stayed at the Royal Albert Hotel for ladies weekend so choose the 2 Bed/2 Bath Apartment. This was so big we could have easily fit a family of 4 or six in there. The master bedroom included a walk in wardrobe and ensuite. The 2nd bedroom had 2x single beds with large wardrobe. The longe/dinning with full kitchen and a full laundry which would be excellent for those having an extended stay. The decor is a little older so its not all white and pristine, however if staying as a family or group you will feel at home. Very clean and the room was serviced daily with fresh towel and toiletries in each bathroom. The restaurant/cafe at the front is bustling and served an excellent breakfast, NO Buffet but a good selection of options for all diets.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_437874957~“Best Brisbane Boutique Hotel”~Unbeatable Brisbane CBD location just off the mall. Very large and high ceilinged rooms all with modernised upmarket bathrooms, most with other facilities akin to apartments. Also available 1 and 2 br apartments. Staff very friendly and helpful as not part of a chain. Car parking (limited) available. For this location BD quality standards, you'd be paying up to twice as much elsewhere. Have returned several times. Seriously consider it.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

The beautiful botanical garden is within walk distance. The hotel is very clean and tastefully renovated. The staffs are friendly. The room is spacious with a stove top, but no ventilation. So you can prepare some quick meal handy, but definitely no stir fry that will wake up the smoke alarm. Highly recommend!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan

review_425966203~“Great location & room standard”~Stayed for a couple of nights. Location very convenient to the mall.  Room and amenities were of a high standard. Price much cheaper than the Hilton down the road.  Book directly with the Hotel and they give you $10 cash back per night on check out. The Arcade that you go down to enter the Foyer was quite slippery when wet. There also was an intermittent plumbing issue with the toilet (could not flush), though appeared addressed by the time I booked out.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_424621942~“Highly Recommended”~Overall experience - excellent! Booked the suite and it was worth it. Located right in the centre of the city and within walking distance to all the shops, restaurants, botanical garden, brisbane river, southbank etc makes it very convenient. The staffs are friendly, and my only comment/suggestion - change your towellings as it will definitely improve your standards. We stayed on the 7th floor and it was perfect. You can hardly hear the noise below. We will definitely return. Thanks again and keep up the good work.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan

We have stayed here a number of times. Lack of parking for larger vehicles is an issue but staff are very helpful with organising alternative parking~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_419657505~“Understated luxury”~This hotel doesn't have a bar or restaurant but doesn't need one because of its great position in the heart of the CBD close to the botanical gardens and the river. What it does have are fantastic large well appointed rooms with solid good quality furniture and some beautiful original artwork on the walls. Good self catering facilities too and a lovely "rain effect" shower. If I am in Brisbane, I will always stay here.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_415971899~“Beautiful Rooms bigger than normal”~Amazing foyer. Perfect location right across the road from Myer Centre. We had a 1 bedroom apartment and it was lovely, bigger than most apartments. Bedroom had no window (only louvers to lounge) so perfect for a sleep in. Perfect for families with a fold out couch. The kids loved it and want to stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_414420444~“OK but there are better”~recent short trip to brisbane; stayed at royal albert mainly because i couldn't be bother looking for another place; rooms are large living room small bedrooms; hot because airconditioner does not really get into the bedrooms with the doors shut; noisy do not stay over friday or saturday nights; car parking is a great option but even though I told them the night before when we were leaving in the am; it the staff a long time fiddling with the parking elevators to get my car out. (Why ask me to tell you when I am leaving if you do not bother to bring car to surface for a quick departure?)~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412940709~“Royal Albert Brisbane”~Excellent location in the heart of Brisbane CBD, can easily walk to everything. Hotel has "olde worlde" charm, rooms are massive. As well as very comfortable beds the rooms have lounge and dining areas with couch, armchair, dining table and chairs. Rooms have a small kitchen area with stove top and microwave for self catering if you wish. Generally a nice homely place to stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_404721227~“Great place for group stay”~We want for a conference in a group and decided tot take an apartment type stay. While searching on trip advisor we found good reviews of this hotel and historical importance)build in 1860s) in mind.  This is a kind of very clean and well maintained apartments with good kitchen very supportive staff.  We did cook for self so can't comment on food.  The location is exactly at one end of queen street mall area and there can't be a better place to stay in Brisbane for a group at the price we got.  Thanks Royal Albert staff.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403519438~“Stayed here plenty”~Perfect central location. Rooms are spacious. Great comfortable bed, good pillows, microwave and kitchenette, television, lounge, great rooms. Service is good, parking available. Shower is a little soft. Walk to most of the city easily. Well priced rooms.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_403425663~“Classic glamour”~when we opened the door to our room, our jaws dropped. We weren't expecting such high ceilings and steps down into our suite in a CBD high rise. There was a real sense of grandeur. They have maintained this piece of Brisbane history beautifully. A hotel to be admired. Loved it!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_402235020~“Best for Location and Value for Money”~My family and I made a visit to Brisbane and we weren't sure of which hotel to pick before settling for this one. It was the best decision ever made because the location of the hotel is 10 minutes from various attractions in Brisbane city making it very convenient for us to go around the city just by walking.  The walk from Central station is 10 minutes however it is to be noted that it is downhill from the station but uphill towards therefore it is advised to take alternative routes to the hotel. Myer Center was located right across making it convenient to purchase essentials for the day and finding food nearby. Queen Street Mall is very nearby too and it's part of the must see places in Brisbane.  The hotel itself was good however there was smell of paint which indicated that the hotel was newly refurbished and the unique decor for the hotel added the charm. The room was really comfortable and easily fits in 3 people (with additional surcharge). WiFi in the room is not available for free but that wasn't a big deal for us. Overall Royal Albert Hotel in the best hotel in terms of location and value for money.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_400645595~“Breakfast”~We visited for a quick family breakfast before travelling north. We received very attentive service, we sat outside, it was clean and warm. We had eggs and bacon juice , wifi and hot coffee. Service was quick. We would visit again next time we are in the area.  Thank you  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_397143932~“Just One Thing”~My husband, sister and myself stayed at the Royal Albert Hotel in the centre of Brisbane. It has old world charm so much so that it could feature in an Edwardian movie. However it has all the conveniences of the modern world and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It is right in the middle of the shopping centre but thanks to double glazing as quiet as a mouse. The only thing I found a little odd was the second bedroom had no windows. This was not pointed out when we booked and luckily my sister is not claustrophobic however it could be a problem for some.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~5~nan
review_396043394~“Location and flexibility”~Excellent location for everything we want to do in town: museum, galleries, shops, restaurants, city cats etc. Love staying here with our 2 young boys. Can check-in early if your room is ready. Can leave car there early on check-in day and pick up as late as 1pm on check-out day. Can receive discount if book over the phone directly with them. Royal Albert will continue to be our place to stay in the Brisbane CBD.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_394534992~“Excellent place to stay”~Royal Albert is an excellent place to stay. The rooms are large, clean and well appointed. The staff are always more than happy to help in anyway. And the hotel is a short walk to everything you would ever want. We will be coming back for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_393403945~“Stunning hotel, central position.”~I don't think you could get a more central position than the Royal Albert without spending a fortune. We booked for 2 nights in the one bedroom suite. Puts most hotel 'suites' in their respective boxes - very spacious. First of all the boutique nature of the hotel is fabulous. High ceilings, Edwardian decor, beautiful appointments. Very comfortable bed, - great to have kitchenette not that we used it, but also fabulous to have the ability to wash and dry clothes. A short stroll to the Queen St mall - the Myer Centre diagonally across the road - just the best place to stay. The Cafe Mondial just outside the front door is ideal for meals which can be booked to your room. Not noisy at all, but we were in suite 512A - so at the back of the property away from any traffic noise. Thoroughly recommend, and we will stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_390211200~“Great Hotel”~Clean spacious and comfortable - great location and staff always accomodating and professional - definitely my preferable hotel whilst in Brisbane on business or leisure it close proximity to Myer / Queen Street mall / Cafes Restaurants and Bars is as good as it gets - Great Hotel~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389562324~“Boutique?”~Hi. I booked the Royal Albert since it was listed as one of the best boutique hotels in Brisbane. But my experience there was not great. The rooms feel very very out dated.. but with a lovely bathroom. I felt I was staying at my Grandmother's house. Also, I was shocked to learn you have to pay $20 for wifi extra. That seems like a relic too! I guest at the Royal Albert old = boutique~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_388290268~“Our Choice in Brisbane”~The Royal Albert is an apartment hotel. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and well equipped, including washing machine, dryer, ironing board, microwave, 2 plate hob plus basic kitchen equipment. 1 and 2 bedroom suites also available. No restaurant or bar in hotel but good restaurant and bar on street in same building. Hotel is very central; across road from Elizabeth Street mall, cinemas. Easy walking access to bars, restaurants, shops, supermarket etc.  Reception staff very helpful and can organise cars etc. AUD10/night discount and free WiFi if you book directly with hotel. Our choice of hotel when staying in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386280456~“Great Location”~Great location in Brisbane CBD. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Room had lots of space with a queen bed & single. The in room laundry & kitchenette facilities were great. Only an easy 25 minute walk to Suncorp Stadium. Will definitely stay again.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_383003035~“Third time here”~2 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment (I snore; she doesn't...so she says). Third time we've stayed here. Great location opposite Myer Centre. Lots of cafes and eating options. Its a central CDB hotel with history and class. We drove to the hotel - left the car and walked or caught taxis wherever we needed to go. There's a rank directly across from the hotel entrance in Albert Street. Spacious well equipped room - a little noise from the live music at the pub across the road, but it didn't go all night. Plumbing in the room above us a little noisy at times...but not enough to worry. Will more than likely stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_381996615~“Great Location for Shopping”~Stayed there many years ago and loved the heritage fitout of this wonderful old building. I was very impressed on my last visit two days ago that the rooms are maintained to a high standard. Bathrooms are marble and modern. Reception staff very helpful.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_379493721~“Great location”~An overnight stay in a 2 BDRM apartment that was very well appointed with the largest open plan lounge/dining area I have seen in an inner city apartment. Made for a great stay with a 5 year old child. The apartment itself was well appointed and the beds were super comfy. Everything we needed was there and the restaurant downstairs made great coffee and breakfast in the morning. A great place to stay for a larger family with younger children or if you enjoy space.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_378924125~“Comfortable stay”~I couldn't fault anything with this hotel, my little family of 4 (3 adults 1 infant) stayed in a Deluxe suite, comfortable and spacious, the sofa bed was great that i didnt even have to unfold it, room had a kitchenette, washing machine and dryer. Lots of surrounding shops and cafes, if you're a fan of Culture Kings store its only a three minute walk around the corner. Its a valet car service I cant remember if we had to pay for this.. but id say its pretty much compulsory that if you park your car in the hotel car park they park the car for you. We had a pleasant day stay here. Wish we stayed longer. Staff were most helpful. Thank you enjoyed our stay in Brisbane~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_376462504~“Going back in time”~Unit was decorated in Victoria England. Very elegant and fully furnished. Across the street was the 4 story mall and shopping district which is walking only. Restaurants are plentiful. Had washer/dryer as well.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_375279048~“Another Amazing Stay”~As the title says yet another amazing stay, my third, at this wonderful hotel and I could not have been more delighted. A step back in time to the luxury of yesterday with large well appointed rooms and service plus the Royal Albert has everything going for it. Just a couple of minutes walk to the Queen Street Mall with its shops, restaurants and bars and with the brillant Cafe Mondial just outside the entrance to the hotel there is something to please everyone. Value for money most definitely.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
