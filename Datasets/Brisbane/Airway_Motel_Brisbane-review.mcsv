review_476572808~“Great clean accommodation in excellent location.”~Stayed 1 night pre flight. Found staff to be very obliging. Had room at the end on the top floor. Nice and spacious and clean with all the am entities one could ask for. Went for dinner across the road at the gallopers club and highly recommend their bistro food. All in all a fabulous stay and would most definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471168283~“Near the airport”~We had a one night stay at the Airway, booked online. Pretty close to the airport, but well located for cafes, restaurants, sports club, buses & trains. Accommodation was very comfortable & staff were friendly & very helpful regarding local area. Train station is only about 5 or 6 minutes walk away, & trains run to the city every half hour.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_459381818~“Non descript”~The room had no character. On a hot day the room was over 40 degrees, the aircontioner took over an hour to make a difference. As happy room, but good modern bathroom. No water provided despite being listed. Noisy traffic nearby.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~2~nan
review_457931503~“Overnight stay”~Reasonable rates , close proximity to airport which will cost approx $25au by taxi. Rooms spacious and clean with all you could need , air con , fridge, microwave , large bathroom. Reception very helpful with directions to food outlets and pre ordered taxi for next morning . Only negative was occasional horn from train and other guests noise when leaving early hours not considering those trying to sleep.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456060916~“Clean and cheap”~Close to Brisbane airport and Warf. Rooms are clean and come with TVs, fridge and microwave. Pool and car parking. Good budget motel. Close to racecourse and cheap places to eat. We dropped our bags off at 7am and upon return at 1.45pm manager had placed our bags in the room ready for us,~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan
review_454345624~“1 night stay”~Stayed here 1 night before flying out the next morning.  First thing I noticed was the train line opposite the hotel but I didn't hear any trains during the night. There was a little road noise though.  The hotel is close to the airport and close to all the long term airport car parking companies. There are quiet a few good restaurants within 5 minutes drive. Parking is pretty much anywhere you can fit your car and most uncovered. I parked under the sign next to the office. Rooms are large and have everything you need for a short stay. Good for the price.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452955688~“In need of TLC but clean & convenient.”~Chose this motel as reasonably close to the Airport. Reviews pretty accurate. Good clean room, everything we needed but could do with a refurb but that would probably put the price up. Comfy bed, good shower and decent towels. Good size fridge with tea and coffee making facilities, microwave, TV etc. Not many rooms, only 2 floors. We were on the ground floor at the end and there was some noise with people parking cars, banging doors, etc. There is a small pool at the rear which has some chairs to sit and relax if you have time. Very helpful reception generally but put in an early wakeup call but it didn't happen. Brilliant take away fish & chips from Hamilton Sea Food which is just a short walk away which had generous portions or there is an RSL across the road which is open to non-members.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_452027976~“Accommodation”~I am staying at this Motel while staying in Brisbane overnight. The room is clean, spacious and homely. It also close to the city and the Airport. It is within walking distance to Restaurants. Staff are very welcoming and accommodating.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450031334~“Great Value Clean and Tidy Room”~I think this motel was excellent value as we only paid $130 a night for 3.  We stayed in Room 1 on the ground floor. My daughter has a wheelchair and we did not have a problem with fitting it in the room with only a small step at the front door. The room was very clean and included all that you need. The air conditioner was very effective and not too noisy. My daughter enjoyed a swim in the pool and it was very refreshing. The manager Kristian was very nice and friendly and helpful on all our dealings with him. The Gallopers Club is a short walk away the meals are good and it is open til late. I can highly recommend this motel for anyone cruising or flying. We park at Portside Parking which is nearby and they drop and pick you up from Portside or the Airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_440239432~“Great”~Great service, we arrived just off the plane and our room wasn't ready just yet so we were pointed in the direction of some good cafes with a map and our luggage was taken to our room and they also ordered a taxi for us the following mourning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_437945027~“Airport Hotel”~Great little Motel to stay in close to the Airport. Good Value for money, the rooms were clean and spacious. The staff were friendly. There is an RSL Club across the road which was handy for dinner.  Perfect for a night or two. The pool looked lovely but we did not get a a chance to use it.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_428315376~“Cheap motel room ”~Purchased to stay for races as close. You get what you pay for: old looking rooms, old bathroom where the tap leaks and the shower door doesn't work properly. Tried opening window and it got stuck. Beds just comfortable enough. Moths keep getting in some how. Can hear everything thing going on outside and next door neighbour. Only stay a night max. Decided to leave early! Only good thing was the staff were friendly.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_425534891~“Good value for money ”~My partner and I needed somewhere to stay in Brisbane near the airport for two nights, this place seemed to be the cheapest yet have decent reviews. Two nights with a queen bed ended up being around $220AU. You get what you pay for. Bathrooms and room are average. There is a mini fridge, plenty of space for bags, mounted tv, AC. The bathroom was average, but the water pressure in the shower was most impressive, which we very much enjoyed (better than the house we rent lol)  Overall, if you're on a budget, this is a great value for money stay. I would come back here if needed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424847328~“Ok”~Pros: clean, roomy, comfortable beds. Cons: no sound proofing, you will hear each arrival, departure and shower being had.  Tip: if travelling on your own from the airport to the Airway, use the airport shuttle service for $15, a taxi will cost you $35.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_408516113~“Good place near the airport”~The motel doesn't look like much on the outside but the rooms are very clean and it's very walkable to resturants and shopping. About a 10-15 walk from the motel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. For a short stay, this is a good place.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_408506054~“Good”~First impressions of outside was a bit mmmmm , room was neat and clean , reception was very helpful and welcoming , bed comfortable , noise was minimal we slept really well ,, shower was good ,, we ordered the continental breakfast which is extra but u get plenty so was worth it ,, if u have a lot of luggage might be best to ask for a ground floor unit as there is no lift , pool looked clean but a bit chilly to try it out ,, tables and chairs around the pool could do with replacing , we went to the bowling club for tea ( Gallopers ) it was very nice ,, would stay here again~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_403088692~“Handy location to the racetracks.”~I phoned before our visit to make enquiries about the area and public transport. The staff member I spoke to was extremely helpful with information. We found the location convenient as it is very close to public transport to the city, The prices were great and our room clean and comfortable. There were plenty of blankets and pillows and a roomy shower with nice hot water. We found this location ideal for our needs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399811726~“Looks 'iffy' from outside, but rooms clean and comfortable”~Very small motel; two floors, no lift. Two things make this a place worth staying--the managers/staff and the clean, comfortable rooms. We arrived via taxi just at dusk and were wondering where in the world we were...racetrack nearby, smell of horses in the air. The desk manager was very welcoming and helped us haul are many/heavy bags up the stairs to our rooms. Once we figured out how to turn on the lights in the room (switch right on the doorframe), we found a clean, spacious room decorated in tile and carpet, light wood, white 'plantation' blinds on the windows and a large bathroom with sparkling blue floor tiles and a large shower. Bed is tucked away around the corner so you don't hear too much street noise (or the tram which runs across the street). Large wardrobe, nice place to put suitcase, long desk area, microwave, refrigerator, coffee makings. Flat screen TV and a quiet reverse cycle aircon/heater.  Slept great and managed the luggage down the steps in the morning. The desk receptionist checked on our airport shuttle pickup for us and was so pleasant to talk to.  I would absolutely stay here again. No breakfast on site but Gallopers is just across the main road and has reasonably priced menu for all meals. You can preorder a continental breakfast from the front desk and they will deliver it to your room (assume it's cereal, etc.).  Free Wifi. About 15 minutes to the airport. We had a noon flight and Conexions picked us up at 10:45; we had bags checked and were at gate by 11:15.~4~3~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_398686099~“Practical”~Good value for the price. Not much access to natural light (limited windows). Staff were excellent. Room very clean and comfortable. Ideal for quick overnight stay when in transit as close to the airport.~4~nan~nan~nan~2~5~5~nan
review_397014185~“Neat Clean & Simple”~Although it isn't the Hilton is was exactly what we needed for an overnight stay. Everything was clean and in good order. In a great location to the airport and not to noisy. We lost the room key and the staff were very understanding and didn't charge us.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_389648048~“Perfect for a quick airport overnight stay”~Ideal location after a late arrival... We came in late and all was flexible arranged. From touchdown to our bed was done within the our. Aprox 6K from the airport. Accommodation is basic but clean and tidy. There is some road and train rumor though. By the way... Train connection to Brisbane and restaurants are in walking distance.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_386052724~“Great location and value for money”~Great apartment, very comfortable and nice and close to the cruise terminal. Was only about a 10 minute walk. Only stayed 1night but will definitely stay again. Might have to plan a trip to the races as its definitely in walking distance.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_383038217~“Great room”~Stayed one night 3 of us room was a bit small but comfy for 1 night clean and tidy close to the airport and the office was very helpful and booked the taxi for the next morning and informed us it would be cheaper than the shuttle this was much appreciated~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_382329115~“Worst Stay Ever (21st May, 2016)”~Our room was directly above main office. At 2am some drugged/drunk thug began trying to smash down every door,including ours, in our row. He couldn't find his room so he just lost it. The language and physical threat was frightening. This went on for over 40mins. We could not believe the motel management heard nothing. They're either stone deaf or just don't care. We were getting an early flight so thanks to an idiot we got no sleep at all. They advertise parking BUT they don't say limited parking. Hope you get a spot. I've gone to T.A. as I contacted the motel privately. Absolutely no response! DON'T STAY HERE!!~1~nan~3~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_379514183~“Comfortable, good sized rooms”~Only stayed for one night when passing through Brisbane, the overall feel I got from the hotel was very nice, with clean spacious appointed rooms.

review_375064097~“Clean, convenient, helpful”~Airway Motel delivers in terms of what one looks for in a motel in terms of the room being clean, neat and tidy. Host was very friendly and helpful with regards to booking a taxi to the airport and local cafes and restaurants for a meal. The location is also great: close to the station, good restaurants and a quick taxi to the airport. I'll definitely be back.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_367696812~“Well located”~Close to airport but not too much overhead noise. Ideal for an over-nighter en-route to or from the airport. Not especially fancy, but good level of amenities, very clean and staff were very obliging.~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_364272132~“Wonderful”~The holiday was wonderful, the room that we were in was really good and we were so close to transport and we were only a few walks down to shops and near the water to see the ships come in to port. the pool was amazing but it should be clean regularly.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353763391~“Mrs Julie Marinucci”~Motel was near the airport and airport parking facilities so that suited us. Bed was comfy. Air conditioning worked ok, opening Windows were good too. Bathroom was neat and clean. Good parking under cover. Area was a little squeezy but managed that. Reception staff were friendly. Not far from motel was a nice fish and chips shop. Lovely meal at a reasonable price. You can eat al fresco or inside shop that's air conditioned.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_353556376~“Good for one night.. Reasonable price”~We stayed here as we had an early flight from the airport. About a 8 min drive away. Room was fine. The pool was good. We had a car so found quite a few eating spots about 3 blocks from the motel. I would stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_352521414~“Cathy Robertson”~Chris is wonderful - the rooms need to be cleared of cockroaches and the fridge in Number 1 was not working properly - however, to offset all of that, I could not have asked for a better person and for that I will be returning.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_351849531~“super comfortable”~Room is super clean and spacious, but dont forget to bring your toiletries. The location is perfect, so close to the aiport and only 20 dollars away from downtown. Staff super friendly. Definitely going back there~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_347217567~“Great Location”~Clean comfortable and well located for our purposes i.e., Travelling from Airport or Cruise Terminal. Also nice and handy to Gallopers Club for a cool drink and meals. Compared to other accommodation in the area it is reasonably priced. Have stayed here quite a few times and will continue to stay in the future.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_346490272~“Close to airport”~We stayed overnight prior to an early flight. Great location, clean basic rooms and friendly reception staff.

review_345543197~“Overnight at Airway Motel”~Airway provided all I required. The friendly staff are always helpful & go out of there way to make things work.

review_344132296~“Second time lucky”~Quite a nice simple place, though the room we were given initially had dirty cups in the sink, dirty sheets, and the room was clearly not cleaned. Upon explaining this a new room was given which was much nicer.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_342252479~“" Value for money"”~Arriving unexpectedly after 10pm on a Saturday night, the receptionist was most courteous friendly & efficient. Value for money at $135.00 per night. The large room had obviously recently been refurbished & was modern & clean. A comfortable Queen-size bed with acceptable quality linen. The shower had ample very hot water & with excellent water pressure. However, there was no complimentary guest soap & only a 1/4 toilet roll available!!! The following day (Sunday) the room was not serviced - not even the bins emptied & still no guest soap or toilet paper!!! It needed a complaint to reception to fix the supply issues - however the room remained totally unserviced. Limited covered parking is available on site; the small pool required cleaning & the guest's outdoor " relax area" requires much attention to the gardens & paving.~3~nan~nan~3~3~nan~3~nan
review_341730552~“Comfortable, quiet & convenient”~Thanks to earlier reviews & numerous Jetstar flight cancellations, I decided on the Airway Motel. I found it to be spotless, ideally located & quiet. This was perfect for a very early start & was a great decision. Let me hasten to add, flying with Jetstar wasn't! Had a delightful evening at the bowling club across the road. The food isn't Michellin star but is fair. Certainly will return next time but not to fly Jetstar.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_340334267~“A GEM OF A FIND”~The Airway Motel, being being smaller size motel is a gem of a find. The manager, Christian was very service oriented, professional & friendly. The motel is situated with a bus stop street side for Brisbane City buses with frequent services to the city..The Ascot Bowling Club is just across the road with great meals at reasonable prices for lunch & dinner meals. Also, it takes just a few minutes drive to the renown Racecourse Rd. & Portside with a cinema complex & a multitude of various restaurants etc.  Rooms are modern & spotlessly clean.Virtually no disturbing traffic noise as the motel is located around the corner off Nudgee Rd. The Airway Motel is close to the Brisbane Airport & just a quick drive to connect to the arterial h'ways to Surfers & the Sunshine Coast.It is a real gem find & we will certainly only stay at the Airway Motel when visiting Brisbane.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339801897~“Great location for a stop over”~It's not a five star establishment however the staff are very friendly and accommodating, service was great, bed was extremely comfortable and the linen was obviously a decent thread count, very clean and cosy feeling.
