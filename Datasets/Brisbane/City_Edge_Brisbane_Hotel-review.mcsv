review_477368027~“We were booked in for 6 nights but only stayed for one.”~We were given a room which only just fitted a queen sized bed in it, and no view out of the window as we couldn't get to it (on the far side of the bed which was pushed up against the wall. We asked to be moved and the next room also had no view as the window had frosted glass in it with a noisy air conditioner outside it. The corner of the room had been walled off to make a tiny en suite, with a cracked basin and the door stuck if it was properly shut which meant there was no privacy in the toilet. There were 2 mugs and one glass but no plates or cutlery, even though there was a toaster and microwave and the fridge wasn't working. The whole place was depressing. However, the staff were helpful and were very polite even when we cancelled our booking.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_475990721~“Perfectly fine for a short stay”~I stayed in one of the rooms at City Edge with a friend, and while it left much to be desired, it was okay for one night. The good points: it was very central and easy to get to Queen St, it was inexpensive and clean. The not so good points: the bathroom was tiny, the wifi was extremely slow if it worked at all, the aircon was very loud (but we did appreciate that there was aircon available in the room), and if you wanted breakfast in the morning you would need to fork out something like $12 for a basic toast meal. So if you're staying for one or two nights with lots to do in the city, want somewhere central, and not too picky about the actual room, this will do the job.~3~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_472669278~“DO NOT STAY HERE!!”~We booked this hotel for 1 night because it was close to the restaurant we were visiting. I just wish we had checked on tripadvisor before making the booking !! This is, without doubt, the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. We rejected the first room because it was dirty, the second room was only marginally better. The rooms are tiny, do not have any natural light and have decrepit bathrooms. The worst aspect was the noise, with garbage trucks unloading in the alley next to room, all night. Also, the AC compressor was mounted on the outside wall near the bed head, about 2 feet from your head so you so you had compressor banging away all night. Not possible to sleep at all. How anyone can pass off this joke of a place as a hotel, is totally beyond me, we would have had a better nights sleep on a park bench!!~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan
review_470792737~“A Love-Hate Relationship”~Price-wise, you'll love City Edge Brisbane.  Its location to George Street is also brilliant; unfortunately, the hotel is also situated just across the road from the Magistrates Court so the neighbourhood is full of dodgy characters by day, and even dodgier ones by night. We were abused by drunk or high residents several times through no fault of our own. Inside, the hotel is clean and offers excellent customer service. Breakfast can be supplied fairly cheaply from Monday to Friday. The facilities in our family room were also top-notch, providing us wth a microwave, toaster and plenty of plates/cutlery to use. However, the double bed in our three-person unit was incredibly uncomfortable - so much so that we fought over who would sleep on the couch instead. And the layout of our room was not ideal, with a lot of wasted space. For the price and convenience, though, I'd certainly return here again.~4~4~nan~2~nan~nan~5~nan
review_464448201~“See a concert”~The rooms were changed twice before we were split into two rooms the air cons facing the main roads were both filthy hadnt been cleaned in years and the bathrooms were the size of a cupboard.

review_461280833~“Value for Money”~I arrived the hotel without any expectation because of the reviews written. Yes, it is a basic hotel. 2 star perhaps but I cannot complain.  The staff Anjeli, was very friendly and helpful. I arrived at 11 am but was given a room straightaway. It was pouring when I wanted to go out for dinner and was given an umbrella by Anjeli. So that was a nice touch.  The room was small but very comfortable. The bed and pillows were my first concern and I must say, I had a good night sleep.  The bathroom was very tiny so I would not recommend a large person to check into this hotel. May be a problem for 2 persons with luggages navigating your way around the room as there is little room to spare. Perhaps there are bigger rooms available. Location is great. Roma Station is only minutes away. Easy to walk to city centre and many restaurants and shops are around the corner.  I think this hotel is located well in the city. It is small but cosy. For the price, I think it is good value. Free wifi is a bonus.  So if you were happy to find a hotel with comfortable bed and pillows without the luxury, I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.  Soho is another hotel I will recommend for Brisbane (Bigger room, bathroom and free wifi too) but it is on the hill and further away from city centre.~4~nan~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan
review_458835819~“Boutique queen room my a r s e”~We stayed at the city edge on a Saturday night and checked out on a Sunday We had no hot water on either day the room was definitely not boutique unless boutique means small room with no luxury poor cleanliness and delaperdated surrounds Staff were abrupt and unhelpful apparatnley they can't make any decisions unless the boss is there.

review_458221022~“Happy atmosphere”~A bright welcoming smile as soon as we walked in, later we realised that was the new manager. The room and the bathroom was a bit small, it’s hard to move around, but it’s not their fault. This was the first time we visited Brisbane, the staff recommended few places we could go, and they were all walking distance. Later we asked for more recommendations, the manager googled few bars & cafes which was so sweet. Highly recommend travellers to stay in this hotel. Extremely good value for money, so close to everything, and the staff are amazing! Air con is the best!~4~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_454872964~“Not a comfortable visit”~The staff are friendly. The rooms are cleanish. Def just a place to rest your head. Very claustrophobic room with small frosted window with aircon unit outside. Any person above the average weight will not fit in the shower recess. About the size of a campervan bathroom. The room was noisy as its next to an alley way. Trash collection at 6am for about 5 mins. The location is perfect. Walking distance for every including a bridge to Southbank. Carparking is actually a block away. Not under the hotel.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451213425~“Early check in”~We arrived early in the morning after 30 hours flight back to Australia. We planned to stay in Brissy for 2 nights before heading home. The friendly staff at the front was very caring, called the housekeeper to have to room ready for us ASAP. Within 20 minutes, we checked in! Will come back again when we visit next time. Best value of money for the level of service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_450797361~“No Parking at Reception. Unhelpful Service. Parking Map confusing. Refund refused after experience.”~We arrived at this accommodation only to find it is on a one way street leading to Turbot street and you can't park anywhere near reception as it is in front of a yellow line even though they say it is clearly mapped out on their website. It must be in the samll print. Reception don't care to tell you where to park legally as they are too busy plugging in a PIN number for your parking somewhere else. They show you a map while you are panicking explaining you are parked outside. To make matters worse you turn up to the address on the map where there appears to be a couple of parking spaces on the same street , but you follow the exact instructions to find that the number is attached to a complex or plaza of some sort. You realize it could be the one back 50 metres and make the mistake of reversing to it as you don't want to risk getting lost driving somewhere else. Best suggestion. Look for accommodation with parking like the Pullman around the corner. I couldn't believe the cost was the same except the VALET parking was $25 dearer. Who cares if you have to pay the extra. You still have to pay here for parking and risk the chance of something major happening. I can assure you if you were not happy with your stay at the Pullman ( guaranteed you'll be happy) they would refund you and apologise for your experience. This experience has been a nightmare with no responsibility for their careless and negligent parking attached to this accommodation at reception and secured parking instructions. Yes I tried.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_441225583~“Overpriced for what it offers”~Room - extremely small then I upgraded to the executive suite that was Tiny for what the name stood for. This hotel needs to renovate really badly... The toilets and shower are dirty with hair all over from the last guests and I don't believe the staff even washes them for the next guest.... The décor is old fashioned to say the least.... Lots of junkies at the reception and often you'd feel insecure as a business traveller. The hotel Iron was broken it tore my shirt when ironing with no other option. The laundry room smelled really acidic. The carpets in both rooms I stayed in had marks and stuff all over it. The dust from the carpets put me into a fit of hyperventilation for a bit and any asthma sufferers, DO NOT BOOK here... This place is not suitable for business travellers at all...Those traveling with small kids, this is definitely not a place to keep your kids... I believe the authorities need to look at this hotel as a health hazard for the general public soon...~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~nan

review_428998324~“Expensive for what it is.”~Executive Double Room - I would be worried about what a standard room was like. This room was very small. Just enough room for a bed.

review_428604056~“Good location but bad luck”~This is a budget hotel and the facilities are minimal. The reception desk people are cordial and helpful. The location is great as one could walk to the city, train stations, etc. within minutes. I could walk from the hotel to Roma St. Parkland, the Botanic Garden and Southbank without too much trouble. However, It was my bad luck that the Brisbane city council sewage truck came at about 3 am on the first night whilst I slept and woke me up. It was not the truck noise but the terrible stench which was totally shocking. Apparently the truck comes a few times in a year to pump out the underground rotten sewage of the adjacent derelict factory. I got up and went to the lobby to sit there until 5 am. The stench spread all over the hotel (and I checked every floor) and the lobby was the only place that I could tolerate. I complained to the hotel which then compensated me by upgrading me to a double-bed room on the top floor. Life was good after that. It was not the hotel's fault anyway, but just my bad luck.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_427165030~“Don't do it”~Although this hotel is very inexpensive, it does not live up to any positive expectations and either upgrading or going to a hostel would be a better option.  There is no space to hang anything longer than a short No hair dryer Very aging No iron, unless you can find the communal laundry (out the back, down the stairs), and the iron there is broken Lamps exist, but one can't be plugged in as there isn't a power point available Wifi settings not up to date and some devices can't link. Slow connection for those that do and only 1 device can link at any time Door slams loudly No noise barrier between room and hallway The 1 Breakfast option is unsuitable (toasted chicken sandwich) No tissues Light flickers No reception during the evening some nights and not open until 8am General junk lying around No room cleaning No phone No room for bags, room is too small Tap in sink sprays Window coverings don't cover window sufficiently to stop light Window very small and 80% covered by an air conditioning unit  Whole hotel needs good clean Some of the toiletries had been used by a previous guest~1~nan~nan~1~nan~1~2~nan
review_426884773~“An unusual start but a lovely stay”~Our trip was a bit late notice one and I needed a cheap room in the cbd and found city edge. After I booked I saw some of the reviews and i must say not all of them were great and got me a little worried.  We arrived and found our room, small but very well equipped; TV , microwave, toaster, bar fridge, tea and coffee and a small desk. The bathroom was tint, but really it sufficed, we could still wash.  During the night we heard a dripping noise, now having read a couple of the reviews we both thought it was the shower but couldn't be bothered getting out of bed to check. In the morning we discovered it was actually a leak in the ceiling and our bathroom had become very wet indeed. We headed downstairs with our luggage ad let them know. The lady at the desk was absolutely mortified and very apologetic and immediately found us a new room and gave us a free upgrade. She was very lovely about the whole incident.  Our new room was twice the size of the other, with a couch and another single bed, I believe it was a family room. It was very comfortable and amazingly quiet for a room facing the road. We soon made ourselves at home and had an enjoyable stay.  I think next time I would definitely book one of the larger rooms. The small room may have been a bit confined for the 4 nights we stayed. But a very pleasant experience with lovely, attentive staff and it is right in the heart of the cbd!~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_422702011~“Not the best hotel”~Visited City Edge hotel again out of convenience. Sigh - why did I?!!! A no frills boutique hotel for under $90AUD Slept in a room with a blazing outdoor air conditioner blasting all night long - noise so bad I coudlnt sleep On top of that the bathroom shower faucet dripped heavily all night long There was also a bottle of shampoo under the bed from the previous occupant, bathroom wasn't cleaned properly It is not a hygienic place to stay Thumbs down again - oh and never again will I stay here The only plus side to it is its proximity to the city - it is walking distance to most places~1~nan~5~nan~1~nan~1~nan

review_421003016~“Won't be back...”~The lack of hot water (none!), the lack of shower curtain (none!) and the fact that it was well known to staff who still allocated is the room, has ensured we won't be returning. The bathrooms need a massive upgrade, circa original backpacker style 1970.  We were simply looking for a cheap and cheerful accom option for our city adventure, we got the cheap but decidedly uncheerful. Clean linen and handy location were the only positives.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_418240203~“Cheap and Cheaper ”~This place is so basic and for us we had fly buys so it was clean and ok. My biggest complaint was the noise. We had four nights and EVERY night at 4am we were woken by garbage collection in the lane. We were exhausted. Small was certainly true. Shower was ridiculous.  They cater for Asian visitors but not Aussies. It's old 100 years but not upgraded for 50 years.  ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_411640819~“Budget hotel in top CBD location”~Booked in for 4 nights. Yes, the room is very small and basic, but clean and comfortable. For it's location though, and the price, I am certainly not complaining and will happily stay here again. You do get what you pay for, so if you're just after a comfy bed and shower in within a 5 minute walk to pretty well everything Brisbane has to offer, then this is fine.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_411220601~“City Edge Hotel is an insult - a lie.”~City Edge Hotel Brisbane Very UNcomfortable room. You would be more comfortable in a shared dorm in a backpacker hostel - tho five times the price. Doesn't match the photos on the website. This place is a lie. A/C compressor directly outside the barred window. No blanket - two sheets only on bed. The only way of keeping warm during the winter night was to continually adjust the a/c and the thermostat didn't operate. I could have requested a blanket however I was already undressed when I discovered this fact - plus I didn't want to give the staff the opportunity to show their indignanance at my continual complaints.  Up and down the stairs since there's no phone on the room to make the complaints/requests. TV kept going on "NoSignal". Dirty walls. No jug But there's a rice cooker! Room tiny - barely walk around the bed - no room for luggage - and then there was an "ensuite" taken out of that. There's a warning sign the wall in the ensuite saying to keep the door shut whilst having a shower or the smokedetector will go off. There is no exhaust fan. The shower cubicle is so small - the size of a coffin - it's only just feasible to move ones arms in a washing motion. Closing the door from the room is a no go. The sink in the ensuite didn't have sufficient pressure to wash the contents down the drain. Two driveway exit alarms adjacent to hotel. This is an old warehouse that has had walls strewn across the floors - placed a number on the door - and they've called it a hotel.  I had decided to give myself a birthday treat for this night in Brisbane and it's categorised in the same space as Sheraton, Pullman and Oaks. The only reason I didn't go elsewhere was that I was worn out after a day of travel. This is third world. This place is an insult.~1~1~1~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_407712795~“the only thing big about this place, is my dissapointment”~I came to Brisbane for two exams which my entire future career depends on. Due to this reason I decided to avoid the usual hostels and motels which I frequent for under $50 and instead, splurge on a nice room in a nice hotel with plenty of room to study in comfort.  We find the place, but there's no where to park. When we find a parking spot, we walk back two blocks to figure out where we are supposed to find this car park we have paid for. The map they provide doesn't extend to where we are, so 45 minutes later of no GPS a million wrong turns and a rather heated argument, we arrive.  Ready to get into the hotel and calm down to get my study on. We walk into the smallest room I have ever seen. My boyfriend can't fit on the bed. So I think, I'm going to have a nice shower, clear my head and get down to the books. The shower is so small its like standing in a coffin. There's no shower curtain, because if there were it would be like a lid closing in on top of you. Claustrophobic me is not happy.  Next we set up the internet, part of the reason I chose this was for the wifi. The wifi only works for one person at a time. So here I am studying and the only thing my boyfriend has to do is sleep.  I do not reccomend this for anybody. Do not stay here, it is a huge disapointment. For the same price or cheaper you can be just as close to the CBD and hey, they might even include a breakfast, cause its an extra $10 here.~1~1~nan~nan~1~nan~3~nan
review_407346931~“Stolen Sunglasses”~Huge delusion. I stupidly forgot my new (quite pricey) sunglasses on the bedside table of the room, 3 hours later I called the reception to have them back, they just gained time and said to call them later and later, later on I called 4 times, the last time I did they refused to admit my sunglasses were there. I've been an idiot but they have behaved squalidly, thanks for stealing!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_406361047~“Small and uncomfortable, and unclean.”~We only stayed for a few nights. The rooms are not at all as bright as what the pictures make out to be, and the rooms are not that big either. Avoid anything near the lift, rooms 101, 201 and 301, as all you can hear is the clunky lift every time it's used.  During our stay, housekeeping didn't visit. Which is fine as I don't want bed linen changed or made up for me, but why provide people with tea/coffee/toaster and a rice maker (?!) if you aren't going to replenish their glassware etc? We got given 1 fork and 2 spoons too. We also weren't given any spare towels or bath mats, so the one's that we were given spent their time trying to dry in the smallest bathroom in the world, and the bathmat was just constantly wet. Carpets in the communal areas and the bedrooms aren't clean. They don't even look like they've tried to clean them. The blinds in our room looked like they had coke or red wine spilt on them. The lamps in the room didn't work. There was a socket down the side of the bed, but it didn't seem to work and it wasn't attached to the wall. To be honest, it all just needs a good scrub down - including the limescale in the bathroom grout. The rooms are cramped. We got moved into what I assume was an executive room after a complaint, which is a slightly bigger room, with a big red couch. There's little to no natural light in the room and the bathroom was TINY. I'm small of build and I struggled. There's no room to put anything anywhere in the bathroom and the signs on the doors tell you that you must keep the tiny bathroom's door shut so as not to set off heat/fire detectors. Except it's so small and gets so hot - why not put an extractor fan in there??  Breakfast is a chicken sandwich....... and the Wifi is poor. The only reason that this is rated average and not poor, is the staff - everyone is super friendly, super helpful and can't do enough for you if you have a question or complaint. It's close to everything, but to be honest, I would prefer to pay a bit more and stay somewhere more comfortable and clean, or pay the same and be further out.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~nan~nan
review_401139924~“Comfortable, but minimal”~I found this hotel adequate for a short couple of night stay. It is central to the city and a short walk to the Roma Street transit Centre. I booked a double room although I was travelling solo. The room was small but at the price reasonable. There is airconditioning, tea and coffee making facility and even a micro wave, toaster and rice cooker should you feel the need to self cater. A light breakfast can be pre order for a minimal charge but I chose to eat breakfast in one of the many nearby eateries. I foung the bed comfortable and the room was clean and well kept. Reception is open between 08"00 and 22:00 and the staff were friendly and obliging. I would definately saty here again if travelling solo as the room does not facilitate anywhere to place luggage. Worth the price.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_401127881~“Good Location but terrible facilities”~The room was very small, the picture on the website made the room look bigger than it was. The bathroom/shower recess was only about 3 feet wide and had no shower curtain, a larger built person would struggle to fix in the bathroom. The carpets was old and dingy and had not been cleaned for a long time. there was dirty scuff marks on the walls. The first night I stayed the corridors stank of curry being cooked. The room was not cleaned on a daily basis nor clean towels provided. The doona had no cover on it, it was placed between 2 sheets. There is no secure room to leave your luggage if you needed a later check out. Girl on front desk has very limited English and told me to leave my luggage in the open foyer that was accessed by anyone. both the bedside lamps did not have a power point to plug the lamps into. The laundry is down in the lower basement, no soap powder is available need to supply your own, and there was rotten rubbish in a bin near the laundry and the stairwell to the laundry had a disgusting smell to it.~2~nan~4~2~nan~nan~2~nan
review_395828144~“Friendly professional staff but very uncomfortable room”~The photo in the ad on booking.com made this room look spacious and warm-yellow lit. Instead it is fluro-lit and very cramped. The shower and toilet are extremely close together and there is no shower curtain or barrier. I wasn't able to sleep and neither was the person I was sharing a room with due to the very uncomfortable pillows (extremely tall and firm - literally slept on a folded towel which was also very uncomfortable); and, noisy outside aircon unit not connected to our apartment's aircon machine, which blocks the very unappealing alleyway view out the window that additionally has caged in poles across it. There is no street parking available - only a secured parking lot that costs $15 per day which takes surprisingly long to walk out of and back to the hotel with one's heavy bags. This is terrible value for money. I paid just over $100 per day and it's honestly worth much less than a roadside motel room, which is a lot more comfortable than this. This is even less comfortable and harms sleep more than any hostel dorm I have stayed at. The booking.com page said that this was a non-refundable transaction but I feel that this is dishonest considering the ad conveniently didn't mention the terrible conditions. The only positive thing is the kind, professional staff at reception - I can't fault them. They're just doing their job and they are very nice. The location is just a 10-minute walk to Queen Street Mall. I would never stay here again. I would drive to another town if I had to, even at great inconvenience because not having any sleep is the worst thing when that's what you're paying for! I may as well be out walking on the street and not pay for a hotel.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_366326101~“Good location but poor facilities”~Very basic accommodation, poor service and very small rooms for price. Was moved due to cleaning fluid smells. 'Superior' room cost $20 extra per night but air conditioning very poor and still basic. Wifi was supposed to be available but could not connect to it.

review_357932460~“No swinging of cats here”~Look, if you're after a cheap place to sleep within a short walk of the centre of Brisbane, then this is the right place. If you expect any kind of luxuries (like a window that looks out on to, well anything) or space to put your bags or the ability to step out of your shower and not directly trip over the toilet, then this is not the place for you. I had a twin room with a friend for one night and we found it pretty funny and charming. We could have held hands from our single beds (which were narrower than your average) and there was no floor space for luggage - but it served a purpose and was good for that. The staff were lovely and very helpful, so it made for a good option on a weekend where everything else was booked out.~2~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_353724943~“Good central location.”~This hotel is in an excellent position if you want to walk around the city. Everything is in walking distant. From shopping, transport and even the casino. The room is very small especially the bathroom but it is clean and you are only there to sleep not to live in. Priced very well for accommodation which is central. If you are catching the train later in the day you can leave your luggage there and collect it later. This is a good service as you are not allowed to leave your bags unattended at the station and can not cart it around with you all day.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan

They were totally terrible in my staying and now I couldn't expect anything different. Disrespectful people!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_348971430~“Small and not always staffed but clean, comfortable and safe”~I had arrived quite late to find no concierge however they had displayed a number to call on the door for me to call someone to register and then I was provided with the safe code to access my room key. So understandable cutting costs by not having a night clerk, I did find their check in process to compensate quite convenient. Upon entering the room, a double bed covered the very small room - I fortunately had just one small bag and the bathroom was incredibly small as well. However the bed was extremely comfortable. Room has no view. On the Sunday morning I stepped out to drop off my rental car and when I returned my key wasn't working. I came down and had to wait no more than 2-3 minutes for the front desk staff to open (so no real issue) however had this happened an hour early I would not have been happy. Overall, if you want to stay somewhere safe, centrally located and clean (my criteria), then I would recommend City Edge. If there are more than 1 of you, you expect 24/7 service and a relatively spacious hotel room then don't stay here.~3~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_366326101~“Good location but poor facilities”~Very basic accommodation, poor service and very small rooms for price. Was moved due to cleaning fluid smells. 'Superior' room cost $20 extra per night but air conditioning very poor and still basic. Wifi was supposed to be available but could not connect to it. Charged instead of pre-authorised amount, still not refunded extra charges. No communication from management. You get what you pay for, within walking distance of restaurants and transit services.~2~nan~4~nan~2~nan~1~nan
review_363476918~“A regular stop”~I have stayed at this motel about six times now, and will without reservation stay there again when next I go to Brisbane. It has everything I need and is close to both the city and rail transport.  I found the Staff friendly and obliging on all occasions and the rooms well made-up and clean. It has everything you need. I recommend The City Edge Motel without reservation and look forward to my next stay there.  My most sincere thanks to the Staff.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_357932460~“No swinging of cats here”~Look, if you're after a cheap place to sleep within a short walk of the centre of Brisbane, then this is the right place. If you expect any kind of luxuries (like a window that looks out on to, well anything) or space to put your bags or the ability to step out of your shower and not directly trip over the toilet, then this is not the place for you. I had a twin room with a friend for one night and we found it pretty funny and charming. We could have held hands from our single beds (which were narrower than your average) and there was no floor space for luggage - but it served a purpose and was good for that. The staff were lovely and very helpful, so it made for a good option on a weekend where everything else was booked out.~2~nan~4~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_353724943~“Good central location.”~This hotel is in an excellent position if you want to walk around the city. Everything is in walking distant. From shopping, transport and even the casino. The room is very small especially the bathroom but it is clean and you are only there to sleep not to live in. Priced very well for accommodation which is central. If you are catching the train later in the day you can leave your luggage there and collect it later. This is a good service as you are not allowed to leave your bags unattended at the station and can not cart it around with you all day.~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
