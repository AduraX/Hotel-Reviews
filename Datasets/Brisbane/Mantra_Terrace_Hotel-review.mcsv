review_478347234~“Great stay!”~The only thing we needed was free wifi, which I consider it should be everywhere nowadays, but can't lay a finger on anything else!  The front desk staff was very kind and made sure we had a great stay.~4~4~5~5~4~4~5~nan
review_477601246~“Overnight Stay”~Once I got over the off-site parking arrangements, the overnight stay was fabulous and incredible value for money. This is the perfect place to unwind, sleep and shower refreshed for a new day of activity~4~5~4~4~4~5~5~nan

Overall good location,great service.great for a few nights break . Thougrally recommended for singles on business or couples looking for a quiet value for money getaway.~4~4~4~3~3~4~4~nan
review_477272497~“Very modern and well presented, but a little small for stays of 2 or more nights”~Room more suited to 1 or 2 night stays. Wasn't anywhere to put our suitcases and could not fit 2 people of the balcony. Know for next time to check size of room but feel these components of the hotel should be made clear that this is an 'express' hotel which is great for business people for 1 night but not a leisure hotel~3~3~4~5~2~5~5~nan
review_476984488~“One Night Stay”~I enjoyed the room, the bed, and the small details (scent, shampoo/soap, magazines, etc). I was only disappointed that we did not receive the free drink upon arrival as expected - and were charged about $30 for what we thought was possibly the complimentary drink. There should have been more specification as to what the free drink was - or it just should not have been offered at all.~4~4~5~5~5~5~3~nan
review_476228144~“Great hotel”~A really comfortable small boutique hotel, with an excellent bar/restaurant downstairs with a delicious menu. Does great individually cooked breakfasts for guests. Rooms are equipped with everything you could want, bathrooms are spacious enough. Everything seems newly refurbished.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475941090~“Mantra Terrace”~Very happy with the room and the service. Staff were very welcoming and obliging. However there is only one (2minute) loading bay in the street out front and the carpark is located in another building a short drive away.~4~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_475934030~“Last minute”~Excellent rooms and great value especially for a spare of the moment booking. Staff were excellent and the location was ideal to explore the city and go out for dinner without too much hassle or expenses.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_474436423~“Convenient Inner city hotel”~Great hotel, convenient and easy to get to. Nice bar restaurant attached as well. Cost me $7.50 each way with Uber to go to Suncorp stadium so a great option for entertainment accomodation. Parking a little bit of a hassle, but not too bad for inner city parking. Would be more than happy to go back~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473965657~“Matra in Astor Terrace.”~Good room and en-suite with balcony overlooking Astor Terrace, which was great, as is the location in relation to easy walking distance to the City. The only downside was the absence of a desk to work at.~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_473956635~“Quality Accommodation”~This convenient little hotel has an elegant fit out and contemporary rooms at a good price. We stayed here after a night out on the town and very satisfied by the service and quality of accommodation. Did not need to pay the parking fee as there was ample free street parking on the Saturday evening we arrived.~4~5~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_473940214~“4 days stay in Brisbane”~This hotel is lovely. A boutique hotel, the lobby and even the hall ways are gorgeous. The rooms are good, basic - no chairs or room for them, but have everything you need and a gorgeous bathroom. Very comfortable beds. The furniture was a little worn and the windows hadn't been cleaned for many years so it did taint the experience/view a bit. The outstanding thing here was the service. As I flew in in the early hours of the morning they took my case so I could have breakfast and they made a big effort to give me a room early, at no extra cost, so I could sleep. This made the whole difference to my visit. Thank you!~4~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_473934972~“Room”~The rooms were good, I had great window view and beds are nice and tidy. the showers are good just need a shower mat to get a grip on the floor but the pressure is perfect not to hard or light but just right. thank you I will return for holidays :)~5~5~5~5~4~5~5~nan
review_473710586~“solo gav”~Great position in town.fantastic food will cater for individual taste.Always ready to help with eny requests.Bathrooms are always spotless.Beds are like laying on the softest fluffy clouds you could ever emagine with the matching support of the perfect pillows.Just a quick walk to city or valley no need for taxi great saving.Price compared to a lot of hotels i have stayed in is really good and i literally live in hotels for my work.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473471232~“Convenient to the CBD”~Within walking distance of the CBD, in a very quiet street, reception very helpful. Rooms a little on the small size, but not important if you are only going to sleep there. Everything very clean and smart.~4~5~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_473462113~“Ok”~Room was pretty small, kind of a surprise. Sheets looked like they hadn't been washed properly (make up stain). Receptionist was a little dry and impersonal in conversation. More like a 3 star hotel!!~3~4~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_473316815~“Great place to stay in the city”~Lovely room, clean and very comfortable but quite small, not a problem unless you plan on having 50 people in the room. Bathroom had a lovely waterfall shower. Restaurant downstairs and parking available for a fee. Recommend it!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473254848~“Disappointing”~They did not give toiletries and offered no assistance when I told them that there was none other than directing me to the nearest 7/11. It was late at night and cold, and as a female, I felt unsafe walking out late at night in order to purchase these. Mantra at Terrace should be more caring in future.~2~1~2~5~3~5~3~nan
review_473040252~“Poor”~Small room size and its not worth whatever you spending. I would not tell anyone to try this hotel. Nice handy location because its near the city and you could walk their as well. Only there was no table or chair in the room to relax or work.  ~2~1~4~3~1~2~2~nan
review_473028984~“Not the cleanest Mantra around”~Several empty bottles and cans of alcohol were stashed in the upper cabinet and not cleaned out from previous guests. A dirty glass was also hidden in a lower cabinet and not cleaned out. Odors from the fridge were not pleasant, even when it was closed. The area behind the fridge was full of dust and forgotten pens that had been dropped there. The door for the connecting room did not close properly due to the screws being loose in the door frame lock (only after turning them back in by hand did the latch lock in properly, shutting the door completely). Reception did take the forgotten trash out the room upon reporting and provided a free WiFi code, however housekeeping practices need STRONG revision - if a guest is able to find this much, housekeeping should be one step ahead of that at all times. Lastly, had to prompt reception to reimburse my 200 AUD cash deposit upon check out, as false assumptions were made with card deposits (guests should not have to prompt for deposited funds this high). Overall, for a 4 star hotel, this needs more attention to detail in cleanliness and hospitality standards. The building and facilities seem somewhat older - elevators are fairly slow and card readers don't always work, but to be fair that's a personal preference in the end.~2~2~3~3~2~1~2~nan
review_472796609~“Nice and Clean”~Very comfortable stay and easy access to city.  Didn't use restaurant as I attended function in town. Bed was very comfortable, the room and amenties very clean. Reception upon arrival very friendly. Upon checkout staff were very busy with large travelling group. Would definitely stay again.~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_472777826~“City Explorer”~Great location, fittings and fixtures. Everything necessary for a city visit was provided. On a future visit I will try your restaurant. Friendly staff most helpful in check in and check out. Did notice, however, the computerised key card showed some difficulty with the access to the lift in proceeding to the required floor. This occurred on a few occasions. In particular, enjoyed the availability of the newspapers and other city news.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472515521~“Donna”~Very friendly, very clean, and amazing food. I thoroughly enjoyed staying here, I will be back and will recommend this wonderful Hotel to all my friends and family. I have stayed in a lot of Motels and Hotels all around Australia, and have had good and bad, but this particular Hotel ticked all the boxes for me.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472204614~“Good”~The people in the bar and restaurant were really friendly, the food was very good, we found that the receptionist was quite rude. Nice and close to Brisbane city. The bed was extremely comfortable and room was tidy.~4~4~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_471981538~“excellent value staff and room and be dquality”~Excellent stay,The staff were extremely helpful with all my enquiries, I was very busy preparing for a conference and their assistance was greatly appreciated.

review_471981171~“Friendly place in Brisbane City”~Nice and comfortable hotel close to the centre of Brisbane City. The rooms are not extremely big but very comfortable.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food at the restaurant is good but the service is a bit slow. Very good stay, will come back if I need to go to Brisbane City again~4~4~4~4~4~4~5~nan
review_471794284~“Time for a wake up call Mantra Terrace - your staff are killing you and dont seem to care”~I stayed at the Mantra Terrace Hotel Spring Hill on 30th March 2017 and it is possibly the worst experience I have had in over 24 years of business travel. Restaurant staff were very rude when they dropped my meal on the table and half fell on the floor, funnily enough they didn't understand why I would want another one, I did oblige by picking it up off the floor for them as they walked away and when the so called new meal appeared (just replated and a new bit put on) I was sneered at by the kitchen staff. Then my bathroom was filthy, mini bar was filled with empty packets that I would have been charged for if I didn't take them down to reception, than to cap it all off, my shower in the morning was highlighted by someone else's, let's say, genital hair blocking the floor drain. Ok call me fussy but this isn't worth it. Sure it was cheap at $109 for the night but I would rather pay a few more dollars and lose the attitude, dirty bathroom and genital hair in the bathroom. I reported all these issues to a perplexed morning supervisor upon checkout and he did at the manager would call me, nothing yet... Too late guys, I wont be back and neither will my colleagues.~1~nan~nan~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_471508728~“Great Value”~Service was extremely helpful and friendly, very understanding when I had to leave early due to unforeseen circumstances would recommend to anybody.

review_470405490~“Good Value”~This was great value for money, room was very clean and in reasonable condition. Only problem was the scratchy bed sheets and a miscommunication with staff. Most staff I talked to were friendly except one who seemed to be having a bad day.~4~4~2~2~4~5~3~nan
review_470214844~“Bevan Dixon ”~Well located hotel being so close to the city and to the train network, we would walk to south bank from here each morning we enjoyed the bar and the meals were just great and to a high standard, the staff were helpful and friendly from the reception to the bar. Rooms were small however they were comfortable . ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469906455~“A comfortable hotel”~We both liked the Mantra Hotel and would recommend this accommodation to those looking for a comfortable stop close to the city centre The staff were helpful and the early morning formalities of registration after a 15 hour flight were dealt with smoothly The only niggle was wi fi passwords had to be renewed daily at reception but apart from that we were happy~4~4~5~4~4~5~4~nan
review_469726080~“Poor”~Overall it is a Nice hotel. Unfortunately it has very Poor service and administration.  I was charged twice on my credit card, I will not be staying here again due to this happening.  Never had this problem at any other mantra hotel. ~2~3~3~3~3~3~1~nan

This put me off on the very first night. l won't even begin to complain about the construction noise which at this stage has become the norm nomatter where you are in Brisbane city.  lt is quite a small hotel and l must say the decor reminded me of an old school European brothel LOL.~2~nan~nan~3~nan~2~4~nan
