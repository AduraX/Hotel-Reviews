review_478682014~“Comfortable ”~We stayed for three night in a twin room. Room was very clean however a little tired looking, the beds were comfortable but dipped in the middle on the sides where people have sat. This made sleeping tricky as that edge was compromised and there was a feeling of rolling out. Breakfast was amazing, plenty of choice and easy to move around the serveries with plates of food. If you don't want to have a huge buffet dinner, walk over the road to Novotel and eat from their menu which is varied and well priced. Coffee was great and never ending. Staff as always polite and friendly. Thankyou~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478391165~“Had high hopes but disappointing visit.”~On arrival: looked impressive venue. Staff very welcoming. Had Club room for 3 nights: comfortable and easy to move around in however room was tired and in need of attention and good clean. Shower over the bath outdated and occ/health and safety issue. Dirty vent in bath/shower disturbing.  All requirements in room, iron, kettle, hairdryer etc. Good access to Club lounge and gym.  Elevators old and slightly unreliable. One friend's card had to be activated 3 times over the 3 night stay as not working in lift. Very frustrating. Escalator not working to street access had to step down heavy traffic flow with other people : felt unsafe.  Saturday went out at 0830hrs, returned at 1655hrs room not cleaned then staff requesting to clean at 1700hrs when trying to get ready for dinner.  Views average with dirty windows.  Definitely disappointing for first visit and felt not worth the money or the star rating.~3~nan~3~nan~nan~2~3~nan

review_478116537~“Disappointing visit”~Not our first visit to the Brisbane Sofitel, but it is not anywhere as good as other Sofitels. Our room was good, certainly got it at the right rate as an Accor member, it was large and clean though the air con is noisy. The buffet restaurant was not available till 8am and for the price was disappointing. The seafood was good, but the rest of the fare was in short supply or Asian only. It was so noisy you could not think. Car parking for valet parking was $80 breakfast is $49 on weekends. Really excessive if not an Accor member, but no discount on the parking. Overall 1 night stay over $400.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477990183~“Disappointing apart from the lovely staff in the club lounge”~Waited much too long to check in, not busy but very slow disinterested service.Club room dowdy and dark.Decent toiletries, bathroom small.Comfortable bed but despite being on the highest floor sleep was disturbed, Sound proofing not great. No courteousy room available for late check out and too busy for us to pay to extend our own room. No showers attached to the pool either. After lunch al fresco and the hottest summer and winter on record...we were positively dripping due to the humidity..just as well flying in business and could shower and change at the airport. Not impressed, buck your ideas up Sofitel.~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_477679101~“Poor rooms let down an otherwise nice 5 star hotel”~Good and bad things to report about this hotel. On the good side, the location is very good. Straight off the plane, across to the train station, off at Central, up some escalators and bang you are at reception. As the station name suggests, great location no more than 5 minutes from anywhere (apart from Southbank Gardens) with Eagle St Pier near by for restaurants and bars. Also, the hotel facilities are of an international standard, which is not always the case in Australia. I was really pleased that staff had accommodated my request for an early check in, as my flight landed at a very early hour.  Downsides, well unfortunately there are a few. The room was nothing special at all, in fact it felt quite dated. I couldn't really think of a single "luxury" thing about it. I accept many 5 star hotels charge for wifi, but their pricing policy was incomprehensible and left me convinced I was going to pay a flight to Europe to check Facebook. So overall helpful staff, great location and nice facilities. But rooms and wifi are below 5 star standard.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477641079~“Decent hotel but lots of faults”~Stayed here a couple of nights in March. Hotel is very centrally located in Brisbane city centre and the hotel was generally very nice. However a number of faults counted against hotel when reviewing the stay. The air conditioning was not working in room when we arrived but that was quickly fixed. There was a leak in the bathroom and also a faulty shower in room. Lifts were a problem with key access not working properly. An escalator from hotel to city was out of order for entire duration of visit and had been taken apart and showed no sign of anyone trying to repair it. Hotel had a swimming pool but no changing rooms attached which meant you had to go to room with wet swimming clothes on. Pool was outdoors and although small nice and warm and pleasant for a morning swim. Breakfast buffet had a very good choice but it was difficult to get tea or coffee as that was provided by waiting staff who were not terribly pleasant and probably overworked.  We had a lovely buffet dinner with an excellent selection of food.  Assuming we were just unlucky with all the problems the Sofitel is probably a nice enough place to stay in Brisbane.~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan~3~nan
review_477515321~“Always good”~Great hotel, centrally located and very well run. Nothing is roo much trouble. Great gym on the top floor but you need to get in early. Room service, minibar and an excellence concierge. There is also off street parking available as well.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477312162~“Central Location”~Good location, very comfortable rooms and reasonable sized outside pool on third floor deck.

That said, when we queried with the check out staff they removed from the bill.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_477167485~“Great views with breakfast ”~We stayed here for a couple of nights while on a Scenic holiday. A good and comfortable bed, nice bathroom with both a bath and a large separate shower cubicle. The breakfast was of the buffet variety and had a good and varied choice. With very large windows in the restaurant the view was delightful. On one of our evenings we had dinner here, this was also a buffet, they had a large choice of food, including a variety of seafood. Rereading the hotel description I would disagree with "luxury accommodation " and " personalised service " .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476960555~“Great place to stay”~Everything here was great. The room was lovely, service was good. Valet parking was good. The hotel is clean and tidy although is a little dated.

A truly amazing staff member in the breakfast area is a woman called Alpha. She is incredibly efficient and always kind when serving her patrons.

review_476373619~“Sofitel Standard”~Stayed at this property a number of times for both pleasure and business. Iconically central to everything you need which keeps me returning. Everything you expect from a Sofitel property. Only thing I'd expect a loofa in a Luxury category room type. Pullman can do it in their Luxury rooms, Sofitel could too. Other than that, fantastic. Liam in Concierge impressive with his forwardness in Customer Service, model staff member! Thanks Sofitel, will be back as usual.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_475203676~“Second Review - Not as Good”~It has been a few years between visits. In that time I have been in Asia and frankly have been spoiled. Location is brilliant. Check-in was efficient. Parking extortionate but I am happy to pay as it was my choice. The Sofitel could do with a rebrand to 4 star. The rooms are good but bathrooms are terrible and cramped. A so called luxury hotel charging residents for wifi?? Breakfast was adequate but understaffed. Spa is not great either. Overall, I left disappointed.~3~2~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_475141056~“Good hotel for a quick getaway”~Good location and plenty to do within walking distance. We were attending a concert so we wanted a centrally located hotel where we could put the car in the carpark, then rely on walking and Uber to get us around.~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
review_475136974~“First stay at Sofitel Brisbane ~ It won't be the Last”~Stayed for four nights in a Luxury Room Club Sofitel. Arrived early at 11.00 am and would have been quite happy to leave luggage and go for lunch until the regular check in time. We were told that we could have a room that had been vacated early on a lower floor than the usual club rooms, this was gratefully accepted and fitted well with our afternoon plans. Surprised and pleased to find the room was a junior suite which was large and quiet with great fittings, nice lounge, nice bedroom with comfortable bed and bathroom with bath and separate shower room. Club lounge is very comfortable and spacious with a good selection of canapes /nibbles on the evenings that we used it.  Club lounge staff really helpful. Club lounge breakfast had a good selection including hot dishes, however the criticism which is common to nearly all club lounge breakfasts at not just Accor hotels is that the "hot" food buffet is only warm with room temperature plates The hotel atmosphere is very welcoming, lobby area spacious and comfortable, with adjacent restaurants and bar very convenient. The helpfulness of reception, concierge, and room service, added to the club lounge staff was great and really appreciated. Location of hotel, with access to central station or easy walk to city streets, restaurants and shops is a bonus. Stayed in the Sofitel in Sydney, Sofitel Wellington did not happen as closed after a fire in the restaurant and Sofitel Melbourne next stop early May. Look forward to another good experience.  As this was our first stay at the Sofitel ,we shall make it our first choice for Brisbane in the future.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_474868585~“Comfortable stay; thoughtful and efficient service”~Over recent years, my family has stayed in the Sofitel many times, always impressed with the hotel's clean, comfortable rooms, good service from staff in all areas of the complex, good food offered in both the restaurants, as well as the convenient location (especially for rail transport) in the heart of Brisbane's CBD. During our latest stay of 8 nights (3 - 11 April), my daughter and I were delighted with the thoughtful, efficient and courteous service provided by Sofitel's staff. The quality of service and food was at the usual high standard, our room was spotlessly clean and staff on the desk were wonderful.  This visit coincided with medical treatment which necessitates an unexpected extended stay in hospital for one of us. Staff members in Reception thoughtfully extended our initial booking by making sure we stayed in the same room.  We highly recommend this hotel for its accommodation, food and great service. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474206527~“Very nice stay for business”~I spent 4 nights at the Sofitel and had a comfortable stay. The amenities are good and the hotel is bustling with activity and has a nice atmosphere. My room was a little dated as is the hotel generally, but hey hotels can't upgrade all the time and at least everything works.  The staff are very cheerful and go out of their way to be helpful to all guests. I observed no snooty behaviour and that can be said of all staff from the ladies who cleaned the rooms to the more senior hotel staff.  I had a lovely time lazing by the pool with drink in hand (paid for by the company). The only drawback for me was the bedsheets felt damp and one night I felt cold and had to wear socks. That was a totally weird feeling and the hotel need to address the cold damp sheets issue. Apart from that I had a very nice stay.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_474045723~“Needs a refurbishment desperately ”~A lot of potential in this property but feels old.  The bathrooms in the rooms are rundown and are desperate for a refurbishment.  The gym has no air flow and lacks basic equipment such as a chin up bar.  The lifts also feel very old.  Customer service is poor as it takes them over at least 2 minutes to answer the phone!  Mattress on the bed is no longer flat and needs to be changed for a new one. In room wifi is so slow it is almost unusable. The internet back in 2000 feels like it was faster than hotel wifi.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473958509~“First class all the way”~Beautiful hotel with extremely helpful staff. We had a stunning junior suite tastefully furnished and exceptional in every way. Beds extremely comfortable. Amenities included lovely Lanvin toiletries. While many appreciated the location , as tourists we would have liked to hop down to a street filled with cafes and restaurants. All are about a 10 minute walk away on the riverbank. If you are older, the walk may become tiresome instead of charming as it is uphill on the way back or an $8 au cab The hotel restaurant dinner buffet was very expensive, even by NYC standards as was the restaurant. Join Accor and you gain admission to the club floor's lounge which have outstanding breakfast and staff.  Wonderfully knowledgeable and helpful Concierge. I'd return in a heartbeat!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_473449611~“One of my favourite Australian hotels”~I really like this hotel - it absolutely delivers. Seems to have been recently renovated as the rooms are high quality.

It's my favourite in Brisbane and one of the better business hotels in Australia.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473059911~“Good but Pricey”~Not a 5 star hotel but nearly up there. The shower in the bathroom was at the end of bath with a grab rail to help you climb in. Not good for someone with mobility issues. Breakfast was good but at $35 was overvalued. Overall good but pricey compared to several other local hotels.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473058612~“Great location. Let's get into the 21st century! ”~Visited for a leisurely visit to Brisbane for a few days. This hotel is lovely. A great central location & the rooms, facilities and hotel general ambience are lovely. Can't complain at all about the essentials! Staff were great upon check-in and everything seemed very easy and hassle free. However, that said, it is 2017 and to not have free wifi available seems to be a bit behind the times. It really is an 'essential' for so many these days; I must admit to not even checking it as a listed facility prior to booking as thought it would be a given in such a big brand hotel for the price. 50mb a day free on the lobby is a bit of joke, it's feels like it's gone before you have even logged in! Could barely check a couple of emails before I'd maxed out my allowed usage for the day.  Appreciate the hotel is a great business spot & I'm sure all the business folk just expense the $30/day for use of the internet (a great money maker for the hotel) but I do really think this should just be included. Have stayed in similar hotels over the past 5-7 years and majoirty so far have included wifi- maybe I've just been lucky!  Just a note on the pool, visited in April. After 1.30pm- 2pm ish the pool is in the shade but a great spot in the morning to catch some rays if you wish. Didn't use the spa but the staff were very rude at one encounter in the elevator so opted out of using the services, although had planned to. shame.  All in all a great spot and would recommend. Just the wifi accessibility bug bear!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473025340~“Great service, location and facilities”~We had a QPAC show to attend and so thought staying at Sofitel would be handy given that it is in the same building as Central railway station. After having a pre-show drink in the Cuvee Bar, we decided to walk across to QPAC and it was a really enjoyable stroll. Not too far at all. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast at the hotel on the Sunday morning and a late checkout. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The high teas looked amazing and so we will definitely be back to check them out!~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_472759854~“Excellent hotel but shocking internet speeds”~We've stayed at this hotel many times over the years. It is very convenient to everything in Brisbane, beautiful views from the rooms and excellent service. However, this time I've never experienced such slow internet speeds in any hotels over the past decades. As a platinum member of Accor and staying on the executive floor I expected much better. It was so slow I finally gave up and didn't send out important emails and make necessary searches until we moved to our hotel in the Gold Coast.~4~2~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan

review_472055459~“Centrally located in Brisbane”~We stayed at the club sofitel and we found the booling eas easy. The checkin and out was very efficient. The room was clean although a bit dated and the bed was very comfortable. The service at level 30 eas great with friendly staff willing to assist. The food was limited with very little variety.

review_472012885~“Good location, great staff - well sized room”~Stayed here for three nights. Appeal was the two double beds so the kids could share a bed. Staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to help. The pool was nice and warm, but there was no bar there and to order took some time via a phone. Wifi is overpriced, as is breakfast (if you don't have it included) - but many places to eat nearby and Brisbane city has free wifi. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471990207~“Comfortable stay close to station and city services”~Business trip for a week, comfortable room, bed, shower. room service food was excellent as were the bar meals,but you paid for it. I didn't eat in the restaurant, it was just too expensive at $49 for breakfast, the good news is due to the location of this hotel, there are lots of options where you can eat, I ate at the pub down the escalator that is still part of the hotel - it was a good dinner.

review_471510928~“Comfortable stay in good location”~The Sofitel was a very good choice for our stay in Brisbane. It was pricey but we did shop around and found it on par with other similar calibre hotels in the CBD.  Parking was also pricey at $57 per day for Valet but again it was on par with other hotels and 'secure parking' facilities in the area. I checked the price with our practical Aussie friends who advised that the parking cost was not unusual and that they wouldn't recommend non secured parking. They were quite firm on that so we opted in. Service was excellent. I found the booking process at the Sofitel awkward. We actually had to phone the individual hotel with our booking request (3 in one room) since we could not do it on the website. Apparently each Sofitel is self managed and may have different rules.  We actually stayed at this particular Sofitel twice on our trip. It was comfortable but a bit dated and not as modern or as well maintained as other Sofitels I have stayed at.  The room was cleaned nicely each day but the staff seemed to have a problem leaving towels. I had to call for towels every day. One day there were none but most days they only left towels for 2, despite having booked 3 of us into the room. Each day they checked the number of folks on the booking, agreed that there were 3 of us and supplied us with the extra towels we needed - immediately. Every time they said they would make a note for housekeeping so we wouldn't have to call again... The beds in the room are comfy but some folks might find them a bit soft. There is also a pillow menu if you are so inclined. It is not worth booking / paying for breakfast in advance. There are several places in the area where you can eat breakfast more cost effectively. In fact we did not actually eat at the hotel because we found the menu prices OTT. The upside is that there are many other delicious and less expensive options in the vicinity. We met our friends in the bar a few times during our stay and we all really enjoyed the ambience and the service. Although we were staying at different hotels, the Sofitel Bar seemed to be the one we all preferred. The staff were all very helpful and made it their business to do their best for you. We did have a couple of issues during our stay but we just had to say and it was taken care of right away (even the repeated towel calls).~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_471331010~“Nice but not worth the price”~It was just an overnight/weekend stay but because it was for a special occasion, I paid quite a lot more hoping for something really special and was left a little disappointed. The hotel is lovely and the room was quite nice except for the combined bath/shower which I find a very dated concept. The issues I had was with the facilities in the room. When I arrived at the room after checking in, it was uncomfortably hot although the aircon appeared to be on. I reported this & they responded very quickly but after saying it was fine, it didn't improve and I had a very, very uncomfortable sleep. After an awfully long night, I tried to make a coffee using the pod coffee machine which didn't work. I have one at home so well aware how they work. I then went to breakfast in the executive lounge (which I'd deliberately paid more for) to find their coffee machine out of order. These issues were bad enough but as I went to check out, I expected the reception staff member to enquire about my stay and give me the opportunity to let them know but absolutely nothing. Surely in a hotel of this standard, it should be part of their checkout procedure to enquire if the guest enjoyed their stay. I guess they're not interested in feedback and improvements. Just a little disappointing for a hotel of this standard and annoying to pay so much for an average experience.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_471287910~“Strategic location and friendly staff”~Strategic location, Friendly staff, Nice room with good view.  Fee: It was reasonable value for sofitel hotel, if you booking room in here definitely recommended to included the breakfast buffet or if not the pay $39/breakfast still money value and amazing taste of food.  Parking: Hm, i booked for valet parking $57/ night but then because i was just wanting to rest and not want to looking around another parking otherwise, you could just catch public transport and park elsewhere.  On the other hand, sofitel needed little bit of maintenance otherwise is recommended definitely.. I can not wait to come back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471250768~“Uneven quality but generally ok”~My husband and I spent four nights here on holiday. The facilities are indeed five star. It a bit on the old side, so not up to the standard of other Sofitels we have stayed in. We were fortunate to be offered a room upgrade to the club floor and were perfectly satisfied with the room, although the mattress was a bit saggy. We had problems with the air con which were promptly fixed. Housekeeping was uneven, well done the first two days, then less good the next two. Otherwise we were impressed with the staff, especially the concierge and reception. We ate in the bar, which was good, but thought the buffet was poor, over priced, feeble service and some rather stale food. But there were things we wished we had known beforehand, like the fact that the hotel escalator to the station was down for repair so my disabled husband had problems getting in and out of the hotel, although when we left we were escorted down in the service lift. We aware also surprised never to be shown the bill for bar or restaurant meals and were not told until after our credit card had been charged on checkout,about the hefty card use fee. So , if access and knowing costs are important to you, ask beforehand. Otherwise it is a good, if expensive hotel and well located at a transport hub.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471214181~“THESE PEOPLE REALLY CARE”~Must admit that being a Accor Member they treat everyone on the same level. The little extra is, a letter welcomes you back a free Drinks and room upgrade. Check in was swift and service excellent. A choice of 2 Restaurants Seafood self service and Prive 249 for service. Very central hotel added bonus train station under the hotel. and 10 minutes walk to the Town Hall. Overall a great stay.~5~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_470734201~“Nice but not 5 star”~Have stayed here many times as an Accor member, mostly enjoyed our stays but not really 5 star standard. Highlight is the quality bedding and pillow menu, so comfy. No free wifi and charges are outrageous, no updated device chargers. Bathrooms are small and a little outdated, in need of upgrade.  Buffet breakfast was very nice, especially with 2 for 1 discount but I'm afraid the buffet seafood dinner is just not worth it even with card discount. Overpriced for what it is, I would not eat here at full price.  Great location above Central Station, easy walk into city for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing.  Have since cancelled membership after more than 10 years as a member, just too difficult to get a Saturday night stay at discounted price.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~3~nan
review_469949524~“Fantastic hotel - good value”~Stayed overnight for a conference and the rooms were great. Exceptionally clean , spacious and well maintained. The comfiest bed in the world with a 'pillow menu' is a nice touch. Room service menu is pricey ($33 for chicken Caesar salad!) but hotel location is close enough to other eateries to dine at. Front desk mistakenly called our room early morning and when manager was advised at checkout they gave us a credit which was great customer service. Hotel doesn't have prominently displayed signage at front of hotel so if new to Brisbane it's on the left opposite the well advertised car park! Blink and you'll drive right past it! Nice stay...will definitely come again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469939143~“Great location. Comfortable hote.”~This is the second time in quite a few years that I have stayed at the Sofitel. It has been upgraded a little since then. I remember that the sleep quality wasn't great last time but this time I had no problems - apart from noisy neighbours coming back from an in-house conference and having loud conversations in the hallway. The rooms aren't huge but they're comfortable. Checkin was busy but quite friendly. They do try to upsell so be cautious. Their AccorPlus was the target of choice when I was there so only sign up if you're sure you'll use it. I signed up and was assured I would receive a discount in the restaurant but that didn't happen and it wasn't cheap. It's right on central station so if you're flying in, take the train for $14 and walk up the escalator (hopefully it will be fixed by then) Busy in the bar and I had to lineup for breakfast; probably because of the conference going on. Be prepared for a wait. Bar staff are (sort of) friendly.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_469751790~“Not a five star hotel”~I'm really not sure how this could be considered a five star hotel. While it is clean and well located the rooms and bathrooms are small and dingy. The whole hotel is dated and in need of a refurb. The worst part is that you have to pay for wifi. The breakfast is very overpriced.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_469238602~“Are we still paying for internet?”~Room was nice and comfortable. Bathroom was okay, if not a little dated. I am still surprised that there was a charge for the internet, and I found it expensive.  Breakfast buffet was quite good.  Location is great - right on top of Central Station making transport to/from the airport really simple.~3~3~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_469219123~“ANOTHER GREAT STAY - THANK YOU SOFITEL”~We always have amazing service at this Brisbane Sofitel and this time was no different - The staff are so friendly. Thank you Zoe for the late check out option - this help us with our travel plans - Highly recommend this central hotel to everyone - so close to the mall & restaurants~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_469211301~“Good location for quick visit”~It was a quick business visit and I can't really remember too much about the place. The bar staff were friendly the foyer decor was a little jumbled and the rooms were generally clean and comfortable.  The only exception being one of my room cushions had a foul odour.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469164099~“Wifi - SLOW”~Room is nice, staff are great, functional gym and restaurant was lovely. Only complaint is wifi - cost is outrageous, and the speed is dismal. It took me 20 minutes for this to post...:) Overall I would have rated it a 5 if wifi wasn't such an issue. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468981987~“Celebration Lunch”~We recently visited the Sofitel and had lunch at their Thyme restaurant. It was a special occasion and we had the smorgasbord. We weren't told of any other option as our waitress left us quickly after showing us to our table and didn't return. The lunch which included prawns & oyster option was enjoyable but could have been better in a few areas - which we have advised Sofitel. This is a great hotel with a lovely well designed foyer and bar/ dining area.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~3~nan
review_468964146~“My Dream Brisbane Address!”~The Sofitel is my dream address in Brisbane and I stay here whenever I am in this city. The location couldn't get any better, it's directly above Central Station in the very centre of town, within a short walk of great shopping and just 28 minutes to the airport by train. The spacious hotel lobby is dimly lit and exudes a sultry, stylish atmosphere. Check-in is usually brisk and if you need a refreshment before ascending to your room, the Cuvee bar serves great coffee along with any other drink imaginable. My preferred room is #2817 for a magnificent view over Anzac Square and the city. The bed (featuring the Sofitel Mybed") is a luxury so divine that I have been inspired to buy the same feather topper for my own mattress at home. When I travel solo, I enjoy dining in the family restaurant Thyme2, there's always an energetic buzz here and the a la carte menu is interesting. I'm not a fan of buffets, but clearly the Brisbane Sofitel lunch and dinner buffets are popular and good value. The rooftop pool is quite small but a wonderful treat after shopping downtown on a hot day. There's a definite lack of shade around the pool (in my opinion there are not enough sun umbrellas) so it's important to bring a wide-brimmed hat. I've had the joy of a massage and pedicure in Stephanie's spa and loved every delicious moment, including the refreshing chilled raspberry-leaf tea on offer that day. Overall, I rate this hotel very highly and always look forward to my next visit.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_468460582~“Weekend away”~Great motel, staff were excellent, club room was really nice, rooms are exceptionally clean, house maids were always there to clean and straighten your room after you went out, very central to all Brisbane city shops and clubs. Excellent stay recommend to all.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468384693~“Getting a bit old”~The hotel is nice and in a very good location. It is close to the Queen Street mall and station. Like any other big hotel chain, the space and the rooms are getting a bit old and aged. it is still clean, but furniture and the design are dated. Staff were friendly. It is disappointing that internet is not free!! Now days, even the buses have free wifi in certain cities. It is crazy that they charge for internet still. Most hotel included free wifi and it is expected. Like being in a big hotel, you can hear everyone's showers and people walked pass the hallway.  Overall, a pleasure stay, but will not be my top choice.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~3~nan
review_468289937~“Ok once past the smell”~Smells like an old grandmas house, just a weird old person smell. Lobby and staff great and the bar was very good. Breakfast also pretty good.

review_467987865~“Comfortable and well located ”~The Sofitel Brisbane is well located directly above the Central train station, making access particularly on the Airtrain from Brisbane Airport, really easy. It is also right in the centre of the city, so everything is right out side your door.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and wifi is fast.  The breakfast is also very good and the restaurant quite nice.  Overall this is a good hotel, in a great location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467960538~“Luxurious stay in the city!”~My daughter and I flew to Broabane for the Adele concert. We spoiled ourselves by staying at the Sofitel. The room was very plush and comfortable.

review_467953392~“Sofitel Getaway”~My husband and I try to have a couple of days in hiding at the Sofitel. We get away from work and family and enjoy each others company. We particularly liked the chef in attendance at all times in the club lounge, where the staff are always very accommodating.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_467684309~“Beautiful High Tea in The Club Lounge”~Lovely experience with great views upstairs in the Club Lounge. Would definitely recommend choosing this location for a more intimate & quieter experience than the downstairs location. The staff said it was a good place for groups as downstairs can get rather hectic. The desserts were exquisite to look at & eat, although we were feeling thoroughly 'sweeted out' at the end of it. A little too rich compared to other High Tea experiences. The mango mousse dome was absolutely beautiful & the highlight of the desserts for both my husband & I. We would go back just to have one of those again. Staff were pleasant & attentive. Overall a very good experience.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_467665950~“Very satisfying stay”~Stayed the night for a work function last Saturday night.

review_467619799~“Birthday Breakfast”~A little expensive for what you get but a smorgasbord can be like that. Toast was nearly impossible to make as only had domestic toasters.Hot Food Selection was minimal. Dining Room was pleasant and service was great,~4~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467547539~“Excellent stay.”~The location of this hotel is excellent. Within five minutes of stepping off the airport train you are checking in at reception. We bought our train tickets on line. Not only did it save time but was actually cheaper. My husband being an Accor Platinum member we were allocated an upgraded room with lounge access. Beautiful room and bathroom. As always in Sofitel a super comfortable bed and pillows - just what one needs after a very long flight. The lounge was very good and the staff very attentive. It has lovely city views and is a great place to relax with a coffee after a long day sightseeing. Evening drinks and canapés were excellent as was the breakfast. Lovely pool area. Very comfortable short stay.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_467434703~“Two night stay ”~Staff were amazing, location is perfect with train station below and city shopping and lots of good eating not to far away at eagle street pier. Comfortable and good size rooms. Nothing was too much trouble. Had a look at buffet on site and food looked AMAZING especially the dessert including the chocolate fondue fountain. Would stay here again in a heart beat.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467073813~“Amazing beds, great views and easy to get to from the airport”~Stay here with my mum for 1 night as we wanted to be in the heart of Brisbane CBD. Easy to get to from the airport as you can get a train to central and go up a few escalators and into reception. Staff helpful and friendly, the rooms are amazing with the most comfortable beds ever.  Only bad things are room key cards are temperamental. you have to avoid putting them next to your phone which is hard if you only have a small clutch bag on a night out.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466867601~“Easy option Brisbane - but no free wifi”~The location of the hotel is a drawcard. It is above Central train station so easy access from Brisbane airport via the well serviced train. It is an easy stroll to the shopping areas of Brisbane and a short walk to the Convention centre and other attractions on the Southbank. The spa is superb and a must if you have time. The pool area is very nice. Staff are helpful and friendly. Beware though no free wifi - really Sofitel! and the charge for in house movies is high.~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan

review_466632850~“Great hotel in Brisbane”~Just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as an Accor Platinum member. Received upgrade to a luxury room which was good as was access to their Club Lounge. This is the third Sofitel I have stayed at recently and Brisbane's Club Lounge is on par with Melbourne's and better than the one in Bali - Nusa Dua. Breakfast had plenty of choices and drinks and canape's at night where of a high standard. Hotel is in a good location for walking around Brisbane CBD and easily got to on the airport train as it is above Central Station. All staff I encounted were good and I would be happy to stay here again if visiting Brisbane.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466425321~“Great location ”~We only had 1 night in Brisbane and stayed here at the Sofitel hotel, it was the best sleep we had as the beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable. We went out for dinner with friends by the riverside which is quite a walk from the hotel but lovely at the same time to be able to see lots of Brisbane city. Had an amazing view from our room as we were on a high floor. Staff very helpful & nothing too much trouble. We arrived by plane then train which took us right to the Sofitel hotel so not much walking involved as the escalator from the train station platform goes up into the hotel lobby area.  Can't wait to stay at another Sofitel.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466262566~“Never disappoints ”~I have stayed at the Sofitel on 3 seperate occasions & it is always consistent it it's service.  Clean, professional with a great variety of dining options. The breakfasts are amazing, huge selection well cooked & beautifully presented.  Buzzing bar area for pre dinner drinks.  Rooms are a comfortable size, luxury linens & well stocked. Comfortable bedding & super clean.  Well located Hotel, not the cheapest but you know that when choosing the Sofitel.  I have stayed here around Christmas time & the decorations were beautiful.  Next time I am eager to spend some time in the Day Spa!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466123141~“Luxury but expensive extras”~Although the room price was reasonable, the add-ons that are unavoidable were extortionate. Parking $47 and breakfast $40+ which you have to take when you are on a tight program were just daylight robbery. I got a bundle price for the two of $70 but even so that is still steep. The hotel and rooms were excellent and very luxurious. No complaints there.~4~3~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_465972863~“Superb service from every staff member”~From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, every single staff member we encountered were superb. I'm not sure what kind of training they do there but it's certainly working.  The views from our room were spectacular and the bed was the perfect mix of soft and firm. We always ask for a room furthest away from the elevator to avoid any unnecessary noise and am pleased to report we didn't hear anything to disturb us. We paid $100 each for the Club and went up to enjoy evening canapes and drinks and there was a good selection available and the views up there were spectacular - particularly the darker it got. I couldn't help but feel though that many of the people there may have not been aware of the dress code - it was quite disappointing to see people slobbing around in jeans, singlets, shorts and thongs - something which you'd never see in airline lounges. In hindsight we probably wouldn't go back in there for that reason. It was an easy walk to central Brisbane so well located.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_465745840~“Great service”~This hotel and the service never disappoints me. Everyone was so helpful .

review_465346706~“Good location, but expensive extras”~So, to me as a business traveler, in this day an age chargeable Wi-Wi really isn't acceptable, especially when it's as slow as the service here (think dial up). Rooms of. Bed comfy. Central location, rail / metro station very close Breakfast buffet at $40 is far from a bargain. Lots of cafes near by do great breakfast for half the price with free, fairly speedy wi-fi.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465235648~“Five star hotel with one star internet”~The Brisbane Sofitel is one of the best hotels in Australia. Wins hands down for location and ease of access; top floor well equipped gym with fabulous view -- which you will need after eating at the exceptional buffet they put on for each meal. They should be embarrassed however by the internet. They proudly offer guests 'free wifi' -- via a hopeless 512kb connection (that's like a 20th century speed) -- OR you can purchase one day for $30 high speed limited to 500Mb. I do constant video calls which use up to 1Gb an hour -- and in Asia and most of the world this is completely free, completely reliable, and very high speed. Sofitel would be wiser not to give away free internet when its like a free 1980s mobile phone -- no use to anyone~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_464963414~“A great place to stay if you don't need access to the internet”~If you're not here on business, and don't need internet access, then this is a really nice hotel to stay in, but we've been here for a week now and have struggled daily to receive and send emails. So probably wouldn't stay here again.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_464893940~“Attention to detail lacking/overpriced food and beverage and wifi”~The good - most of the staff are friendly, the beds are comfortable and the location is good.  The bad - 29.50 per day for wifi is outrageous as is the $33 sandwich if ordered by the pool.  Whilst the pool area is not staffed I would recommend an hourly check of the area on a busy weekend. When we went down to the pool there was no towels, the bin of used towels was overflowing to the floor and used towels and drink bottles littered the pool area...not good.  There was no pen or paper in the room. The hairdryer had a piece missing at the back and my hair got caught, when the room was cleaned houskeeping forgot the bathmat. For the two days we were there the escalator that leads down to the train station was not working which was very inconvenient for guests accessing the station wih suitcases.  These seem small issues but togethet they were annoying. I would choose another hotel next time I'm in Brisbane.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464880883~“Must stay”~From moment you walk in its friendly,helpful the staff can't do enough for you. The rooms ar fabulous,clean and comfortable.

The menu and food selection, even in the foyer, was of a high standard.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463134117~“Pleasant and relaxing stay with a few irritating lapses”~We stayed for two nights in a standard room. Check in was a breeze, and the bed was just about the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. The room was clean and tidy and comfortable but some of the dark wood furnishings are looking a bit tired. It was annoying not to have a pen and notepaper provided in the room, and having to have the room yes reprogrammed several times was a real pest. Surely there is better technology than this. The major disappointment however was breakfast time. We ate there on Saturday morning and the place was full. We found the tables were so close together that it was very difficult to get around the room, and the table staff seemed a bit thin on the ground. The next morning we were shocked to find that there was a queue more than 20 people deep snaking all the way to the lifts at 9 on Sunday morning. I expect that a 5 star hotel would be designed so as to be able to cater for the likely demands of guests at major meal times. More like McDonalds than exclusive accommodation. We left and found a cafe on Sunday morning after the queue was not moving after 10 minutes.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462890780~“Junior King Suite a huge hit!”~We stayed in the club junior king suite which was just awesome! Huge room with a separate lounge, bedroom and bathroom. The bed was very large and super comfy and different types of pillows were made available through a pillow menu - very lush! The bathroom was just massive with a separate shower and bath tub. The cleanliness of the room was superb and what hit us when we first arrived was the sheer size of the room. Whilst the hotel is older it doesn't look at all dated or tired but looks chic and elegant. Absolutely loved the size of the bathroom - just massive in comparison to other suites. Whilst on the more expensive side this hotel is one to rival other in terms of service - nothing was too much trouble for all the staff we came across - Javier, Mauro at Thyme Restaurant, the cleaning staff and the ambassadors at concierge - all friendly, welcoming, immaculately dressed and delivering high quality service. A nespresso machine was in the room and water was provided at bed time for us to consume. The pool is on the 3rd floor and towels are provided on arrival. Very close to the city and below down a few escalators is the train station - very handy indeed to the Queen Street mall and shopping and restaurants.  We had some trouble with the keys accessing the Club lounge for breakfast but this wasn't a huge issue - went downstairs and it was changed first time. With the club rooms I would say Wi-Fi should be complimentary but alas it wasn't - something perhaps for the hotel to consider!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_462831714~“Delightful Stay”~My husband and I recently stayed for 7 nights and was delighted with this motel. The staff were delighted and nothing was to much effort.

The facilities are modern, always very clean - and the beds and pillows - they are more comfortable than my own - guarunteed great night's sleep!! Business, Pleasure, Medical, Family (we have stayed several now times with our infant) - this hotel almost feels like home...

review_462381820~“Good but marred by frustrating annoyances...”~Returned after a couple of years..... stay was good overall but some irritating frustrations. Card reader in lifts and rooms failed 7 times in a two day stay. Had expensive club room option and expected better really..... frequently exited floor thirty to travel 3 floors down and the card reader failed.... had to go up and down in the lift, recut keys each time and wasted 15 mins each morning while trying to get to my room, just added unnecessary annoyance. I usually stay at the 'Next' hotel in Brisbane... they offer high tech rooms, working lifts/room keys/FREE super fast wifi/free minibar and free movies. Guess where I'll be staying next time.  Sofitel charge a ridiculous $29 per 24 hours for in room wifi, even in club floors. I pay $59 per month at home. Australian hotels are so backwards charging for wifi in 2017 and I'm not surprised tourism numbers are reducing here... one feels fleeced at hotels like this. The experience was lacking in comparison to my last visit....expensive wifi, no notepad and pen in room ( presumably a cost save) and just lacking the wow factor it once did here. Indifferent.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462344162~“Great convenient location”~I flew into Brisbane airport last Monday and caught the train from Domestic to Central station, then up a couple of flights of stairs and into the hotel, just so easy. My 3 night stay was most enjoyable, the room on the 19th level was spotless with a choice of pillows and the aircon was very easy to set to my required temperature. The buffet breakfast had a wide choice, loved the pastries and the cooked to order omelette by the friendly chefs, also excellent cappo first up. Would I stay again , most definitely.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
