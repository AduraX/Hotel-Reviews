review_472051419~“Overnighter”~I stayed at the Airport Inn Heritage for one night,It is very close to the Brisbane Airports and just down the road from the Cruise Ship Terminal. Plenty of places to dine at Portside. Dinner was lovely in the restaurant with a lovely chef and helpful waitress. I had room service breakfast and it was a good size continental selection. Would stay again!~4~nan~5~3~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471268040~“This place is shady...”~I have just spent one night at the Quality Inn Airport Heritage and it was terrible. First of all, if you are planning to arrive in the evening, BEWARE! My flight arrived at around 945pm so it was well after 10pm by the time I arrived at the hotel. Taxi dropped me off and drove away and there I was standing alone out front of the hotel with no transportation and a hotel that was CLOSED! There is even a sign in the window saying reception closes at 8pm!! I called the phone number on the sign and after giving my credit card details to someone over the phone they gave me the code for the safe next to the door and inside the safe was the key to my room and instructions on how to get there. You walk around the back of the hotel where an open door leads into the corridor of rooms. I found it very bizarre that reception is locked up but the door that leads to the hallway from which the rooms are accessed is wide open and unlocked, held open by a door stop.  The room was simply OK but I was disgusted when I lifted the toilet seat in the bathroom to discover that the toilet had not been cleaned.  Also, I arrived after a long day of travel and was hoping I could get something to eat when I arrived at the hotel. Well, that was a bad assumption on my part. There is a vending machine in reception which, again, was locked for the night.  I have gone back through my booking confirmation email and cannot find anywhere where it warns guests that the place is basically closed after 8pm and there will be no services provided. As if all of this wasn't bizarre and weird enough for an airport hotel near one of the busiest airports in Australia, perhaps the creepiest part of all is that during the entire time I was at the hotel (which was from about just after 10pm until 9am the next morning) I didn't see or hear a soul. Not one other person in sight. No lights on in any of the room windows, nothing. Nobody on premises or even walking down the corridor. It was extremely creepy. It was like the Australian version of "American Horror Story: Hotel". Definitely would not be going back.~2~nan~nan~3~2~nan~1~nan
review_467952693~“Good value”~I've stayed a couple of times and good value for money. Very comfortable room and true to its rating. Very friendly staff and in a good location near Portside and racecourse rd precincts for cafes and restaurants. Only negative is paying for Wifi. Tiny remote cafes in Vietnam or hotels have free wifi. Maybe something to look at! Otherwise great!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465674410~“very comfortable”~We stayed here as it was close to the overseas ferry terminal just a short walk down the road. The shopping centre at the dock is lovely we ate down there & would stay there again, the room was very comfortable & the breakfast in the restaurant was great~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_464590719~“Close to airport”~We had a comfortable one-night stay here before departing from the airport, which is quite close. We used Conexions which collects from the bus stop 28 outside when you book. Probably would use Uber with hindsight another time as cheaper. The hotel is basic but clean, and the reception staff are welcoming and helpful. We found the bed to be a little firm but still comfortable. The road outside is very busy but the double glazing is amazingly effective at keeping out noise. There are a few restaurants at Portside Wharf, about five minutes walk away. Otherwise, there is very little else here.~3~nan~3~3~nan~nan~4~nan
review_463321854~“Handy Location For Cruise Departures”~Six of us stayed here overnight prior to leaving on our cruise. We booked this place after reading favourable reviews on Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed. We had three first floor rooms up on the first floor, right at the front of the motel fronting Kingsford Smith Drive, where we thought the road noise might be a concern. Because the doors and windows onto the balcony are double-glazed, there is absolutely no road noise whatsoever and everyone enjoyed a lovely nights sleep. We were all pleasantly surprised with our rooms, which had recently been refurbished, Jay at Reception was very friendly and welcoming. We had travelled all day by car and needed to walk so we wandered down to the Hamilton Hotel for dinner which was great. The motel does also have it's own restaurant but we didn't go there because we all wanted to walk for a while. We also chose this property because they offer undercover parking for $5.00 per day so we were able to leave our cars there for the two weeks we were away. The cruise ship terminal is a very easy walk, but because we all had so much luggage, we ordered a maxi taxi, which cost around $20.00 - great value! My only comment is that this motel doesn't offer a shuttle service to and from the cruise ship terminal, which we noticed a few other motels along Kingsford Smith Drive do, but for us it really wasn't an issue. We would certainly stay here again, because of the convenient location. The beds were really comfortable, and the staff were all really friendly and helpful~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_460762262~“What a surprise”~I had no huge expectations on this property based on the price and the location, but what a surprise. The room I got, (#1) was newly redecorated with nice furniture's and what a space... the room was large. Very nice bathroom. The only thing I missed was a shelf in the shower for the shampoo bottle, but that is just a small remark on a great small hotel. Staff was friendly and the Wi-Fi signal fairly strong. Wi-Fi was included in the price. I did not utilize the restaurant for dinner, but I had breakfast in the morning before I was of to the airport. By the way, the airport is less than 10 minutes away. I had an omelette for breakfast which was not as good as I thought.... Otherwise, I good hotel for a very good price. If you are going on a cruise from Brisbane, this hotel is located just a few hundreds meter away from the cruise terminal.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_440166421~“Surprisingly good”~If you judged the hotel by it's surroundings, you miss out on staying in this nice little motel. The room was very comfortable, the motel is about a ten minute walk to shops , which I like. But the real selling point for me was breakfast, it was really magnificent - cooked to order, and the ingredients used you could tell were really good quality. The chef was really good. Surprised about the comments of "don't bother staying" - they clearly did not ask - there are a large range of cafes etc within 10 minutes walk.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_426775633~“So so....”~Provided you do not arrive after 8:00pm and need a meal or feel like a beer then the location is great (10 minutes to the airport) and the rooms are spacious and reasonably clean. Paper thin walls do mean you hear all activity next door. Breakfast is just superb and well-priced for a BIG and very hot start to your day. Receptionist on duty was fabulous - helpful and welcoming with a big smile - lovely lady. Parking is very good, the pool certainly needs a clean - Overall OK.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~4~nan
review_425791932~“Muddy fun”~Visited whilst attending Miss Muddy event within easy access to racehorse and short walk to Eat Street markets. Unfortunately sofa bed was broken but spacious apartment with own balcony big enough for friends sharing.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_424227233~“Don't bother staying”~Stayed for 1 night pre cruise. This motel has no restaurant, room service or breakfast on weekends. Had to wander the streets to find dinner after checking in from a delayed flight. No hair dryer in room & a mouldy stained bath. Bed & pillows were like concrete. Housekeeping walked in at 9am without even knocking & no apology. Apart from being close to cruise terminal there is nothing going for this place.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_423042666~“Not a Quality Room”~Wow, not ever seen a branded hotel have a bathroom in such disrepair. The room was good apart from cobwebs but the bathroom wow, really bad. Also cannot use the balcony as the window is sealed closed????? Not impressed, stayed in much better accommodation for the same price.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_417271217~“average is the perfect word.”~I stayed here for an overnight with work. it was average to say the least beds are uncomfortable, barely any hot water. Had to wait to get checked in because receptions main issues was arguing on the phone with someone rather than providing service to their customers. Ordered room service breakfast with was ok but they had no maple syrup for the pancakes and rather than walk across the road to Woolworths and get some they just gave them to me without any & then didn't offer anything to replace it or a discount. You would stay here for the location & the proximity to the airport but there are other hotels on the same strip that would offer better quality for the same price.~3~nan~nan~nan~2~3~2~nan
review_416317029~“Lack of attention to detail”~Stayed here for one night prior to going to the airport. Had a nicely refurbished room but the details lacked. No hairdryer (because people take them was the reason given) no teaspoons for the coffee cups, international roast coffee and only white sugar. May seem petty but at over )150pn it's an expectation. The shower was new but the water pressure was miserable so you had to stand near the back of the shower to get the water, your bum then repeatedly pressed in the tap to turn off the shower. A number of others in the party had no hot water in their rooms! Rooms at the front were very noisy due to traffic all night and noisy hotel guests. Overall I'd rather spend more and stay at a better hotel.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_414730397~“Do not stay”~We recently stayed at this hotel. The room was ok had a massive hole above the shower and beds not comfortable at all but ok for 1 night. We accidently left a very valuable item behind and we knew the exact location of the item. We realised approx 3 hours after  vacating the room that we had left the item we called immediately the person on the phone said that they checked the room and it wasn't there we ask if the could speak to the cleaners to be told that she had finished for the day and would be back in tomorrow and she would ask them despite several phone calls that afternoon they would not do anymore until the cleaner came back the next day. My mother inlaw called the next day and everyday for the next 3 , I facebook messaged as well as emailed and they maintain that they don't have it and suggested to my mother in law that it was probably in our suit case. I strongly believe the actions of the staff member on the first day prevented this item being located as she was just pushing it off to the next day therefore not checking laundry, bins etc. This item can not be replaced we realise that it was our fault we left it behind but the actions of the staff prevented it from ever being located.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_412934643~“Good location in proximity to river and airport”~Very friendly owners who will accommodate all your needs to make your stay comfortable. On site restaurant was top class. Brilliant food and most excellent quantities and all reasonably priced. The location to the Brisbane river and Portside Harbour shops and eateries was fabulous.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_412141134~“Very Happy.”~Booked a Deluxe Suite at the rear of hotel and the room was recently rennovated as are the others , ongoing , it was clean ,very quite , great bath ,had a kitchenette with microwave and utensils, fridge , with a very comfortable king bed and a single.The staff at reception was helpful and booked a very reliable and friendly taxi for an early morninglift to the airport. We were very impressed that we were allowed an early check in which is a great bonus for an Airport Hotel ...Thanks.....Suggest a trip to the local hardware and purchase Bath Plugs that fit .Wifi is now free and good .I think some of the previous reviews are a bit unfair, as a very frequent traveller a lot of the issues are minimal in the overall picture .~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_397305167~“Good for a stopover”~We stayed here overnight on our way to and from an overseas trip.  We chose the hotel due to its proximity to the airport, which was about 15 min away by car.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  We decided not to eat in the restaurant as it was quite pricey for a fairly basic menu, but there were a couple of other restaurants not too far away.  The room was spacious enough for a family of four and was very clean on our first night. It wasn't quite as good for the return stay, but it was still fine.  We'd definitely consider staying here again next time we travel overseas from Brisbane.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384780239~“Never agaib”~I have stayed here on several occasions over the last few months for work. The first time, was good bc they accidentally put us in the wrong (but nicer) room. Second time was disgusting, my friend went to get a blanket out of the cupboard during the night bc he was cold and wrapped inside the blanket was a large, 1 litre opened bottle of greasy baby oil. As I was staying 2 nights, I complained and they upgraded me. The next time my air conditioner didn't work and it was Revoltingly stuffy and like sleeping in a cupboard the room was so small. My latest and last experience, I booked the 2 bedroom apartment, and certainley not cheap at $270. When I arrived I was told I had been upgraded to 'the penthouse'. Ha! When I got to the room, it was smaller than the usual 2 bedroom apartment and the balcony was enclosed (I am a smoker so this was of no use to me) I asked to be changed to a room that I had originally booked. I went to my new room, only to find all the beds dirty and unmade, rubbish everywhere and dishes in the sink. I went back to reception to tell them and was given a different room. The second bedroom, which I had specifically booked for was locked and there was much tooing and froing to get it unlocked. I then received a call from reception saying that the closet in the second bedroom could not be unlocked as it has some of the owners possessions in there. Not to mention the light bulb had also gone out. So for $270... wow. No offer of compensation or reduced rate with all their stuffing around.  Never again will I stay here. Plenty of other accommodation in the area. Ended up in a room facing onto the fluorescent light carpark.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_376580622~“Old dirty and rude”~Stay away from this hotel its sooo overpriced for the quality of the room. Filthy linen, dirty mugs on the sink, dusty room.

review_374981703~“Great value for a stop over near the airport.”~We were flying overseas and had to catch an early morning flight so this was ideal for us. On arrival we were told that the family room we'd booked was unavailable due to flooding, however we were given two seperate rooms ( son is 15) and this worked fine for us. Rooms were very comfortable and clean and we would stay here again.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan

One comment inventory on cutlery, I desert spoon, 3 forks, come on housekeeping. A few comments on long walk to restaurants etc. wrong, its 500m to the port cruise terminal with an IGA, many shops and many restaurants, Italian, Indian, Chinese, American, Subway and others.

review_369177286~“Good short stay”~This place was exactly what we needed for a couple of nights stay. Close proximity to the airport and eat street markets which was fantastic. Lots of car spaces. The room had a couch, chairs and table, bed, clothes cupboard, bedside tables, TV cabinet and under that a small bar fridge. The room still had a lot of space even with all the furniture. The bathroom sink was modern compared to the shower over bath set up. Very quiet area considering the traffic and location. Free to call a taxi in reception and there's a vending machine there too. Will stay here again. Didn't use the pool or restaurant so unable to comment on these. Staff were nice.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_368928013~“Last minute booking - one night ”~Booked here at the last minute due to flight delays. We did select this establishment as said 24 hour reception, however this was via phone not in person and had to get keys from safe and locate our room ourselves. We arrived at 1am and left at 930am so really just needed a bed and shower and both were fine. Room was recently renovated and was really clean and bathroom was lovely. There was no full length mirror (my pet hate) and no mirror for short sighted people (could not see properly in bathroom mirror due to sink location) - the bed was a little hard. Close to airport and short stroll to riverfront restaurants - fine for overnight stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_362658473~“Average comfort”~Lovely spacious room, a far walk to get dinner, very disappointing that the restraurant was closed every weekend. A table and chairs would do wonders in this room to add more comfort for the guest. Our A/C was loud and didn't work properly~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~5~nan
review_362462166~“Small motel type”~Stayed here overnight.Reception staff very friendly and helpful.

review_358299205~“Good Workers Hotel Close to the Airport”~The hotel is good and basic, fine for workers. The staff were friendly, and efficient, and answered my questions easily about the area. It was a nice touch to offer to make my taxi booking and wake up call for the morning. The only downside for me is that the whole place is dated and tired looking, and it was quite possibly the worst mattress I have ever slept on, the pillows are not much better.~3~3~nan~2~nan~nan~5~nan

review_343172491~“"Worst hotel management experience ever"”~In June 2014 my company used this hotel for 3 staff who were traveling together on a business trip. Our company hasn't used the hotel since, and after our recent experience, never will again!!  While balancing our corporate credit card in Jan 2016, it was discovered that the hotel had processed a payment in Dec 2015 which was never authorized!  With further investigation we discovered that one of the employees who stayed at the hotel back in 2014 stayed again at the hotel in Dec 2015 and had left without paying. The hotel then retrieved our credit card from "the file" and processed the payment without even a courtesy call. The problem occurred at this point because this person was no longer an employee of our company and in fact had left over 18 months ago. I notified the hotel of the error expecting a quick "sorry" for the mix up and a refund. Instead over the next week I experienced the rudest hotel management staff ever!!! The day manager (Jade or Jane) refused to return the money until she was able to find who should pay the bill, even though I gave her the details of the person's new employer, and she didn't even have authority to use our credit card for the transaction!!  I called the hotel again a couple of days later, as it was clear a refund had not been processed to our credit card and I wanted it sorted out. Jade answered the phone again and became very rude and hostile stating that I was no longer being "nice" and that this would not help my situation. I was flabbergasted!!  After the unsuccessful phone calls to receive the refund, I informed her that it appeared I had no choice but to call the bank and report the unauthorized activity on the card - only then was the money refunded!!  This hotel management was rude and condescending to say the least. I will not be using them ever again!!!~2~nan~nan~3~nan~3~1~nan
review_336238582~“Very convenient hotel motel.”~Stopped here one night after missing my initial flight.  Location: I booked this hotel due to it being nearby the airport, which took around 15 minutes in a taxi. I didn't explore the local area, but it also seemed to be rather close to Brisbane City itself.  Room: Quite an average en-suite double room, although the balcony was a nice addition I didn't really expect. Bed was comfy, from what I remember. Nothing special, but perfect for a short stay.  Facilities: I ordered room service in the evening, which was much better than I had expected. Also liked the fact that vending machines are downstairs. Was quite disappointed that the WiFi was restricted usage, so had to purchase more a few times. Staff member was kind enough to order me a taxi for my ride back to the airport the following morning.  All in all, a good stay. Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed.~5~nan~nan~nan~4~3~5~nan
review_333395198~“OK motel”~Stayed the one night after flying in from Hong Kong.  Reception was not open at 1 am but they have a system where you make a phone call and pick up the room key from a lock box outside reception. Seemed to work OK for us. The room faced busy road but the noise was not a problem as the windows are double glazed. Rooms are not large but are comfortable and have had some recent quite tasteful redecoration.  This is an OK motel if your travelling on the cruise ships that tie up just a few hundred metres away or flying, the airport is about 10 minutes away by cab. All in all a motel that serves it's purpose and is reasonably priced.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_332763226~“Convenient, strange bathroom facilities, no hand basin plug”~I have stayed here a number of times before over the years when having to overnight between international and domestic flights. It has its faults but is convenient for the airport and within very easy walking distance of a supermarket and eating places - just ask the receptionist for directions. It is certainly better than other motels I have tried in the vicinity of the airport. On weekdays one can arrange for a cheap shuttle bus service to the airport. On weekends they will book a taxi for you. The receptionist was friendly and helpful. There is no one on duty at the reception desk early in the morning. Four thin pillows were provided on the bed. One pillow was far too thin for me and two together too high and far too hard. Two thin pillows and two thicker pillows would seem to be a good solution to cater for different preferences.  The bathroom was the weirdest aspect of the room. It had obviously been done up in the last few years but renovated to look trendy rather than being renovated for function. The hand basin was large and very shallow. The fancy integral basin plug had broken and no other basin plug provided. There was a clear glass window in the wall between the bathroom and the room - why someone would want to watch me sitting on the toilet or showering I just don't know. The microwave was very handy as I was able to heat food purchased from the nearby IGA supermarket. Overall, a convenient place to stay for the airport.~3~nan~4~2~nan~nan~4~nan
review_331125107~“Old fashioned”~The hotel looks old and the design is a bit odd with a maze of long corridors. The menu was poor and the quality of the food very average like the rest of the features of that motel. I had to get in the kitchen to find someone available for the morning breakfast which was average low. The bathtub was not cleaned and the aircon noisy. I would not recommend this one.~2~nan~2~2~nan~nan~2~nan

review_297846640~“Perfect but noisey”~Its a shame to give 3 stars as the apartment we had was perfect for 2 couples or a family to satay overnight or longer. The room was great , 2 bedrooms,both with bathroom, good kitchen, and living area, so all round very good.  However the apartment we had was right on a very busy road and was busy all night, getting very busy around 6.00am, made comment to the manager and he recommended asking for a room at the back of the motel. if this eliminates noise, this would be a great place to stay. 500m to the cruise terminal , plenty of choice of places to eat and drink and shop~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_297680503~“Very helpful”~I don't know if this will qualify as a review because I didn't stay there, but I think mention needs to be made of our experience. I was staying somewhere nearby where staff appeared to know nothing about nearby places to eat. Went for a walk and called into reception here. Marty was on the front desk and went out if his way to help us. Made phone call to restaurant/club and gathered lots of information when he looked on Internet. Thank you Marty for your friendly help yesterday.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_295265061~“Just not worth the money.”~Stayed having arrived on a late flight from Brisbane. Our Travel Agent had said it was a long drive into Brisbane from the airport and this was a nice, close hotel. It was very functional, but a 10 minute cab ride, the driver said it was only a 10-15 minute journey into the city at that time of night.  Our room was spacious, and the shower was excellent. Unfortunately the walls and carpet were dirty and the feel of the place was run-down. Would have been worth it at $80-100, not the $170 we paid.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_290276104~“Would stay there again”~Clean, quiet and comfortable. What more could you ask for? Getting to and from airport isn't easy though, $30 cab ride pretty much the only option. Other than that it was great.  The pool looked nice but being 10 degrees we weren't going to try it!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_286164579~“Functional & comfortable”~Not my normal choice of hotel in Brisbane but chosen for proximity. Would I stay again? Probably not, for the same money I would probably stay up the road at the Kingsford .. More modern (albeit smaller). Plus.. Close to racecourse road and Portside for dinners / great coffee. Easy to get a cab. Comfy beds. The biggest downside - the walls are paper thin. Probably one of the worst for being disturbed by others.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_274940008~“A bit tired.”~This hotel is in a perfect location between the airport and city. Check in was easy however my request to have sofa bed made up was not received and we had to wait a few minutes for this. Room was a good size, very clean, but it is a little tired and had a musty odour. Shower was terrific. The room was supposed to have a mini-bar but there was none. No breakfast on weekends!!! How utterly ridiculous! The pool was filthy and unusable. The exterior could do with a paint and the hallways and room doors as well.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~4~nan
