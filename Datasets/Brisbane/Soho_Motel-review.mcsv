review_471294015~“Meh”~Stayed here for one night with a friend as we were going out in the valley. My other friend got a really nice modern place for $10 more :/ Pros:  Comfy bed and pillows Clean Fridge Air-conditioned Cheap taxi ride to city and valley Cons: No lift available Very small and stuffy Old fashioned Bathroom door wouldn't close properly making showering, dressing and going to the toilet uncomfortable Air Conditioner kept making banging noises while trying to sleep ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470243095~“Great motel for short stay in Brisbane”~Found a very neat and quiet motel on Wickham Tce for a very reasonable price and included a hot breakfast. Short walk to Brisbane CBD and Roma Street station. Very tastefully furnished, comfortable bed and pillows and good size shower with good hot water. Well appointed with and pleasant. Room is very small so short over night stay or 2 is ideal. No lift and some half a flight of stairs. Parking was free but very limited and we had to park in the back street as the area was full. Parking on Wickham Tce is metered and expensive/hr but we found free weekend parking in Lilley Street nearby.~5~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_467719508~“Unwelcoming”~Stayed here for 2 nights last week and the man behind the reception desk could not have been more unwelcoming. I've never been spoken to by a receptionist the way he spoke to me and my parter, he was condescending, spoke to us like we were idiots and like we didn't deserve to be there, and to be honest it made me want to grab my suitcase and walk right out and find a new hotel (couldn't do this due to having used booking.com). He was beyond rude and I want the hotel to know this because I've never come across customer service at a hotel like it, something needs to be done about it. I won't be staying there again because of this experience, I'm just glad we didn't have to deal with him upon departure. Really disappointing.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466385799~“Highly recommend!!”~I've been visiting in this hotel for many many times when I need somewhere to stay in city. Cheap, clean, comfortable, free&fast wifi, parking, awesome location... seriously, I don't know what can you complain about?  OK, the room is small, but the bed and pillow is so comfortable. OK, there's no elevator, but it's not exhausting for the those stairs at all. You have private balcony, kettle, free coffee and tea, sometimes special $10 breakfast, short walking distance to everywhere and the price range just locate between $90-$100 in city!!  Thank you for all the friendly service and nice work of cleaning. I will always be back for sure!  Highly recommend here!!!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_465516518~“So much too offer.”~Hi guys,have been staying at Soho motel for nearly a week and here's how I got on.I travelled from Byron bay to Brisbane using Brisbane 2 Byron prebooked coach(8_12) hiace. The coach stops at Roma bus station, but the driver brought us right to the door of the Soho motel,as he said it was close by.The trip took 2 hours and was quite pleasant with some good air_con aboard the coach. Anyway the lady at reception greeted us with all local helpful information, eg free bus to CBD,every 10 minutes. We had prebooked and even though we were early1pm,our room was available to enter and relax in. We discovered it's just a 3-5 minute walk to Queen st mall. There's an amazing park just across the road and to the right.(Roma park). At check in there was a special 10dollar breakfast deal,which we went with.(rashers ,eggs,toast,juice). There is no lobby area as such,just a small reception area that cut off from the accommodation quarters. In fact the bedrooms are very small. That said they are spotlessly cleaned every day. A fridge is included,TV and electric kettle,air-con and good wifi. It's an old type key for your room,and reception closes 6 or 7 pm. An automatic door allows entry up till then,and the room key allows entry after 7pm. For what you pay the motel is good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451042773~“Basic but good value”~We wanted a cheap hotel for a one night stay near the centre of Brisbane, and that's exactly what this is.  Reception was friendly and helpful, and we were allowed into our room a full two hours before the official check in time. BE WARNED - there is no lift. We were on the first floor, but could have been a struggle. The room was small, that clean and comfortable and the shower was good. There was also a tiny but usable balcony to sit on. Not luxury, but perfect acceptable.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_447948088~“Exceptional Short Break”~We were warmly welcomed by Philip at the Reception Desk.His friendly and professional manner was reflected in all the staff throughout the hotel. Our room although small was perfectly adequate. It was very clean and comfortable, and we also had a small balcony where we could sit of an afternoon and enjoy the breezes.The bed was firm, comfortable and the pillows were good. No aching necks in the morning. The bathroom was very clean and the shower good.  We had dinner in the restaurant the first night. The menu was very good, excellent value for money and our meal was delicious. We also chose the restaurant for breakfast. The menu was varied but we decided on poached eggs on thick toast. A good choice which we enjoyed.  We would definitely stay at The Soho again.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_443221315~“Basic amenities, close to the city”~Basic but comfortable rooms and amenities. Free Wi-Fi is always good and complimentary parking is useful, but the spaces are very limited. Five minute walk to Queens Street mall, but you need to be able to take on a number of flights of stairs and steep inclines to get there and back.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_441213105~“Great Location”~Close to Brisbane Private Hospital. Room small but clean and adequate for our needs. Staff was really friendly. Meals are reasonably priced. Train stations are close by. Free loop bus available close by to mall and other shops.~4~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_437866528~“Good choice”~We stayed for two nights and were very happy with our choice. The location is great, right next to Roma St Station and the Parklands. The free loop bus at the door gets you to the CBD quickly. The room itself (we stayed in a twin) was compact however had everything we needed, including free wifi, aircon, tv, balcony, fridge and coffee/tea facilities.  The beds were comfortable and everything was clean. The decor is a little dated but considering the rates, this accommodation is very good value for money. The staff is very friendly and helpful.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_436968884~“Good value for money”~This hotel with older style small room is well kept and good value for money. It has limited free parking but I have managed to get parking both times I have stayed here. The last time I stayed here I attended the Brisbane Thai festival in the Roma Street parklands and it was only 300m walk to the event. For less than $100 a night you can't go wrong~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434929676~“Odd but Adequate”~The Soho is conveniently located...a few blocks from the Central Train Station (airport connection). It is a lot of uphill, though, so if walking uphill w luggage is a problem I would recommend a cab. The same holds true for restaurants, shopping, and walking along the river and bridges. If walking is not an issue for you, the city is wonderful and Soho' s location is great. There is a very lovely park across from the hotel, and beautiful walkways all around. The Soho itself is an odd building, but it works. Situated on a couple of different angles of a hill, entrance to the reception is different! The building is quiet and secure. It tries to be upscale, but the refurbishing is not quite there. The rooms are compact and a little tight for two suitcases. The air conditioner is outdated and needs some servicing or replacement. It never did quite get the room as cool as we would have liked, especially during the daytime. On a different note, the bathroom is relatively big and the shower is great! Staff are friendly, helpful, and responsive. While quirky, this hotel is an affordable option in a desirable area. We would stay again.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434870303~“Cheryl”~Our first time staying here for a night, if you don't want to pay alot of money just to have somewhere to sleep after a busy day in the city this is ideal,has everything you need to be comfortable & this hotel is not fancy but our foom is very clean,also you have to like walking up stairs as there are no lifts,lucky theres not too many floors,very close to everything city cbd,roma street parklands, public transport, the gentleman in the office was very friendly and helpful, he even gave us a map to get around,he also let us in our room earlier, I would definitely stay here again~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_434479221~“Don't knows about the Ausi Standard but as per Asian Standard at this expense this service is unacceptable ”~The hotel location is the only positive thing. Otherwise the service starting from checkin to check out is not professional at all. Moreover the room is a tiny one and bathroom's doors does not close properly. At this expense this service!!!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433421172~“Brisbane city holiday”~The Soho is an economical and comfortable motel set on the hill above the city centre, a short stroll downhill (5-10 minutes) to the main business and shopping areas. Staff were friendly, the bed large and very comfortable, the room was well maintained during our stay. Breakfast and dinner were available if wanted but we always prefer to eat out if we can so didn't try either. Very handy for the Roma Street station and the airport airtrain calls in there so very accessible from the airport. It was full during most of our stay but we heard little noise from our fellow guests or from outside.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~4~nan
review_432595870~“A little poky”~Stayed here overnight when travelling through Brisbane. Room was clean but decor a bit dated. The room wax very small. Although we only used it for sleep so it served our purpose. Price was also reasonable.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_432511027~“An excellent Motel”~I wish I knew this place much earlier. It is not a 4 or 5 star but it certainly a comfortable place to stay and the staff members are very helpful and obliging. Room is clean and has everything you can find in a 4 star hotel. I rather stay at Soho from now on.~5~nan~3~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_429840415~“Affordable”~This was a last minute booking as most were booked out on the day within location of the Brisbane Private Hospital. The Reception staff are lovely and helpful. I was moving between hotels with my partner in surgery and they checked me into a room well before check-in time. The location is great for the price. The rooms are tiny, outdated and no outlook (I was on lowest floor). But - They are clean, bed and pillows comfortable and the bathroom was new enough (looks like it has been upgraded in the last 10-15 years - not 80's style). You are getting what you pay for. I would not book it for a romantic stay but as an budget savy, central place I would recommend it.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_420969980~“Great location, value for money with friendly staff”~I stayed 1 night at the soho as meeting up with family. The room was on the small side BUT was impeccably clean and the ensuite had a large shower. Unless you plan to spend more time than sleeping in your room it was perfect.  The hotel is only a short walk down the hill to Queenstreet mall and a few doors away from the private hospital.  The staff were very helpful on arrival and also on my departure. All the staff were completely honest as I found out a short while after my checking out as I got a phone call to inform me I had left my large Nesspresso coffee pack in my room as house keeping had found it. I would stay here again.~5~nan~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan
review_417014814~“Great hotel to stay”~The best hotel in my trip to Australia. Hotel very clean: room, bathroom, bed...

review_412953690~“Friendly motel in a great location”~We only spent two nights here but found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and the free WiFi worked well. The food at the restaurant was really good...the lamb shanks were yummy and large as was the fish and chips and all were served promptly with a warm and happy smile from the waitress. The room was small but very comfortable...big roomy shower cubicle...and all was well-maintained and clean. Just a short walk down through the Roma Street Parklands to Roma Street Station and the Transit Centre. Also close to St Andrews Hospital and doctor's consulting rooms. Would definitely stay here again.~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan

review_361665156~“Nice place to dtay”~We stayed here on 2 separate occasions for a total of 8 nights. The rooms are quite small, wasn't a problem for us but can see why people could complain. The rooms were very clean with an ensuite bathroom. Good aircon and but WIFI was hit and miss. Great location, 5 minute walk from Roma Street station and 20 mins from SouthBank. Staff were really nice here too. Would highly recommend if you're seeking budget accommodation close to the city.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_356278286~“Pros and cons. Acceptable. ”~Compared with other inner city hotels and apartments I found Soho an acceptable place to stay but with balancing negatives and positives. The rooms are small, however well furnished with a good work desk. But no spare power points near the desk to plug your laptop in. Shower is spacious and had great pressure, but I didn't have very hot water. I'm not sure if we had missing toiletries but all we had was shampoo. The door to our room was open on arrival so maybe another guest had helped themselves? Bed was a little hard. Parking was an issue. There are only a few parks behind the hotel in a dark alley. None were available on the night we stayed which cost us $20 in parking.  Breakfast finishes at 9am, it would be great if this was extended to 10am to allow a bit more of a sleep in on holiday.  Our alarm clock didn't work so we overslept and missed breakfast. Our fault, or maybe Madonnas fault for starting her concert so damn late so we only managed a few hours sleep after her concert and an international flight. Heavy luggage is an issue as there is no lift. Unload your luggage roadside to avoid lugging it from the back of the hotel up 4 or more flights of stairs, if you're lucky enough to get a park. Tip - The restaurant next door at Hotel Urban makes nice pizzas. Pleasant stay, average.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355841312~“Overnight Stop ”~This was an ideal place to stay overnight as it is close to both City and Station. The room was on the smaller side but with a large shower room. Room had good views but being at the front it had a lot of traffic noise. Be aware that it is a stiff uphill walk from the station and the hotel has no lift so if you have heavy luggage be prepared. The breakfast was good, assuming you like bacon and eggs.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355134837~“Great place to stay!”~An immaculate room, small but very comfortable with lovely bed linen & towels. Tea & coffee making supplied, air con worked well & the staff very helpful & friendly. The shower recess is huge with plenty of hot water. Only downside is no lift but lower floors are easily accessible. A nice small balcony but the smoking on adjoining balconies was a bit troublesome when outside. We were at the back so very quiet. The location opposite the lovely Roma St Parkland is very good although it is a 10 min uphill climb from the CBD and Roma Street station - still a pleasant walk through the gardens Great value for money & a nice clean & friendly place to stay. Can highly recommend it.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~5~nan
review_354192678~“Great Place for a weekend break”~Brilliant place for a weekend in the city. Here's why...... Great location. 5 - 10 mins walks to central Brisbane.

review_353480498~“Great place to stay ”~Spent 2 nights here at the weekend 4/5 March 2016. The room was very small but still nicely decorated and clean. Bed was really comfy. We managed to get free parking at back of soho...glad we were on 1st floor as we had very heavy luggage to take up stairs.  Ordered breakfast to the room Both mornings Asked for 2 lots of breakfast one for me and my boyfriend, but the chef put 2 lots of eggs, bacon and sausages on one plate I think it was the language barrier on the chefs part. But still we shared and it was delicious.  Short walk to city centre with all the shop, bars, restaurant had a very enjoyable much needed fun weekend~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_351708815~“weloming pristine room”~arrived from the Roma train station after a walk along the broadway and up albert road. google maps did not show me the hill.. arrived after reception closed so i was emailed a pin to the locked box where my room key was. the complex is six story's high and no lift so if you have luggage maybe ask a low room. room is very small but if you are only wanting to sleep between touristing then its not a drama. the bathroom is all renovated too and the room opens onto a small balcony. met Phillip the next day, very friendly and helpful. only down side is there is no food/convenience store after 9pm in the area,~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_341334119~“Perfect location”~Lovely hotel in a perfect location to visit Brisbane city. We arrived after 8 pm and there was an easy procedure to obtain our keys. Our room was on the first floor, with a few steps to climb. The room was small. The shower room is relatively large with a hairdryer and the essentials. There is a tv, air con, kettle and a wardrobe with an iron and board. The hotel is less than a 10 min walk into the heart of the city and is well priced. The staff were helpful. We would come back here.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We arrived late at night, and the combination/key arrangement worked smoothly. When we did see some staff, they were friendly and helpful. We aren't terribly mobile, so dragging our heavy luggage up the 8 steps was painful, but had we arrived at a civilised hour the staff would have helped. Also Google map doesn't show the very steep grade awaiting you if you try to pull your luggage up from Roma St. Don't.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~nan
review_337098704~“convenient location”~Was looking for somewhere to book for new years eve and left it quite late to book. Found the Soho Hotel on line. Was reasonably priced for new years eve. The Hotel was quite close to the centre and only about a 10 minute walk to all the bars.Room was clean and had one double bed and a single which were comfortable. Only negative thing I could say about the room was the air-con was a bit noisy. There is parking for the hotel but is a bit limited so its a first come first serve. There is meter parking round the back of the Hotel and is free after 7pm so didn't work out too expensive for other people in our party who traveled by car. We travelled by train and found it was only a short walk to Brisbane central. If we went to Brisbane again would stop there again.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~3~nan
review_330451931~“Small but perfectly formed city motel.”~The rooms are relatively small but more than adequate for a short stay. Very clean and well maintained with all the requisite facilities. Of particular note are the bed pillows. With most hotels only having skinny pillows that need two to provide a decent head rest this hotel has full pillows that would probably be a luxury item in other places. Checkin was efficient and pleasant giving helpful advice re the hotel. The room staff were also welcoming. Given that this place is only a short walk to downtown Brisbane this hotel is excellent value for a short stay in Brisbane.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

Hotel rooms were compact, but clean and functional and provided everything we needed in a place to sleep - tea/coffee making, free wifi and complimentary parking subject to availability.

review_321080977~“Small but functional”~The motel had very limited parking with only a few spaces. It had a very small bedroom and three floors with no lift.

review_304237596~“ok for short stay”~More as a business hotel, standard twin room is quite small but equipped with enough amenities. rustic design, old ac, basic white washroom, but everything works fine including wifi. Close to city center, but there is steep uphill, not recommended to walk with heavy luggage, better to take taxi or drive. Didnt try the breakfast. Downsides are no elevator (and stairs are small) and no receptionist after dark. Just enough value for money.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~3~nan
review_293990583~“Nice staff, tiny rooms at a good location”~Although this hotel is somewhat less expensive than others in the area, that does not mean it is a better value. At check-in, we found our double room to be clean but smaller than a room we had in Tokyo last month (famous for tiny rooms). More frustrating than the size was the set-up. There are no plugs near the desk, so you can use your laptop until the battery runs down or alternatively stoop at the wardrobe where there's a plug for a kettle. The hotel has no common areas, so there's nowhere else to sit or work or read. WiFi is "free" but slow. There is nowhere to use an Ethernet cable to connect directly (we asked). Parking is "free" but very limited (a handful of spaces for the entire property). If you arrive with a car be aware that since a space is not guaranteed you may have to park on the street (and pay and possibly move the car every few hours). As there fortunately was a space when we checked-in, we chose to leave our car in it and literally not move it until we checked-out 4 days later. There's an on-site washer ($4) and dryer ($3). You can borrow the key from reception between 8AM and 4PM. We booked the room on the hotel's own website several months in advance. Our credit card was charged in full at that time, which we did not expect. Staff members were friendly and efficient.~3~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
