review_478384566~“Stylish and good value, but not quite right”~The Johnson has been recently renovated and has been done very well. It is good value for money and is not too far from the CBD. The majority of the staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. The rooms are a good size and comfortable and my only criticism is that they are poorly laid out. Even though there is enough room for 2 sinks, the toilet is in a small separate enclose and facing a wall about 12 inches away. I believe that sitting upright on the loo is good for you so maybe his has been done for our own good........... but I doubt it. We also felt that the servicing of our room was a little half hearted and it didn't feel finished - rumpled bed, pillows not fully plumped etc. The attached bar has good food but the cocktails are a bit hit and miss (FWP). Day one was perfect, day 2 was off-hand service and wilting celery in our Bloody Marys. I would recommend staying here overall.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_478364398~“Pretty hotel in quiet end of Brisbane City”~Clean and pretty hotel loved the art series which gives it a unique touch. However as located in the quiet part of Brisbane city everything is shut so not much selection of places to eat lucky to have one cafe open up the street. Unfortunately no breakfast facilities or breakfast room service available.  Just disappointed that I requested a room with a pool view through Qantas Frequent Flyer but was given a room of the bottom floor facing the fence. Otherwise it was very clean. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478132183~“Art series”~The Johnston was another great Art series hotel as we usually stay in Melbourne. Glad to received the same consistent service and quality of the hotel room but do love the pool,nice to have that space to relax in~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478088984~“Quite simply, the best Hotel I've stayed at in Australia”~From arrival to departure after 1 week, everything from the room, the facilities, the restaurant, the room service, right down to the strength of the wi-fi, the quality of the iron to the brand of the hair dryer - superb.! Defines style, luxury at an affordable price..!!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_478029902~“The Art Series Nails It Again”~I'm yet not find a better hotel chain than The Art Series in Australia. From previous experience they always tick all my boxes - clean, ambient, a (very) comfortable bed and an affordable price. The Johnson was no exception.  The Johnson is a beautiful modern space with generous sized rooms. The communal spaces are amazing - the pool is fabulous and the environment is just an enjoyable one to spend your time in.  I think what I am always most impressed with at The Art Series though is the staff and how helpful they are. The staff at the Johnson make your stay easy and ensure you have every need accommodated. That is not to say little issues never arise - mistakes and accidents happen, but what counts is always how easy they are to resolve. The Johnson staff excel at this and go about it in a friendly and welcoming manner to achieve a prompt and convenient solution.  My love affair with The Art Series continues and I will certainly be back again soon!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477836170~“A happy place”~We were pleasantly surprised by The Johnson. The staff were super friendly, the rooms were spotless, beautifully furnished and the artwork was a fabulous bonus. My only negative was that when we booked, we were told we'd get a gift of two bike rides and a welcome bottle of wine-unfortunately we received neither. Otherwise the stay was lovely.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477324107~“Fantastic - deserving of six stars!!!”~Stayed here for four nights a couple of weeks back whilst on business in Brisbane in a 2 bedroom deluxe suite and cannot speak of or review The Johnson highly enough. We've travelled and stayed at many hotels worldwide and this is one of the few that we would happily give six stars if that option was available. It really is that good. Spacious, clean, modern, comfortable, furnished well with quality fittings all in excellent order. The beds were so comfortable and the unit huge; with two bathrooms and a very comfortable living area with fully functional kitchen plus much more. The larger parent hotel company have in our view a high quality and innovative accomodation product in the Art Series Hotels and the Johnson does them proud. Every single staff member was amazing - professional, helpful, knowledgable and friendly - a credit to hotel management in the careful selection of the right people to perform specified roles and then in their training and support - it's obvious the staff want to be there.  We will be staying here a bit in the near future and unreservedly highly recommend the Art Series Johnson Hotel to you, whether it be for business or family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476614107~“Hidden Gem”~Most people look to stay right in the CBD - this is only 5 minutes walk from Central Station, Brisbane CBD, and the Valley and is a hidden Gem of a Hotel - unique, well appointed, contemporary, and very comfortable. Super helpful staff~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476577231~“excellent”~fantastic location staff made sure our stay was perfect particularly Ben. I highly recommend the Johnson very classy. Restaurant also excellent. We will be back for sure. Ten out of Ten best hotel in Brisbane by far.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476275553~“Quiet, comfortable, great location”~What a great place to stay, would have liked to stayed longer. Very comfy beds, well equipped rooms, my Studio was huge, very quiet. Good prices on room service and mini bar. The location is also great, with easy access to the motorways and easy to find, far enough away from the cbd to avoid the noise but close enough to walk to everything. Will definately stay here again, next trip June. A great choice for your Brisvegas accom.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476233881~“Great night's sleep”~We were very happy with our Deluxe Studio room which had a very luxurious bed and an array of pillows to choose from. The location is very handy to both the valley & the CBD. We will stay there again when we're next in Brisbane.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475633836~“Really lovely hotel ”~My husband and I stayed here for a quick staycation celebrating a birthday just before Easter. The hotel is so beautifully designed - the rooms are large, we loved the high ceilings, the 'his and hers' sinks in the bathrooms and full length windows / doors. There is so much seating and well thought out storage space, it would have been nice to stay a bit longer! The bed was really comfortable and all the little touches make it - the robes, the ample body wash, shampoo, etc., the mini bar food you actually want to eat! The staff were incredibly lovely and efficient both at reception and at Tumbling Stone. We had breakfast included in our stay and you receive 1 x main breakfast item and a drink which is absolutely better than any regular hotel breakfast, I would highly recommend dining at the Tumbling Stone.  The only thing that was a bit of an annoyance was the sound of the chain door at the car park. We weren't overly close but it is loud and noticeable during the evening.  Overall, would definitely recommend and go back in a heartbeat.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475391190~“An arty experience”~Perfectly situated and generous rooms, pool was a bonus. Only downside was that our room faced inwards overlooking other rooms so could not experience waking up to a view which was a little disappointing~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_474471221~“Quick city break”~Check was easy and straight forward. The rooms are new and modern and quite large. There was even an in-room half kitchenette which was an unexpected surprise. Our trip was short so didn't get to use all the facilities but the room service and breakfast were tasty and priced pretty normally for Brisbane.~4~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_474373666~“Lovely modern hotel, just that little bit different to all the others.”~We stayed for one night as a birthday celebration. The Hotel itself is very modern, spacious and the artwork is everywhere and beautifully balanced by the furniture and overall decor. The Staff were warm and friendly, efficient and check in and out was faultless. Our room was sunny, clean, well equipped, the bathroom really well thought out. Free 30 Loop bus over the road, another bus stop right outside. Tumbling Stone provided really good food for both dinner and breakfast and has a relaxed feel. No negatives - other than perhaps some time Management might suggest that staff in restaurant stop greeting people as 'guys', stop saying 'not a problem' for everything, and 'no worries'. It's a bit old hat now. I know they are being friendly and helpful, just it seems to be a Brisbane thing & we are from Brisbane. Still loved our stay though.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473981104~“Worst Nights sleep ever”~If you are looking for a hotel that needs no wake up call or that brings you straight back home to a noisy night with the kids, then look no furthur. The Johnsons incessantly screeching carpark roller doors will ensure that you aren't late for your 8am meeting and will ensure you get as good a sleep as you would with a newborn.  After complaining about this noise to management I was assured it would be fixed only to find that a night later it was still occurring, management seemed to fob this off as just a ridiculous enquiry. I would never recommend staying here unless the issue is fixed the noise was completely unbearable and I left as soon as was possible.~1~2~nan~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_473970966~“Excellent for couples or business travellers”~Lovely stay at a beautiful hotel. The room was spacious, and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. The in house restaurant was excellent (try the mushroom tart!!). I will certainly be staying here again for future Brisbane trips. about 5 mins from CBD on the free bus, or 3 mins via Uber.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_473956572~“Wedding night”~We stayed for our wedding night at The Johnson. The overall hotel looks nice and amenities look good. Our room was average. We ended up getting a disabled room for some reason and the front door didn't lock but since we were only staying one night and got in very late, we didn't bother saying anything until we checked out. The Tumbling Stone restaurant was good for brunch the next day.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473923448~“Great but noisy car park doors ”~Absolutely lovely hotel. Great value. Comfortable beds. Stylish. Gym. Pool. Great staff. Breakfast was lovely. The room has great facilities and the mini bar and room has tasty snacks and a nice range of drinks. It's a little way out of the city centre (15 min walk) but that wasn't a problem for us. I would say it was even a bonus as it was more relaxing than our previous stay in Brisbane which was in the CBD. Uber is very cheap in Brisbane too. However, someone needs to look at the carpark gates. They have a chain on them that rattles every time someone opens and closes them. It's pretty annoying. It sounds like a baby with a rattle, on repeat. Would stay again but bring earplugs / sleeping tablets or ask for a room not facing carpark.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473679117~“Enjoyable stay”~Very nice room and friendly staff. The pool is good and the gym has most new equipment. The location is a bit of a walk from Brisbane City. You may wish to take a connection bus to city centre. Despite this, I would say The Johnson is a perfect choice for leisure stay.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473104869~“Bring your ear plugs!”~We stayed at the Johnson as we had a family event in Brisbane. I will agree with all the previous reviews, rooms are spacious and location is great. As we stayed on a weekend we could not take advantage of the free bus to the city, that said it's only a 15 min walk. Now the downside, our room looked over the entrance to the car park, the roller door was so noisy, as it went up and down 24/7. We often look forward to a quiet "red" on the balcony when we stay at hotels but not at the Johnson. It appears so much money has been spent to make such a great boutique hotel, with a great location and it's been let down by a noisy roller door! Would I stay there again, yes but only if that noisy door has been fixed.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_473068424~“Great room, great stay.”~We had a corner room with 2 queen beds . This room was very spacious, well decorated, comfy beds, a huge bathroom with lots of toiletries and towels. The tea/coffee area was well stocked . The art work throughout the hotel was colourful and pleasing to the eye. We have been to 3 Art Series hotels and this is by far the best one. The staff were helpful and friendly.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_472522693~“Great hotel on the CBD fringe”~We are fans of boutique hotels and this one has been exceptionally well executed. The rooms were generously proportioned and the standard of the interior appointment was as good as anything we've stayed in around the world. The location is right in the fringe of the central city area which was fine for us because we were driving to the suburbs to meet with family and friends but if you want action right on your doorstep this probably isn't the place to choose. That said the staff were welcoming and friendly and the restaurant/bar on site was terrific. Would definitely stay here again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472520795~“Trendy & roomy”~Had the opportunity to stay away in our own city of Brisbane -- got a great deal for family of 4, which included a full a-la-carte breakfast & drink!! Very modern, attention to detail for an 'old government' building - fantastic size rooms.....comfy beds (AJ Beard!), would certainly stay again if needing Spring Hill or Valley end of town!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472513575~“Beautiful!”~This hotel is stunning. In a great location to where I needed to be. The room was so spacious and nice and light. The bed was heavenly, no wonder they have the option of buying a bed like it. I felt very safe and welcome by the staff. Breakfast in the restaurant was also delicious and not your typical boring hotel breakfast fare. Thank you!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_472216276~“Perfect Stay!”~We booked into the Johnson for a one night stay so that my wife an I could have a little get away. Wonderful staff and a beautiful room, we loved the styling and the size of the room... huge! will be back for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472030102~“Sophisticated Johnson ”~The Johnson Hotel is a classy and stylish inner city hotel with professional and friendly staff. We arrived a little early but were geeted warmly and checked in very efficiently. Our suite was on the same level as reception which was good to minimise time spent in any of the four lifts.  Our room was bright and airy with a private balcony overlooking the valley to the east. The room was large and we'll appointed and included a king bed that was the most comfortable of any hotel ever experienced.  The bathroom was huge and accoustically separate from the suite and included two vanities, a double shower and separate WC. Both the room and bathroom had with ample floorspace above expectation. The cousine in the restaurant was very good and reasonably priced. There were three separate eating zones both inside and outside which felt stylish and yet relaxed. We stayed two nights and wanted more! Highly recommend. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471726377~“The best stay you will in Brisbane”~This beautiful hotel goes above and beyond even during a Cyclone. Friendly and helpful staff, beautiful spacious accommodation and a fab resturant to boot!! Will only stay here whenever we travel to Brissie.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471699650~“Perfect”~Room was great, forgot to tell reception though that with the crazy weather water had come in onto the carpet at the head of the bed, room 402. Just didn't want it to get missed because cleaners would have shoes on~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471513504~“Fantastic Hotel - as with all new hotels some things are still hit and miss”~Conversion of this building has been tastefully done and the rooms are fantastic. Location is convenient with a free shuttle bus to the city from across the road. The pool is the jewel in the crown - very inviting on a hot day. We also went to the tumbling stone restaurant and the quality of the food was excellent. Staff on the front desk are all amazing - accommodating, professional friendly, knowledgeable. Used the smart car to get around town and it was very convenient and cost effective. So why four stars and not five - the service was inconsistent in the areas of wait staff in the restaurant as slow and lacking and the cleaning in the hotel was really hit and miss, not up to scratch yet. As I have experienced this at many new hotels, I am sure this will be resolved. The key cards also randomly stopped working a number of times which was a little annoying. Would definitely return to this quality, modern, spacious haven at an affordable price.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_471284463~“Lovely hotel in good location”~Couldn't be happier with stay so far, check in smooth and friendly, room (studio 1 bed) spacious, well furnished and quality bathroom etc. Internet fast and free. Bit out of CBD but that was planned, Spring Hill is older quality suburb. The added bonus of all "Art Series" hotels is the fabulous array of featured artist's works adorning all the public spaces. This is a chic hotel that will become my regular for all future Brisbane trips.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470968851~“Good choice just out of CBD”~Twin Suite Room was large and extremely comfortable, with two king size beds. Hotel staff were courteous, efficient and friendly. Excellent re-use of old government office building makes for a hotel with an interesting feel. Twin sink bathroom is great. Enclosed toilet within the bathroom a bonus. Attached restaurant (Tumbling Stone) has good food although service can be rather hit and miss. Polite but slow. Plenty of other eateries nearby however. Well situated for nearby hospitals and specialist rooms and without CBD chaos.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470967420~“Modern, spacious, easy”~Rooms are modern and spacious. Check-in and check-out is made straightforward and easy. Staff are very professional, friendly and accommodating. Only negative is no pillow menu (no low pillows for those of us of slight stature!).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470769948~“Excellent stay”~We had an excellent few days at this hotel but must add one bad point although this does not affect giving it an excellent rating. We arrived, drove into the car park underneath the hotel, and then made our way to reception. What we were not told on checking in is that you have to pay a daily fee for the car park!!! We found this out as we checked out. As we left early each morning and came back late, we would have been better to park on the street at the reduced rates. We didn't make a fuss as we left as we really enjoyed this hotel, the security, the amenities, its position in the city, the large comfy room and everything else about it. Just a shame about the car parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~4~nan
review_469724671~“Top place for a weekend”~A birthday weekend was enhanced by staying at this great themed hotel. I'm not an art aficionado but couldn't help but be impressed by this place. The art which is everywhere was great (personal preference obviously) the location wasn't too far from the CBD, the pool area was brilliant and pool food and drink service was available and well used by guests. The front of house staff weren't the friendliest we've ever seen so some in-house training wouldn't go astray. The only issue I had was walking for ages to try and find a newspaper on Saturday morning. Providing papers to guests would be a big improvement: even having some for sale would save time. Other than that our stay was great.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~3~nan
review_469404131~“Another winner from Art Series”~Having stayed twice at the Olsen Art Series Hotel in Melbourne, we were reasonably confident about choosing its counterpart in Brisbane. We were not disappointed (although unfamiliar with the artist being celebrated) Situated close to cafes and restaurants in Spring Hill, it is, we were told the refurbished Main Roads Dept building. You would not know that except for the somewhat tight and non-intuitive car parking. Service was exemplary, the room was clean, and like the Melbourne counterpart was furnished with books and other references to the featured artist. Art works were prominent in the foyer, lifts, corridors and rooms. Other nice touches include the provision of cold scented water in the foyer. There seem to be few good commercial reasons for this extra effort to be made but it is very much appreciated.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469364164~“Awesome ”~Amazing bed and room . With the best bar across the road for late night drinks snacks. Friendly staff and so clean. Had the penthouse for a function which was fantastic. A great venue for something special ♥~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469286166~“staff are everything”~The thing that makes this small hotel group stand out is the consistently high quality of staff and the service they provide. I guess its all in the training but the art series hotels is now always my choice because they are fun places to be, as well as having all the bells and whistles. Slick but never pompous.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469277047~“The place to stay”~Such a great space, with modern, clean and well appointed rooms. Food was great, conference facilities world class - this will be our companies go to with in Brisbane. Such a great addition to the Art series hotel family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468670409~“Lovely place to be”~Staff are wonderful, the place is charming and food perfect. It would have been nice if i had been informed I would be $50 out of pocket for the parking! It was difficult to navigate where to park to access the front to check in.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468657360~“Very nice”~We found this new boutique hotel on Travelzoo for $129 per night which included breakfast for 2 each day at their restaurant- Tumbling. We were upgraded to a 2 bed apartment. Accessing the building and parking was the only confusing thing. Great place to stay~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468653851~“A fabulous place to stay”~Our stay was such a pleasure, it's the 2nd time we have stayed there. We come to Brisbane a lot & now that we have found The Johnson we wouldn't stay anywhere else. The rooms are beautifully clean & the staff are so friendly & helpful & go out of their way. I couldn't recommend it more highly, my husband & I love it~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_467359640~“I love The Johnson”~The Art Series Hotels are the best thing to happen to the hotel industry in Australia. I recommend you become a member of PGR and really take advantage of all of the deals available. The hotel is modern, the staff friendly and the in-room meals tasty. The pool was glamorous and the alfresco dining area a much needed addition to Spring Hill.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_465920568~“Wow wow wow”~This has to be one of the most beautifully decorated and designed hotels i have ever stayed at. The studio rooms are enormous, luxurious and you honestly cannot get out of bed as the beds i swear were made from clouds. Books to read in the room, information about the artist who designed the hotel, dressing gowns and slippers, his and her basins, ceilings that go forever with exposed cement and beams. Luxurious fittings,fixtures and furniture. There is nothing i can fault about the room, the hotel, the service or the staff. There is only two miner downfalls that I easily overlooked as the hotel is so stunning. House keeping forgetting to service my room on 3-4 occasions even when called and requested as they thought i was there on a promotion when I had paid to stay, and the views are dismal, staring into a carpark is not pleasant however i was happy to stay in bed :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465482051~“Great Weekend”~We had a girls weekend here and could not rate it highly enough. The room far exceeded our expectations, the staff were awesome, close to the city and a 5 min taxi ride to south bank. We will seek the Art Series out for our next weekend away :0) thank u :0)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465425920~“Great hotel!”~Stayed two nights here and it was honestly the highlight of the trip. The rooms are beautiful, clean and with some really nice touches, like T2 tea and nice quality soap and shampoo. I also loved having a balcony that I could open the room up onto. The pool is stunning. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We also rented one of the hotel smart cars for half a day which was $30 and we were easily able to go for a trip out to Mt Coot Tha and then drive down to the powerhouse for dinner.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We had booked the hotel months before attending the Adele Live Concert at The Gabba on Saturday Night. Before Arriving, Jessica assisted us over the phone about our extra Adele ticket, and warmly welcomed us upon arrival. We were also pleasantly surprised by the upgrade we received to a Sub Penthouse!!! Amazing Service and an Amazing Room!!! The hotel itself was in great condition, well furnished and situated a short 15 minute wall to Queen Street Mall! The bed were the best hotel beds I have ever slept on! The breakfast at the hotel was superb, and the al a carte service was a great welcome to the day ahead! Definitely recommend this hotel and would once again like to thank Jessica at reception for making our stay magical!!!~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_464622787~“Most Relaxed Brisbane stay EVER”~The Johnson has the best and most relaxed vibe of any hotel we've ever stayed at in Brisbane. The rooms and amenities are world class especially the 50 metre pool. We booked a room and breakfast package which was more than worth the value. We will be back.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464618728~“Friendly relaxed vibe.”~Stayed one night at this New hotel, staff were outstanding, particularly Jessica who when we asked if it was possible to be moved away from being next to a lift, organised an alternative room in minutes.  Dinner & breakfast at the restaurant was enjoyable and reasonably priced. Would recommend The Johnson to any traveler wishing to stay close to the centre of Brisbane and willing to walk into the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464432544~“Excellent Location - Great Rooms”~This place is value for money. They define modern contemporary design. The rooms are excellent and well maintained.

review_463924851~“Spacious and Serene”~I have had a couple of very enjoyable stays at The Blackman hotel in Melbourne and was keen to check out The Johnson, Brisbane's first Art Series hotel. I was not disappointed. The reception staff were attentive and helpful throughout my two night stay. My Deluxe Studio Suite (room 412) was spacious and filled with natural light thanks to floor to ceiling glass across the entire back wall. The leafy view out to suburban cottages provided a feeling of serenity and a sliding door out to a narrow balcony allowed fresh air into the room. I really appreciated the ample lighting in the room at night compared to the many dimly lit hotel rooms I have stayed in, while the addition of blackout curtains ensured a lovely dark room for sleeping. A very quiet room, both during the day and at night. The twin vanity units in the bathroom were a real bonus and the basins themselves were very generous in size. The toilet had its own door for privacy and the shower was a comfortable size, although the water pressure was lacking. I enjoyed two delicious breakfasts and a lovely dinner at Tumbling Stone restaurant which adjoins the hotel. Both food and service could not be faulted and I strongly recommend you try their very tasty, innovative and reasonably priced menu. Roma Street Parklands is close by for a peaceful late afternoon stroll.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463594834~“3 Star”~We have traveled extensively and simply asked for toilet paper not once but three times to be delivered to our room. I then made my way to reception to be advised nobody could deliver it and was handed a roll. Was not impressed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_463572850~“Revitalising Spring Hill”~Terrific repurposing of an old building. Rooms large and comfortable. Great beds and a spacious bathroom.

review_463115569~“Do yourself a favor”~Wow first time I've stayed with the Art Series brand. Staff at reception so welcoming explained everything and beyond like the free bus into CBD is just across the road. When you get into your room your bottom jaw drops. Great comfy beds huge rooms big bathroom. really high standard bed linen and towels. The only thing I could winge about is the shower pressure it could be a bit stronger but will not stop me staying again. Already thinking of going back next week. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_462860092~“Amazing!”~Beautiful hotel steps away from Brisbane Central. Stayed only 1 night before my flight back home. It's an elegant, spotless and fun hotel. My room was huge with a king bed, balcony, double-sink bathroom and lots fo room to spread out. I loved the little touches like the art books, stylish decorations quirky toiletries descriptions and coffee & tea. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462845170~“Fantastic experience”~We stayed in penthouse with two bed rooms for three nights and four days. During the stay we really enjoyed staying in the hotel. The room was very clean, well managed, beautifully designed one with a fantastic view of Brisbane! And all people working for the hotel were very nice and kind for us.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462147197~“Better Value Possible in the Valley”~Unfortunately this hotel does not meet the standard of any other Art Series Hotel, the special feel of QT and Art Series Hotels I have enjoyed numerous times in the past was not reflected in service delivery or hotel ambience. When I finally had the "pleasure" of meeting the General Manager Andrew Edsor after I had spent $170 in the restaurant, I realised why, he is closed to feedback and can only assume I will received same in his feedback to this review. I'm now happily back at the Emporium, similar price, better value. Take it from me, don't bother.~1~nan~1~nan~nan~3~1~nan
review_461953529~“Great Place To Stay”~We stayed at The Johnson for two nights. An excellent hotel. New, well designed, great room with good facilities. The service was great and the price was reasonable. We would definitely stay there again.~5~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_460127190~“Speechless ”~I stay at a lot of hotels as a pilot and this is one of the best ones I've been to in a while. The reception staff were courteous and helpful. Location was convenient in terms of being able to walk to the CBD. Rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable.  My recommendation is if you're getting there from BNE airport try to UBER it as the taxis cost quite a bit more in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460022300~“Ms”~Excellent 2 night midweek stay for best friends significant birthday! Accommodation excellent  Staff excellent  Food very good. 1 meal was queried ? Raw fish not specified on menu - was told it had been 'marinated' it was cold. I asked for fish that was 'cooked' not slimy! Got it - but was disappointed. Veggies excellent. Other meal was lamb and very good Excellent Jugs of a Gin cocktail!!! We enjoyed the veggies the most!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459470937~“Real value for a great hotel”~I have stayed at 3 of the other Art Series hotels and as usual, it was a first class experience. My room had a little courtyard...I wasn't on the best side of the hotel but I had the cheapest possible room so for the price, it was really good value. My room was very spacious with icy cold air conditioning - perfect as it was an unbelievably hot day. I loved the bed so much I think I want to get one for home - its very very comfortable. The pool is spectacular....I forgot to take my bathers so didn't hop in, but the poolside set up looked so inviting. The gym facilities were brand new, so the equipment was in great condition. I ate at the restaurant which was simple, delicious and well priced. About a 10 minute walk downhill to the city and very close to the Botanical Gardens, so you can make that 10 minutes last as long as you like.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_459033393~“Arty and Flash and very new”~We thought we would have a "Valentines" Weekend together and chose the new Johnson Hotel in Spring Hill. It was named after Michael Johnson, an artis, who's paintings adorn the whole Hotel. He is an abstract artist of great talent and it certainly is a testament to him and a brilliant idea.  Apart from finding it hard to work out how to get into the place without needing to park on the street (where there were no parks), we were welcomed to go into the carpark beneath after ringing "but only park in the Hotel Reserved area". Of course we could find none spare. Either a heavily booked Hotel or not enough parks. And you got charged $25 for the privilege of parking in the wrong spot and being told to move on if someone complained. I suppose if flying in from interstate you would just be dropped off, then hire one of the Bicycles or even a smart car they have available. The rooms were very nice and clean. The minibar was immediately displayed, and with kids they were ready to help themselves which is a danger. However, it appeared that the rooms had not been finished. The Ceiling above was bare cement showing the boxing moulds used to pour the cement into when building it. Weird! Perhaps they ran out of money to finish the ceilings? Perhaps they are waiting for Michael Johnson to come along and paint one of his Masterpieces directly onto it just like Michelangelo did in the Sistine Chapel?  The rooms were fantastically quiet. They even thought to make sure the light was blocked out with twin curtains. In fact with record temperatures in Brisbane, you did not even need to put the airconditioner on. Somehow the rooms were already cool. Perhaps it was due to the bare concrete ceilings. The swimming pool is this 50 metre lap pool. At least they cater for swimmers getting exercise not simply splashing around. The staff all appeared very friendly which is so important. However you get the feeling they have not totally got their act together yet.It is quite new though. Look forward to seeing it when they have finished the Ceilings.~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan~4~nan

review_457963351~“Excellent service and supreme quality at mid range pricing”~I've been living here for a while and I don't know how I'll ever leave. It's fantastic. - Epic facilities, particularly impressed with room furnishings and gym quality  - Short walk to everything - Impeccable service: The staff have all been so helpful and friendly!  - Specific shout outs to Jess T and Ilse at front desk; y'all make my day, 12/10 :D - Extremely comfortable beds: They sell well independently... Need I say more! - Great dining options: The restaurant on ground if fantastic and well priced - Attention to detail: From artwork to functional design, it's all very well done - Rental cars: Available for day trips, soooo convenient, very practical option Possibly my favorite hotel in the world, and I've stayed at many... It feels high tier quality and service, but the pricing is mid ranged. I would (and regularly do) emphatically recommend The Johnson :)~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_457784521~“Fantastic stay!”~We loved this hotel and have already booked again! Friendly and welcoming staff. Amazing room (we were spoilt with an upgrade!). The beds are so comfortable and we had everything we needed. The hotel is in a great location - within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants. The restaurant downstairs was wonderful too. We had drinks and some tapas. Overall a wonderful experience.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456971474~“Booking Debacle! Not A Great First Impression”~Don't book through Trip Advisor! The link to book The Johnson from Trip Advisor takes you to The Cullen in Melbourne!!! You book thinking you are booking The Johnson in Brisbane and you end up with a booking in Melbourne!! IT guys, get your links right! Alex, at The Johnson, just could not work out a solution for us. He kept saying over and over that what we booked in Melbourne is not available in Brisbane. Understood Alex. We just wanted a solution. Any accommodation would have been great but poor Alex just could not get his head around the whole thing. Not the best first impression. Would Alex have coped with a check in? Would have loved to have stayed at The Johnson, but after the refund debacle, I guess we will be staying at Alex Perry! Unfortunate.~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456558436~“Friendly staff and great stay”~Fantastic large studio room and super helpful and friendly staff. The pool was amazing on the warm QLD nights. I managed to park out the front after 5pm and could stay there till 8am the next morning.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_456096393~“Great rooftop pool!”~The rooms are very clean, spacious and modern. The bed is comfortable as you would expect from an Art Series hotel. The bathroom is large however the toilet is sooooo tiny! Beware tall people! At 5ft 7 my knees were touching the wall - not a big issue (but could be if you couldn't fit in there!  The swimming pool is a full 50m lap pool and is on the 'roof' on one side of the building. It's a highlight. The pool plus the deck area on that level is amazing, heaps of loungers. We ordered food to have there and that was also good. You could chill there all afternoon (we did!). The gym is also great. I like that they have T2 iced tea in the lobby :) We didn't go down to the restaurant whilst we were there but our friends who travelled with us did remark that they had to wait a really long time for breakfast on two separate mornings. Car parking is available but expensive as I guess you would expect for the city.  Slight downside is the location - it's walkable to the CBD and the valley, but is up a pretty steep hill. A good place to stay if you don't want to be in the middle of everything.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_455739844~“Aesthetically pleasing!”~Be prepared to not want to go anywhere! We had a balcony & it was incredibly relaxing with the fabulously oversized doors. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the staff were ALL happy & the location is central to everything!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_455260681~“Australia Day getaway.”~Wonderful atmosphere and service; a great place for a quick retreat and relax. Just a nice stroll to some great Brisbane's local eateries like Happy Boy, e'cco and many more; and only a 5 minute walk into the Brisbane CBD.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454348120~“Our new Brisbane fave ...”~We are regular visitors to Brisbane and have a few hotels that we prefer to stay out .... now we have a new one! We stayed at the Johnson Hotel on the weekend and it was great. It's a property with a great story being a converted landmark government building and is located right on the city fringe - so close to but out of the chaos. Great things about it were - room layout, really great space and balcony, amazing 50m lap pool with great outdoor area including BBQ, really well equiped gym, great restaurant downstairs and being an art hotel the pieces around the property and in your room are really interesting. We stayed on the weekend and there was plenty of on street parking. Great add on is if there ins't anyone staying in your room after you leave they will let you extend you check out .... even to the next day ... beat that! So, in short, there is no reason we won't be back - again and again!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_453240237~“Has the potential to really impress.....but”~I organised a two day company workshop with The Johnson, which was organised by telephone and email. There were some minor misunderstandings, which came from a lack of experience, from some of the staff, to clearly listen (and understand), the clients requirements. Eventually 'things' fell into place, but only due to my persistence to get some of their staff to clearly listen (and really stop trying to be too fancy and false). This is a quote from an email I received from one of The Johnson's Assistant Operations Managers after the workshop - we do indeed have a few points to work on in terms of our communications and execution. So, would I utilize The Johnson again for a workshop or meeting - NO. I thought our accommodation (deluxe room) was okay, but certainly does not compare to the rooms we have occupied at the Cullen and the Blackman in Melbourne. Our room was all white (similar to an undercoat white), with some attempt at art deco. The partitioned off room had a television, which is ridiculously too big for the actual room size. I had to speak with reception staff about providing a door key, so we could lock the balcony door - really. When I explained to the reception staff, if we can't lock the glass door leading out on to the balcony, the room is effectively insecure. What I initially got was a vague look, but once again persistence paid off and a key was delivered to our room, so the door could be locked while we slept. Now the adjoining restaurant to The Johnson, in a word - superb. The ambiance, the quality, taste and presentation of the food - absolutely five star and the waiter staff and service, beyond belief. So this is what I will do in future - will not stay at The Johnson or conduct a seminar/meeting, but will definitely go to the restaurant and once again, enjoy a wonderful foodies experience. And now I await, a possible reply from The Johnson management to smooth the ripples in this review or to simply apply a slick attempt at 'spin doctoring'.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_452932966~“Nice staycation”~In the week leading up to our staycation at The Johnson, I received a phone call from their front desk noting that they looked forward to welcoming us on our arrival. To be honest, the phone call was unexpected. It was a very personal touch that I would usually expect from high-end, luxury hotels and resorts, so when I got off the phone with The Johnson, I was already impressed without even setting foot in the hotel.  Brisbane’s first art hotel, The Johnson is a part of the Art Series Hotel Group. Set just a stone-throw away from the CBD in the suburb of Spring Hill. This former government building now houses over 80 hotel rooms and 190 residential apartments. As I’m sure some of you would have heard of (or even stayed at) Art Series Hotels like The Olsen or The Cullen in Melbourne, each hotel takes design inspiration from the namesake artist. The Johnson takes its design cues from abstract painter, Michael Johnson. You will find splashes of vibrant colours in the lobby, hallways and certainly in your room.  Located on the 9th floor, we spent our weekend in a One Bedroom Deluxe Suite. Equipped with a sizeable kitchen, the generous space was clean, modern and simplistic. Snacks were carefully stacked in a basket, drinks such as Veuve Clicquot and Balter XPA were placed in the fridge to be consumed and the associated price tags were pleasantly affordable for a hotel minibar. The king bed was very comfortable and certainly big enough for the three of us to easily spend the night snoozing away. The bathroom was very simple, one would even say it’s clinical, but our balcony provided views of a quieter side of Brisbane - Queenslanders, cloudless blue skies and lush green trees.  We spent a lot of time at the pool. Designed by Michael Klim, the lap pool on level 5 provided sweeping views of Spring Hill. As soon as we settled, we all went downstairs where I found myself a very comfortable sun lounge to chill and read, with an icy mojito by my side, while watching the boys swim around in the dazzling blue water.  We found the service very friendly and helpful, although there was one little incident where the hotel staff came in to replenish our minibar an hour after we had checked into our room as we were advised that the previous guest had drunk a bottle of red wine which wasn’t replaced, but I guess that wasn’t really an issue. The next morning before we checked out, we had breakfast at the hotel’s Tumbling Stone Restaurant & Bar which was really satisfying and delicious. It was our first stay in an Art Series Hotel, but I’m sure it wouldn’t be our last.~4~nan~3~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_452015421~“City escape”~Welcoming and friendly staff. Nice surrounds, comfy bed, choice of pillows, clean room/amenities. Towels supplied for use after pool. Iced water with lemon in foyer appreciated on hot days. Handy information leaflet included with room swipe card. Not wanting to be picky, but some feedback......Paid for parking (which was reasonable pricing) however car park was difficult to manoeuvre around/small parking bays.Staff since advised best to use front entrance not rear.Need better signage and/or advise on web site/when contacting people. Location in nice area, and great for us as we like walking, however a little out of the CBD and a "hilly climb" back for those who may not be used to hills/walking a little distance. However Uber, taxis' and a free loop bus readily available at hotel doorstep.  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451732266~“Great hotel . Bad location ”~We stayed here because we have stayed at the art series hotel in Melbourne so we like the hotels and cleanliness!! Also it had just opened in Brisbane and we love brand new hotels . The pool is great and the rooms are great also they have high ceilings so gives the effect of being spacious which worked!!!  The down fall is the location . Your not "close" to anything where you can have a selection of a bite to eat. It's a odd spot for a hotel . The cbd is walking distance but if you like to hike! It's hilly and a far distance in my opinion . Don't let the hotel tell you otherwise . We had a baby so we were pushing the pram up and down the hills to get to the cbd .  If you want something in the middle of everything I wouldn't stay here .~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451563938~“Business Planning and Accomodation”~Our team stayed at The Johnson for 2 days of business planning. It is a reasonably new hotel (a refit of a previous Government Agency). As an Art Series hotel it has a great sense of colour and interest with lots of art by the Artist Johnson. The rooms were a great size and included coffee machines and tea making facilities. Foxtel on the TV and free internet.  The rooms we had for our planning session were light and bright and plenty of room. The catering was pretty good and could improve with a little more attention to detail around refreshing water bottles, glasses and tea/coffee cups. Also has restaurant/bar attached. Service varied depending on staff but the meals were good. For those interested in craft beer selection, there are some available, but not its main purpose.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451550689~“Best.Rooms.Ever”~Stayed at The Johnson this week for business. The suites are ridiculously amazing. They have thought of everything. From the beautifully decorated 'huge' rooms, the best blackout curtains ever, T2 Tea, Coffee Machine, huge TV and most FOXTEL channels, beautiful art - I can't say enough good things about it. I didn't go in the pool but it looked amazing. We had our conference there and the service was fantastic. My head office is in Brisbane (I'm in Melbourne) so I hope I can stay here every time!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451369526~“Wow what a way to visit Brisbane!”~We were already on holiday at Byron Bay but wanted to catch a band playing at the Triffid. Having read about the Johnson we thought it was handy to Tenerife and it was a good time to try it out. Fabulous!  Such a friendly, stylish and well appointed hotel. Only a short stay this time but we are looking when we can go again and talking to one of our children looking to buy an apartment there. Many places we have stayed have offered a pool but this Michael Klim designed pool we couldn't leave! So cool, fresh, clear and at 50 metres room for everyone, the lounges surrounding the pool were ample , comfortable and gave each user privacy. We even popped back in the morning before checkout.  We ate at the Tumblestone restaurant twice for lunch and breakfast and enjoyed the variety available on the menu of interesting food. It was beautifully cooked, presented and served. It is a bonus having such quality food on site, it was disappointing it wasn't open for a night cap when we arrived back at eleven pm. The art by Michael Johnson adds an vibrancy to the hotel that takes it to being a trendy colourful truly modern accommodation. The owners have totally transformed the old Mains Road building from the Sixties into an uber functional hotel for today. Give it a tryyou won't be disappointed.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_451365974~“Friendly and accommodating staff”~This was a great place to stay, an easy walk to shops, eateries etc. The staff were very accommodating when asking for extra items to be delivered to the room. It was a really easy walk to the shops and lots of cafes and eateries. A pity a lot of them were closed for holidays whilst we were there. We still managed to find some though. The staff went over and beyond their duty to make our stay very pleasant and comfortable.~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan

review_450540791~“Great pool”~This is a great find. Close enough to the city to access it but quiet enough to leave restful and refreshed. Rooms are lovely and clean, well stocked with a comfy bed.

review_450027787~“Fantastic stay”~The whole experience was very good. Great location, the staff were friendly and helpful. Tumbling Stone Restaurant had great service, friendly staff and very good quality food. The room had great quality beds(a must for us) the rooms were clean and spacious. The only disappointing fact was, no full length mirror in the room or hallway. And checking ones appearance is very important.  But I must say that the art pieces at the hotel were wonderful. Overall we were happy.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
