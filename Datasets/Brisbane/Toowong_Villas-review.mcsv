review_469564602~“Happily recommended ”~Stayed here for a week whilst visiting my daughter. Everything spotless. Had a one bedroom apartment which had a kitchen, washing machine and tumble dryer; given the humidity, those were a godsend. Everyone very pleasant and helpful too. Close to shops and train station in Toowong and about a 10 minute walk from Regatta City Cat dock which is a great way to get around. Have already booked to stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_465472392~“Great location, friendly staff”~Stayed there for 7 days while moving our daughter to UQ. Friendly staff, great location near mall, easy access, and spacious. Parking is limited but available. Wifi is free! :) The apartment has a washer/dryer, and dishwasher - super handy! The unit is comfortable and the items below are suggestions: 1. Replace both air cons - currently the units are old, noisy and not efficient enough. 2. Second bedroom does not have air con (it was hot in Brisbane!), and only a wall fan - also, old, noisy and not enough electricity outlets to plug in phones, etc. 3. Kitchen - nice and well maintained apart from the microwave which had a faulty button. 4. No extra linen - I washed ours after 4 days. 5. No pool towels~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan

review_453680786~“Family stay at Toowong Villas.”~My son, his wife, and four children and myself stayed in two units at Toowong Vilas in Brisbane for 6 nights after Christmas. We really enjoyed staying in the spacious apartments. The family of 6 had a 3 bed unit and were very comfortable. I had a one bedroom unit. They are fully self-contained and had everything we needed. Although a slightly older resort, the advantage was the rooms were bigger and we enjoyed having two swimming pools. Plenty of parking and being on a hill, we had a good view of the Southbank fireworks on New Year's eve. Saved us fighting the crowds at Southbank itself. Also enjoyed being close to the city, the river ferries, Toowong Village and Indooroopilly for shopping. This is the second time we have stayed at Toowong Villas and will do so again. Prices were fair to medium considering it was during the Christmas holidays.~4~4~nan~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_448182276~“First Visit”~My wife and I made a late visit to Brisbane for 2 nights including new years eve and we weren't sure what we'd get but we were very pleasantly surprised with everything here.The size and set up of our 2 bedroom unti and the excellent view of Brisbane from our balcony especially for new years eve fireworks.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_447650496~“Brisbane's best kept secret”~I have stayed here many times and I keep coming back. Why? Because it offers so much value for short stays in Brisbane. We always request a top floor 2 bedroom apartment that doesn't front the busy street, simply to get a higher room without an adjoining door. But I am fussy. Many people like the lower rooms. You get a full apartment, parking undercover and (walking) close proximity to Toowong, the train and the river walkway/cycleway along Coronation Drive. The prices remain reasonable for near-CBD in a busy city. Nearby Toowong has grocery stores and many shops and cafes, and the city is a 5 min trip away. The bedroom wall-mounted AC is noisy but a split system AC in the living room is enough to keep the heat of the night under control. It is all-round good value.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447063019~“Comfortable family place to stay”~Stayed for four nights in a two bedroom pet friendly ground floor apartment - No. 55 for $250 per night over Christmas. It was a comfortable stay – 2 lovely pools, big barbecue area with a number of tables, sandpit for the kids, undercover parking and a nice clean apartment with a kitchen that was well stocked with equipment. The apartment was comfortably furnished. Queen sized bed in main room with great robe space and a small television mounted on the wall. Second bedroom had two single beds and a robe. The outdoor area was a contained, paved courtyard with table and chairs. Useful items were the washing machine and dryer, clothes basket and airer, ironing board and iron. Free Foxtel and internet. Walking distance to shops and public transport. Short drive to the city and Southbank. Really enjoyed our stay and would be happy to come back again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_443757121~“The Roadtrip”~Toowong Villas is an apartment hotel set in a pleasant sidestreet in Toowong , a quiet suburb of Brisbane. Being an apartment hotel it has kitchen and washing facilities.  This is not a luxury hotel. The basics were in order. It was clean , there was adequate aircon and a balcony. There was a small swimming pool in the garden. There was plenty of shaded parking space . This was the starting point of the Roadtrip. A sufficiently large SUV had been rented for the estimated 10000 km long Roadtrip. We were ready to go. Four 70 year young guys. This hotel is walking distance from the Brisbane River and as summer was approaching it was very warm so one afternoon we took the ferry upriver where the banks are lined with villas, many new, but some of the old traditional sort are still there. Very scenic. If you want to eat well with some ambience in Toowong I can recommend the Regatta Hotel which has retained its victorian style by the Brisbane River. The selection of meat is especially good, and of course the selection of Australian wines is extensive. Really worth a visit. So having arrived at Toowong Villas on the 4.11., I left on the 8.11. for our next destination.The Hunter Valley wine district. To summerize our stay , I can say that Toowong Villas is a good place to stay, basic but with everything you need.~3~4~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan
review_441088272~“A home from home”~We stay here in our regular visits to see family in Brisbane and look forward to our stays every time.

review_438437066~“Very Peaceful with everything you need”~I stayed here for business because I was working nearby. The staff are lovely and helpful. The environment is really peaceful with all the trees and planting. The room had everything I needed, wifi is fast and easily accessible. The room was spacious and the little courtyard perfect. It is out of Brisbane but the city is accessible by public transport or ferry if you're happy to walk a bit. Great accommodation and price.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_433440725~“Everything you need”~We stayed at Toowong Villas with our young daughter for 6 weeks while in Brisbane for work. We can't rate it highly enough. The villas have everything you need - we were in one of the villas that hasn't yet been updated and it was still very comfortable if a little dated in decor. They are unusually large for serviced apartments but the thing that really sets them apart is the grounds: the pools are absolutely gorgeous and there is a fabulous BBQ area right next to some play equipment which makes for relaxed and easy evenings with little ones. The serenity of the property is impressive considering how close it is to Toowong Village shops as well as easy access to the city and ferry. And don't miss Corner Store cafe and Josie North for coffee - both just a short walk away.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_420789732~“Great getaway for you and your pet.”~We recently needed a few days in Brisbane and were pleased to be able to bring our little dog with us. We booked a two bedroom apartment. The apartment has a fully functioning kitchen with a full size fridge and stove. The main bedroom had an air conditioner and television. The second bedroom just had a fan, so might get a bit warm during summer. It was great being able to bring our little dog with us. As you would imagine, there was a bit of dog hair on the bed spread and on the couch, but if you are a dog person, you would be used to that anyway. The managers were very helpful and friendly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_399199408~“very comfortable and clean”~Nothing lacking for our family of four. Comfortable, clean, Well equipped. Convenient location, close to shopping centre, restaurants, trains and buses.

review_383862715~“Great place to stay”~Clean, roomy studio with good amenities. Waking distance to shops and restaurants at Toowong Village. Plenty of parking.

We stayed for 2 nights, one the second day, a maintaince worker came and said there is leakage in the bathtub and he had to stay to fix it.  just one little thing: there was a cockroach in the toilet and it made me and my son scream loudly.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_341407980~“Great place to stay with the family”~Just enjoyed a five night stay at Toowong Villas in one of their three bedroom apartments. There was plenty of room, for us (two adults and four children). Great storage within the apartment and would be well suited to much longer stay. The children particularly enjoyed the pool. I would happily recommend this accommodation.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_339772465~“A Return Visit, but..”~Have stayed here before, is good value older style accommodation, well maintained, good size rooms and amenities, walkable to Toowong Village and rail station. Driveway back to accommodation if walking back from Village etc is very steep.  Service is friendly, however, although the tariff included service daily this did not happen, beds not made and we had to chase for towels. Just received an apology from management as they overlooked it "as staff were not on for the day (saved them money) and they weren't busy". A curtain fell off the tracks and they "would fix it the next day", after we checked out. No compensation, a disappointing end to our visit.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~3~nan
review_338993755~“Toowong Villas”~Clean room - quiet with balcony / courtyard Good value for the price - We only stayed one night however we would stay there again  It was close to airport ( 20 minute drive) and very close to river cat so getting to Brisbane city for NYE was easy~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_338561907~“Great family accomodation”~A vey clean and spacious villa for our large family. It's also very close to shopping centre river cat and train station - all in walking distance.

review_338310146~“Great location. Spacious units to suit a variety of people.”~Great location walking distance to big shopping centre. Eg woolies,kmart. Quiet location and easy to find. Rooms to suit variety of people. We travelled in a large group of many families and our needs were met easily. Modern, clean units with air con which is a necessity. 2 swimming pools, BBQ area with plenty of seating. Car parking is a breeze even with a mini bus!! Our only criticism is that its a hilly area but that's Brisbane!! Hilly everywhere. You get to keep fit whilst holidaying.~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

review_336347913~“Toowong Villas”~The room was clean and spacious. Great bathroom, kitchen and laundry facilities. The staff were friendly and more than willing to help out. Only downside was the wifi cut in and out frequently and only two devices can be connected in 24 hours. Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would recommend particularly to families and group travellers.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_336093183~“Value for money”~The reception is friendly and helpful, Karen made sure everyone in our group has a bed, she even offered an extra unit free of charge, many thanks to her!

Highly recommended.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_334526786~“Wished we could have stayed longer.”~Staff are very good and helpful. Rooms are nothing special, but are exactly what you need when travelling. The rooms are big enough and beds are good. Two pools are great and bbq areas are as well and a bonus for kids a simple but effective playground. Well worth the stay. Location is also very handy to Brisbane city and areas around.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_333226609~“Adequate base; good location”~Not far from the motorway; close to Toowong Village shopping mall with restaurants and cafes; supermarkets nearby. Only ten minutes to University of Queensland and 15 minutes to CBD by car. It's an adequate base for a family visiting various city sights and venues. There's no lift. Hauling heavy luggage to top floor is not what you want after an eight hour drive. A broken fan and no air conditioning in a bedroom and a noisy air conditioner in the living room is despairing on a hot Brisbane night. Guests have to ask for the wifi password instead of it being offered in the first place. If these things were fixed the Villas would get a higher rating.~3~nan~nan~2~nan~3~2~nan
review_332820479~“Great unit close to everything”~Only needing one night accommodation, I was pleased to find Toowong Villas was available for a group of 4. The 2 bedroom ground floor villa was excellent value. The staff were very friendly and helpful. And although unable to enjoy them, there was a nice playground, BBQ and pool for guests usage. My only disappointment was that I could not stay longer! I would certainly recommend this property, and will stay again when next in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_332519712~“Nice”~The room was clean and had everything we needed. Loved the fact they had a little bit of laundry powder with the washing machine so we could do a last minute wash late at night and not have to go shopping to get some. The staff had a great knowledge of the local area and were able to answer all of our questions in relation to eating out, shopping and catching public transport and taxis. Guy on the desk even remembered why we were there and ask my daughter how she went in her competition, that is great customer service!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_331593141~“home close to the city”~A nice apartment for family. 3 of us stayed for 2 nights when we could not get apartment in the city. This was great as it was cheaper and close to shops and only 6 minutes into Queen Street and South Bank.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_330434750~“WEEKEND”~Quite relaxing facility priced well. The Manager was polite and helpful. Unit was well appointed and very clean.

review_330215780~“Toowong Villas”~Toowong Villas is situated in a lovely quiet street and yet is only a 10 minute drive to the South Bank / CBD. An added bonus is the Toowong Village shopping centre less than 1km away. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. I stayed in the two room apartments with 4 teenagers and it was perfect. I will definitely be booking there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_330196185~“Three bedroom Toowong Villas”~Friendly and accommodating management. Decor tired and outdated - didn't match the price - paid $700 for 2 nights. The pool was closed while we were there, which was disappointing. There was another pool but less suitable for small children. Fairly good location plenty of shops nearby.  Handy barbecue area and plenty of onsite parking. Don't rely on the 'free wi-fi' as its limited to 500mb and only one user can access at a time. Overall, I think it was over priced for what it offers, I've paid less for 6 nights in the Gold Coast for a similar style accommodation. But on the upside it was a hassle free enjoyable weekend away in a convenient location outside the CBD and only about 10 minutes drive to Southbank.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
