review_477892922~“Needs improvement”~Stayed for two nights during a work trip. Great location. The hotel itself had a strange odour in the corridor and the lifts were very slow. For the room, I had to reallocate to another room for my second night as I came back to find water all on the kitchen floor from a leaking aircon unit. The maintence guy was super helpful and friendly to help me move my bags. The rooms could be cleaner, the bathrooms were dark and the balcony windows did not seal closed so I got some rain in the room. I was looking forward to enjoying a serviced apartment instead of the normal hotel I stay in but sadly disappointed.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~3~nan
review_476990350~“Mixed reviews”~Oaks Festival is good, but had a really bad experience at Oaks on Charlotte street in Brisbane. The air con stopped working in my room around 9 PM, so I called & they checked & said they will move me to another room & I should wait for their call. They didnt call for 30 mins so I rang & was told they were fully booked out. I asked for a fan and they didnt have one. the lady night manager on duty at Oaks on Charolette st, was so indifferent & rude. She said open the windows & sleep, my room was on 30 floor & the windows hardly opened. This was in march which is peak summer in Brisbane. I had taken a 5am flight, had worked all day & this drama continued till midnight. I finally asked if they can move me to another property & they said their computer is not working, so I said they could call & check, which is what they finally did & got me a room at the Festival towers across the road. I had to move at 11.30 PM on my own to the new room & the lady manager never even showed her face to me. Her receptionist kept going in & out taking my message to her & bringing back her reply. Most disrespectful & arrogant behaviour for no reason at all. And this is when i was on a business trip.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_476964638~“Clean, spacious and everything we needed! ”~Excellent location in the heart of Brisbane. Great little kitchen and balcony which we enjoyed having a drink on while overlooking the city. The view was sensational!  The only negative was the smell in the hallway.  Overall, a neat apartment for an excellent price (we got a great deal). We would definitely come again!  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476265357~“Average ”~Positives were handy to main shopping area ,restaurants & mini Supermarketsm. Negatives our room on the tenth floor smelt of stale cigarette smoke & the hallway had a very damp musty smell which was quite unpleasant. Have stayed at better apartments.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475165812~“Nice hotel in a very central location”~We were staying at the Oaks for a week in a double room apartment. The apartment had a kitchen / living room with a nice eating place, two rooms with separate bathrooms and a small balcony.  The hotel has a small fitness area, a pool and a place to have your own BBQ.  If you step out of the hotel you find places to eat or shop everywhere. Its really in the centre, 5 minutes from the hotel is queens mall.  The receptions is in principle nice, I just had one guy who needed to explain me how to behave as a customer. This attitude I didn't like too much. The rest of the staff is going a great job.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~4~nan
review_474897628~“Good for family”~Place was good for couple night stay only problem was hallway spelt quiet bad  But close walking distance to everything  City centre of queen street was two blocks away  Great cafe down stairs out the front of hotel~3~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_472781416~“Nice spot average service. ”~Group of us stayed here in different rooms for a concert. Rooms are great. I requested more towels and pillows 7pm first night didn't happen. Cleaner came next day and put two towels in room and left everything else. Won't let you have more than six milk tubs for coffee whether there is one person or three.  Overall I like Oaks chain and stay in various ones from time to time. This one is in a fabulous location.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471578461~“review on oaks festival towers”~4 months ago in December i went to Brisbane in Australia, it is the best place ever. it should be a 5 star because the service is amazing, and the food is divine. i adore it so much and hope for more people to go there. It has the best location on the planet.  love from Marcus Sylvester xxxxxxx~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_470200915~“Nice budget hotel in the heart of cbd”~Stayed here one night for business as it looked centrally located. Drove into the car park and after figuring out the intercom and so on, finally found my way back to ground floor for the reception while parking my car in the visitor spot. Check in was effecient and they organised a parking spot for me in the secure area. Left my bags there as I had to go off to meetings. Came back later that night and got my bags and keys to the apartment. The apartment is spacious, just not as well appointed as one would expect, but still pretty clean and comfortable. Wifi is charged with the first 30 mins free. It is centrally located and plenty of shops around so it is convenient.~3~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470156590~“Bad service ”~Rude host unhelpful should be working as a morgue director not a front of reception. Not even trying to help find a solution. Be sure to look at your term na conditions for sneaky hidden charges too Tv wouldn't work . Said would come up and look. But Didn't bother coming. And the reception is supposed to be24 hour! I would not recommend them  Waited in car park with no direction on How to come up in lift cos they work  Rooms were clean and tidy tho~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470111048~“More than OaKsy”~Fantastic location with all the sites of Brisbane in easy walking distance. Rooms are spacious with a TV in the lounge and bedroom. Not that we were there to watch TV but great selection of sky channels and movies as well as the usual tv channels. Lifts can get a bit busy and take time to get in due to the amount of rooms they have. Reception was efficient checking us in and provided a good review of where to go locally. Good display of the old festival hall that stood on the site with many big stars of the day. Plenty storage space for your luggage and things. Great views should you get a room high up and quiet. Would not hesitate to go back there again as great value for money.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469696585~“Nice”~So for my partners Birthday I took advantage of a Brisbane sight special with Oaks 212 Margaret. The morning of check in they called me to say that they have moved us to Oaks Festival Towers, which was fine. We checked in and I thought the front office guy could have been abit more possible instead of telling us how much hes looking forward to going home. We walked into our room on the 6th floor to find that we were looking directly and very closely at a very ugly carpark and construction site. I then called reception straight away to advise that I was Not stayin in there and I specifically requested a view NOT looking at a construction site. She then quickly moved us to the 24th floor which was a much nicer room. Overall the stay was very pleasant and comfortable. Yes I would recommend staying there again, and glad we were there instead of 2 blocks further away from the city.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_469663173~“Quick business trip to Brisbane”~I regularly travel to Brisbane for business and the Oaks Festival Towers is my favourite place to stay. The staff are friendly, check in is easy, the rooms are a great size with the 'inside' balconies and kitchen facilities (for those you like cooking while they are away). it's located only a short walk from Queen St mall and there are several great restaurants nearby.~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_468761280~“Lovin Australia”~Out first time to Brisbane and this hotel is in a convenient location. Close to south bank and shops. Hotel was clean and spacious for family of 5. Full amenities with kitchen and laundry. You need to confirm if your rate includes wifi and parking but still good value.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468638144~“Quick weekend stay”~This hotel is in a great location, and the staff are lovely. They called us late on the evening we were checking in to ensure we were still on our way, which I appreciated after going through hell with delayed flights.  My only criticism is that both the floor and the room we stayed in were smelly. It was a very strong musky smell - hard to describe but very unpleasant.  I had stayed at this hotel before, and I do remember it smelling strange back then also - I wouldn't stay here again simply due to the smell of the rooms. You do get used to it, but as soon as you leave and come back you can smell it again - in the hallways, all the rooms etc.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~4~nan
review_466359235~“Always delivers”~I've stayed here on many occasions. It is my go-to when traveling to Brisbane. It is usually really well priced and the staff have always been friendly at reception. The rooms have always been clean and ready and the pool and gym are also just what you need. Location is very convenient for anything in cbd. I'll keep coming back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_466266268~“Convenient Central Location and Economical”~We originally booked for the oaks apartments in Margaret Street however as it was overbooked our booking was transferred to Festival Towers. Which worked out perfectly for us as it was more closer to Queen Street and our intent to head to Brisbane was for a short shopping getaway. We had an excellent rate, definitely affordable and you get more than what you pay for. The rooms are generous in sizing and we stayed in a one bedroom apartment. The shower and toilet was separate which was convenient. The bed was a king so it was spacious. It definitely felt comfortable; home away from home kind of vibe. I firmly prefer to stay in these kind of apartments than a hotel room in Brisbane CBD that's for sure. The service was average. For parking, we had to pay additional $25 a night which is good value considering the location. The only thing I had slight issue with was the access to get in and park. Also it would be beneficial when the staff called to confirm the booking and parking was added to the booking to explain how to get to the address and where to park in the interim whilst attending the check in process. We weren't aware of the loading bay which was oddly positioned and we had to find and pay for parking on the side approximately two streets away in order to just check in. Which I felt was unnecessary. However overall great experience and would stay there again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_464864724~“quick overnight stay”~Have stayed here a few times now, ticks all the boxes for a city stay, location is second to none, right by Queen st mall, and casino. The rooms are modern, clean, comfortable and the right price. another bonus is parking for $25.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~4~4~nan
review_463117385~“Fabulous place to stay”~We've stayed here 3 times over the last couple of months and have enjoyed our stay on each occasion. All 3 rooms were very comfortable and clean with everything you could possibly need including a lovely view. Check in and out is extremely easy and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Parking is available for a very reasonable price as well. It's a great place to stay if you want easy access to the Queen Street Mall as well as Southbank and QPAC. Everything is within walking distance. We will definitely stay here again.~4~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_461561776~“Well located, busy accommodation ”~We stayed in a fairly spacious 2 roomed apartment on 33 rd floor. Good views and well supplied with welcome teas, bathroom soaps. The parking is beneath the building an a tight circular drive to the basements. I scraped the car so watch out. There is a key fob entry system. We also spent a good while circling the one way system to find the apartments that are on a corner, despite using the sat nav. As the place is so central it's easy to sample the local restaurants, bars and shops. To be enjoyed~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_460797720~“Changed location and smells”~The room itself was nice and worth the money, but other issues happened that took away from 5 stars. All the hallways and car parks smell really bad, not sure of what but very musky and damp smell. We booked margaret 212 online and also got a discount with free wifi. They called us a few days before the booking to speak to us but when we gave a call back, it rang continuously with no answer all four times. We arrived and they told us that we're now in a different hotel down the street which I wasn't happy about because I booked Margaret street to be on the same street I used to live on. I also booked a specific room to have a bathtub and because of the location change, there was no bath tub and also had to pay $25 per day to park in the parking lot when I was informed it was free parking. Plus the windows are not tinted and the people in the building next to me could see us changing. So even though the room looked nice, there were a lot of other issues that we weren't pleased about.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_459498872~“In the heart of Brisbane!”~We had a 2 room apartment on the 39th floor. The front reception staff were friendly and very helpful, especially as one of my travelling companions had lost her handbag! Nothing was too much trouble! The rooms were large and comfortable, with modern facilities and a fabulous view. Located very centrally to the shops and restaurants, we really enjoyed our stay and wish we had longer in Brisbane! I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.~4~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_458981512~“Service Okay Great location ”~Stayed at the Oaks Festival Towers for the weekend to watch the Brisbane Global 10s Rugby Union event. Initially on arrival was greeted cold faced by the reception staff member, ask her politely that I made a request for a higher floor and was quickly shut down with "you can request things but we cannot guarantee it". Having experienced bad staff days in the past the best remedy is being over polite back to them with comments like "thanks so much" , "greatly appreciate you efforts" and the simple icebreaker "please", if this fails then I respond with the same attitude I am receiving. In this case the reception staff member came around and was pleasant with a smile and we got Level 18 corner room which was great. Being polite does work. The 2 bedroom apartment is adequate room sizes are good, comfortable beds and clean cannot fault it and great city skyline views. I suppose the only set back is, it might be time soon to renovate the bathrooms a little as they are showing signs of well used and their age. Otherwise we enjoyed it, felt safe which is always our main priority. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_458567695~“CBD convenience”~We stayed on the 35th floor - what a view. 15 minutes walk from Central Station and 15 minutes walk from QPAC. Close to lots of restaurants. Very clean with courteous and friendly staff. The only downer is that WiFi is free for ONLY 30 minutes per day. Best practice would suggest free WiFi 24/7 as in most other accommodations.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_457446068~“nice apartment but rude reception staff. ”~I recently booked a two bedroom apartment for 1 night at oaks 212 Margaret. Upon phoning them to see if my room was available for an early check in, I was told that I had been reallocated to another hotel, festival towers. I am disappointed that I didn't receive a phone call or an email to let me know this. If I had driven to the Margaret hotel to be told this I would have been very annoyed! On check in I found the staff member quite abrupt but I could see she was under pressure as they were extremely busy. I got up to my room and saw that the door to the second bedroom was locked. I tried to phone down to reception and there was no answer. I waited 5 minutes and tried to phone again. Still no answer. I then went down to reception to ask if the door could be unlocked as this is what I had booked & paid for. The receptionist told me "you could've just phoned from your room." I then waited over 20 minutes for somebody to come up & unlock the door. I then had to head out & ask another receptionist to get someone to unlock the door. Overall the apartment was good, however the customer service & lack of communication left me feeling disappointed.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_454584466~“Horrible Service”~I always stay at the Oaks apartments as they have always been a convenient hotel choice to stay at while travelling and apartments are always lovely. Although I decided to stay at the Oaks Festival Towers in Brisbane for my an event in December. Plans change and I was unable to stay so I tried to cancel and was told if I cancelled I would still have to pay full amount. 320 for a 19 year old uni student? For not even staying. I was told I could move the date as to when I would stay with the Oaks Festival Towers and I chose that as I had no other option. They told me I could make no further changes to the room or cancel. We didn't necessarily need the room and I wasn't allowed to cancel they had told me so we didn't show.  The main reason why I am upset and will never be booking with the Oaks again is due to how rude the lady was on the phone to me as I explained I was unable to pay due to having sufficient funds and in between moving houses. I told her I would love to talk to someone to put me on a payment plan. After harrassing me everyday and taking 50 dollars out of my account weekly for the past two weeks I have just found they have frozen $300 from my account.  Be very careful with cancelling your books or switching accom, because they are EXTREMELY rude, unhelpful and un forgiving. I'm sure not all of their receptionists operate in this manner but I felt like I was being bullied into making payments from the lady I spoke to on the phone a week ago.~1~1~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_454455810~“Very Central”~We recently stayed for 4 nights, have previously stayed on many occasions as to the fabulous location, Apartments are large clean with friendly staff & provide a lovely outdoor balcony area to sit at or just enjoy the view & sunshine. We had a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen, lounge, dining, washing machine & dryer, balcony. All the Oaks chain have great beds & pillows, we will always frequent here as so near to the Queen Street Mall, cafes & Restaurants. Just a short walk to eagle street pier also if you would like to try the array of dining there. Nandos is at the base of the building as well as a bottle shop. Pancake Manor is just 2 mins walk away,~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453462046~“One week break in Brizvegaz”~My family and I love staying here. The staff are always friendly & accommodating and it's so conveniently located in Brisbane's CBD.  It's great for families with young kids as well as those traveling for business. My mum often stays here on work trips & she loves it! Having previously lived in Brisbane for a few years, this place is highly recommended if you want to check out all the great things the city has to offer.  Side note - if you're on a budget try to take advantage of the 'mate's rates' when booking via wotif. It's a little more cheaper than booking direct but do read the t+c's Luania Temu & fam/Patricia Kila - PNG~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_453444862~“Central to everything Brisbane”~We stayed here for a week over Christmas and couldn't believe how central to everything we were,  We booked a two bedroom apartment, and check in was a breeze, very helpful staff, and a first rate room, so clean. Nothing was too much for the staff who were very friendly,  My mother is in a wheelchair, and the room was very spacious for her to move around in, really enjoyed the outside balcony area which can also be closed off. Such a great Apartment and experience we are booked again for next Christmas.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_452515945~“Oaks Festival Tower 1st visit”~The Festival Tower is virtually in the middle of the Brisbane city. It's conveniently close to everything in the city. Walking distance to the Treasury Casino, major retail shops, supermarkets, Botanical gardens,.. and if you enjoy walking then only a 20min walk to Southbank. We walked to southbank everyday(7) except once catching the free city cat from Eagle St pier-fantastic short free boat ride. Southbank beach is where you go to chill daily on the sand or lawn area and take regular refreshing dips in the man-made beach. There are also life guards on duty and they do an excellent job. There's a separate pool/beach & play equipment for the kids too. Cafes, bars, shops, markets and the big ferris wheel are all set behind this fabulous place. We're going back.  The staff are very friendly and quick to fix a few minor hiccups from housekeeping. There were no spare pillows in the room and when requested we got only one. Most days the housekeeper either forgot to leave a clean tea towel, or dishwashing or washing machine sachet. The pool area is good but the spa needs to be updated. Two BBQs for such a big complex isn't enough and there should be signs informing guests that the BBQs need to be booked at reception. We had it booked and we felt sorry for another guest who didn't know about booking, so we offered ours as the other group wasn't moving and they were there from 6-10pm! So, how can anyone else use these limited facilities? BBQ times should be reduced to 1hr(not 2hr) and provide more tables on the unused lawn area so guests can move to the tables once they have finished cooking. Only 2 tables & 2 BBQs for 2hrs isn't ideal. Only a suggestion because it is a good area set up on the 4th level.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~3~4~nan
review_452255599~“cricketing weekend”~We have stayed at Festival Towers before and enjoyed the experience so we booked here again for the Big Bash game on in Brisbane this week. On getting to our room, we were disappointed as it was nothing like the room we had last stayed in, so I went back to reception on the off chance there was another room available. The man at reception was extremely helpful. The hotel was almost fully booked, but he changed our room to one with an amazing view of the city from the Storey Bridge right around to the Gabba cricket ground. There was heaps of space for the family and the room was very clean and comfortable. It's right in the city centre and very easy to get to the cricket via public transport~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan

review_451358090~“festival filth”~we stayed 3 nights. Our first night was dreadful. We checked in and were so disappointed. we went out to dinner and returned to really look at the apartment. actually took pictures to report. Old, rusty, dirty bathrooms, brown stains on pillows and mattress protector disgusting! Air conditioner socket mouldy and hanging off the wall!! Absolutely couldn't sleep there. Moved rooms which ruined our night completely. Had to pack and get everything out at about 11.00pm. We were exhausted. New room identical and a bit cleaner, no upgrade for our trouble. In fact when we went to cancel the third night, with 2 days notice, management argued the point rather than being apologetic. Don't stay there please.~1~3~4~nan~nan~nan~1~nan

review_450013822~“Hotel review ”~Great location if you want to be in the city.. originally booked for oaks on charlotte street but apparently they over booked that location so sent us to the busier motel which was crap.   I found the entire corridor to stink like rotten rubbish and food. It was so bad you had to cover your nose to walk quickly from lift to the room. The smell started to come into the room we asked what the smell was and informed it was the rubbish shoot. The lifts were very slow and took a good ten minutes to get to your room or to the ground floor.  Apartment size good and clean. Bed a bit hard. Shower pressure was good.  Limited WIFI sucks only get half hour a day per room.  ~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_448403471~“Central and consistently good”~I've stayed here a few times and have always been satisfied with my choice. Location is fabulous in the centre of town, one block from Queen Street Mall. Everything within easy walking distance....grocery store, ATM, bottle shop, restaurants, theatre, South Bank, museum, shopping ++ .... Literally everything. It has a nice pool area and small gym (two treadmills). Also has parking at $25/night. I've always had a nice view of the city and glimpses of Brisbane River. The apartments have a small but adequate kitchen (l've only ever made breakfast), washer/dryer, balcony/indoor/outdoor area. Very comfortable, clean and good customer service. Haven't tried their wifi which they charge for. Crazy. Should be standard inclusion these days.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_447925834~“Typical Oaks”~Oaks are well established in Australia; they are very consistent. They typical offer you a serviced apartment; you get a kitchen; Barbie in the common area and a pool! Works really well for me. This one is right above a Nando's; which is heavenly! And plenty of good cafes and other eats downstairs. In the heart of the CBD; made Boxing Day shopping a breeze! One of my favorites in the CBD.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447639567~“Very Good Apartment if not for Strange Smell along common corridor”~Stayed in the apartment with my family of four from 06 to 08 Dec 2016. Pros: 1) Conveniently located 'in Brisbane City Central', 2) Lots of restaurants/ pubs/cafes around, 3) inside the apartment itself, it is clean and tidy + also beautifully and very well furnished (absolutely no complaints on that...) 4) Customer service is great as the staff are very friendly and efficient! Con(s): 1) One and Only problem is that the common corridor that leads to your apartment 'smelled really horrible and revolting'..... It smelled like something that has rotten.... We were puzzled initially by this bad smell (where it came from) until when we need to go to the rubbish chute at the common area to throw our rubbish. The bad smell must have come from the rubbish chute, and to make the matter worse... the air circulation around the common corridor areas that lead to the apartment was very bad or not working (at least on the 27th floor that we stayed). I would have rated the Oaks Festival 5 stars if not for that really bad smell at common corridor area!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_447338221~“City center and great hotel”~Great location! Complete amenities! Laundry, iron, kitchenette, fast wifi, a short walk away from Queen Street Mall. I loved the place! The room where we stayed faced the next door carpark so we didn't really have a good view. It had a small balcony so if the room faces the streets I'm sure the view would be great.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Briabane was very active on Christmas Day with alot of eateries open. The room was modern and clean.

review_446824540~“A Disappointing Experience”~Despite advising the Hotel three times by e-mail that I would be arriving about 6:30am on the Sunday morning following an International flight, the Two Bedroom Apartment was not available for my family and that we would have to wait 7.5 hours to check-in. Not the greatest welcome for my family's first visit to Brisbane. Whilst admitting that my e-mails have been received by the Hotel, the uncooperative Reception Staff made no effort to accommodate my Family and kept saying that if I wanted an early check-in (that meant before 14:00hrs) then I should have also reserved the room for the previous Saturday night, despite not staying in it !  Surely the Hotel should have responded to my e-mails informing of their strict 2;00 pm check-in and then I could either have booked another Hotel; taken a later flight; or made alternative sleepy arrangements.  Eventually, on checking into the Serviced Apartment at 15:00hrs, I found to my astonishment that there was no safe and that I was only allowed 30 minutes free Wi-Fi. I travel extensively throughout Asia and never have I experienced such poor communication and lack of facilities.  But the situation gets worse. My wife left her bracelet on the bedside table whilst we vacated the room to visit the nearby shops and allow the Apartment to be cleaned. Unfortunately my wife's bracelet "went missing" never to be seen again. Would a room safe have helped ? Maybe !  Cleanliness was poor. My daughters bed sheets and pillow were stained in two places but were never replaced during out 3 night stay. Also the cutlery and crockery needed a good clean.  Requested a late check-out, but was informed that I would have to pay an additional AUD 50.00 to stay till 12.00 Noon. I politely refused. Reception graciously offered to "store my luggage free of charge" whilst I went out for breakfast. An offer I could not refuse as everything else provided by this Hotel incurred an extra payment, from early check-in; to Wi-Fi (after 30 minutes);to car parking, and to late check-out.  Now the fun starts; on checking out I was informed that the Hotel were unable to return my AUD 75.00 deposit as it was paid by a UK Credit Card. It took me several days and over half-dozen telephone calls to UK and Australia from my home in Bali to get this issue resolved at an expense far in excess of AUD 75.00.  I understand that the Oaks Festival Towers is built on the site of an old Music Hall.......well this experience has certainly given me the Brisbane Blues.~2~2~nan~3~nan~nan~1~nan
review_446203473~“One of the best hotels in Brisbane ”~I love everything about the oaks. I've stayed there in 2013 and in 2014 tried Charlotte towers which is next to it, both really enjoyable.  The last time I visited festival towers was in October 2016 and I would do it any time again! The apartments are quite big, I stayed both times on really high floors which gives you a really nice view if you're not as acrophobiac as I am.  The balcony door and windows are the only weird thing, took me a while to work them out. The apartment is fully furnished and fully equipped.  The outdoors pool and jacuzzi have a special feel because they're surrounded by CBD towers which is pretty cool. There's great food in Brissy, but for a lazy bite, head downstairs to Nando's, very convenient if you just don't want to go anywhere. But at the same time, everything is walking distance from you. Left my keys once at work, so the reception staff were very helpful and courteous while helping out.  But my absolute best experience with festival towers was in 2014 when the one bedroom serviced apartments were fully booked and I had an upgrade to the two bedroom apartments.. I wish that can happen every time! I'd give oaks - both festival towers and Charlotte towers - 5 stars.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_445419208~“Perfect placement in the heart of Brisbane”~Stayed here for a couple of days and it was a blast. The hotel got great placement in the heart of Brisbane and you get a big flat where you can either cook your own meals or use the space to hang out with friends or family.  The room was tidy and clean. Great view from the balcony even though we lived on the lower floors (18 of 41). The pools were lovely and they have a great outdoor place where you can have bbq. I recommend this place for those who want a bigger place to stay at and you really do get lots for what you pay for.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_445417938~“Great service and clean modern rooms”~I stay here for two nights on 9/12 and found the service great. The staff at the check in counter were very polite and catered for all my request and the room was clean, modern with a great view. The location of the hotel is what I would stay very close to the center of Brisbane city and everything was walking distance to the places I wanted to be. Queen street mall is about a 3 minute walk and the eagle street pier for dinning is about a 3 minute walk in the other direction. For me, not being right in the city center was great because there was less traffic and noise.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~4~nan
review_444746737~“Perfect location”~The hotel is in a great central location with awesome restaurants and shopping on your doorstep. The room was large, extremely clean with full amenities. The staff were always friendly and helpful during our stay. I would definitely go back~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_444161328~“Great stay”~Not being from Brisbane, we didn't realise how central the hotel was. We arrived early and the staff were happy to store our luggage until we could check in. When we eventually checked in (we went out for lunch); it was quick and easy and all the staff were very friendly! We had booked a two bedroom suite and were so impressed with the size and cleanliness! We will definitely be back for our next girls weekend away. Thank you!~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan
review_443163939~“Lovely clean room and a safe, friendly, comfortable place to stay”~The room layout is neat and functional. There is a kitchenette with all amenities. It appears there are lots of people who cook food in their rooms and the funky smells in the hallway mean that you can usually work out what each family is having for dinner). The bathroom is large. The room is comfortable and I was on the 19th floor and it was extremely quiet. There are two televisions (one in the bedroom). My only wish is to have more space on the bathroom sink to put my stuff (but I have the same problem nearly everywhere I go). I went to the gym, sauna, spa and pool each day. I felt safe and calm so I slept like a log!~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
