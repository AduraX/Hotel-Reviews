review_461799896~“Comfort? Maybe. But "Airport", - In Name Only.”~Let's talk about the good parts of this Inn first of all. The rooms are comfortably furnished, - with a decent queen-sized bed, air conditioning, television, shower and toilet unit, and so on. Sleep quality was fine. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and made us feel most welcome. Additionally, a Continental Breakfast was served at no extra charge. However, where things went terribly wrong for us is that this is NOT an "Airport" hotel as we would understand it. Our travel agent had booked this hotel on the basis that it WAS an "Airport" hotel. (the Inn is shown as being one of Brisbane Airport's hotels on various travel websites). We arrived on a flight in Brisbane's Inrternational Airport at 1.00 - 1.30 a.m., after a 30 hour journey that had originated in the UK. The flight wasn't delayed, - this is the normal time of arrival for one of Emirate Airline's planes (arriving from Dubai, via Singapore) . After being driven to the hotel, we arrived at about 2.00 a.m. to find reception closed and the place in darkness. Our driver was savvy about these matters, and obtained our room key by dialling a number on a special phone that was outside reception. Whoever answered the phone then provided a number which when keyed in to an adjacent box opened the box to provide the room key. Our room on this occasion was on an upper story, which was reached by two flights of stairs on an external metal stairway. Our driver was extremely noble, and carried our cases for us up this stairway, opened the room for us, and helped us sort out the air conditioning. Please know that we are both in our 70s, and that without the help of the driver at this late hour we would have been in a considerable fix. We returned to this hotel three days later before catching onward flight connections, and at least had been allocated a ground floor unit on this occasion. But needing an evening meal, we were directed to a sports club that is a few hundred yards up the road. This club served food to both members and non-members. I am concerned that this hotel was included on our itinerary by our travel agent as you will find it listed as one of Brisbane's "Airport Hotels" on various websites. An "Airport Hotel", as I understand it, is one which has a 24 hour reception, has food available on site, and which does not expect guests to carry luggage up to their room on an external staircase. Next year Brisbane is hosting the Commonwealth Games and there will be plenty of people arriving on late night flights who need an "Airport" hotel. Hopefully, there won't be too many "oldies" like us who discover that this hotel, - although clean and friendly, is far from being one that suits the needs of the middle-of-the-night traveller.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~3~nan
review_443218815~“Adequate”~Needing an airport hotel in Brisbane in a hurry, my travel agent listed a few and this one seemed like an ok distance and price. The highlight of the stay was the helpfulness of the staff who answered all questions and made airport transport arrangements. Another good thing was the 15 minute walk to the river warf area with lots of restaurants and stores. Overall this is a very basic motel that is serviceable and a decent price.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~3~5~nan
review_436696929~“Overnight stay”~The room was clean & fresh with a queen & single bed. On ground level which was great. The staff were very helpful & nice. It is located close to eatery's as well as the airport & port. I highly recommend this place for a stay.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~4~5~nan
review_392691883~“Standard Motel”~Pretty much what you should expect from a motel. A few bucks more than most of the places we have stayed in the last 3 weeks but it does include a continental breakfast. Our road trip has taken us down the coast of Queensland from Cairns to Coffs Harbour if you care to read about other places see our not for profit blog at havecarryonwilltravel.com. Contrary to what one of the other reviewers mentioned I did not find the area sketchy at all. In fact I thought the neighbourhood to be quite pleasent. There are numerous places to eat on Racecourse Rd. A short walk away and we walked every night. The tram is also close so we took it to downtown every day, expensive ride but very efficient. It is also reasonably close to the airport and the port so if you are headed out of town it could serve you well. The bed is firm, the pillows are good and there are lots of them, the room is clean. My only concern is the noise, it is on a busy road and the traffic runs by all night long, but it is in a big city and that should be expected. The AC machine sounded as if a airplane was in the room and the bar fridge hummed very load. I brought these matters to the attention of the manager and he told me they are in the process of redoing the AC and he would simply purchase a new fridge. If this comes to be I would consider the establishments customer service to be top knotch. If in Brisbane again the motel would be on my list of place to check out.~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_389917406~“Close to the Airport is the best thing...”~A quality stay I cannot promise but for $140 including breakfast it's OK - TV aerial cable was broken - maintenance obviously a little issue. No evening meals available but a short walk across the road takes you to a local RSL for a reasonable meal and pokies if you wish. Not a great part of town so watch yourself on the streets late at night. The elderly lady on reception could learn to smile and offer some courtesy, all in all - just an OK place to stay.~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan~2~nan
review_379251002~“Made me so comfortable!”~My hosts were so helpful and accommodating - gave me all the information I needed, and then some. Carried my bags to my room as well. And the bed! So wonderfully comfortable - colour me happy! 4 oversized pillows as well! Had the best sleep. Felt like home.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_379203571~“Our Choice!”~We have Ben staying at this motel on and off now for several years. It is convenient to the airport and Brisbane central also the cruise ship terminal. Recently new management has taken over and they are lovely. Nothing is to much trouble. We were graciously given a free breakfast on our last stay which was continental, with a twist. Delicious fresh self made pancakes, cereals, toast, fruit and really good coffee. I would highly recommend it. Spotlessly clean, close to everything, including a restaurant strip a couple of streets over toward the wharf and the bowls club you can walk to fr dinner. Our motel of choice!~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_326099654~“Very nice”~They have nice big rooms & very clean. Some road noise goes quite at night. Good parking available. I liked it and will be using this place again. It was one of the nicer motels I have used in that area, we were flying out of Brisbane Airport.~4~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan
review_322508048~“Not accommodating; felt ripped off.”~My travel friend booked a room at this hotel on-line for 2 of us, as we needed a place to stay for 1 night prior to international travel. She had called and said that there might be 3 people and was assured that would not be a problem. When 3 of us arrived at 6pm by cab, we were told that 1) they could not put 3 of us in the room b/c it was a queen, and they do not have any pull-out sofa or roll-away bed (RU kidding me?). We would have slept on the floor, and were willing to pay more money, but were denied that option. 2) They could not change our room, b/c we booked it on-line. REALLY??? If there was a room, WHY not try to help us out and change our room? What, exactly, did they want us to do? Well, they wanted us to book "the only" remaining room that they had for $155, that's what. So, due to their lack of flexibility to accommodate our situation, we had NO choice but to pay for TWO rooms.  There was a restaurant on the property, which was closed. I had asked if breakfast was included for our double price, and were told no. This property is in the middle of a residential area, and there was no place in site to eat. We were sent several blocks in the dark in an unknown place to find a place to eat. In the morning, I had asked to speak to the manager to express my dismay. The Manager argued with me, and told me that the extra room that WE paid for "was already booked, as someone had paid for it to permit them to check in early."!!! So, she was admitting that she was double-charging for the room that we, and someone else also had paid for to get into early! This was enraging. As we were waiting for our cab, the Manager offered my friend free breakfast, clearly knowing we would decline. My friend in the 'other' room had tried to call twice (before 11p) for a wake up call, but there was no answer. If we had hoped to sleep in, that would not have happened. At 0700, sharp, two leave blowers (or some loud machinery) went into action just outside our window. The pool looked to be the size of a parking space and was squeezed into a space next to the parking lot. The WIFI was not activated unless we went to log on in the lobby, and then didn't even work when we were in the rooms. No elevator, so lugged 3 weeks of luggage up the stairs.~2~nan~3~nan~3~nan~1~nan
review_318762655~“Great Value Overnighter?”~Living outside Brisbane but with an early morning flight can pose a problem. I recently discovered the Airport Admiralty. Just down the road from Brisbane Airport this establishment is easy to find, remarkably clean and quite good value. With the early morning flight it proved a great place to stay. If I had known that it had the quite nice pool I might have arranged to get there a bit earlier. Great clean quite rooms and parking that is not crowded~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_286539999~“Best motel close to Airport”~After visiting Queensland, we always stay at this motel, great especially for early morning flights, 10/15 mins by car/ taxi, depending on time of day, very comfortable and clean rooms, now with the added advantage of a microwave and dishes.  Across the road from Hamilton bowls club and their very nice restaurant  Close to both Doomben & Eagle Farm racetracks,   Bus, Train & Ferry to Brisbane all within walking distance~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_278928640~“Comfortable, reasonable price & close to airport”~I looked online for a motel close to Brisbane airport for an international departure next morning. This motel met my needs as it was quiet, comfortable, reasonably priced, the breakfast good value and only 12 minutes drive to the airport. I wandered over the road to the bowling club for a nice dinner. This motel is not the Ritz but is good value.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_274905926~“Cheaper option than the Novotel”~The motel is 10 mins taxi ride from the airport (30 dollars). The motel is clean and tidy with a few reno's going on. This is a perfect place if your looking for a quick sleep whilst waiting for a flight connection. But if you have the cash I'd definitely spend the night in the Novotel~3~nan~3~nan~3~nan~nan~nan
review_266548286~“Very Modern”~We had a very modern standard size room with a queen size and a single bed. Very clean room, the fridge was full of drinks and snacks for which you had to pay. There was a restaurant which provided breakfast only. The pool is unheated and doesn't look as though it gets much use, but then this is not a family orientated motel as it is close to the airport and its use would be mainly for business people. The Wi-Fi is free and works well. Plenty of car parking. There is about a 20min walk to catch the ferry cat (which makes for a very pleasant trip to Brisbane CBD) and about a 15min walk to the shopping centre at the wharf or the shops and restaurants along Racecourse road. Over the road is a fish and chip shop. There is a train station also near by.~4~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan
review_260779480~“Spacious room, Quiet”~Reasonably priced, nice rooms, walking distance to the Bowling Club which was the restaurant and bar , Air conditioned rooms. Car under cover, close to the airport. Rooms are spacious , as usual turn off the bar fridge . would use them again~5~4~3~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_259327962~“Unhappy”~We have previously stayed here a couple of years ago. Unfortunately this time the room smelled sweaty and the smell of body odour lingered in the room. The air conditioner filter needed cleaning and the room deodorise.~3~3~5~nan~2~4~4~nan
review_251997119~“Some renovations happening (polite hours)”~Simple motel with efficient staff. Currently undergoing some renovations during polite hours (unless shift worker). 2 levels - ground ok. Upper level had balcony :) but also required stairs to get too :( if you have heaving luggage.  Bathroom very clean but shower rose build for 5' people.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_243234347~“Convenient to airport and fine if you just want to sleep”~10 mins to domestic airport. Small but clean room with a comfy bed. It was quiet after I turned off the noisy bar fridge. No mozzie screens on window, guess that's ok if you can sleep with the air con on... I can't, so it was a bit hot. Receptionist was lovely and helpful. Motel served my purpose as I was only there for about 5 hours between a late flight arrival and early departure and was asleep for most of it. Have paid less for nicer motels but the location is what you pay for.~3~3~5~nan~3~3~5~nan
review_241642220~“Nice place to stay”~I stay here regularly for work and find it very comfortable. The reception staff are always happy and helpful. The rooms are simple, but have everything that would need for an overnight stay. Meals can be bought from The Gallopers restaurant across the road which are very reasonably priced and very nice.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_237949384~“Great stay”~We enjoyed our stay - clean and tidy rooms with everything we needed. Enjoyed the pool and outdoor area to catch up with family members who were also staying there. Great location and would definitely stay again. Excellent and quick communication via the website.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_226761200~“Tidy and close to the airport”~We didnt get in till late and left early to meet a flight. The room was clean and tidy with a spa bath. Nice comfy beds and friendly staff. Reasonablly quite and close to the train station if you are travelling from the city.~4~3~nan~3~nan~nan~3~nan
review_222085824~“Convenient location, nice room”~This motel belies its star rating. It is well placed near restaurants, airport parking and the cruise terminal. The rooms are reasonably large, well maintained and the furnishings are excellent. In particular the bed was firm (which we like) and not soft and bendy as so often found. We have stayed elsewhere but think we have now found the spot for the overnight stay before a trip.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_218698253~“Delighted with our room in this convenient motel”~Arrived early evening for an overnight between flights. Staff at reception were welcoming and very helpful, advising on nearby places to eat. Pleasantly surprised at the size of our room and facilities available. Tea / coffee making facilities, TV and free WiFi and air con. The bathroom was a bit small but had all we needed. Overall, room and bathroom were clean and fresh. The cooked breakfast was a delicious and there was plenty of coffee available from the coffee machine for an early 'kick start'.  Reception helpfully booked a taxi for us to return to the airport. This is a 2 story motel and some guests had their cars parked outside their rooms. We had a ground floor room which suited us well,  Overall, would recommend this motel for a stay near the airport.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_213668376~“Perfect pre-cruise accommodation”~Spent a couple of nights here before boarding our first cruise. A short walk to the ship's berth with the advantage off being away from the busy and noisy Kingsford Smith Drive. Great dining options at Portside and Racecourse Rd. Spotless room, good wi-fi and staff helpful when needed. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_208480943~“Staff”~on my recent stay i found the reception staff to be unhelpful and quite rude. no assistance was offered to call a cab, no warm welcome on arrival after a long trip, very unpleasant experice on arrival and departure. would not stay here again as i would expect to be greeted respectfully, maybe even a smile from the owner.!~3~3~3~3~3~4~2~nan
review_198015780~“Clean comfortable and friendly staff”~This is great location close to the airport, cruse ship terminal and close to some great places to eat. I was not expecting great things from a motel, but I was blown away at how well maintained, clean comfortable and quiet this place was. Great wifi and excellent airconditioning in the room was a huge bonus and it was also great to have a restaurant on site for breakfast with very reasonably priced continental or cooked breakfast options. The staff were just so friendly and helpful and i wished i was staying longer than an overnight stay, as i felt welcome and at home. When I arrived, it was a warm greating and I was given some great tips for restaurants and where to explore when going for a walk. I really do reccommend this property and will look forward to staying again.~5~4~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_195132818~“Good A/C, excellent Wi-Fi”~Fairly new motel with good air conditioning. Shaded parking is provided. Free Wi-Fi was excellent, with a simple single-time password and no limit on the number of devices. Why can’t all hotels make it so simple? It was a bit difficult to see the hotel sign from the road because of the trees, so I missed it the first time.~4~3~3~4~3~3~3~nan
review_194590584~“Clean, you pay for location”~We booked a room here in order to be close to the airport for an early flight. It is expensive for a small motel room with thin walls, but it is very clean with nice amenities. We did laundry which is $4.00 each for wash and dry. It is close to many nice restaurants, walkable if you feel like it. We did not hear any street notice, just the TV from next door.~3~3~5~4~3~5~3~nan
review_189946575~“clean and close to the airport”~my wife and I stay regularly at the Comfort Inn but this is my first review of the motel. It is very clean, close to good eating venues and close to the airport. The staff are friendly and helpful, always good value for money.~4~4~4~4~4~4~4~nan
review_185141672~“Had the best night's sleep here!”~This motel was extremely clean and we stayed in what looked like a newly refurbished room with a balcony. I'm a very poor sleeper and I was happy to say I had the best night's sleep here in a long time. The cost of the room was excellent value and I liked the location. I think this will be our regular place to stay in Brisbane going forward.~4~5~4~5~4~5~4~nan
review_183219911~“Good motel close to Airport.”~This motel is located near the airport, with a club across the road which serves meal. Reception was staffed by a friendly lady & check in was no hassle. Rooms are large enough with an adequate bathroom. Will stay there again.~4~3~4~4~3~4~4~nan
review_172445390~“Clean & comfortable”~Although we have stayed many times,this our first review, it was pleasing that renovations have been done, room really welcoming as was reception, so convienent to town, with bus almost at door, but our preferred transport to town is the City cat , about 15 min stroll away, also Doomben rail station just around the corner. Reasonable close to airport and depending on time of day about 10 minutes by taxi Very close to both Doomben and Eagle Farm racecourses, and just across the road is the Hamilton Bowls Club with bar facilities and the recently opened Gallopers restaurant~4~4~5~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_171980226~“RUDE staff”~Location is good, facilities very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Unfortunately the RUDE staff really let down what is a nice motor inn. On my first stay on arrival at reception I was greeted with the receptionist complaining about the booking.com reservation system, which escalated into a very uncomfortable situation and being challenged about payment despite having already paid online and having a printed reservation form. I decided to give the place another chance as thought the receptionist may have just had a bad day, but on my second stay (I even checked in a bit earlier to avoid the previous week's receptionist) it was a similar scenario. The staff are hostile and have poor customer service skills. Such a shame as I would have thought it should be a nice place to work. I would never stay again, too stressful to have to have contact with the reception staff.~3~3~5~3~5~5~1~nan
review_162239108~“Internet”~I spent 3 days in hotel, not that I need anything fancy - just internet in the room... soooo when I get there I found that internet is not connecting in the room due to some technical difficulties. I was told that they expect tomorrow service to fix. Not really terrible inconvenience although sucks to go to the lobby that is open from 6:30 to 10:30PM (I'm not sure what time exactly they close in the evening). That would be if that actually would be fix the next day... next day I was told that it is hard to get service people here?!?!?! and it will take ...whatever it take... so 3 days later no fix and nobody really cares - my questions in that regard although politely replied to (don't know...) are getting under their skin I can tell. I'm on business trip and I need that internet, not mentioning that trying to use Skype in the lobby to call home it is not really all that private - so yes although all around crew is nice I would say and coffee shops are not that far from here to have nice break it sucks big time to think that it is for management excusable to have situation like that for that long. I hear other guys asking (not many actually but I'm not seating here all the time in lobby) and getting first run around like me implying this is something new that someone mention (but try doing this or that...:D). I will ask my company to avoid this one - I don't think they are seriously taking their business~2~2~3~2~3~4~1~nan
review_162065581~“late night arrival”~After hours arrival was not a good experience. All locked up and no directions as to how to contact hotel staff. Room was clean, but very dated with brick inside and out. Continental breakfast limited. Not quite as close to airport as I thought, but then again at night, not knowing where you are going all seems confusing.~3~2~2~3~2~3~2~nan
review_159327311~“It's ok”~Accommodation was chosen for location to both the airport and cruise ship terminal. Rooms are a little dated but for what you pay I wouldn't expect anything less and rooms are also quite large. Perfect for a one night stay. Bed was quite comfortable, which was quite good after a few hours of traveling.~3~4~4~3~3~3~3~nan
review_156131505~“Good Choice for Overnight Connections”~Stayed here on an overnight connection through Brisbane. The rooms are a little dated as mentioned by previous reviewers, but are clean, spacious and for the price, well appointed. Complimentary tea/coffee and a well stocked mini-bar. There is a restaurant on site for dinner or a pub/club with lots of options 5 mins down the road. Breakfast served from 6am on a weekday and 7am weekends. Proximity to the airport is it's main advantage, no more than 15 mins in normal traffic, about a $25-35 taxi ride. There is a regular (every hour?) shuttle bus which can be organised through reception for a fee. I have stayed here on a few occasions and will use it again in the future, simple, clean accommodation convenient for connections at Brisbane.~3~3~4~4~3~3~3~nan
