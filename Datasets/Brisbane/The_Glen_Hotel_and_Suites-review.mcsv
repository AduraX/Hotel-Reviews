review_468479703~“Overnight stop”~What a great find this place is. Contemporary, clean and convenient to Garden City, the M1 and Nathan track, this stay was a good one. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom was spotless and stocked with lovely NZ body products. There is secure parking, express check out and a room service menu. We couldn't check straight in because the hotel was full and the room wasn't ready, but aside from this, our experience with staff was very positive. On site there is a pool, a bottle store and restaurant. Room config. was Two queen beds with Sep bathroom. Extras include room safe, iron and board, good lighting, plenty of PowerPoints, foxtel tv and a well stocked mini bar. They will take a $100 deposit on your CC despite having paid in advance. I would recommend this hotel though and will stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_468207364~“High quality accommodation in southern Brisbane”~My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. It was a wonderful experience and we loved this hotel very much. The mattress was comfortable and the bed was huge. The room was spacious and had everything we needed. Definitely recommended!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_466207643~“High quality accommodation in the suburbs”~A recent addition to the classic old 'Glen', the Suites were a pleasant surprise in Brisbane's south. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, and there's a small workout room and lap pool downstairs.  There's a little noise from the child care centre next door but it's not too bad. There's some reasonable dining at the adjacent pub including breakfast service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462652398~“well equipped contemporary hotel southside Brisbane”~This hotel was a real find down near Logan Road in 8 Mile Plains south of Brisbane. So convenient for an early start in the business area down there. Swift check in ,modern and very comfortable room and beautifully presented continental breakfast delivered to room ( Café also available downstairs in another building). I used the secure car parking just next door - free of charge as was the wi fi. Recommended for an overnight if doing business early in that area~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan~4~nan
review_457202858~“Great Hotel”~Wow I was vey surprised - never expected it to be so great. The accommodation was of a very high standard. Rooms were big, bed was so comfy. Just great - thanks. Breakfast was amazing - the pork and cider sausage - oh wow.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_454103919~“perfect for relaxed lunching”~The Glen has been in its present location, on what was the main road south, just about forever, as photos on the walls attest. In its current configuration, it feature accommodation and convention centre, in addition to its long standing function as a watering hole, and a place for travellers to satiate their hunger. It is also popular for weddings. I've only been there as a weary traveller searching for sustenance, and I have come away refreshed each time. The "pub" part is brilliantly designed. With the pokies discreetly out of sight and sound, the low dark wooden area surrounding the bar has the feel of an English pub, and is adjacent to the open kitchen which serves meals and snacks to the various surrounding areas, which is where much of the appeal lies. Close at hand are a collection of small bar tables with high stools and more leisurely tables and chairs, all well under cover. This area morphs into a larger area, still undercover, but more open to the outside and the breeze, all tables and bench tables for larger groups, and adjacent to a verandah which flows around a corner to a children's play area, next to a concentration of adult tables, and a small hidden area suitable for larger groups. There is also outdoor seating, where you can be assured of getting wet if it ever rains. A large a la carte restaurant is also available but is not open all the time. I have eater there and I have been when it is closed, and it would be great for wedding receptions as it is both airy and, being roofed with translucent "sailcloth", impervious to the weather. When I go it is usually for lunch and a beer with family and friends , and every time the food is excellent, better than average pub food and from a wide selection of plates. However, it is one of those places that make me want to order a Guinness and the last time I went it was no longer available on tap, and that's the only way to drink it. This is a great place for lunch, and for mine is far better than the more famous "Steakhouse Pubs" around Brisbane, and I feel may be lighter on the hip pocket.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_444603799~“Excellent Customer Services :D”~It's the second time to stay in the Glen Hotel and Suites. All the front desk staff is polite and helpful. They solved the problem for us.

review_435289798~“Nice rooms, no facilities”~The Glen is located in a convenient location when you travel south from Brisbane. The rooms are modern and nice. We found the place lacking a bit of ambiance as there's basically no facilities. Good for one night though.~4~nan~3~nan~5~nan~3~nan
review_428641500~“Fantastic service and great value ”~Very impressed by the polite and very helpful staff here, from the front desk, cleaners and garden restaurant staff everyone has gone out of their way to make our stay lovely. The standard of this accommodation is definitely 4 plus stars. Loved using the lap pool, gym and garden restaurant. Very close to Athletics track. Very clean, serviced apartments and comfortable beds. Will be back!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_427389268~“Great stay and value for money ”~I was really happy with this hotel, it was way more modern than I expected it to be, great water pressure in the shower and the bed was super comfortable!! We head over to the buffet breakfast the next morning and the food was lovely!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_411589204~“"Beautiful Hotel!"”~We have been going to the the Historic "Glen Hotel" for many years, for the good food and great atmosphere. Now they have built a world class hotel behind the original building that we did not know was there. We had gone for dinner only, as we do not live far away and had not been there for some time, and lo and behold...there is a new hotel on site! We decided to try it out for a night and was overwhelmed by the luxury & style so close to home!....highly recommended for visitors to our beautiful area as not only do you get 5 star accommodation....you get 5 star staff as well without the 5 star price! The only thing I would suggest is that the mini bar supply mini bottles of spirit to make your own mixed drink as it only supplies beer, pre-mixed drinks filled with sugar and soft drink cans, some sugar free but all in all...well done Mr Fitzgibbons!~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_409108269~“Stylish and spacious”~Our room on the second floor had a clever layout creating ample space to move around the king bed.

review_399789328~“Lovely hotel”~Hotel is modern, clean, with great facilities. Having two different restaurants on the same site was fantastic. Great customer service from all staff, within the hotel and also the restaurants. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to stay a little bit out of the way.~5~4~4~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_393064530~“Good for a short trip”~We recently visited for one night due to a surprise 40th in the bistro next door. Booking was made on line so the check in was very quick. Rooms are clean and comfortable and contained a large bed. Although the rooms were near a pretty busy road, a drive through bottle shop and a bar/club it was pretty quiet. Especially liked the secure parking available at no extra cost. Located about 30-45 mins from the airport/Brisbane CBD.~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~3~nan
review_392364813~“All round excellent”~Just the one night stay but very impressed. Comfortable room, quiet and good dinner in the hotel. Went for breakfast and started with two flat white coffees. One cup delayed because not up to baristas own standard and remade. It is the little things like this that reflect a desire to provide top service. Well done.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_384790844~“Enjoyable and Comfortable Stay.”~Location was great. The room was lovely and clean. We had a very comfortable bed and I found the staff to be very friendly. Ideal for Business and Formal Functions.  Would stay there again in a flash. It was also a quick drive to get into the centre of Brisbane where we attended the Baby Expo which was held over the weekend. The hotel was also easy to locate.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_384446736~“Excellent for Business Trip”~This was an excellent hotel for our business trip - nicely located only 15 mins taxi into the city. The rooms were clean and very comfortable beds. Came with all the expected things such as ironing board, kettle, minibar, safe etc. Also had a heated outdoor pool and small gym. The Staff were excellent and helpful. Also had free Wi-Fi and newspapers in the lobby and secure parking. Had the glen restaurant next door which was excellent and also a more informal tavern to eat as well.~5~nan~4~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_381761418~“Clean, quiet, comfortable”~Stayed here for 3 nights while attending a work related course nearby. The location was perfect so easy to find! I get lost going into the CBD! Staff were welcoming and helpful. The room was comfortably furnished, large and clean. The food was average (I had roast of the day). Despite being so close to the Gateway it was very quiet. Free wifi was a bonus!~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_375914790~“Great place to stay!”~Before you even arrive you know they are considerate because the hotel is slightly off the main road but it is really well signed so you don't miss the turnoff or the entrance. Check was seamless. Locked parking is also provided as is a lift. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The bed was comfortable, the desk was more than adequate, wifi was free and automatic. Would have liked to stay longer and would certainly recommend.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_375577669~“A gem in the suburbs”~We have dined her often. They have two eateries. The Deck is a informal place too eat and meet. Great for kids as they have a playground.  The Garden restaurant is a ore formal place to eat. Great food .~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_367067080~“Modern hotel with friendly and helpful staff”~This hotel is in a perfect location if you have something organised at The Glen. We stayed over night and the staff and the hotel are brilliant. Very modern and extremely clean. An added bonus is the late checkout of 11am so if you have had a hard night before this is a real help :) would have no hesitation in recommending anybody staying here~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365286352~“Lovely room”~The room was well appointed and quite large. The complex is secure and includes wi-fi. My room was very quiet. I ordered room service which was delivered with a smile and was tasty and good value ( wood fired pizza). The only aspect I would question is cost - I thought it was a bit high given the location.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_360244926~“Everything is Perfect here!”~This is such a great place to stay if you're visiting Brisbane. The Glen has a beautiful pool, nice gym, fabulous staff, great location 20 mins from Brisbane CBD. It also has free WiFi, free Guest laundry ($2 for laundry powder), secure caged parking area, very clean and very competitive rates. We would recommend it to friends and family and anyone looking for great value.~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
review_359902542~“Great hotel”~A few months ago when attending a sports tournament we were the only ones that didn't stay at The Glen and really wished that we had. So we booked in straight away when the next competition was on and we weren't disappointed at all. The rooms are spacious, super clean, the bathrooms are a good size. The pool kept the kids happy and the beauty of this little gem is that it is connected to The Glen restaurant and you can either dine in more upmarket formal restaurant or you can dine in the tavern. Great options after a long day at a sporting tournament. Will definitely stay again.~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_356974682~“Be a Guest of the Glen”~I was booked for 4 nights for work. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable and the bathroom was large with plenty of space for toiletries. The room was very clean. The staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. I had room service breakfast which was very good and delivered with a friendly smile. The amenities were excellent. Laundry facilities, gym, pool, coffee machine in the lobby, free wifi, secure parking. There was a restaurant and a nice pub with very good meals in the same complex. I felt comfortable and well catered for. I would recommend the Glen Hotel & Suites for any business travellers.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_356529582~“Just great!!!!”~From the moment I arrived the staff at The Glen Hotel and Suites provided outstanding service and made the stay so special. Comfortable, modern & spacious rooms, good facilities on site: bottle-shop, restaurants, free secured parking, Gym, pool and FREE WIFI.. It was only 5 min away from the HUGE Westfield Garden City and 15min from CBD.... I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for accommodation outside of the city, for sure I will be back.~5~4~nan~5~nan~nan~4~nan

review_346873170~“Fantastic one nights stay”~Had a very early flight so needed a nice hotel not to far from BRISBANE Airport.Well what a little gem this is although a 4 and a half stars I have given 5 for so many reasons, Checking in was easy and was given our room keys which gave us excess to the secure carpark and also the back way in to the hotel it's only 2 stories high.Theres a lift down the corridor for the upper level which we were on.When we opened the door we found a beautiful room very well furnished and all the hotel is immaculately clean,with great security at all doors and around the nice little swimming pool and gym.Although its on a road and the huge pub,club,restaurant is next door we never heard a thing.We don't usually get room service so after a couple of relaxing hours around the pool decided to eat in as the finals of the Big Bash Cricket was on well the Salt and Pepper Calamari was to die for and wished I could box it for other days.After a lovely nights sleep breakfast which is over at the Club only negative if it was raining hard even though umbrellas are provided,Well be prepared the breakfast is HUGE which is ordered off the menu if you are on the B & B so thanks and can't wait until we return again Kancho Alan~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

Staff are also very professional and helpful~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~4~nan
review_343691101~“Great stay”~The hotel was very nice,modern and clean. The pool was always clean and a nice temp. The restaurant across from the hotel we ate at twice and both times were very good, great value for money. The only downside was we paid at the start of our stay but when we checked out we were charged our room again. They didn't actually charge us on the 1st day so it took some time to figure out what they had done. Turned out that the room wasnt paid for on the 1st day like like we thought so we had to pay at the end.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_336853419~“A little gem”~My family met with friends for my birthday dinner. They recommended it as they're locals and had been previously. We're glad they recommended it.  Service was friendly. Very fast. The prices were reasonable, too. Nice big area so we weren't sitting right next to people where we could hear their conversation. In fact it's very spacious. The place seemed huge. There is a play area for kids.  We had entrees, mains, desserts and coffee. We went the lot and we couldn't complain about any of it. Servings were large enough, too. Thank you.  ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_335384403~“Blissful!”~This beautifully appointed hotel, which is located conveniently to Brisbane CBD, and surrounding areas. We were very fortunate to stay here for 4 nights over the Christmas break. The hotel amenities are exceptional, and the value was outstanding. We enjoyed both the swimming pool, and the gym. There was also free Wi-Fi, and a laundry for guests too.The staff were respectful, and very obliging. Our room was kept spotless, and serviced daily. The enclosed secure under-cover parking area,was convenient and at no extra cost. This hotel has a couple of restaurants, a Bottle shop, and a Business Conference Centre on site, with ample parking. I would highly recommend that people stay here. We will definitely be back next time.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan

Everything was fresh and tasty.Plenty of room to fit everyone in. Situated on the banks of a creek with a very pictureqsque outlook. I would recommend this place to anyone.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_333368151~“High quality accommodation with all amenities on site”~The Glen Hotel has long history, and over this time management have honed the art of hospitality to a fine edge. I found the staff to be cheerful and very helpful even with my slightly unconventional requests. The rooms are a good size, comfortable bed and everything worked as it should. The soundproofing is incredibly effective as 2 main roads move a great deal of traffic past the hotel. Thankfully you aren't required to shut everything off every time you leave the room which was very necessary in our particular case with our computers going 24/7. The WiFi is fast and access in and out of the building is easy. The secure car park is great for peace-of-mind and guarantees you a parking spot if you are coming and going at all hours. The other venues on site are extremely popular and the non-secure parking can fill up fast. Talking about the other amenities, there's a bottle shop only 20 metres from the entrance and several places to eat depending on your budget or tastes. Good food was had from both places we tried and they have no trouble charging it back to your room. A really relaxing stay for us was much appreciated as we were in the middle of moving house.~4~nan~4~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_332168194~“A cool suburban pub with a fresh clientele”~A great Friday afternoon with drinks and buffet on the deck.

review_328912123~“Lovely with room for improvement”~Lovely, well appointed bedroom, bathroom and facilities. Clean and modern, very comfortable stay. Convenient to have two restaurants on-site and ample parking as well as being close to the technology parks. Reception staff a little hit and miss - the initial reception staff who assisted my check-in wasn't overly informative nor attentive whilst my travel companion received the full run-down of amenities. Upon checkout, my details were found to be incorrectly entered at the time of check-in but fortunately the staff member assisting me was helpful and apologetic. Perhaps just an odd-day! Free Wi-Fi is available however the speed is abysmal. 24-hour gym and pool available and a taxi rank outside. All in all convenient and comfortable accommodation in a suburban area.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan

review_323767457~“Great location with modern rooms”~We travelled as a couple & stayed for 3 nights. We found the room plenty spacious. The bed was super comfortable. Rooms were very clean & well presented though in our 3 night visit the toiletries & tea/coffee weren't restocked when the rooms were cleaned daily (this would be the only slight complaint during our stay though). The hotel is in a great location & we had hired a car & found it really easy to access tone motorway from the hotel's location. If you do have a car there is also a secure car park on the premises. We found all the staff to be really friendly & helpful. We really enjoyed our stay & would definitely return.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_314739063~“Best hotel in the 4-star category with rooms for improvement.”~Let's start with the good. 5-star bed and service (including all staff especially my man Min). 5-star toilet and shower. Gym and pool would be 5-star if it were bigger but it was great for me as an individual. Location, parking and accessibility were awesome. Now for improvements. The carpet smelled a bit - maybe shampoo vacuum. The coffee/tea making area a bit dusty. The sink has a hole and it is a breeding ground for germs - it smells when you put your face down for a wash in the sink. Either have free internet or paid internet - can't have both. The free Wi-Fi was slow as - better to not have it at all. Overall, my stay was amazing. "Nothing is perfect in life."~4~5~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_310651361~“Felt new”~Stay at this place for a few nights on a work trip and found it very comfortable. I don't think this place is very old and there was a definite feel of everything including the bathroom and furniture feeling fresh and clean. Good spot for work functions with the hotel next door which serves meals and has quite a few function rooms. When leaving the room to check out I had a touch of sadness that I hadn't had more time to enjoy the king sized bed with big comfy pillows.~4~nan~3~5~nan~nan~4~nan
