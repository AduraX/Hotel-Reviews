review_463997810~“Food and service below average”~Whilst I'd love to give a good review, this place is good for a drink only. Food is expensive and pretty ordinary. Food service matches. It is very average pub food. It can get busy but I think that is due to lack of alternatives.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_411627908~“Management needs a shakeup!”~Where do I start?! I have a feeling that the only reason that this place is still going is location only.  A group of 20 of us went here for a double birthday dinner. On booking it was explained that this was a double birthday dinner with both birthdays being on the exact date Saturday 27 August. Hotel Carindale have a deal that with 4 mains ordered the birthday person gets their main for free with proof of their birthday i.e. drivers licence. When we got there we again went up and confirmed this was the case and asked the question, "do we all need to order at once for the 2 free birthday dinners". The answer was "as long as we all give the table number it's fine". After we all ordered and ate a very ordinary Luke warm meal, we discovered that neither of our birthday people got a free meal. When management were approached we then got a very patronising explanation about how the system works and what we should have done and that there's really nothing that could be done now because the tills were closed off. We were furious, not only with the attitude but the fact that you advertise something that is so complicated when it comes to the execution of a 'free birthday dinner'. After much fuss and bother another manager came out with 2 vouchers a $20 and a $10 one. Add to this we went earlier to watch the Bledisloe cup, it took them 45 minutes to work out how to get the right channel which meant we missed the Haka and national anthems. There is also absolutely no atmosphere, it's a Saturday night in a pub, no music and staff clearing up around you as early as 10pm to give you the big hint to get out! Seriously if management read this, look at your rating overall here, a lousy 3! Show some pride in your establishment and do something. You have lost hundreds of dollars over a lousy $26 meal we didn't get for free! We will never go back and not one of our friends will either. One of our party has close to 200 staff with an account at your establishment. Guess what? He is never ever going to use it! Do the maths as to what that $26 has cost you and use it to improve!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_343236587~“Pleasant visit”~Food was good and served quickly. It was a Monday night and fairly quiet. Very enjoyable night except for one waitress who would have been much happier had she not been at work. They were helpful with the birthday cake we had taken and happy to accommodate us with candles etc.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_305674229~“Was ok enough for lunch”~Came here for Sunday Lunch. We didn't book in and we were lucky to get a table. Shortly after we were seated the line up for people waiting to get in  There is no table service so you have to go up to the bar to get drinks and then up to a separate counter to order your food. I ordered the barramundi - I don't particularly like barramundi but as I wanted fish and didn't want fried fish I didn't have any other option other than salmon, which I would have had but didn't like the sound of what it came with. My friend ordered lamb shank with mashed potato The food came out fairly quickly given how busy they were. It was nicely presented but not huge portions but I hadn't been expecting much for the money we paid. As expected the barramundi was rich and fishy tasting. It was cooked well enough but it is just not my favourite fish and by the time I had scraped the skin off and cut away all the soggy dark bits there wasn't much left. The kipfler potatoes were nice but I didn't touch the bok choy. My friend said his lamb shank was tender but there want enough jus and it didn't have a great depth of flavour. He said it was ok though I guess for the money we paid it was ok food and it was handy for us being easily accessible from the shopping centre.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~3~3~nan
review_286984707~“Dinner for Two”~One of my close friends and i ventured to Hotel Carindale on a friday night for a few drinks and dinner. The food was delicious and all staff were friendly. I did receive the wrong meal (i ordered prawns with my pasta instead of chicken) and it was quickly rectified with many apologies. This is not a bother to me and by no means did i make a fuss but i appreciated the efficiency & respect i received from the waiter. It has a good atmosphere and is reasonably price. Would definitely recommend & i will be returning to try more food on their menu. PS, the duck pizza is to die for!!!!!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_252524700~“Pie needs meat”~I've been to this hotel before and had good meals but this last one needs mentioning. Ordered the chunky meat pie with mashed and peas. The pie came, nice mash and peas but had to look for the meat. Three pieces, each about a cm square floating around in gravy is not what I'd call a chunky meat pie. My partner had the pie as well but was unlucky and only got two pieces of meat around the same size. The service was good as was the setting but charging $17 for three pieces of meat is a bit much. Will give the place a miss in future.~3~2~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_247114412~“I wouldn't go out of my way to visit”~Unfortunately for this hotel at least one of the front bar staff is very unpleasant and completely uninterested in being personable. I wish I could mention a name! Not a great place to be unless you have an ordinarily stuck-up attitude and wish to be surrounded by the same!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_213211613~“Terrible attitude from staff.”~Attended the hotel on Saturday night with a group of friends, ordered a strawberry margarita and the barwoman put salt around the rim of the glass instead of sugar!! Disgusting, but i do understand accidents happen!! Went to the bar and told a guy there was salt on my glass instead of sugar. He said to take a seat and they would bring me another one shortly.....15 minutes later my drink arrived. The barwoman who made the original drink dropped it down without a word...I don't think an apology was out of the question or even a free drink maybe as a kind gesture!  Have eaten here once previously and did not enjoy it either. Attitude of staff was noticed by us all on Saturday night as rude and unfriendly..Very disappointing Will definitely not be returning to the Carindale Hotel!!~1~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_204985711~“Pleasantly Surprised”~After reading quite a few unfavourable reviews of the newly refurbished Hotel Carindale, I must admit our group of diners were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, price and service. We started with a selection of breads and dips and bruschetta for entree and then had a variety of meals including Rump steal, seafood pasta, Chicken, seafood salad, and the lamb pizza which all received good reviews, although the chicken dish was a little dry. I myself had the Chef's special Atlantic Salmon which I found superb especially with the sauce it was served with. Service was relatively quick and whilst car park access to the shopping centre is now slow we would definitely go back again.~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~4~nan
review_170387293~“Wouldnt recommend.”~Went there last Wednesday night for dinner with a group of 6 girls from work. 3 of us had ordered the chicken and you guessed it the 3 who ordered the chicken came down with food poisioning!!! Not at all happy. We had to cancel appointments for the next day and we were so very ill it was terrible. We rasng and told them and the management said they would get back to us which they DID NOT. That is definitely not good enough. very bad customer service.~1~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_166342764~“Stay away.”~Wow should have read the reviews before going here. Went out for a girls day lunch. We all wanted to try this place since the renovations.  Wish we didn't try it. The food was terrible!!! The three of us all didn't finish our meals. When the waitress asked how the meals where, we said not good at all...that is why more then half is left on the plate. Food tasted lile fake processed meat, another meal tasted off. The glass water jar was dirty. The waitress called the lady manager over...she has such an attitude problem..considering we are always polite customers. She was rude and had the worst attitude problem. Please quit your job and work in a place that you don't have to communicate with customers if it makes you that angry that you take everything out on customers.  It's a pity because the area is nice to sit outside and have a meal.~1~1~3~nan~1~1~1~nan
review_158326813~“Things should be better”~We went for a Sunday breakfast, in a group of 10. We had no gripes with the food itself, when it came, or the waitresses. My wife and I ordered breakfast and coffee at the same time, yet my wife's coffee failed to arrive. She had to go and chase it up. Some coffees for others in our group failed to arrive at all, so refunds were provided when sought (but no apologies). And there was no effort to clear our table after breakfast which is especially disconcerting given that the dining room was nowhere near fully booked. We also saw other diners complaining. Dining experiences are a bit like Snakes and Ladders. A bad experience sends you right back to the start of the game. We won't be going again, in a hurry, to Carindale Hotel.~2~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_156655549~“Wanted to try it out”~We used to eat at the old restaurant before the refurbishments. Always had great service, and excellent food. Now, after it's renewal, not very impressed. Yes, you are shown to a table, given a menu, from there on in tis all down hill. You make your meal choice, and then have to queue to place said order, pay, and return to table. Then, you have to go to the bar for any beverages you may require, return to your table, wine in bucket etc., wait for the meal, which is delivered to the table! For heavens sake, remember your table number when you go to order! We had 200g rump, with gravy and salad. For rump, the price was reasonable, cooked to perfection, we both love rare! However mine was as tender as one would expect, my partners, so tough! The salad was a little wilted, though varied, the peppercorn gravy was OK! Miss the old restaurant and service, and doubt very much that we will return!~3~2~4~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_154740841~“Update (Hotel has been redeveloped and no longer has Accommodation)”~The listing and photo are out of date the Hotel was knocked downs a couple of years ago and the site rebuilt as part of the Carindale Westfield shopping center. A new Hotel is incorporated in the center with Bar and Restaurant, there is no longer accommodation. The Hotel does have a cafe type appeal and links to the "Glass House" Restaurant / Food Court within westfield.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_152233946~“good food pity about the staff”~We have been to the bistro at the hotel a number of times since the refurbishment and have had the same female staff member on most times tell us we she wants us to sit. Not like other staff who ask where we would like to sit. We tell this person that we wish to sit away from the noise but you have to raise your voice and stand up to her but she backs down and not nice to you. We are the customer who pays her wage. Otherwise the food is good anf the menu is large~1~4~3~nan~nan~4~1~nan
review_149943746~“Shame”~Family birthday with little (ish) kids. Three adults had sirloin steak at $30 a pop. Tough, over cooked and obviously not rested. Welcome poor and average age of wait staff an uncaring 17/18 years old. Bar staff great and surroundings good, could be an enjoyable treat for a family night out but alas for the above won't be returning. I'd rather spend my hard earnt hundred bucks for a family out elsewhere. Shame.~2~2~nan~nan~nan~4~1~nan
review_148327413~“Don't bother to eat here - it's not up to scratch”~We went there to watch an NRL game while having dinner and to try it our since the rebuilding. Disappointed on all levels. our request when we booked for a table close to the Tv that the rugby league would be televised on was not fulfilled, despite a promise that it would be, and there plenty of tables ther - so we moved ourselves. Our meals took forever to come and the top range steak offered on the menu was as tough as an old boot. Service was very slow and staff were few. Despite the fact that it's a hotel, it was almost impossible to even get a drink. The ambiance is not as good as the old hotel as it is too noisy and is more like a food court than a hotel. We saw many other people making complaints as well. Over all, a very disppointing experience. Would definiety not bother going there again, despite the fact that we were regulars at the old Carindale Hotel.~2~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~2~nan
review_130717366~“THEY HAVE TO PULL UP THEIR SOCKS”~We booked a dinner for 8 persons on Saturday May 26th 2012 at 7.30 pm to celebrate a birthday. Placed our order for our meals between 8pm and 8.11pm. Ordered Steaks and seafood. 4 meals arrived at the table within 15 minutes, 2 meals arrived 45 after minutes and the last 2 meals at 9.11pm. When I spoke to the Hotel Manager, he offered an explanation that it is quite in order to wait up to 50 minutes for the meal to be served.Also told me that the Restaurant was very busy and that a delay of that amount of time is acceptable. I found the Manager to be extremely blase about the matter and could not care less about customer service.Prior to that we spoke to 2 waiters about the delay in serving the meals, but they told us the same story that we have to wait. Such delays is certainly not acceptable.We found the experience at the hotel simply daunting and would suggest that they need tlo pull up their socks if they want to attract customers. It appears the staff including the manager is totally untrained in customer service. Like the previous reviewer said, this is simply a canteen with all its attendant noise and not a quality restaurant to dine.With regard to the Steaks, It is certainly not value for money and I would suggest that you give the Hotel Carindale a miss and enjoy your meals in one of the other establisments.This Hotel is a big let down for the Carindale residents. Dont waste your time money and effort to dine there.~1~1~nan~nan~nan~4~1~nan
review_130209442~“Review on Restaurant”~We went for dinner at the Carindale Hotel on Friday the 18th May 2012. We were really looking forward to a night out. We ordered our meal, and waited 45 minutes, then went to find out why it was taking so long only to be told there was no record of the order. We produed our receipt and were refunded cash by the manager, and the manager destroyed the receipt (probably to cover his bugger up). Aweful experience. Will never go there again. Can't believe how blase the staff were, didn't really care that we had spent the last 45 minutes waiting for our meal. Just believed that a refund would take care of their mess up. Whilst we were there people were leaving because they had to wait so long to place their order. Pity we hadn't done that!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_128371610~“A few teething problems but........”~We have visited twice in the last month, once 2 days after opening and again for lunch on the 22nd of April. A few hits and misses.  Our dinner on the first Saturday night was lovely but a few issues both that night and even worse for Sunday lunch. A severely understaffed main bar with lovely workers but a little uninformed. A great and inexpensive wine list but staff really should know a Chardonnay is not a red wine. I had the salmon and hubby had the lamb, both really nice although someone decided they would set the table with entree forks which made eating a bit tricky as the staff were run off their feet and we couldn't get their attention. Spiro the manager was very welcoming and enquired if we had enjoyed our meal. Finally a manager who really was interested in feedback. Sunday lunch unfortunately was not so good. A nasi goreng with undercooked chicken, a kids burger that was charred, cold and as dry as the Simpson Desert but the smoked salmon pizza was lovely. They did run out of the daily special at 1pm which was a shame and we had quite a wait. The biggest problem was the bar with 1 staff member serving for a full restaurant, it was laughable with 12 people lined up waiting and tempers flaring. I headed for the back bar for instant service and wondered why staff hadn't noticed the problem and directed patrons to do the same. So in a nutshell, would I return? Yes as it is a good option for Bayside residents not wanting to go into the city. Don't expect 5 star or an intimate dinner and you will be fine.~3~3~4~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_127884505~“Dressed up canteen”~The restaurant was a noisy Westfields type eatery. Service was slow, but the staff were pleasant. I ordered the risotto, the portion size was small and the salt content rivaled the dead sea. ......~1~2~3~nan~nan~4~3~nan
review_78585897~“Just OK”~Hotel was just ok , in need of a makeover , chipped furniture , cracked sink , everthing really starting to show its age . Very hard to park , as everybody using the pub parks in the hotel guest spots , nothing worse after a day working park your car miles away and walk , staff just shrugged and said it happens all the time ? Shopping centre next door is great.~3~2~3~3~2~3~3~nan
review_38599252~“Passable Hotel”~Well what can i say. Booked hotel at the very last minute for location. Room service and restaurant were good and hotel next to large shopping centre. As for the rooms which were clean but truly in need of renovation ( as well as hotel corridors ) please dont have high expectations of them. With that in mind you will get by. This is not a tourist hotel.~2~2~3~nan~1~3~3~nan
review_17389025~“Not for families”~The service was average. Worst thing was a party booked in the restaurant. The noise was loud enough to shake the windows in our room, the TV could not be heard over the din, and it did not finish until 11.00pm. The hotel is nice enough, if slightly tatty at the edges, and the location is brilliant for shopping (walk 10 metres to the centre). But as we were travelling with young children, and had the worst nights sleep for many years, we will not be using this hotel again.~1~2~5~nan~2~2~2~2
review_10869962~“okay rooms, good location for shopping”~I have to agree with the previous review regarding the reception staff. Very uninterested but when asked for info they were helpfull. The rooms are ok, no problems. Our towels were lovely, no holes. Bed comfy but soft if you like a hard bed. The best is that as you walk outside from the hotels irish bar you are right at the entrance to a large shopping centre. The biggest in Brisbane i was told. Hogs breath cafe across the mall and also an italian restaurant. I also saw a dominos, sushi and thai . Great place if you just want o go to Brisbane for some shopping. A large bus depo is also just down the road with the bus taking about 15 mins into Brisbane city.~3~3~4~nan~3~3~3~3
review_10076068~“Could be better”~Stayed overnight on a business trip. Rooms were ok, probably like a standard motel rather than a hotel. Everything was clean but some of the towels had holes in them and the service was very ordinary at reception.~3~3~3~nan~3~4~2~2
