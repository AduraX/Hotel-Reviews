review_478671872~“Home away from home”~The staff are fantastic, the building really modern, the apartment facilities are excellent. The gym is well equipped and the pool is lovely. Having a full kitchen makes it easy. Being so close to the Roma Street station made travelling nice and easy.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478535450~“Excellent accomodations”~We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the Brisbane river. The suite had a spacious bedroom with king bed and TV, a large living room and dining area with TV, separate laundry room, small fully equipped kitchen, and a dual bathroom - sink, shower/bath in one room, and sink/toilet in a separate room. Ample closet space. It was modern, immaculate, and serviced every day. There is an indoor pool, sauna and gym, and reception could not have been more helpful. There is a car park with additional charge. We were there for 8 days - it was shockingly inexpensive and we saved $$$ by eating breakfast in and having cocktails at home before we went out. Cheaper than many hotel rooms and much, much better!!!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_478146263~“Spacious and modern. The view is great.”~We stayed in a "Altitude Suite with two bedrooms" on 70th floor. The view is spectacular. South bank parklands and Eagle street Pier are in walking distance (about 20 minutes). If you plan to join local tour to Frasier Island or Moreton Island, Meriton Serviced Apartment on Herschel Street would be your best choice. Only 3 minutes walk to the meeting point at Brisbane Transit Centre on Roma Street.~5~4~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan

review_477852789~“Happy Customer”~For my second stay at a Meriton in Brisbane we chose Hershel St as it is closer to the centre of the city then Adelaide St, where we stayed before. The room was great the service at reception great an all together a great stay. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477567138~“Perfect accommodation for bussiness and family”~If you are looking for something for yourself or your family, you come to the right place. The room was furnished with all essential appliances, including washing machine, drier, and big fridge. The cooking stow was just brilliant if you would like to have a normal family meal or even quick instant noodle for a rush Morning. The room was one of the best that I have stayed in Australia in term of cleaning and good design. The apartment location was near the heart of Brisbane CBD, about 10 to 15 mins walking, 24/7 convenience store just right at the corner and bunch of food courts just about 5 mins walking away from the apartment.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477544192~“Herschel St Apartment”~We loved our stay at the Meriton. There was absolutely nothing for us to fault, the staff were extremely helpful, courteous and welcoming. The apartment was spotlessly clean, had wonderful river and city views, a fully equipped modern kitchen, super comfortable bed with more river views and our apartment was so private with no external noise. We look forward to our next visit.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_477445603~“Meriton on Herschel”~Excellent facility. Room was spacious and has everything you need for a short or long term stay. Good location and walking distance to shopping and only one block to train and bus station. Only deficiency is tha exercise room is very small and does not have much equipment. If can only handle 2 or 3 people at one time.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477379655~“Wonderful”~Only one Night in Brisbane.  Central, everything ist nearby!  We had a wonderful Night. Only the milk in the fridge wasn't good. So the coffee was terrible.  Next time please new milk befor the gest come.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477368574~“excellent value for money”~Extremely helpful staff, very friendly, beautiful apartment, well fitted out kitchen. Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to be in walking distance of Qpac and Queen st Mall. Will stay there again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477367136~“Great service”~Front desk awesome. Tiago at the front counter went over and above to accommodate our needs. Thank you. Very clean. Quite room. Would definately stay again. Only thing I could think of is that parking at hotel a bit expensive~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477343385~“Clean, comfortable and convenient.”~Thoroughly enjoyed 3 night stay in spacious, clean and very conveniently placed hotel, close to CBD and Southbank, and close to Roma train station and Roma Parklands. Easy walk to shops and other CBD attractions, and to pedestrian bridge to Southbank. Only gripe was $42/day parking fee! Pure extortion!~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_477037661~“Excellent Apartment & Location”~Great stay! We booked a one bedroom one bathroom apartment that suited our needs perfectly. Very clean and modern with plenty of hanging space and drawers for the two of us. The queen size bed was extremely comfortable! The kitchen was well equipped with a microwave, dishwasher, oven and full sized fridge and it had it's own laundry with a dryer. My preference to use an air dryer was provided without fuss by the lovely staff. Although there isn't a balcony the windows open enough to let in fresh air if you prefer but the air-conditioner does do a great job. Oh and there is free WI-FI to boot..!! The location was simply brilliant for us. Roma Street Station is barely a 3 minute walk from the apartment building. The train cost $18 from the airport to Roma Steet versus the $60 taxi fee my travelling companion paid (we arrived on separate days). There's a handy little 7/11 store only 200m away, the mall is within an easy 10 minute walk and it's a cruisey walk to Southbank (you can train it too).  Very happy with the apartment. We will definitely stay here again when in Brisbane next time.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476986295~“Home away from home.”~Room was extremely comfortable, very clean. All amenities provided including a washing machine and dryer, ironing board and iron. Airconditioning in both lounge room and bedroom was appreciated. Great location - close to Queen Street Mall, Roma Street Station, GOMA.  Great service.  I will stay here again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476947907~“Excellent”~I stayed here for the long weekend. The hotel is clean and the rooms are modern with everything you need. Staff are friendly too. Great value for money, except parking is on the steep side. The location is quite good, only a short cab ride or walk to Suncorp stadium. You can easily walk into the city. A cafe and 7-11 store downstairs too. I'll be back for sure.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476894222~“Great stay !”~Room was perfect for the price it was. Definitely worth the money ! Although one of the downfalls was that the blanket I had yellow stains on it, but the bed was very comfy and so was the lounge and table chairs :) view was great even though it was just of the other buildings beside us, it was still great ! One of the other downfalls was not having a balcony as I am a smoker so everytime I wanted a cigarette, I would have to go in the lift, and go all the way to the ground floor. It would have been great if there was a designated smoking area on one of the floors in between the middle or the top. But other than that, it was still great and I would recommend it. Good thing I didn't drive in, as the parking was very expensive per night, but very safe and secure. So while there are some cons, the pros still definitely outweigh them :) Thank you for a great night at the Meriton on Herschel st !  ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476730630~“Fab First Time Brissy Stay”~Thanks to the friendly and happy staff at Meriton on Herschel St. Our apartment was spacious, well equipped, clean and super comfortable, loved the coffee machine, big fridge and adequate cutlery & crockery and good prep space and cooking. My Daughter and I had a lovely two days exploring downtown and South Bank. The Meriton was well placed with pubs, restaurants and shopping all within an easy walk and a 24 hour deli just around the corner and the coffee shop next door did great coffee and plenty of easy breakfast or lunch food. Will definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476707659~“Fantastic Views, Fantastic Stay.”~My family and I decided to stay in Brisbane for few night and saw an excellent deal to stay at the Meriton in an altitude room. Imagine our wonderful surprise when we entered our room on the 70th floor. Fantastic room, well appointed and central to everything in Brisbane. Spent the day wandering Brisbane, dining at the many cafe's and took the city cat to Eagle St restaurants for dinner. Will definitely stay there again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476685597~“Magnificent views and spacious apartment”~Modern clean large apartment which was fully equipped. Close to the CBD and Southbank. Very resonable tariff and friendly staff. Lifts were quick and readily available. The only negative was expensive car parking.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_476611110~“Self serviced apartment”~We had a fantastic stay at the Meriton Serviced apartments. The staff were accomodating to our every need whilst we stayed there. Its a short walk to the city, with a 7/11 around the corner if you need a late night snack, they also have a few flyers for delivery if you don't want to go out for dinner. The room was cleaned every day and amenities were refilled. We were able to park our car there too, its very narrow so be-careful when your going down the ramp. Overall a great place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475912017~“Amazing views, service and location”~We stayed for 6 nights in a two bedroom apartment on the 69th floor (Room 6904) of this amazing apartment building. We had amazing views of the city lights at night when it wasn’t cloudy – yes sometimes you are in the cloud! And we looked down on Roma Street Train Station which the children loved. The windows open but have a really good safety latch. But really the air conditioning system is so advanced that you don’t need to open them much. The staff were extremely polite and helpful with everything we needed. The lifts always came quickly, the ride was also quick (30 seconds to level 69) and I loved the electronic swipe card key system which made you feel incredibly safe. The apartment was very spacious so our family of four could really spread out – it really was like a home away from home. In fact, my children said they’d happily live here! The beds were the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on away from home. The laundry was large enough to easily fit our pram. There was so much wardrobe space including drawers and a safe. There was so much general storage space/cupboards I sometimes had to think twice about which cupboard I had put something! There was a daily room service and full linen change on day four! The only suggestion I have is to have hooks somewhere to hang our rain coats on. We were here to catch the eye of Cyclone Debbie. We chose this location for being close to the shops and Southbank and it was great – 10 minute walk to Queen Street Mall (Coles Supermarket, Myer etc), 15 minute walk to North Quay to catch the free City Hopper Ferry to get over to Southbank or we walked across the pedestrian bridge. We went to the GOMA, City Beach, Museum and enjoyed exploring all the amazing little gardens and play areas tucked away along the Arbour Walk. There is a cycle and walkway along the river and under the highway which is a really quick way to get to the City Hopper. We accessed this from the end of Turbot or Ann Street. We took the children’s scooters so they didn’t get so tired and this worked extremely well. We had a little trouble with the wi-fi going down on us a few times but there was always a quick solution from reception. Nothing was ever a problem. The pool and gym were great too. I will definitely stay here next time I am in Brisbane.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_475732787~“Nice View, Nice Price, Nice Location ”~I always stay with Meriton apartments and never be disappointed!! Modern apartment overlooks the river with affordable price, convenience location, just about 10mins walk to CBD. Highly recommended to everyone.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475468331~“Beautiful apartment.”~Wonderful stay, lovely apartment, comfy beds, great location, helpful staff. Close to everything and a short walk to South Bank. Enjoyed the pool, gym and spa and sauna. Fully equiled kitchen, but plenty of places to eat close by.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475409483~“Excellent Service, Excellent Location, Excellent Price!”~I was very stressed with my wedding coming up, and had mixed up my room reservation dates, so when I received an email that I failed to show and my reservation was canceled, my stress was through the roof when I arrived. However, the front desk was very understanding and took care of it quickly, professionally, and arranged for a room at the same price as my original reservation. And while the rooms themselves are clean and include everything for a comfortable stay, the wifi service great, the location very convenient both for those coming from the airport and those traveling around the CBD in Brisbane, the true highlight of the stay was the reception staff, who were very helpful with any issues, including bringing the room key for my elderly grandmother's room to where we were relaxing so that she could go to her room without having to go back to the front desk again just for a key. I am very happy my family and I picked this location while preparing for my wedding.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475395094~“Great place to stay in Brisbane”~We stayed here last year and enjoyed the experience. We returned this month for another 5 night stay. Difficult to think of anything to criticise, the rooms are big, clean, very well equipped and comfortable. Location is great when arriving by train, well placed for exploring Brisbane CBD and the South Bank and Roma Street Park. Definitely would return~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_475377010~“Friendly welcoming staff”~We chose to stay here after having a great stay at Meriton apartment in Sydney. We stayed for 7 nights. The staff were wonderful and friendly. They were always helpful and quick to deal with anything. The room was nice and clean, with everything we needed. The only downside was the view. We did request a high room for the view. But unfortunately this wasn't possible, so we were low down looking into other apartment and office blocks. Being so overlooked and surrounded made the apartment dark and a bit depressive. Would stay again.~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan~5~nan
review_475376842~“Room with everything”~Stayed as a family of 4 (2 boys 13 & 11) in a 2 bed apartment for 3 weeks on floor 73 Apartment: We found the apartment well set out with space for all of us. The apartment has a fully equiped kitchen, full sized fridge/freezer, large microwave & large dishwasher. Also drawers of the kitchen things you need (knives, grater, scissors, peeler, ladles, bottle opener etc) There is also a coffee machine with pods supplied. Behind the front door was a very handy closet where we stored all our empty luggage bags & backpacks/handbag. Was a great spot to grab out what you needed before heading out for the day, but also got them right out of the way.  There is a TV in every room & the DVD player in the lounge room & some Foxtel channels kept everyone happy. There are extras you can request, I requested a rice cooker (cooked that one time the first night lol) & a GHD hair straightener to use during our stay. There is a deposit that is refunded on return of the straightener($290) I'm unsure if there was a charge on the cooker & they delivered that to my door within a few mins of my request. The straightener you have to personally pickup at reception. Also available are slippers, umbrella, clothes rack, teapot, extra blankets. There is also a fully equiped laundry with washer, dryer & sink.  The real draw card of course though is the view. UNBELIEVABLE. For the first week & a half we kept waking up with the sun as closing the blinds on the view felt so wrong! This has to be the best view in all Brisbane! The staff at Meriton are lovely to deal with, we found them in all our dealings to be kind & helpful.  Surrounds: The hotel itself is close to the main city mall, no more than 10 mins walk. Also a pedestrian bridge on Turbot st will take you across the river & into the Southbank area. Again just a 10 min walk.  Directly downstairs on the street is a subway store & a 711 for when the munchies hit.  Across the street & on the other side of the central station is the Roma St Parklands, it's so pretty & peaceful there, I recommend taking a stroll through as the layout is beautiful. Overall, I could seriously live in this apartment. Everything is taken into consideration as to what a family would need on holiday. Unlike a hotel room, you are set up to look after your family with the ability to cook for yourselves or keep heaps of food on hand in the full sized fridge. I found having this ability really relaxing as we didn't have to go out all the time searching for food breakfast, lunch & dinner (saved a packet too)  Highly recommend to all~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_475066863~“Perfect location”~Accommodation is only 200m from Roma Street. The staff were very polite and nothing was too much trouble. The Queen Street Mall is only a short walk away or the train and bus stations are just around the corner. Next to the venue is a lovely cafe which has a great menu. Around the corner also is a 7-7 convenience store, Subway and International Hotel which also has a good menu.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474758565~“Brilliant rooms but poorly maintained”~The rooms were fabulous. Amenities and everything is there. Staff were very helpful and accommodating. Great view.  However, the cleaners could do a bit better. They didn't vacuum and left without doing much of cleaning.  Also there was something that resembles human feces floating in the swimming pool and in the jacuzzi. It was revolting.  Such a beautiful apartment and good facilities, but they need to do a better job with the upkeep.~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_474511334~“Excellent location”~On arrival just prior to 2pm, reception staff expressed surprise at my "early arrival". I was listed as "Late arrival". I requested a "relaxed check out" not a "late arrival". I was quoted $60 for this late check out via email which I accepted via email. Reception staff quoted $100 which I declined and had to put my own case for the $60 as arranged previously. The room was lovely and having requested a nice view, I was given a room with a nice view over the river and Mount Cootha. Great to have windows which open for fresh air. I telephoned room service and requested instant coffee sachets. The staff arrived with coffee pods. I explained that I had requested instant coffee sachets as the sign on the tea/coffee caddy instructs to do if required. I did use the pods but my request for instant coffee was ignored. One of the UHT milk mini sachets was mouldy. Reception staff was apologetic and replaced it with fresh milk.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

We found it !!!!!The apartment is really well furnished and beautiful, the view amazing and the bed.... Unbelievably comfortable... All the staff is very helpful and nice (Thank you Zane, Adam (the other one)...The covered pool is a bit too "bleachy" for my taste, but maybe difficult to avoid It with the number of guests in a 74 floor building!!! We are 15mn walk from the casino and the Big shopping area (clothes, Food, Myer, Coles etc etc) Tomorrow I am trying the Sauna and my son the gym...There is as well a floor garden .. It's a shame they don't Have a bar and a restaurant there, It will be a hit!!! We will be back.

review_473732104~“Recommended. Great location.”~Was up in Brissy last week for a three day conference. I have to say I could not fault Meriton Herschel street. Great amenities and services. The only thing I would criticize was the location and eating options around Herschel street are limited after dark. Fortunately there's a delivery room service menu that's open until 9pm each night. Had a fantastic selection of restaurants to choose from. Was well impressed. Overall a pleasant experience. Will definitely stay here again.~4~4~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan

We were on floor 24 and had a great view especially at night with all the lights of the city and reflection on river. Was windy when we stayed and windows needed a bit of fiddling with to stop the whistling noise. Friendly staff. Would definitely stay again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472738577~“Impressive”~Top floor has great views of the city and sunset. Would book again. Very clean and comfortable Good value between 6 friends. Kitchen and bathrooms were very pleasant and five star. We only stayed for one night~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472690098~“The best of everything!”~This place is just THE BEST in every way. The suite was huge, well maintained, and extremely functional. The location is second to none, being right across the street to the train hub, and 2 minutes form the pedestrian bridge to South Bank. It's within an easy walking distance to Queen Street shopping area and all the restaurants nearby. There is a full gym and an inviting pool right down stairs. If ever I am in Brisbane again, this is where I will stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan

review_472607294~“My family of 5 loved our stay”~We loved our 3 bedroom apartment. Fantastic viees, clean, stylish, super comfortable beds. Pool was wonderful, views fab and staff attentive and courteous. We would definitely stay again and spend more time in the pool!~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472590994~“Fantastic hotel”~We've become a huge fan of the Meriton experience in recent years, staying frequently in Sydney CBD and Bondi Junction where the facilities and staff were exceptional. So when we had to travel to Brisbane we decided to try their Herschel St property as we required a two bedroom apartment. We weren't disappointed with any aspect, from the professionalism but friendliness of reception staff to the housekeeping girls for whom nothing was a problem. The apartments (we had to move after having to extend our stay over the weekend with the hotel heavily booked, a relocation made totally painless by the staff) were exceptionally well equipped, with comfortable beds and a high standard of cleanliness. Not to mention the view from our 73rd floor Altitude suite, nor the lift technology that gets you there! We will be staying again when we return in the next couple of months. (No, we're not Meriton staff - just 3 Tasmanians who appreciate quality!)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472574222~“Mr turner”~Very nice room sensational view great service friendly staff the service apartment with washing and cooking fertilitys was a bonus worth the money also easy to park and only an extra $10 a night extra.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472568796~“Fabulous as always”~Stayed here again (here in Dec to see Matilda at QPAC) we really enjoyed our stay then, so when My Fair Lady was playing at QPAC it was a no trainer to stay here again. We were not disappointed. Fabulous front desk service, clean spacious room and beautiful bathroom products~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_472229877~“Great Accomondation”~My second visit to the Meriton and myself and my family loved it. Our two bedroom apartment was very comfortable with an awesome view of the river and Southbank. The beds were oh so comfortable. My family were on holidays from the UK and Meriton was the perfect place to stay so close to the city and Southbank well within walking distance. The reception staff was very helpful. Miles was so friendly and made us feel so welcome, he is a great asset to your company.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_471853478~“Short holiday”~We stayed in Brisbane for 2 nights on a recent trip North to check on a property. We were upgraded to a bridge view room due to a problem with overbooking and the view was indeed beautiful. We enjoyed walking around Brisbane and catching the river cats.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471785739~“WOW this was our best city apartment in agreat city! Tremendous Service!”~This was our first visit to Brisbane and our last leg of our long holiday prior to flying home.We were here for 3 nights, we could have stayed longer! from the minute we stepped into the reception and met the Receptionist we were treated very well indeed. A friendly face, a welcome with an interest in where we were from what we had done where we had been. Polite, smart and efficient was our first impression.We were allocated an apartment on the 19th floor. There are 74 floors to this wonderful building. Opening the door and entering we were impressed. Clean modern decor and facilities. Comfortable! We felt like this was our home for the stay and as above would have happily stayed longer! The hotel is perfectly situated for accessing the CBD and the tourist attractions on foot. The pedestrian bridges to the South Bank, the ferry terminals, the CBD itself, the Railway station is just across the road.  Every time we entered after a long day sight seeing the receptionists smiled, welcomed us and asked us where we had been.  The lasting impression of these wonderful team of people on Reception was on check out day. Our bags were efficently whisked away fromus and we were told to enjoy our last day. Upon returning we asked if there was anywhere we could freshen up as we had our long flight back to the UK to prepare for. "How about a shower?" said the angel on Reception! "Would we like some towels and some shower gels?" Come on, we were checking out they wouldn't see us ever again perhaps but NO this was real service for customers. We particularly wanted to thank Tiago Bevazzi on this occasion but it could in fairness have been any of the team. Wonderful service a great place to stay all facilities modern and well resourced for your stay. As other reviewers have said Perfect in every way!~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan
review_471733003~“Best Serviced Apartments in Brisbane# Best Views”~Next time i am in Brisbane, Meriton Serviced Apartments on Hershel Street will be my only choice again. From the moment i entered 1 Bedroom Apartment on 19th Floor, i have been captivated by the panoramic views and i did not wanted to go anywhere but stay inside and enjoy them ... absolutely everything in walking distance and if you are first time in Brisbane you will figure out very fast your way around ... Get on the City Cat to explore Brisbane ... Southbank just a few minutes away, cross walking Bridge or take a City Cat Ferry ... there are also Free Ferries circulating for the travellers on the Budget ... Good Memories! ... Thank You Meriton on Hershel :)~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471493275~“Perfect in every way”~From the location, to the friendly staff and the well-appointed rooms, this Meriton lives up to the quality standard we know so well. No wonder Meriton hotels are popping up all over the place, they truly deserve the accolades. Our room was a two-bedroom with two bathrooms on the 69th floor. The views were phenomenal. Also loved the indoor lap pool and spa as a way to unwind while it was bucketing down outside.~5~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan
review_471481751~“Excellent place to stay.”~Well located,clean,new and very comfortable. Would stay again. In the heart of city. Travelled overnight and checking was very smooth. Staff was very helpful and provided information when required. Easy place to stay.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471279993~“Excellent ”~We stayed one night at this apartment was amazed at the view from our 72nd floor apartment as two couples traveling together we had our own bedroom and bathroom everything was in the room that you needed from kitchen to laundry but why would you easy walking distance to Brisbane city centre and Southbank car park was easy to get in and out of would definitely stay again~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471251051~“Great Getaway”~Lovely hotel however didn't think through the novelty of the altitude suite. No balcony. Smokers had to exit the hotel to smoke and when staying on 72nd floor took a while in the lifts. Would recommend a magazine stand for the elevator. Great rooms, gorgeous views.....no ice trays~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471063117~“Great location, great room, awesome staff”~Stayed here for a conference in March. Room (206) was spacious and well appointed with all mod cons apart from a microwave. Staff were awesome and the pub across the road proved to be great entertainment :).~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_471036249~“Another great stay at these fantastic apartments”~First time I stayed here was when they were only partially completed. Been back five times now and the apartments still look fresh and as good as new. Very high standards have been maintained over the year. All staff are very friendly and helpful. The apartments (I've always booked a one bedroom) are fully equipped with everything you need. Located only a few minute’s walk from Roma Street station and bus links the apartments are ideally situated for travel to various locations around Brisbane and Queensland. Also numerous supermarkets and restaurants nearby. I have always highly recommended these apartments over staying in a hotel and still would. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470923461~“Great views and location”~We had a three bedroom apartment, plenty of room for a family of 6. Within walking distance of the city centre, Southbank, and Roma Street Parklands all worthwhile visits. The views from the 70th floor made for a great location, and with daily servicing and washing machine etc provided made for a good family stay. Pool okay, but a bit cold.~5~5~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_470883139~“Fantastic!”~Everything about my stay was terrific. The staff was attentive and would happily answer questions about anything. The location is nice - near the river. The building is great - very new. I think all the rooms are suites or more. I had a one bedroom apartment which was beautifully decorated and furnished. The kitchen was a complete one with everything a regular kitchen would have - and a good size as well. I loved the full size refrigerator for storing essentials like cheese and wine. Oh - also has a washer/dryer which is really handy if you're trip is long. The windows open in case you want some fresh air. Bed was comfy. Full size bathroom. I can't recommend this enough. FYI - there is another Meriton Serviced apartments in Brisbane. This is a review for the Herschel Street location. The airport shuttle took me to this one by mistake instead of the one on Adelaide St where I had a reservation. The concierge at Herschel Street worked with the other location so I didn't have to pay a no show fee and arranged for me to stay so I didn't have to take a taxi to the Adelaide St. hotel. They even contacted Booking.Com who then called me to verify that the transfer was legit. I wished I could have stayed longer. It felt like being on a vacation just staying there. The price was extremely reasonable for what you get. You would think that they would charge more. Downsides: the nearest supermarket is about a 20 minute walk. There is a 24 hour 7-11 around the corner though. No restaurant in the hotel.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470795833~“Great sneaky break away”~The room was excellent! Very spacious, clean, had all of the amenities, with great views and the staff were most friendly and helpful. The location was very handy for downtown Brisbane which included parking facilities. We will definitely be staying again.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470783102~“Perfect Apartments”~These apartments are spacious, clean luxurious, the most comfortable beds and pillows we've ever experienced. We had breathtaking views of the city and of the river. Perfect location, we had everything at our fingertips within walking distance & with children. Friendly, polite & most helpful staff which was absolutely delightful, there wasn't much more we could as for apart from an on location restaurant was it's only flaw if any. There was plenty of restaurants surrounding us was no big deal. Would definitely stay at this Meriton again or would be willing to try any other of there appartments. This is definitely a home away from home.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470773422~“Great stay. Cleaning is a common problem for Meriton”~In 2017 we stayed in North Sydney and in Brisbane at Hershel str. And in 2015 in Bonday Sydney and Gold Cost. Cleaning quality is a problem the chain-wide. Gold Coast in 2015 was the worst cleaning wise.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470772074~“Comfy apartment in the middle of the city”~I stayed in a standard apartment. very spacious and comfy. had everything I wanted for my three night stay for work. Room and the lounge were facing Brisbane river. Well sound isolated. Would stay again and recommend to anyone. ~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470770298~“Highly Recommend”~Great clean and tidy room and the bed was amazing  Top location with short walk to queen street mall and Suncorp stadium  Parking on site was convenient  Staff were easy to deal with and very professional~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470760064~“3 Bedroom apartment”~We had a 3 bedroom apartment and were supplied 4 towels for 6 people. Our stay was for a wedding and I had given the hotel names in an email of who was arriving and at what times (hairdresser, makeup artist, photographer, cars) and they said they would call when each person arrived. They never called and one in particular was our hire cars. They waited down stairs for 15 mins and not once did the front desk think to call our room and notify us they were there. I thought they hadn't shown up. I wasn't going to wait the in lobby in my wedding dress so preffered to stay in room. The lay out of the main bathroom is also terrible.  I was also going to be charged $42 per car, per night for parking even though when I phoned to book the room and also when my parents when to view the room, I was told that at least 1 car space was included and a second if available. I refuse to pay an extra $170 for our cars. Lucky this was waivered!~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470755215~“Terrific location, Terrific Accommodations!”~My husband found this lovely serviced apartment hotel, just about 1 block from the Brisbane AirTrain station at Roma Street....we stayed for a total of 7 nights there, in a Modern Suite with 1 Bedroom. There was a fully equipped kitchen, a laundry room with a washer and a dryer, and 1 bathroom, one Bathroom, with a full tub/shower and sink and the other, was a powder room, with a toilet and sink. A lovely large living room and several couches and a chair...very very spacious, and the King bed was so comfy. I would give this hotel a 10, for it's cleaniness, the front desk service and especially the location. There was a lovely indoor pool, but neither of us managed to get down there to swim but we did check it out, and there was an area to work out.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_470728420~“A nice hotel to stay”~The building is the highest in Brisbane, it would be good if the roof top open for us, I guess it would be an advantage for this spot. Also, the location is near busy area, good for us to shopping, you can also visit Roma St. garden which is only 300 meter distance, the Garden is very beautiful.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_470444090~“I am in love!!!”~This is probably one of my favourite hotels.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment on floor 73 and we had so much room! I could have stayed in the hotel for the rest of my holiday in Brisbane just to look at the views. We found ourselves sitting in front of the windows watching the world pass by. The only downside is the elevators, we had to leave 5 minutes early because we'd end up waiting for an elevator for ages but with 4 elevators serving 25-74 floors we get why. Otherwise there is nothing i can fault in this hotel. It was perfect. The pool, spa, sauna and gym was great. We could get pizza delivered straight to our apartment door. It had everything we could want and more!~5~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan
