review_475656505~“Poorly managed”~We stayed here for two nights including good Friday. We were told on arrival (a letter was provided) that there is no service on Good Friday due to liquor license restrictions so no cooked breakfast or room service would be available, which was annoying since we wanted food not alcohol. Then we were told there would only be room service cooked breakfasts on Saturday but this was due to staff shortages. As you can imagine MacDonalds was very busy those two days. I asked if the rooms would be serviced at Saturday and she guaranteed me they would. When we got back late Saturday night they had not been done so we had wet towels, no coffee and no serviced room. The pleasant night manager gave us towels and coffee. All very frustrating since they charge extra for public holidays but provide no services.  We did get ONE complimentary drink voucher (useless since the bar was shut) and in the room there was ONE little packet of biscuits. Not enough for TWO people.  The rooms are new spacious and fresh, the beds are comfortable BUT they have the worst showers ever. The water pressure is nonexistent.  The management needs to improve their booking and service for long weekends. Either pay the staff or make the rooms cheaper and inform patrons the rooms won't be serviced.  This did not make my celebration weekend enjoyable or romantic.  Stay away from here on public holidays. !!!!!! ~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_439796960~“It's What the Area Needed”~Wow! This hotel is exactly what the area needed.  Staff were fantastic, went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. Convenient restaurant, just down stairs, large variety menu. If that doesn't catch your eye, there are plenty of eateries within walking distance.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are heavenly, nothing short of a King Size bed.  The only down size was having to pay for wifi All in all it was a wonderful stay. Will certainly be back and would highly recommend the hotel for anyone that needs to stay in the area.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~4~5~nan
review_429104783~“visiting family”~The Motel is situated on a main road. 1 minute walk to the shopping centre. Bus stops just down the road. Hotel for great food right beside the Motel. The rooms are very nice and spacious. Would stay here again.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_424824408~“Great hotel and convenient to the airport and lots of shops close by”~I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Helpful staff, very big rooms, clean and modern. It is rated 4.5 stars but I would give it 5. it is right next door to shops and choice of different eating places, cafes, etc. It took me just 30 minutes to get to the airport from the hotel. Bed was very comfortable!! Only disappointing thing was no wifi in the rooms. The cleaning staff were so good and very friendly. All in all a good experience.~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_409081138~“Convenient location for meals and great parking!”~The hotel seems quite new and the staff are friendly and helpful. There is a bistro/bar attached and if very convenient after a long day at the office. Also the room service breakfast was excellent and that kept me going for a bit. Checking in/out was easy. Only issue I had was trying to find the driveway entrance. If you use google maps, you end up driving past the hotel a few times which is what I did. As the hotel is on the corner of a major intersection it was not given approval for a driveway entrance due to traffic. So you need to enter at the McDonalds entrance. Once this was explained to me by the staff, it was a breeze getting in and out.~4~nan~4~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_407021392~“contemporary hotel”~A good place to stay for a couple of nights close to Brisbane CBD and the airport. The hotel is clean and a refreshing interior a bit contemporary.  The usual home hotel comforts. It is very close in fact walking distance 2 shopping areas and fast food outlets. Plenty of parking available. Next door is a restaurant which is okay I sports bar and gaming machines if needed. The hotel is located to nearby business parks. ~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_400243009~“Surprising Quality”~Have stayed a couple of times now. Rooms are large and modern (hanging space is a bit of an issue), and the pub food downstairs is very good. Perfect for a business stay, and a shortish cab ride to the city if you want some different dining~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan~4~nan
review_390617144~“Modern & comfortable”~It was the first time I had stayed in this hotel. The last time I was in the area it was still being built. Checkin (a group) was quick & efficient. The room was large & extremely comfortable. The bed was awesome. Will certainly stay again when next in this area~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_385009717~“Great accomodation ”~Everything here is great, check in very easy but the rooms are outstanding. Big king size beds, big flat screens, walk in shower, good sized rooms and bathroom. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Attached eatery is also very good.  The only down side is that there is a cost to use the attached gym~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_384069130~“Very comfortable but you pay for it”~We had a very comfortable night at this hotel. It is however very difficult to work out how to get into it. You have to go through the shopping centre as both the main roads it is on have no access. That said. We found the room incredibly large. My husband paced out 7 metres from bed to window!!! Extraordinary!!! Bed and pillows were wonderful and I am extremely fussy as I have a very bad back and cannot sleep for pain in a bad bed. Slept all night. Everything was what you would expect clean and in good condition. Price is a little high for being so far out from city centre but if you are like us and attending a function out that way it's perfect. Had a lovely breakfast and it was reasonably priced. They also gave us two free drinks the night before. Thank you for your lovely service.~5~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_380442165~“Not a 4.5 star hotel at all!”~Stayed here for work, as the location was good and the pictures looked good. My boss had trouble booking the room, as the first time she rang no one could help her with booking, and promised to call back. She received no call back and had to ring again, and was able to book. We arrived quite late, and due to extremely poor signage missed the turn off the first time. The lady at reception was competent, but not friendly. We dropped our bags, and ate at the pub next door, which was ok. We got back to our room at 11.30 and as I was getting into bed I noticed my sheets quite clearly had not been changed since the room was used last. There were short black hairs all over the pillow, and on top of the sheets and in the bed. There was also a couple of pubic hairs in the bed. I called down to reception (advertised as 24/7), and even though I tried 3 times over 15 minutes, there was no answer. I was exhausted and had an early work appointment, so I brushed the bed down as best I could and slept on top of the covers. Upon checking out the next morning, my boss mentioned there had been long black hair all through her bathroom. I explained the problem to the lady at reception, and offered to show her the photos I had taken of the hair on and through the bed. She was apologetic, and asked for my email address so a manager could get in touch with me. One week later and I haven't heard a thing from the hotel, so I am putting this review up as a cautionary tale to other travellers. To the hotel: Being brand new and having funky furniture does not make you a four and a half star hotel. Basic cleanliness is a must.~1~nan~4~nan~nan~1~3~nan
review_376271581~“Brand new, huge rooms and good location!!!”~Nice location and it is a brand new property. The room was huge, and the bed was super comfortable. There is also a great restaurant next door, service was very poor. Checkin took more than 15 mins and the receptionsist was not at all friendly. However finding the entrance was a nightmare they need better signage dor sure, i had to drive around the block as i could not find the entrance.~4~4~nan~nan~5~nan~2~nan
review_370275393~“Ultra comfy bed”~Finding the entrance to this Hotel is the biggest challenge. We arrived at night & although the Hotel is clearly visible (bright lights) we did 3 U-turns before we discovered that the Hotel can only be accessed by turning into the shopping centre & following the service road. Hope this bit of info helps others! Whilst checking in I asked where there might be a smoking area. It turns out that the 4th floor has a very good sized balcony outfitted with a steel bench & 2 big ashtrays either end. The receptionist was kind enough to re-allocate our room to the 4th floor so that we had easy access to the smoking area. The room was very spacious with a huge King sized bed. The bedding was luxurious & a good night's sleep was had. Bathroom was also big & modern. I booked through the Hotel website & got the room $30 cheaper than on Expedia. There is a drive thru bottle shop downstairs for those that want to play in their room. The hotel also boasts a Restaurant, a bar that offers Keno facilities & a few pool tables. There is also music on a Sat night. There is a large car park outside the Hotel plus undercover parking for Hotel guests with lifts taking you from the basement direct to your floor. All in all, value for money & I'd stay again.~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan
review_368682148~“Nice location for a reasonable price ”~This hotel is fairly new and well furnished in modern style. The bed size and quality meets the highest standards. Room service good. Brakfast location in or outdoor is nice while the food offering at the buffet is quite limited.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_365901052~“Very Pleasant Stay”~This is a very modern hotel with good sized suites including a spacious bathroom with shower. The flat screen TV is a good size with loads of options including a good pay movie selection. A nice big bed with loads of pillows, although a little softer than I am used to, but I did sleep very well. The reception staff were really nice and even leant me a USD charger as I had forgotten mine. The complex has a restaurant & bars attached which provided a good service, however if I had been staying a third night I probably would have eaten elsewhere. A couple of small things affected my overall experience; 1. My package included breakfast in the restaurant (not room service) and on check-in I was told breakfast started at 6am which suited me as I had to leave for meetings by 6:30. On showing up for breakfast at 6am I found the restaurant locked and nobody at reception, hence 2 days without breakfast. 2. None of the powerpoints in my room would charge my laptop, very weird?? 3. The room setup has chairs & a table in front of the windows which made it extremely awkward to open & close the curtains. 4. You have to pay for wifi.....a little behind the times I think. Like I say these are only small criticisms and I would recommend this hotel.~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_356902162~“Good value for money”~My sisters and I spent the weekend in this lovely recently refurbished hotel. The beds, bathroom and living room area are absolutely amazing. The rooms are very comfortable and relaxing. My favorite part of it was the bed, I felt like coming back another weekend just to sleep the whole time and recover from our busy lives in the city (yes they are that comfortable) The restaurant was ok. The service average and the food can be improved. Room service was good we had a lovely family dinner in the room.  There are limited facilities which is maybe why they have only 4 stars. No pool, no gym, no SPA. They do have a night club, but they charge entrance fee even if you are a guest in the hotel.  Most of the staff in the hotel, the restaurant and the club really need to improve their customer service attitude. The only person who was absolutely wonderful to us was the night bar supervisor she was lovely and you could tell she enjoys what she does. I wish I could remember her name so she could get the proper recognition. Overall the stay was nice and we would be back.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_355928838~“nice looking new complex”~hotel rooms very good nice clean, compfy bed, room with a view mini bar would have been good, but did see a fridge next too reception on way out the next day, we had 3 rooms all very good. definitely recommend stay here, will be back next time with work again.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_353980771~“Work conference”~Great location to meet for a work conference. Conference rooms, accomodation, restaurant and hotel. Great food and friendly staff. Plenty of parking and easy to find. Food was magnificent. I spent the day at this hotel and it had a nice feel to it. Plenty of traffic going past you, but nice and quiet inside.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_352739160~“Outstanding”~This place is fantastic. The rooms are huge. The beds are new and very comfortable. The pillows are first class which is one of my bug bears. Air conditioning worked perfectly and did not blow directly onto you in the bed which all too many do.The restaurant and bar was very efficient, the service was generally first class and the breakfast was great. The breakfast bacon and eggs was a la Coffee Club which I love. $24 for the lot was great value and outstanding quality. I wish this place was everywhere I travel in Australia. Underground car parking at no charge. Whoever designed and built this place is or was a regular travel with a brilliant attention to detail. Could not fault a thing. Loved it and cannot recommend highly enough. Let me know if you own similar properties anywhere and I'm there too. Bravo.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_334566618~“Clean and comfy”~Loved my stay here. It would have been perfect if wifi is free. All the basic hotel stuff are there except internet service which you need to pay for. Quite confusing on which road to take to enter the hotel, maybe put more signs to say where to enter? All good, will choose this hotel again.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_328508942~“Beds from heaven”~We stayed here for a family function. The rooms are large and well appointed. Being this is a new hotel everything was new and in good condition.  Positives:  - beds are dreamy, best sleep I've had in ages  - large bathrooms - plenty of storage space  - close to shops and fast food if you did not want to dine in the restaurant  - friendly staff Negatives:  - the sauces on the shelves were very dusty and still had food residue from previous guest.  - quite a lot of white hair was picked up on from the floor by our crawling baby.  - we gave a cash bond on checkin, I found it quite weird that the staff did not check our room prior to handing our bond back on check out? Thankfully we didn't trash the room!!  With that said I would definitely stay here again. It is a beautiful hotel.~4~nan~nan~5~nan~3~4~nan
review_327738769~“Modern and new”~This is a great new hotel that is a good place to stay if you are happy staying in the on place meals are big and good ( not cheep) sports bar is great and staff friendly if you work nearby worth a try,~4~nan~nan~4~4~nan~5~nan
review_326098675~“Only stay here if every other hotel is booked out!”~From the very beginning we felt like the staff didn't care and they were stuck up. They had EXTREMELY loud music playing into the middle of the night, just that shows a big lack of respect for their guests. Other guests weren't happy either and the staff didn't care. The sheets were stained too but the bed was comfortable. There are plenty of other places to stay in Brisbane and if I were you I'd only stay here as a last resort. If someone else owned and run the hotel I would go back but until then, never!!!~1~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_322806142~“not too bad, but I won't go back again”~it is not a terrible experience but I won't stay in the hotel again. three reasons, first the bed linings was not changed everyday, bed sheet was only changed once during the 7 days I was staying there, and the pillows and cushions with dust was thrown back on top of the bed without getting the dust off. second, this hotel is newly refurbished but has strong smell of new paint, it gets stronger without using the air-con, last, the hotel staff are not very visible, seems understaffed there was only just one person behind the counter, and he/she is not always available. The good part is the bed, very comfortable.~3~nan~nan~3~nan~2~3~nan
review_313907778~“Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in”~The hotel suite has only been open since May, so everything is new and modern. Great foyer area, but we also noted that the hallways were really wide and spacious. We had a king size bed, it was so soft (including the pillows), it felt like you were sleeping on a cloud. We had the best night's sleep. Being new, the air conditioner was also accurate. The room decor was really nice too.  The only negative is a 2.5% credit card charge, which is stated by signage and also when I booked the room online. I paid using my savings account and was still charged the amount. No-one pays by cash anymore, so I think this is a bit unfair.~5~nan~nan~5~nan~5~4~nan
review_309715342~“Decent pub meal”~We did not stay in the hotel but dinned in the restaurant for lunch.  The venue looks good as new, very modern and clean.  Be prepared for large meals! I had the pie and it was more than twice the size of your normal pie. The salads are also large considering they fell under the entree category. Food was probably more salty than I like.  Also had the cheese and bacon garlic bread to share. Very heavy and very cheesy but I suppose again depends on what you like. Service was ok. ~3~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_308746213~“A great stay!”~We really enjoyed our stay! The hotel was not what we expected to find out of the CBD precinct. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Hotel is modern and very funky. Service was great in both the hotel and restaurant areas. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
review_294807367~“New & Fresh”~I have stayed here twice now and the king suite rooms are a good size. As this is a new hotel everything is fresh and clean. There are a few things they didn't get right when designing this hotel and the main one would be the cupboard space or lack of it. There is very limited hanging space and the space is only for shirts/tops as it is not long enough to hang dresses, pants, skirts. No drawers or shelves. The other issue is actually accessing the hotel. If you were following your GPS you would end up on the road out the front but no access. You have to access through entrance to shopping centre but there is no signage to show this. It appears the house keeping daily only change towels, pull beefing up, empty bins and rinse cups/ glasses. They definitely do not vacuum the room. The staff are a bit hit and miss, some great, some flat out smiling~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_282554290~“A new experience for anyone wanting to stay outside of Bne CBD”~Usually if you are a corporate traveler you have to stay in the CBD precinct to get good quality accommodation and service. Not anymore, Calamvale Hotel Suites will rival anything you can find in the CBD for the same or similar money, it is on the South Side of the city but has great access to the freeways and major arterials, lots of parking and the dinning is great. Now for the best parts, the rooms and the service; being a new hotel the rooms are in great shape, but even over time they will stand the test, as they are large, well equipped, quiet, very comfortable beds and pillows and wonderful views (room service never tasted so great until you are sitting at your huge window overlooking the city skyline). Then there is the service, it cant be faulted, the establishment should be very proud of their training, everything is as you expect and your feedback is actually taken on board! Well done all round and you wont be disappointed if you choose to stay here. **Hint** Don't restrict yourself to the room service menu, go down have a drink at the bar and choose from the full range, they'll still deliver so you get the views.~5~4~nan~nan~5~nan~5~nan
review_275177877~“Great rooms, helpful staff, comfy beds”~Brand new hotel. Has everything you need, bar, restaurant, gaming etc. The rooms are beautiful, everything is nice and new. The only complaint would be the pillows are too big! Staff are very friendly and helpful. Restaurant has great food options as well.~4~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
