review_478707645~“Improving”~Staff need to be more diligent to check all is fully ready for the next visitor. It was a bother not being able to secure my valuables. Also very frustrating not having the convenience of dining downstairs in your restaurant the night I checked in. I am slightly disabled and having the restaurant on the premises was one of the reasons I chose your Hotel.~3~3~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_478392420~“convenient”~was a lovely clean and friendly hotel. wonderful views of the Brisbane river from our room if you want to stand up or sit on very uncomfortable stools, shame the windows were not lower or a balcony. shame also that the restaurant is not open on a Saturday night. bed was very comfy and we had a good nights sleep.~3~4~3~4~3~4~4~nan
review_478165184~“Good views and value”~I stayed at the Park Regis last Saturday and while not the most central location (it is a 5 - 10 minute walk to Southbank / Queen St)  The location gives riverview rooms a great view down the river of both Southbank and the city. It is also close to Roma St station for those taking public transport.  Parking isn't cheap and the carpark is horrible and tight and the lifts can take an age to arrive.~4~4~3~nan~nan~nan~3~nan
review_475459293~“Terrible staff”~Firstly, the location is not that central, In Fact it's a long walk to the centre of town or to south bank. It is however, manageable but make sure you leave yourself time and at night I wouldn't walk it alone as there are some quiet spots closer to the hotel area with not a lot of people around. I'll comment on what I believe was the only good things! This hotel is more apartment styled, with a big sitting area and kitchen, so I was very impressed with that, although because we were in a corner room it seemed to have wasted space. The bedroom however is pretty tiny! No tv in the bedroom. The view was ok. Swimming pool tiny. We arrived late, to find that the room we had booked was not the room we had been given. It took him ages to check us in and seeemd to be such an inconvenience. I phoned to say we had booked a double room and that we had a king single. He said I'll have to find you another room. We waited and waited it was about 1am by this time, in the end we walked down and as I approached the desk he said look can you just sit over there and wait. Then I was told there were no spare rooms and he would have to seperate the beds and give us the room we had booked in the morning. He went up to do this and took ages to come back and tell us the room was ready. The room was so small that even though the beds were separated into single beds we could have knocked the other if we'd moved our arms.  The next day I heard nothing about a room change. No note under the door, no call nothing. I phoned that night and they said oh we can do it tomorrow, but by that point we only had one night left. Not good enough to not get the room you booked.  We also were under the impression that free internet meant free internet not 2gb a day for two people. I would never stay here again, the worse thing about the hotel is the staff doesn't seem to know what customer service is and they certainly appeared like they were in no hurry to find out. Further the standard hold on my credit card that hotels take, as a deposit in case of damage took nearly 10day to come off my card, we I phoned they said well it will come off so you don't need to worry.  Seriously the worst run hotel I've ever seen.~2~2~2~nan~nan~nan~1~nan
review_474780861~“Perfect if you are going to Suncorp”~Great value for money, nice modern & clean room. 10 min walk to Suncorp. There was a slight issue with my booking that was fixed right away by staff & compensated by free parking. Would defiantly stay here again~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_474489339~“Convenient location and comfortable apartment”~Excellent location for visiting Brisbane as a tourist. Very near to Roma Street Transport hub and easy walk across bridge to South Bank museums, galleries, restaurants, boat trips and cultural attractions. Close to sporting venues and to a cinema, Coles supermarket and bars and restaurants nearby. Apartment was well equipped, had a good kitchen and was comfortable. Reception staff were all extremely helpful and welcoming. We had a problem with our reservation, caused by our travel agent not by Park Regis , and despite being very busy on a Friday night when we arrived the Park Regis receptionist was exceptionally helpful and resolved the problem for us. Their customer care was exceptional.We stayed for 8 nights and would definitely return here again. Great views over the city. Efficient and quiet airconditioning which was much needed in very hot weather. The installation of a new lift is urgently needed, however, and is due to be completed soon. Currently only one lift is working and this did cause some delays.~4~nan~5~nan~4~nan~5~nan
review_473987073~“Disappointed customer !!!”~We were disappointed, on the whole, with our visit to Park Regis North Quay. I had stayed here before and bragged about how good an experience it was back then. I think it was the Oaks North Quay, or at least another owner. The check-in and check-out was a poor experience. We couldn't get into the carpark underneath, because the receptionist forgot to program the keycard. Also, it was an absolute ripoff, having to pay an extra $28, on top of our room fare, for parking overnight. Then, when we returned home, late that night after dinner, our "King" size bed was 2 King singles pushed together, with a big, uncomfortable ridge in the middle. Oh, and there was a pubic hair in the shower, when my partner first used it. Our overall experience was extremely disappointing !!! Unfortunately, nothing like my previous experiences at this hotel. I doubt that we'll be in a hurry to come back anytime in the future.~2~2~4~2~2~2~2~nan
review_473973870~“Family Brisbane Visit”~Pool area and access areas need some serious work done. Very depressing area of the hotel to visit. The furniture was broken and old with no plants. Paving was broken and one of my children tripped on it.~3~3~5~3~3~3~4~nan
review_473963622~“Mr Kennedy”~No dinner service  Not advised Lift service dangerous  Nice view Hotel has b poential to improve  Good location next to river Air conditioning system in the bedroom needs undating Provide more tv channels~2~2~3~2~2~3~2~nan
review_473936640~“never disappoints”~I'm a regular visitor to this hotel. Have always received great service and great room quality. It's close to everything Brisbane has to offer and has amazing views if you book a river facing room. I would highly recommend choosing this hotel for your next visit.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_473531961~“Average”~Stayed for one night only and booked the room through Trivago so was relatively inexpensive. The hotel room was clean and tidy but the bed was uncomfortable. There are two elevators which are in the process of being upgraded - the new one was terribly slow and seemed to stop at every floor whether anyone was there or not and the old one yet to be upgraded was good but it was a lottery as to which one you got. Easy access from North Quay and check in was relatively painless. The car park was small and cramped but they waived the $28 parking fee if you signed up to their rewards card. Can't comment on the food as we ate a short walk away at Southbank. The pool was outdoors on the 2nd floor roof overlooked by other buildings and is not heated so we didn't swim. Older flat screen TV with free to air channels, limited Fox sports channels and movies you can rent for $4.95. We found that even though we were on the 11th floor that the traffic noise from North Quay, which is one of the major traffic thoroughfares for Brisbane, was noticeable throughout the night. There was also a lot of light coming into the room from the window blinds and the door. Every time someone from the neighbouring rooms left, the closing doors were loud. The staff were polite and helpful.~3~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan
review_473279110~“Perfectly located big apartment.”~Particularly for our trip, the location of this hotel was perfect. We had a day tour starting at the Roma Station, and this hotel was within 10 minute walking distance from it. We got a 1-bedroom apartment, and it was quite big with a bedroom, living room, dinette and a kitchen. The view of the river from our room was very beautiful, especially at night. Wi-Fi was provided free of charge, and it was quite good. Because we were leaving early in the morning we didn't have a chance to try their breakfast so I can't comment on it, all I know is that it was not included in our rate and would have been an extra charge. Overall, I was very happy with my stay there, and given a choice would have picked this hotel again.~4~5~5~nan~nan~nan~4~nan
review_472829537~“Always a great palce to stay.”~I always enjoy my stay at Park Regis North Quay Hotel because of its locality and pricing. However this time the sleep was really uncomfortable. I really recommend that the pillows are replaced with a decent brand asap~4~4~5~1~4~4~5~nan
review_472817736~“Amazing staff and service. Great location”~No complaints. It was an amazing experience and I will definitely be back with my partner. The river view was incredible and the bed was so comfortable. We slept like babies. We had a wonderful experience.~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan

review_471027739~“Great location”~The location was perfect for my daughter and myself as we were in Brisbane for the Justin beiber concert. We needed to stay somewhere close to Suncorp stadium and this place was great for being in the vicinity of the concert venue. ~4~4~5~4~5~4~4~nan
review_471016207~“Disappointing but out of character”~Restaurant was closed for dinner and ended up having to order take away at an inflated price. The one lift was out of service, no problems, there are two lifts................Only problem was the morning of check out the second lift was out of action due to maintenance and which resulted in being late for a meeting. Have stayed at the Regis several times over the years and never had an issue. Hope if there is a next time it will be better~3~3~3~4~3~4~2~nan
review_470703473~“Easy and welcoming”~Could not find fault with this property from staff especially at the front desk to the room everything was very good . Lift was being replaced at time but really not a bother. Will recommend and when I revisit Brisbane will definitely stay again.~5~5~4~5~5~5~5~nan
review_470426015~“Gavin Wren”~Apart from having both elevators breakdown in the morning and having to walk down 7 flights of stairs to exit the building and poor room service.  Reception should of given directions to exit.  There needs be basic cutlery in the rooms.  ~3~4~4~4~4~5~4~nan
review_470413059~“A room with a view”~Our room had a beautiful view of the river, the room was clean enough but the decor made it look old and out dated. The aircon worked well but was soooo loud. With only one lift the service was a bit slow but to be fair they are updating the lifts so to be expected.~4~4~4~4~4~4~3~nan
review_468947725~“Stay for Conference”~Had a 2 night stay for conference and found the rooms to be excellent and staff helpful. The location is handy to both the CBD and Southbank area making it a good base form which to commence both business and leisure activities~4~4~4~5~5~5~4~nan
review_468903990~“good view, needs maintenance”~The Park Regis has a great view and close to the city. The room we stayed in had a huge wet patch on the carpet from the air conditioner leaking, it was hot in the room. the shower screen was faulty and while cooking breakfast it read the sign stating to use the rangehood at all times while using the stove. It didn't work! The bed was very uncomfortable. Sadly, I stayed at a caravan park in a cabin just days before that was more luxurious than this room. We paid $430 for the night :( I will go back to the Royal Albert next time.~3~1~4~1~3~2~3~nan

review_466697833~“Good location for our Footy trip”~Good location with Suncorp Stadium only a ten minute walk via Caxton Street, Roma train station a 3 minute walk and Southbank just across the river. Room was a good size but could do with a bit of updating and maintenance,friendly staff, overall a comfortable stay~4~4~4~3~3~3~4~nan
review_466656945~“Hotel a little rundown”~Only one lift working, leading to lengthy delays for guests/room service which is annoying. Blinds in room were stained, lights not working, bathroom needs a good clean especially the windows. Just feels to me as if the hotel is due for a refurb. Staff were very friendly and efficient.~3~3~5~4~2~3~4~nan
review_466390158~“Great for the footy”~Stayed here in early march, got a great river view apartment for a nice discount. booked this room for location to suncorp stadium for Friday night football. Room was good & location was fantastic, 10 min walk to the stadium. Free wi-fi was laughable due to the amount of data allowed for free. only one operating lift was quite annoying but understood upgrades. Will stay here again.~4~5~5~4~4~4~4~nan
review_465502733~“Great stay”~Very nice stay. Will definitely stay again in this hotel. Only fault, not all tv channels were working, would like a movie channel or lifestyle channel. This is a minor issue only and will not stop me staying again.~5~4~4~5~4~5~5~nan
review_464916587~“Old and run down”~The hotel was old and run down. Only one lift was working for 24 floors and staff. Water was warm in the rooms and struggled to clean teeth.

review_463654782~“Weekend away”~Lovely hotel with great service. Will be good when lift is done. Service great but breakfast food was a bit average. Air con a little noisy in room. Parking too expensive. If you book a room you should get free parking.~4~5~5~5~4~3~4~nan
review_463413936~“Adequate but inconsistent”~The best part of staying at the Park Regis North Quay was the staff there. I appreciated their friendliness and eagerness to assist me. The biggest problem to me were the elevators. there were two and one was in repair. The waits were long and sometimes the elevators so full I had to wait longer. Also the sleeping rooms - some are beautifully decorated and well maintained and others were dingy, and cramped, and old.~3~3~5~3~3~3~3~nan
review_463143535~“Loved it!”~Had a great one night stay here. Room was lovely and the service was great :) Was down to one elevator due to renovations, but it didn't interrupt too much :) Thanks! Will recommend and stay again! Thank you~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan
review_463066493~“Long Stay at Park Regis is the only option.”~Stayed at the Park Regis, North Quay for 12 nights in a one bedroom apartment. Great view of the river and city, particularly of a night time. I have stayed here before and will continue to stay as the facilities are excellent and the value for money is exceptional. A short walk to the Barracks Shopping Centre and Caxton Street or down to the CBD and Casino. A quiet and safe area with Police HQ and Roma Street Watch-house only metres away. Wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.~5~5~4~4~5~5~5~nan
review_463050749~“Seminar Participant”~Good position, access will be much improved with the completion of the second lift, was a quiet night not any loud noises or other disturbances. Signage advice that basement levels can be accessed via stairs would be appreciated.~4~4~4~4~4~5~5~nan
review_462878099~“Mixed bag ”~This hotel has great views of Brisbane river though I found my room very noisy (from traffic on freeways adjacent to building). Room space generous though the fittings and furniture old and worn. The mattress was very old, worn and uncomfortable. Having a shower in a bath tub is not ideal either. Only one lift working (out of two) for this rather tall building made for long waits. Service at reception was good and helpful though. Also like the proximity to Roma St station. I think this hotel really needs an upgrade to 2017 standards and the cafe outside reception could do with a more appetising menu. Not sure if I would stay here again with all the great alternatives nearby.~2~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan
review_462549923~“Great stay at the Park Regis”~Room was excellent with great views of the river, softest bed ever, stayed two nights, friendly staff and very helpful, close to the city centre with plenty of restaurants close by. Tasty breakfast with plenty of choices, I will stay again.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~5~nan
