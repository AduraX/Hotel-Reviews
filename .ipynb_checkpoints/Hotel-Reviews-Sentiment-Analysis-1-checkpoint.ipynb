      "review_476956232~The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are cosy and modern. It's also an amazing experience that the beds, being built into the windows make it seem like they are floating. Definite thumbs up for this hotel.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476662030~A great little hotel, ideally located close to everything.  The staff are very receptive and helpful. Beautifully laid out and well appointed, the rooms are quaint, yet nearly practical. The amenities and supplied gratuities are first class, almost.  The bed, if more than one person is in the corner mounted bed, your climbing over your bed fellows to get out. The towels could do with replacing as they were getting well into the worn side of life.  The shower could do with a good clean to remove some growing fungus.  All being all, it's a great place to stay, and nothing should hamper your stay.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476619303~Like any modern hotel, LNH ticks off all the necessary ingredients of a convenient and functional hotel. When I received the Email confirmation of booking that our room will be available at 12 noon I was asked if there are any request and I requested a room with a view. We arrived on time but our room was not ready. We were given a slightly bigger room with a view of a small wall garden. I requested for a less boxed up room with a view. The hotel obliged and gave us a smaller room but with a view. I am mostly impressed with the design of the rooms, the use of light and efficient use of space. The communal lounges and library were equally modern and clean, although there were not much reading materials available. The breakfast at Buvette was one of the best breakfast buffet I came across. There are hot and cold, gluten-free, healthy breakfast choices. Having soy milk available makes me think how much they put a lot of thought and care with the breakfast menu, the most important meal of the day! The service and attentiveness of staff is very commendable both at Buvette and LNH. The hotel group's Palace of Versailles package is best value for money and proved to be a wonderful experience of culture and modern accommodation for me and my family. I can't wait for their next offering.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476613833~Little National Hotel offers minimal luxury, perfect for a cosy getaway. The tiny, beautifully designed room was picture -perfect and I appreciated the thoughtful extras. The library offered ample space for relaxing. Staff were generous, welcoming and professional.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476395550~Coming from a busy city like Sydney, I enjoyed the peacefulness of Little National Hotel. It was convenient to restaurants with a health club right across the road. Very modern hotel and I enjoyed my stay.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476308442~Staff were well presented and had the most lovely manners. Room was the perfect size and also well presented. Loved the common areas and facilities. Parking wifi movies etc. Just two small things. One of the two towels was dirty and also the bench in the bathroom had marks all over it. However minimal it's just a little extra attention to detail. But have to say again - staff were fab!~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476297501~Staff not good with NESB guests. Overflowing smelly rubbish bins near entrance. Car park was in other complex 100's of metres walk away from elevator. Free breakfast promised is not free (staff use doublespeak to convince guests otherwise). Due to poor design website is problematic when it comes to booking online.  Otherwise all fine :)~nan~nan~nan~4~1~3~nan\n",
      "review_476257662~We stayed one night on our way to Sydney. Hotel and rooms very modern. David on reception was great with dining options. Beds very comfy and bathroom well appointed; plenty of parking and a lovely bar area. Will definitely stay again.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476253149~We stayed 1 night here and were pleasantly surprised by the efficient and friendly staff, fantastic facilities and convenient location. The free wifi and free movies were a real bonus. The whole experience was let down by the musty smelling room 634. It was very unpleasant and left a lingering odour on our luggage.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_475946436~Great hotel with compact but really comfortable rooms. Free movies, T2 and coffee pods. Bed is huge and right in the window with views over the city. Friendly and helpful staff. Would definitely stay here again. Central location very close to Manuka cafes, restaurants and shops . Bike rental here too.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",

      "review_475147515~I was only here for one night on business. But a lovely room, smallish and quirky, but exactly what I needed, beautiful big comfortable bed, no noise, very modern. A great shower and the best nights sleep I've had in a motel for a very long time. Short walk down to Kingston Foreshore for plenty of meal and drink options. Would definitely stay here again.~nan~5~5~nan~nan~5~nan\n",

      "review_474327282~Loved this hotel, it felt warm and cosy (especially for one in my room), yet was also clean and modern. Staff friendly and helpful. Lovely Library with a view on level 5. Several good dining options across the street at Realm. Ideal location for the April runs.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",

      "review_473763146~Beautiful, modern hotel. Smart use of space and great service. The hotel was very conveniently located and great value for money. I would definitely recommend Little National Hotel to anyone visiting Canberra!~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_473724936~The thing that struck me when I checked into the Little National was the apparent space. Big open corridors decorated with museum like pieces of art, a spacious lounge and a large library/study. As you enter the room the tight space strangely doesn't seem to tight even though the bed is snugly fitted to the width of the room. A strange feeling. Effective though. I liked it. I made good use of the public open spaces too to relax and meet with colleagues. The other strange thing about this hotel is that it is on two floors of a car park. From the outside it looks like a cube! Almost unattractive. Staff were very friendly. There is no restaurant here, though there is a cafe right next to the hotel for breakfast and coffee.~nan~4~4~nan~nan~4~nan\n",
      "review_473344208~Very clean hugh bed. Bed very comfy. Lots of recent free movies. Nespresso coffee and t2 tea. Close to art gallery parliament house and lake. Hotel has a library with comfy seats work places coffee machine and microwave.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_473217587~on checking out i was advised that i had several drinks at the bar very funny when i don't drink  I was then advised that i had several drinks from my mini bar and again i don't drink overall the staff where very nice  ~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_472323454~Driving up, this place looked like a multi-story car park from the outside and I could make out beds pushed up against the window and I thought oh no, I've booked a shoe box.  Once inside however, staff was friendly, hotel feels quite new, elegant, well maintained and the common lounge areas looked really comfy.  Note there is a cafe/ restaurant in the lobby area but it's closed on weekends.  The rooms are quite compact but comes with everything you need. Bathrobes, slippers, T2, Nespresso machine, nice toiletries, great shower, oh and the bed, the super king sized bed is the best! It was the best sleep I've had in ages.  What a great find, I'm still patting myself on the back.  As for parking, it's free all weekend and plenty of it outside or in the under cover car park.  Loved our stay, we will be back!~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_472037668~This place is a great hotel for a short visit to the capital. The rooms are small but all you need if you are not planning on spending a lot of time in your room. If you like soft, comfy beds these are spacious and fluffy. Be careful not to bang your shins getting out though! The blockout blinds are great and the bathroom is great as well with a good shower. We hired bikes from the lobby which was very handy to explore Canberra. The girls on reception were efficient and friendly and i would recommend this hotel if you are planning a visit here.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n"

      "review_472026834~First visit to this hotel. Staff competent and hotel spotless - one of the new style. Having worked in hotels internationally for 40 years and stayed at 100's ( or more) over this period of time, the rooms here would have to be the smallest I have ever encountered. The king size bed is wedged up sideways against the window so one person needs to climb over the other to get out of bed. Not that I complained! However the room has everything a traveller needs - just don't spend too much time in it. You watch to by sitting on the bed. We did book online via trip adviser at $120 whereas the direct rate with the hotel was over $170. I checked today at home to see if this was normal. Popped in a dummy date of 27 April. Direct with hotel was $240 whilst trip adviser was $175. All rooms same size. Check out was good - no one did ask us if we enjoyed it.~nan~nan~nan~3~5~5~nan\n",
      "review_471976849~We were wonderfully surprised with this small but very well thought out room, as we just wanted somewhere to sleep it was perfect, from the excellent bed and shower to the multitude of plugs and USB chargers this modern efficient room and friendly staff will be the only place we stay in Canberra.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_471571504~This hotel is quirky, small rooms but has a library area with coffee and tea making, books, newspappers, and a pop up bar each night with specials. Close to city centre and museums, galleries and a variety of good restaurants. The staff were very helpful, nothing was too much to ask of them. The beds must be the best ever, ( in my experience  he Freemont Hotels in Canada have the next best) in fact they have a flyer in the room to tell you how to buy one, must be asked a lot. Will I stay there again, can't wait.This hotel is great for the business person, or the weekend traveller wanting a crash pad after a day of touring.~nan~nan~5~nan~5~5~nan\n",
      "review_471043064~After getting in later than expected due to a delayed flight, I was greeted by friendly staff with a bit of a run down on things such as food in case I hadn't eaten, the fact the pool is available at the hotel across the road as are the restaurants for dinners and breakfasts. The elevator wouldn't move until I realised I needed to swipe the reader to select the floor - the reader is not on both sides of the lifts but the buttons to select floors are. A tip is to concentrate on how to get to your room and back to the elevator if it is not close by. I entered the room and wondered how to turn the lights on, only to discover that lights in my room were not working. I was advised to open the wardrobe doors to get some light until they came to have a look. Still no light in the bathroom. Told occupancy was 100% and at 10pm, it's a bit late to do anything. Without fuss, I stayed and used my phone torch. Bed was very comfortable although the base sticks out which you soon learn to avoid after knocking it a few times - certainly couldn't see it without lights.  Being in a negative mindset, I found myself pretty annoyed that there were no face flannels in the bathroom and the alarm clock didn't have a battery. And I did check after the lights were fixed the next day. There are some nice places to eat within walking distance of the hotel. I would think twice before staying again though. For the price paid, I'm very disappointed that all I received was an apology for not having lights all night or in the morning.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",

      "review_476993229~East provided a really great ahead of trend experience. There was enough to do within the hotel, so that going out was an option, but if you did leave the hotel you were right in the middle of the lovely areas of Kingston and Manuka. The Appartment was fantastic, Agostinis is one of the best Italian restaurants we have been to, we are not Italian, but visit Italy yearly, so thats a big call. All the staff were attentive and relaxed and the great attention to interior design was perfect.~1~1~1~1~1~1~nan\n",

Agostino's downstairs is a fabulous new addition with great Italian food.~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan\n",

      "review_475501458~Stayed here three nights in a family suite (adjoining one bedroom with studio) on the family fun package. Massive credit to East Hotel for thinking about families as guests...we felt most welcome and the kids are well catered for. East Hotel is also really well located close to the Manuka shops/cafes/Coles which is good for families. Bottle shop across the road which is good for parents! Our two bedroom setup was very spacious, three tv's, two bathrooms, laundry and the kitchens well equipped. My only issue (and why this is not rated 5 stars) was that the king bed was extremely firm...too firm that it was uncomfortable for us, nearly like sleeping on the floor. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Plenty of undercover parking. Tip....a drink at Joes Bar whilst keeping the kids in line of sight on the Hotel's free Apple computers is a real treat.~5~5~nan~nan~nan~5~nan\n",

A very large room for 2 persons with small bar area to eat in. A choice of 3 restaurants made it a difficult choice, but settled for MUSE which combines an excellent bookshop. Casual dining with excellent menu and each dish we had was a credit to the chef. Also an excellent local and imported wine list. A very pleasant night.~nan~4~nan~5~nan~5~nan\n"

      "review_472822478~We stayed here for two nights to attend an exhibition at the Australian Gallery. The hotel is in a great location and close to plenty of restaurant choices in Manuka and Kingston. We were pleseantly surprised with the spaciousness of the room and in particular the large bathroom. Everything is thought of, robes, excellent toiletries etc. Comfortable bed, quiet (apart from the cockatoos!). We did have breakfast at Muse but were not impressed. Slow service and when my husband's muesli arrived it was without milk or a spoon. Unfortunately Joe's bar was closed on Sunday and Monday when we stayed so couldn't try that. We did dine at the Italian restaurant which was okay, but again the service slow and inexperienced. Mind you, we have found this at virtually every place we have eaten at in Canberra. Must be a \"Canberra thing, i.e. slow and vague\". However would be more than happy to stay at East again and have already recommended the hotel to friends.~5~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan\n",

From the moment you walk into this hotel the staff are excellent. I've been coming here 3 years now and it's gotten so popular I am booking in as early as possible sometimes 4-6 months in advance as this place does book out. The hotel and rooms have great colourful decor and interesting artwork and photography. I love the lobby lounge area. The rooms are studio and apartment style with great toiletries that smell amazing. Oh my gosh the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. If you don't want to leave the hotel For food there is a good choice of restaurants at the hotel - I recommend Joe's or room service is also good too.  If you need a gym the hotel has a small but functional one which is fine for me. The best thing here is that you feel like a valued guest.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",

Then we received a voucher for drinks at Joe's Bar and if that was not enough, we found two complimentary piccolo sparkling in the mini bar. The suite was terrific. Modern, large, spotless and very well appointed. Joe's Bar was amazing. The atmosphere and decor was beautiful and the menu just right. Muse restaurant was exceptional.

Rooms were more spacious than we'd anticipated, beds comfortable, and the linen was lovely.

      "review_476301237~We love staying at the Avenue hotel. Our third visit, been of very high quality every time. We travel quite a lot and have stayed in many hotels, I think the Avenue is one of my favourites. Such comfortable beds, everythings so well thought of. Twice we have been upgraded to a one bedroom suite. Free wifi and parking is such a bonus, you don't get that at many hotels these days. I would highly recommend this hotel.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_476016843~Excellent, clean and modern hotel and quite spacious 1 bedroom apartment awaited us. We have requested a quiet room and were placed on opposite site of hotel from Northbourne Ave (which was appreciated). Unfortunately a popular Canberra night spot is nearby in Mort St, but on a Saturday night in downtown I will not complain. Double glazing was effective and room on high floor (7) had lovely views to the mountain range. Bed very comfortable and bathroom had all required amenities at this level and satisfactory water pressure and hot water. Having choice of overhead rain shower or more conventional adjustable wall mounted shower head was a nice touch. Shower door not closing completely is not a problem unique to this property but still frustrating when bathroom floor is sopping wet after a shower. Only real complaint was parking. Very tight turning into and out of the underground car park meant hanging out of the car on more than 1 occasion to reach the swipe. Do note that this appears to be a public car park (not limited to hotel guests) so although we did manage to find a park each time upon return it was a close run thing a couple of times. There was a helpful digital sign showing how many spaces were available at the boom gate. It is unclear what happens if you are a hotel guest but could not get a space if the car park were full. Much more annoying at checkout was the $10.00 per night parking charge added to my bill - but mentioned no where in the booking, including on the aggregate web site we used to make said booking.  Parking free or Parking fee is clear enough on any web site. Silence on the issue leads to a quite reasonable assumption that it is included in the tariff (you should not have to visit the hotel web site fine print for this information, as it was suggested we should have done), and the $30.00 hit at check out left an unpleasant feeling that may well affect our choice of venue when we visit Canberra again.~3~nan~nan~nan~5~4~nan\n",
      "review_475680280~Many positives about this hotel - great room: lighting excellent; spacious and clean. Good facilities (iron and ironing board hidden behind panel between sliding cupboard doors!) tea/coffee making etc. Beware the bar-fridge - a little too policed for my liking and make sure you read the Info card! Balcony is a huge plus and would stay again if only for this reason as it means not living in A/C. Both food and service at the \"Bar\" was great - though, disappointingly, the same cannot be said for the actual Restaurant (breakfast and dinner included!) On arrival, Front desk service was great and staff very helpful - this is always appreciated. Would I recommend this hotel (notwithstanding lack of service and value for money at the Restaurant)? Yes - but check out other places to eat. (Note - Food service is available only during limited hours at the Bar) Note: Service rating dragged down by lack of same at Restaurant - but very good elsewhere in this nice hotel.~nan~nan~3~nan~5~3~nan\n",

The WiFi was fast and free, and there was free parking. And it had a well equipped, well maintained gym open 24/7.

Excellent bathroom with walk-in shower and laundry facilities behind doors. My only advice to those that are light sensitive is to use a sleeping mask.

We loved the room, particularly as it was really two rooms (one being a one bedroom apartment and the other a normal hotel room). Because of this, each room had TVs in the bedroom as well as the lounge room of the apartment. There were also two bathrooms which is always handy. The kitchen had everything you would need with a decent size fridge. It was great to have access to a washing machine and dryer. The room was clean and modern and the wifi worked well. Beds were very comfortable and bathrooms were a good size with nice showers. We all said we wished we could stay for a week rather than just the night.

      "review_476762507~We stayed at the Hyatt Canberra for one night with our toddler. From what I remember, it was quite expensive to hire a cot, so we just used the existing bedding. The king bed was comfortable and was big enough for three of us. Bathroom was wonderful, our son loved his bath time.  We had the Easter dinner buffet, which was superb! We recently dined at a popular seafood buffet located at an international hotel in Sydney but this one was far better!. Oysters were really fresh and the king crabs were so tasty. All the other dishes were also great and we especially loved the pork belly, duck and spinach rice. Desserts were divine as well. Loved the chocolate fountain and panna cotta.  We didn't bring our swimmers but the swimming pool looked good. We hired bicycles at the club house and rode all the way to Kingstone along the river. It was great as they had a bicycle with a child seat. We didn't have the buffet breakfast but had light breakfast from the cafe near the lobby. The furniture was a little dated but had a nice ambience. Overall, we had a pleasant stay and will definitely return.

On the fourth floor, our view was of an empty courtyard, without so much as a blade of grass in sight. But the room was spacious and beautifully appointed, and we were very comfortable. Our daughter's gift of French champagne was on ice awaiting our arrival along with chocolates from the hotel in honour of my husband's birthday. We found the food and service in the lounge to be excellent quality and very abundant. All the staff we met were friendly and enthusiastic and seemed to be enjoying their work. Nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed the Christmas carvery buffet in the Federation Ballroom for Christmas lunch. The room was beautifully set up for couples, families and other groups and the range of food options was stupendous. Best if you enjoy seafood as oysters, prawns, muscles, lobster and salmon were a major attraction, but there was also a huge range of other options including the traditional roasts. Wine and other drinks were provided and the desserts were to die for. It's not cheap, but the luxury of having it all prepared for you is worth it. So we'll probably be back but I will be asking for a garden view - probably a more expensive option.~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",

Also the rooms are next to service lifts and from 5am you can hear a motor starting and stopping. This doesn't stop until late in the evening. Very disappointing for $400+/night. Some advice ask for a room NOT above the restaurant or near service areas.  Putting that aside the hotel was lovely and the staff are will to help. The buffet breakfast was great.

Staff were very friendly and efficient from the pre arranged airport pick up through to check out and return to the airport. All these services were faultless. The only area letting the side down slightly is the 2 restaurants. In the Promenade Restaurant I was presented with a poorly prepared starter which I returned without touching it. In the Tea House lobby cafe I had the special afternoon tea which while served in a most attractive area with indoor and outdoor areas turned out to be a buffet affair the service of beverages was quite satisfactory but if it was supposed to be a \"high tea\" I would have expected a traditional table service for the food. Having said that we had a most enjoyable couple of hours. Whilst I was entertaining guests at tea I was otherwise solo and was disappointed the there were no half bottles of wine on the list as the freshness of wines by the glass is sometimes doubtful.

A soak in the long tub - possibly the nicest soaking tub we’ve experienced - is a luxurious experience. Park Hyatt’s main restaurant, Promenade Café, specializes in extensive breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets, with a very wide range of offerings at many different stations. Particularly popular is its weekend Seafood Buffet. Promenade Café also offers an à la carte menu, which, in our mind, was better than the buffet offerings. The filet mignon was tender and delicious, the roast chicken with rocket salad very nicely prepared. The chocolate caramel lava cake was tasty but even sweeter than expected. On Sundays, Afternoon Tea in the lobby is an elaborate affair, with an unbelievably large number of delicacies, and clearly extremely popular with couples, brides-to-be and families. Better make a reservation as last-minute arrivals will not be accommodated due to every table’s being occupied. Only downsides are very limited restaurant options, no gift shop/necessities store, confusing layout, other wise, would certainly rate a “5.”~nan~nan~4~nan~4~5~nan\n",
      "review_474434887~Whilst we have visited Canberra many times, this was our first stay at the Hyatt. As far as the hotel goes, we were not disappointed. We found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful - obviously well trained -, the room was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom very well appointed.  We were, however, disappointed with the food. We opted for the buffet on the Saturday evening. We found the food on offer very ordinary ( I think we paid $75/head). The 'fresh' seafood was obviously frozen, the hot dishes were barely warm and the dessert bar quite mundane. On top of that, the coffee at the end was charged as extra. In summary, we would stay at the Hyatt again, but will almost certainly eat at a restaurant outside of the hotel, of which Canberra has many great options.~4~nan~nan~4~nan~5~nan\n",
      "review_474418937~Check in was seamless and the people at the front door very pleasant. Our room was on level four near the presidential suite which meant we had to walk through the hotel to get there. I was amazed by how many people were there for the afternoon – it was packed to the rafters. Apparently it gets booked our two weeks in advance so if you are going make sure you book early (it looked impressive).  The room was fine albeit maybe a little tired. Size was good and had everything you would need. The interesting thing was that the room was marketed as a king bed but it was only a queen size bed which I thought was a little cheeky. With our room we had access to the Ambassador Club. This was a lounge, below the presidential suite, that had free tea, coffee and juice and snack food (very little) during the day. From 6-8pm there were drinks and canapés and this was a nice treat (the food, like the hotel, felt a little dated – but was lovely).  There is a good size gym, pool at the back of the hotel. The tennis court was $10 to hire which I wasn’t informed about. I thought that disclosure would have been appropriate as opposed to me having to query it when I received my bill. I am assuming the gym was free… We didn’t eat at the hotel but there were a couple of options as well as the trusty buffet for those so inclined. I did go down to the bar at 9pm on Saturday evening and other than one other couple, there was nobody there…strange. It sadly lacked atmosphere and I also thought the wine by the glass options were very boring/ average. The scotch options however were comprehensive. Other bits - the hotel is wedding central which for some people could be a problem however we found it to be quite fu. A rollaway bed for a young kid will set you back $80.00. Our room had free wi-fi but not sure if that applies throughout the hotel. There is also ample parking around the hotel and its free. It is very centrally located and the architecture it colonial and big and airy. I have stayed in a number of hotels in Canberra and I think this is a hotel that appeals to an older generation – very classic with a bit of old fashioned charm.~nan~4~nan~3~nan~4~nan\n",

      "review_474414689~Gardens at the front of the hotel are beautifully maintained but the interior doesn't match up. The carpets everywhere are in need of replacement. The bed base squeaks and the bed head was very worn on one side. Housekeeping needs much better supervision as the turn down service did not turn the bed down and was erratic. The used coffee cup was ignored as was the milk frother from the coffee machine. The Ambassador Club staff were very pleasant and efficient. The lobby restaurant was more than acceptable with good staff. There was no sign of any senior management which was very evident as although staff were good willing they appeared to lack knowledge. Would have given this Hôtel 3 1/2 if we could~3~4~nan~nan~nan~4~nan\n",

Excellent service generally and a very pleasant atmosphere. there are various options for meals, drinks and snacks and we enjoyed the Speakers Bar for quiet drinks and food.

It is quite beautiful and a pleasure to stay in.  However no 5 stars from me. On Sunday night I tried to order room service. The number rang out, then I tried both the front desk and the operator.. both rang out.  I then tried using my mobile to call in from an external number .. it rang out also.  Eventually the concierge answered the phone and took my order. I was told that phones just keep ringing until someone picks up and that they were busy Quite unacceptable for any hotel let alone one that charges premium charges.  The breakfast offering is superior but seriously $39 for breakfast is excessive.  This hotel is a premium destination but over reaches with its pricing~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",

      "review_473712246~I took our children on a road trip from a Melbourne to Canberra to show them some of the sights. The Hyatt is in a lovely location, is a beautiful historic building with great access to many sights. Concierge were very helpful however my checkin was a bit sloppy and they failed to tell me anything about my Club inclusions (Ambassadors Lounge). The staff in the lounge were fantastic and went out of their way to provide my daughter with tasty gluten free options. We had dinner in the restaurant on night which was also lovely (I had the barramundi which was fantastic). The other night we tried to order room service but no one would answer my calls so I ended up going to the Lounge so staff there could order for me. There was a VIP staying in the hotel which was obviously the focus of the hotel staff. Our room was very close to this VIP and the rooms surrounding us were taken up by his staff so we did have some uncomfortable yet funny moments when I (45 year old woman) and my two children (5 and 9) were stopped by burly security guards as we walked to our rooms and asked where we were going. Thankfully the 'visiting' security guys got to know us and were very pleasant (not so the 'local' security guys). Perhaps informing us of this situation upon arrival would have been suitable. Kids thought it was all very exciting though..~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan~nan\n",
      "review_473283483~We stayed at the Hyatt a few of months ago and I have been waiting to do this review in the hope...a vain hope as it turns out...that I would have received an answer to my Registered letter that I sent about a major problem we had at the hotel. It is inconceivable to have not had the courtesy of a reply, or even an acknowledgment of receipt of a letter, from a supposed 5 star hotel. The issue was major and I fully detailed it in my letter, but feel it is not the proper avenue to discuss it online.  As two seniors, we seemed to become invisible to staff when we wished for any service...staff appeared to be far more interested in using their computers than looking up and asking if we needed help. One incidence was when we went for a meal at The Promenade...we were eventually noticed, the restaurant was NOT busy, and were seated at a table, with the question \"did we want a buffet or an a la carte meal\"...we asked for a moment to decide and were given a menu and then left alone and the person did not return. We decided the buffet must be the obvious choice, which was a mistake...the food was of a very poor standard that night and an ordinary bottle of water cost $10. At $75 a head, we expected coffee to be included, but no, that was extra.  We had one staff member over the 3 days we were staying actually ask us how we were enjoying our stay...otherwise no one even bothered. There were two other senior guests with us and they found their \"treatment\" to be exactly the same. I guess we don't fit in with the business/conference clientele. We were so disappointed in our treatment I preferred to forfeit an ALREADY PAID for 2 night stay to celebrate a 48th wedding anniversary, than ever return to the Hyatt. We have traveled quite extensively and have never had something like this occur before...it is sad this should happen in our own \"backyard\".~1~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan\n",

      "review_476317980~We stayed in one of the \"high rise two bed two ensuite\" apartments. All I can say is \"wow\". Amazing apartment. Huge with great living areas, full kitchen and massive balcony. The staff have all without question been polite to the extreme. Very helpful and did I mention polite.  They had the 50% off breakfast buffet deal on. Good value for breakfast at $15/$8 (12 & under). But at $30 would be too expensive. Good buffet but no freshly cooked omlets etc. Parking spaces are a decent size for \"normal\" sized cars. None of the issues we had at the Novotel last year trying to fit the family car into a tiny spot.  Pool looks nice but not heated so after a *very* quick dip the kids abandoned that idea. Would love it if they had an outdoor spa for winter (hint hint) Happy hour(s) at the bar is really nice. Reasonable price on the drinks ($5) with complimentary hot chips.  Will definitely look at staying here again. My most enjoyable trip to Canberra yet.~nan~nan~5~5~nan~5~nan\n",
      "review_476279119~Recently stayed here as a family (2 adults, 2 children) for a week. Had a great apartment on the seventh floor with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Staff were very pleasant and fixed a blown light globe in one of the bedrooms very promptly. The room was serviced each day and we were very happy with the level of cleanliness. Parking was included and there was ample parking spread across three levels underneath the building. The free wifi was great but was occasionally a little slow. The Canberra centre and many other shops/restaurants were only a short walk away which made the location ideal as we didn't have to worry about city parking. The food served in the restaurant was high quality and we enjoyed the selection of options at the buffet breakfast. Our apartment had everything we needed for a week long stay with two young children so we would be more than happy to stay here again next time we are visiting Canberra.~5~nan~5~nan~nan~5~nan\n",

The beds were clean and comfortable, and there was loads of space to move around, The location is just a block or so from all the main CBD shops, and there's underground parking below the building. The staff were wonderful - friendly, and competent, and always able to help out. Can't recommend this place highly enough. Thank you for a great stay!~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan\n"

There was also a dining area adjacent to the kitchen and the lounge which looked on to the balcony. The lounge was comfortable.  The balcony was quite long and had a full size table and chairs.

Overall presentation of apartment and building was really good, rooms were cleaned and furniture was comfortable and modern. A nice touch was the free WiFi and parking which is sometimes an extra charge. We noticed that breakfast was a buffet style and seems to be common in Canberra. The waitress who greeted us was so friendly and my son (10 month old) couldn't stop starring and smiling at her. The location to my surprise was walking distance to the main shopping district of Canberra including its dinning district.

They could do with an update with it's decor but what it really offers is great size apartments with everything needed, including washing machine/dryer. I was travelling solo for work but was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment, and all the rooms had heaps of space and a nice, bright outlook. There was a large flat screen tv in the living, and also the main bedroom. However, this one had problems with it's sound. My only contact with staff was with check-in and check-out so I can only say they were friendly and polite. I'm not sure I would return as I found the decor too simple and basic decor, and not crazy that soaps etc came as those refill bottles.

      "review_476247594~Great to land after a 4 hours flight and walk just 5' to reach the hotel. Unfortunately my positive spirit vanished as I approached the front desk. Personnel seems to be more concerned about their housekeeping business rather than take care of guests, once in the room I realised that the air conditioning did not work. In Canberra can be very cold during nights in April, and sneezing in your room waiting for someone that fix your aircon is not the best experience. I managed to sleep a bit and went to have my breakfast....the worst I have ever had in a Hotel. It is enough to say that even scrambled eggs were appalling! I am sorry to write negative comments but this is just a wake up call for the manager of the Hotel! Not mentioning the costs! It is not value for money; great to have a Hotel next to the airport but I stayed in much better hotels in Canberra! Please do something as I frequently need to stay in Canberra and love to walk in from terminal to bed!~1~nan~nan~2~nan~2~nan\n"

      "review_475959975~I don't understand the attraction of bathrooms within bedrooms. These bathrooms had sliding doors and both sides and a gap at the main wall. The main sliding door on our bathroom (where you enter) was sticky and hard to move and the other sliding door (behind the sink) wouldn't stay shut, I shoved a coathanger in the track to keep it shut. Why would anyone want to open up their bathroom into the bedroom anyway? The beds were very comfortable with nice pillows. For such a new hotel, the cleanliness of the bathrooms was surprisingly lacking. There was dust inside the cupboards. Blackout curtains with a gap at the top, so the room wasn't dark. And those funny metal barriers at the bottom of the full length windows, why? Pretty under enthusiastic receptionists. Overall not a great hotel, but could be. Proximity to the airport for an early morning flight and comfortable beds are it's saving grace. And I would recommend it for that. Wouldn't stay there otherwise.~nan~5~nan~3~nan~3~nan\n",

      "review_475752945~Overall this is a very high quality hotel conveniently located close to the airport. Modern and attractive decor in public areas and rooms. Comfortable beds and surprisingly quiet given proximity to airport. The coffee makers in the room are a nice touch, and particularly appreciated when you have an early morning start and don't have time to have a proper breakfast in the restaurant.~4~5~5~5~5~5~nan\n",
      "review_475626306~Ok rooms and food - the food side is important because as this hotel is isolated from town or other restaurants, you're mostly stuck with what they have. Particularly business travelers working near or east of the airport as companies often like to use Vibe now as it saves on taxis etc. Rooms - very good. I'd rate the property high if this was all that mattered. Modern, Funky. Comfortable. Couldn't find a fault. I'd prefer a bath in the bathroom but otherwise, very good. I'd definitely stay there again, so long as I could eat somewhere else. Food - Whether it be the in-room dining or the restaurant, this is where this place really lets itself down. Particularly for vegetarians and vegans - though from a health/nutrition perspective I don't think the menu is good enough for anyone who has to stay there for a few nights. Ok - more detail for the veggos - I thought it stopped being acceptable to only offer salad as an option back in the 1990s.... but you won't find anything other than a haloumi salad on the in-room dining menu that is acceptable. When I called to see what else they could do they were polite and offered me the entire restaurant menu, which wasn't much better. Pasta with napoli sauce for over $20? I thought THAT stopped being a reasonable thing to offer vegetarians back in the early 2000s! There was another option - a pasta that was super-creamy and also had macadamia nuts.... yep, great for anyone who cares about their health. I've ordered salad there too and it was very oily, so even if you are willing to eat a pile of greens only for dinner then it's still not great. A message to Vibe: Guests at your hotel are isolated so for goodness sake please try to cater better to people with special needs. Your veggo options are either outdated or unhealthy. This is 2017 - thank goodness my work is keen on diversity and inclusion and will likely let me stay elsewhere so I can have proper food options rather than be stuck with inadequate choices at Vibe.~3~nan~nan~nan~5~2~nan\n",

      "review_475434074~Just spent two nights here. Booked it as we had a 6 am flight to return flight to Adelaide. On our arrival in Canberra we walked straight out the terminal doors, along the footpath and into the hotel, all in a matter of minutes. Check in was perfect, smooth, fast and welcoming. The room was great. Reasonable size, spotless and very comfortable. Plenty of large windows giving an open modern feel. The room had everything we needed; however bath robes would have been a nice extra touch. Bed was very comfortable, aircon worked perfectly and in all a great room. Breakfast was fine, lots of the usual breakfast items. Second morning, due to early departure they provided small breakfast boxes, very handy.

      "review_475374129~For what is otherwise an good hotel and i was very disappointed when I ordered room service - a fish and salad dish for $31.00. I was informed I needed to pay and extra $9 if wanted chips! This is pretentious and 'gouging'. The food was very very ordinary and the portion very small. To have got a 'normal' plate of food i.e. with few chips! - it would have cost $44.00. (with $4 delivery fee). Ridiculous.  What really upset me was the response to my complaint. I tried to negotiate a compromise with kitchen and then complained to front desk next day . All I got was an uninterested 'I will pass on your feedback'. It wasn't feedback it was a complaint that needed resolving. Nobody took responsibility for resolving the issue. Lack of professional customer service response. The room was new and clean but small and very stuffy and wifi did not work. No fresh air. Good bathroom. Foyer has good atmosphere.  My advice - if you stay here go and eat somewhere else !~nan~4~nan~3~nan~2~nan\n",

      "review_474827684~Lived every minute of it. We ate every meal of our 3 night stay at the visually stunning hotel lobby restaurant/bar. I was there with my wife and another couple for the Canberra running festival and they did their best to accommodate us early starters with breakfast packs as we left too early for the normal breakfast.  The staff are all very friendly and approachable and made the stay even better. Look out for NOJ aka Jonathon who practically lives at the hotel as he managed to serve us for all our meals and drinks. Good amount of in room entertainment. I watched 4 movies in a row when chilling out after a half marathon. Rooms were nice and quiet despite being next to the airport. There was the occasional rumble of a jet engine but never woke us up.

The location was perfect, the staff awesome and the valet brought our car up whenever we needed quickly, so quickly we didn't get a chance to sit in the comfy lobby flicking through the library. The room was just stunning! And the cocktails a joy. Plenty of places to eat just a short walk away if Monster Kitchen is not your thing (or you have a fussy 7 year old with you). And you can take an awesome walk along the lake if you like or grab a bike. It is just brilliant.~5~5~5~5~5~5~nan\n",
      "review_476713291~These apartments are pretty cool and located in New Acton, so plenty to do within the immediate area. I love the whole environmental concept with use of natural air flow instead of air con. The only issue is that the apartments back onto Parkes Way which means leaving the door open is very noisy all night, not a problem if you're not staying in summer. Other than that, the apartments have everything possibly needed with retro style furniture and great design. Hotel Hotel is great for a drink or two and other places are walkable if you want to go out. Great staff and service. Would definitely come back.~4~nan~nan~nan~5~5~nan\n",
      "review_476653558~Located in the hip and trendy NewActon precinct, Hotel Hotel shares its address with the striking Nishi building housing apartments and commercial spaces. The first thing that grabs your attention as you enter the building has to be the awe-inspiring, instagram-famous, timber plank staircase. Designed by March Studio, thousands of pieces of recycled wood (2,250 to be exact) embrace the lobby, decorating the walls and ceilings in irregular patterns and it is surprisingly mesmerising to look at. Hotel reception is located upstairs next to the hotel’s restaurant, Monster Kitchen & Bar. We arrived early and left our luggage with the hotel before headed over to A.Baker for a light lunch. The hotel has four different types of rooms, Cosy, Original, Creative and Meandering. The Meandering Room that we stayed at is the largest of the lot, albeit slightly oddly shaped (as the name appropriately suggests). Taking inspiration from the iconic Australian shack, the design of the room isn’t your typical hotel room, think exposed concrete, wood and faux fur. Artificial lights flood the room as the only window in the room provides a view to the internal rainforest courtyard. If you prefer bright, airy hotel rooms, the Meandering Room perhaps isn’t your cup of tea. The most impressive part of the room, in my opinion, is the incredibly sleek, spacious bathroom, with his & hers vanity and double rain showers. Full sized Aesop products are provided for you to slather your body with rich, creamy moisturiser filled with invigorating scents of orange and lemon rind. Taking a relaxing bubble bath in the enormous polished concrete tub might just be the best thing you can do for your body and soul after a long day exploring the city.  In addition to several food and drink outlets (including Max Brenner for some seriously good chocolate treats), a Palace cinema, and a hairdresser, the hotel has a ‘library’ next to the reception and there are plenty of quaint and cosy nooks for guests to sit back and unwind. If you are feeling active, you can get on one of the hotel’s bicycles and easily explore the surrounding area.  Hotel Hotel insists that it’s a place for people people, and I couldn’t agree more.~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan\n",
      "review_476340037~I stayed with my partner in one of the apartments - I had been keen to stay here since visiting the hotel a few years back, and it didn't disappoint. From the moment I made the booking over the phone, the staff was always professional, friendly and attentive. This goes for all the staff, including in the bar and restaurant. We chose the apartment because we wanted something a little larger, and the room was larger than expected. It was well appointed - from ground coffee in the kitchen to designer appliances and kitchenware, to the Aesop products in the bathroom - it was a perfect balance of minimalism and comfort and a breath of fresh air compared to the sterile chain hotels in that price range. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The views over the lake were nice, we stayed on the 7th floor, and the location in the city was perfect. The iPad in the room was a nice touch, and the internet was excellent. The food in the restaurant - probably some of the best in Canberra!  Had an absolutely amazing stay and I can't thank the staff enough.~nan~nan~nan~5~5~5~nan\n",

Staff are very helpful, you can ask anything and if they don't know the answer, they will find it out for you. It has a gym, and yoga classes. You can hire a bike and cycle around Lake Burley Griffin which is right next door.. There are many Canberra attractions within walking distance. There are four levels of room, and one to three bedroom apartments. Lots of fluffy towels and Aesop soaps, shampoos and conditioners. Good Wifi is free.

Underlit hallways, rooms without a decent chair, table or desk. A scruffy footstool and a recycled cafe table instead. It gets better, air conditioning failed... as did the minibar. Had a puffy milk container which we avoided. Had to open the window onto a motorway to cool down. As the hotel was fully booked we could not be moved. However the night housekeeping staff was very apologetic and courteous and brought in a Dyson fan. I could have bought the Dyson with the savings if we had checked at a place that was less overpriced and pretentious. Miles away from any amenities. Parking charged every time you left. The concept of multi entry rate has evaded this hotel.  We would have moved if we could. In fact checked out a night early. Frankly want our money back.

The rooms are small but nice and linen is A+ class. Everything is actually. Even the toiletries are Aēsop branded.

Tried to change but no rooms available. So have it a go. The Good - staff were fantastic. Room on the 9th floor was small but clean and well presented. Walking distance to museums and some great eating places. The not to great - no air con, which to be fair is advertised on their site but I never after all these years thought to check as it is just expected. Cross ventilation means opening the balcony door however the traffic noise is just too load and continuous to leave it open. One chair on the balcony, 2 people...hmmm. Breakfast was ok.

      "review_467075911~Lots of mixed reviews about Hotel Hotel, either you are going to love it for its fresh approach to the hotel experience or you are going to hate it because it challenges the traditional view of what a hotel should do. Personally, for us, we found that a fresh approach keeps things interesting. Centrally located, free bikes to ride around the lake. A Cinema downstairs. Great and exciting food menu. The curry egg sandwich was a stand out from the bar snack menu. My only advice, their approach to apartments means they don't come with air conditioning. We moved from an apartment to a hotel room because of this. Otherwise, this challenges the senses and make for a refreshing stay in groovy area of Canberra.~nan~5~nan~nan~5~4~nan\n",

      "review_464609375~Well, I'm in my seventh month of living in hotels, and this is my least favorite place so far. The hotel touts itself as an artistic endeavor and aesthetics definitely triumphs over comfort here. I don't love the visual style of our apartment, but it's the fact that all of the furniture is so awkward and unusable that makes it a fail in my book. The chairs in both the dining room and living room are strangely shaped and impossible to sit in (no couch) so we stay to the bedroom. We would have been better off just getting a room at a normal hotel where there is traditional hospitality. This place provides no service at all. Our oven was broken the first day and they sent someone out to fix it three days later. We're here for two weeks and will get no service on the room. We're expected to take out our own trash, with no bags provided and no instruction on where to take it. The few things provided (body wash in the shower, salt and pepper) were all down to the bottom dredges and are empty now.) When we asked the front desk if we could have them replaced, they claimed that was our responsibility as well. Yeah, I'll get right on filling up your salt shaker. Staying here is like staying in a museum where they expect you to be grateful to be allowed entry, but for an enormous entry fee per night. Give it a pass and stay literally anywhere else for better service.  *On a bright note, the breakfast was divine and the staff in the dining room was actually friendly and made you feel welcome.~1~nan~nan~2~nan~1~nan\n"

      "review_474882405~Stayed 1 night in April with breakfast included, however, when checkout I was asked to pay 10 dollars for my breakfast because I ate their hot foods, eg egg, bacon, sausage and hatch brown. After protest, the manager agreed to waive the charge. Don't assume breakfast included you can eat all the foods on the table in this hotel.

      "review_474878982~We stayed 4 nights here as part of our road trip to Canberra for the Versailles exhibition at the NGA. We requested a quiet room away from traffic noise but were initially given one overlooking the main divided road. This was changed (at our request) and we ended up with a quiet room but it overlooked the car park. Fortunately, there is so much to see and do in Canberra that our outlook didn't really matter. It's classified as 4+ star but its probably more accurately described as a 3+ star (although NSW ratings may differ from Victoria's) - it's more like a good business hotel. A substantial continental breakfast is included in the overnight tariff (fresh fruit, yoghurt, canned fruit, a good range of juices and a variety of breads and toppings, tea and coffee), although we were surprised to see very bruised and darkened pineapple pieces every morning. Having the fan in the bathroom connected to the light was annoying (and uncomfortably cold). A limited Foxtel service is available to all rooms. Beds were comfortable and the room was well-darkened. Some staff (although not all) at reception were not overly friendly - getting a smile and a greeting from some was not an easy task. Location was good for what we wanted to see and do - a short drive to Manuka shops and not far from the Lake, galleries, library, Old Parliament House etc. Our restaurant meal at the hotel was disappointing - the service was very slow (considering the number of people dining) and serving sizes were quite small, considering the cost.~3~nan~4~nan~nan~3~nan\n",

      "review_473500492~We stayed here for two days while on business nearby. All the staff we dealt with here were friendly and efficient. The room was quite spacious and light; and the bed and pillows very comfortable. The bathroom is on the small side but workable for a short stay. Our room rate included a continental breakfast - a reasonable selection of cereals, breads, fruit etc and the usual pretty dire coffee! Happy hour was good - the bar area is small but you can sit outside as well, and it has a pretty wide range of beers, wines and spirits, and fast bar staff! We also had dinner here. The dining area is really quite motel-y and although the food and service were fine, I think it's a little over-priced, given the huge range of restaurants in nearby Manuka and Kingston, most of which are better value and a lot more 'atmospheric'. Parking is easy and free (and you WILL need a car here), and there is quite a pleasant outdoor area round the pool. Free WiFi was reasonably fast. Just one thing - the sheer curtains need replacing, torn in several places and a bit grubby.~nan~3~4~nan~nan~5~nan\n",

The negatives were some mould in the shower cubical and the slowness of the restraurant for breakfast.  The location of the hotel is quiet and easy to access. It is about a 5 minute drive from Kingston and Manuka where there are many restrauants for dinner, cinemas, Manuka Oval etc. It is also an easy 10 minutes back to the Civic Centre area as well.

Overall a bargain find and we'll be back!~nan~5~nan~nan~4~5~nan\n",
      "review_467510622~This is a nice, well appointed, very comfortable motel in a slightly inconvenient part of southern Canberra. If you have a car, it's within 10 minutes of Manuka and Kingston, so inconvenience is minimal. The rooms are excellent. Beds are comfortable and, even though I had a room facing the main road, rooms are quiet. There's a nice bar and restaurant (although the latter is pricey for what you get), a lovely sheltered pool area and a small gym. The pool and gym are free. The only slight negative with the rooms is that the bathrooms (well, the one I had) are little tight on space. However, as is the norm in Australia, there were nice soaps, shampoos and hair conditioners provided free of charge. There were also tea and coffee making facilities, also free, and fresh milk (real, not UT) provided at reception with no cost. The motel advertises a business centre. That's a stretch! There is a PC and printer near the bar and usage is free. I needed to print some documents from the 'Net and everything worked well and quickly. There was no extra charge.  The MAJOR negative for me was that the motel advertises that it has free cable TV. It does, but channels are limited. As a rabid football fan, I was looking forward to watching an Asian Champions League match. The pay TV channels are limited and the channel showing this match was not one that was provided. I was faced with watching badminton(???) instead. Not happy Jan!! So, I woke up early next morning to also watch a European Champions League Match, which I knew was on free to air TV, but found that there was no reception for any SBS channel in the hotel.  So if you are a real football fan. forget this place. The TV coverage is pathetic.  The menu at the motel's restaurant is reasonably broad, mains are large and the quality was good. Prices are on the high side however. I compared the motel's breakfast prices to what I actually paid in an up market cafe in up-market Kingston the next morning, and found the motel was over 50% more expensive for the same dish. (Because I only tried one, I cannot comment on comparative quality, but breakfast in Kingston was excellent.) So on balance, a very comfortable bedroom and shower, but not much else. Staff were nice and efficient, but much of the advertising about their 'extras' needs to be treated with a large pillar of salt. (Think Lot's wife!!). If you can get a cheap deal, this place is probably an OK place to stay. If you pay their published rates, it's not worth it.~nan~nan~nan~3~4~4~nan\n",

Major attractions - Old and New Parliament Houses, National Gallery, Lake Burley Griffin foreshore walks - are all within walking distance. The hotel is situated in a leafy and quiet part of Canberra. The only downside is parking, which is $15 a day and seems to be limited.~nan~5~nan~5~nan~5~nan\n",

Close to the War Memorial, the Royal Australian Mint and the National Gallery.

      "review_476776141~We stayed overnight in a Historic Room over the Easter long weekend. Check in was a little delayed due to only one staff member working at the time. The room was really lovely with an absolutely brilliant shower. The hotel grounds are historic and beautiful with a rose garden at the entrance and gorgeous sunlit courtyard garden outside the restaurant. Parking was easy due to the long weekend, however it would be frustrating during the week with a $15 surcharge. The free WiFI worked well which was a blessing. We ordered room service and the food was okay but not great which was a little disappointing. Overall we enjoyed our stay and the property is beautiful.

      "review_476693868~We had a wonderful easy access room on a corner with nice views out the upper levels of the wooden slats on the windows. The shower was a terrific walk in one and the bed was very comfortable with a warm light doona. The coffee machine in the room was good which was a saviour when the coffee at breakfast on the terrace and dining room )either the extra paid for Espresso or in the standing pot) was terrible. It seems like they need different, fresher coffee beans and/or a review of the expresso machine.  The staff were fabulous especially Stephanie who was so very helpful and just lovely to deal with. All staff were friendly and efficient. A lovely touch at Easter was to find 3 chocolate bunnies outside the door on Easter Sunday morning. There was also a special complimentary thank you for 4 night booking on one day with the most delicious selection of 4 chocolates left for us.  The whole hotel was accessible with ramp access at the front and off the breakfast terrace area to the outside lounges under umbrellas. The only problem was that there was no ramp from the ramp to the footpath and I had to go on the road to get to the street footpaths. This may be a small thing to change in the future for a perfect access score. Breakfast was disappointing for our group because there was not enough choices of healthy options and coffee was terrible. The serving run was also difficult when it became busy and could've been better laid out. Suggest add natural muesli or rolled oats, no or low fat natural yoghurt and a more obvious sign for freshly cooked poached or boiled eggs (only discovered on the last day) and better quality bread for toast.  The hotel really was very good and in a great location, easy walking it scootering distance to the National Galleries,Parliament House (700 meters), National Library and Lake Burley Griffin).

      "review_476634188~We booked via Hotel's website and it was hard to get enough information about the rooms. But the biggest disappointment was on the day of arrival. It appeared that the system has assigned us a standard Heritage room instead of Heritage Family room that I booked. The receptionist gave us the key and didn't even raise a question despite he obviously knew that the rate I paid was for Heritage Family. Only when I returned with a lot of confusion he confirmed that there was a mistake and then offered a refund.   Of course, there were no large rooms available so we had to stay in standard room for two nights. As an excuse, the receptionist offered us an upgrade to Executive Suite for one night free of charge. That was nice, but the impression was spoiled anyways. I'm sorry, but I couldn't see 4 stars in that hotel. The service, facilities, rooms were only at essential level. As I said, we've been accomodated at the standard heritage room. It apperead that the room was designed for the disabled people. The bathroom was with rails and shower seating and with very minimum convenience. There was even no shelf next to the sink so we had to store our toiletries on the opposite shelf above the toilet. There were no bath robes provided - this is NOT a sign of 4 star hotel. The room and furtniture were relatively clean, but can't say anything more. Doonas were awful!! They are probably 10 years old, covered with pills and weary. Mini bar prices are rip-off. I know the drill, but $8 for peroni is over too much. After we've been moved to Executive Suite thing got nicer, but still suffer the same problems. Old and weary doonas and furniture, horrible roll-over (sofa), no bath robes and somehow no shower caps provided. Overall, rooms looked tired, boring and minimalistic. Same framed prints on the walls. General hotel impression was spoiled by the disgusting smell of old (especially in the lobby and corridors). I know the building is old (and that's a plus), but there are so many ways to fight the smell now. Hotel management simply doesn't care. On the positive side, I really liked the fireplace zone in the lobby. Nice place for an evening drink with a book. Inner courtyard could have more attention. Bar staff didn't care when I was there not even offering to turn on a heater.  Finally, finding a parking spot was a torture.  As a conclusion, I could say that this hotel is very average, but in quite good location.~2~4~3~2~3~2~nan\n",

We had breakfast the first morning, I would not recommend the hot breakfast or full breakfast, not enough on offer, all of it was quite cold, you can have eggs to order, we had poached, and they were really cold and inedible, so that was a waste at $28 each. We also had high tea , very disappointing, the sandwich s were made an cut and left unwrapped, therefore dry, minimal topping, the cup cakes were from breakfast, so reused, the scones were dry, assume the days before, and I think store bought, the hot cross buns were the same, inedible, we had champers with it but after 10mins had to ask can we get tea ! On a better note as far as food goes, we had dinner at the restaurant and it was really lovely, bit pricey but was worth it Great location to visit the attractions of Canberra and just a $15 - $20 dollar cab ride to the city centre, casino etc~nan~4~nan~nan~5~4~nan\n"

A steak ($42) and 2 sides ($9 each!!) is not what I would by any stretch of the imagination call a 'decent' price. The breakfast buffet was quite average but I have been told that the coffee is great (I myself, don't drink coffee). You have to ask about the free WiFi at check-in as they don't volunteer this information during the check-in process.

The cleanliness of the room was a little disappointing with cobwebs on the windows, dust on the desk, radio/clock and lamp and mold present in the bathroom.

Bed comfortable (though pillows a little too soft) and bathroom VERY nice with one of the best showers that I've had in a hotel. The dinner menu, while a little pricey, was very much worth it with excellent meals enjoyed by all in our group that dined there. Breakfast was ok, but well overpriced for whats on offer in my view. Absolutely suited a business stay, not sure how i'd feel travelling there with the family.~nan~nan~nan~4~5~4~nan\n",
